## Question

For a 68-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and morbid obesity (BMI 40) who is taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, glipizide 10 mg one tablet daily, lisinopril 40 mg PO daily, metformin 1000 mg PO twice daily, and Ozempic 1 mg weekly, and who was on Lipitor 20 mg for hyperlipidemia but it was causing cramps, with cholesterol 176, HDL 43, LDL 103, and triglycerides 157 — what alternative medication can be used that will not cause cramps?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what alternative medication can be used that will not cause cramps for a 68-year-old who developed statin-associated muscle symptoms on atorvastatin 20 mg, including the recommended alternative medication and a stepwise strategy to reach LDL-C targets safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming SAMS and clarifying baseline ASCVD risk and LDL-C goals. Then, I should review evidence-based strategies for statin intolerance, including statin rechallenge and altered dosing. Next, I will evaluate non-statin options with efficacy and outcomes data. After that, I need to tailor a tiered plan that balances efficacy, tolerability, comorbidities, and cost. Finally, I will set a monitoring protocol and safety checks to ensure adherence and minimize adverse effects [^115bngEc] [^115TKVoR].

> Let me first confirm the core problem and risk profile. The patient reports muscle cramps consistent with statin-associated muscle symptoms, which observational data suggest occur in 7–29% of users and are a leading cause of nonadherence, though true statin causality varies and often requires dechallenge–rechallenge to verify temporality and specificity [^115bngEc] [^117G7e77]. Given age 68 with diabetes, hypertension, and morbid obesity, I should treat him as high ASCVD risk and target at least a 50% LDL-C reduction or an absolute LDL-C below 70 mg/dL; with an LDL-C of 103 mg/dL, he likely needs approximately a 30–50% reduction to reach goal, depending on the final agreed target and risk enhancers [^115TKVoR] [^115WPayZ].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline lipid profile and therapeutic gap to guide the intensity needed. Total cholesterol 176 mg/dL, LDL-C 103 mg/dL, HDL-C 43 mg/dL, triglycerides 157 mg/dL suggest mixed, but the triglycerides are only borderline high, so the immediate priority remains LDL-C lowering to at least below 70 mg/dL if feasible, with secondary attention to triglycerides via lifestyle and glycemic control rather than fibrate initiation at this time [^116KRVDw] [^115TKVoR]. I should confirm there are no secondary causes of myalgias such as hypothyroidism or drug–drug interactions before labeling this as definite SAMS, as per consensus guidance on structured work-up and re-challenge strategy [^117G7e77] [^111Rja8b].

> Next, I should review evidence-based approaches to SAMS before abandoning statins outright. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most patients can tolerate some statin exposure with adjustments, and guidelines favor a maximally tolerated statin dose first, using alternate-day or low-dose approaches, and combining with non-statin therapy as needed for goal attainment [^111Rja8b] [^115TKVoR] [^116zMyVJ]. I should confirm prior symptom onset and resolution with dechallenge and consider reintroducing a different statin with lower myopathy propensity or a different dosing schedule, as suggested by consensus statements [^117G7e77] [^111Rja8b].

> I will now examine alternative statin strategies if partial tolerance is possible. Fluvastatin XL 80 mg has been tolerated by approximately 97% of previously statin-intolerant patients with about a 33% LDL-C reduction, likely helped by its CYP2C9 metabolism and lower interaction profile; low-dose or intermittent rosuvastatin can achieve roughly 30–35% LDL-C reduction with about 70% tolerance in small series, and its long half-life suits non-daily dosing; pitavastatin may also be considered but data are more limited here [^116R3God] [^111Rja8b]. Let me double-check potency expectations across statins to calibrate goals; rosuvastatin at standard daily doses is among the most potent agents, which supports even intermittent low-dose use when intolerance is present [^113Y9hcm].

> If statins remain unacceptable, I need to prioritize non-statin options with solid efficacy and safety. Ezetimibe 10 mg daily consistently lowers LDL-C by about 19% and is generally well tolerated, making it the first-line non-statin for statin-intolerant patients; guidelines endorse RCT-proven non-statin therapy in those with persistent SAMS despite rechallenge, and ezetimibe meets that standard [^112vz2JC] [^115TKVoR] [^116zMyVJ]. But wait, I initially thought ezetimibe carries no muscle risk at all; let me correct myself — while ezetimibe monotherapy is usually well tolerated, myopathy and even rhabdomyolysis have been reported, particularly in combination with statins, so I should still monitor symptoms and liver enzymes if clinically indicated [^111yEyfy].

> I should also consider bempedoic acid in true statin intolerance. Bempedoic acid 180 mg daily lowers LDL-C and hsCRP in statin-intolerant populations and is activated in the liver but not in skeletal muscle, which theoretically reduces myalgia risk; however, initial pivotal data were 24 weeks and outcomes data were pending at the time of those reports, so I need to discuss the evolving evidence base and patient preferences when positioning it after ezetimibe or as an adjunct [^111i19Vu] [^1132wKbc]. I need to ensure the patient understands the pros and cons versus injectables and cost considerations before deciding on sequencing [^1132wKbc].

> I should confirm where PCSK9 inhibitors fit for this patient. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies can reduce LDL-C by roughly 50–60% and are not associated with muscle toxicity, but access and cost are barriers, and 2024 AHA/ASA primary prevention guidance states insufficient evidence for using alirocumab or evolocumab solely to prevent a first stroke in patients without established cardiovascular disease, so for primary prevention high-risk patients who are statin-intolerant, I should usually reserve PCSK9 inhibitors for failure of oral options to reach LDL goals, factoring payer criteria [^112Wg2FL] [^115EMi9w]. Let me reconsider: if this patient had established ASCVD, I would escalate sooner, but in primary prevention diabetes without ASCVD, a stepwise oral-first approach remains reasonable [^115TKVoR].

> Bile acid sequestrants are another oral option I need to weigh. Colesevelam can lower LDL-C about 15–25% and may modestly improve glycemia in type 2 diabetes, but GI side effects, pill burden, and drug-binding issues often limit adherence; the combination of a bile acid sequestrant with ezetimibe can yield about a 30–35% LDL-C reduction and may be considered if statins are not tolerated or not desired [^111mbp1D]. I should double-check triglycerides because sequestrants may raise triglycerides and are less attractive if fasting triglycerides trend upward, which I would monitor over time here given a baseline of 157 mg/dL [^111mbp1D].

> I need to eliminate suboptimal or non-recommended options. Niacin and routine addition of fenofibrate for cardiovascular risk reduction on background statin therapy are not recommended by contemporary guidelines, and gemfibrozil with any statin increases myopathy risk, so these should not be first-line for LDL lowering in this scenario; fibrates are typically reserved for severe hypertriglyceridemia or specific phenotypes rather than LDL-lowering in moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^114JiuSr] [^111mbp1D] [^113XDyYa]. Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interaction caveats as well, because if a statin is reintroduced, concomitant macrolides like clarithromycin markedly increase myopathy risk and should be avoided or prompt a switch to a non–CYP3A4 statin choice, which further supports fluvastatin or pravastatin in selected cases [^115kxvrr] [^114LtnNc].

> Now, let me formulate a tiered plan with a clear primary recommendation and built-in contingencies. Tier 1 is ezetimibe 10 mg orally once daily as the initial alternative, with a reasonable expectation of about a 19% LDL-C reduction; from 103 mg/dL, that projects to approximately 83 mg/dL, which still may not reach the < 70 mg/dL target, but represents a safe and practical first step in a statin-intolerant patient while we reassess tolerance and preferences in follow-up [^112vz2JC] [^115TKVoR]. I need to ensure the patient understands that we may need combination therapy to reach the goal and that we will monitor for rare hepatic or muscle adverse effects as clinically indicated, especially if a statin is later reintroduced [^111yEyfy].

> Tier 2, if LDL-C remains above target or if additional lowering is desired, is to add the lowest tolerated statin exposure using fluvastatin XL 80 mg daily or very low-dose, non-daily rosuvastatin, given their favorable tolerability in SAMS cohorts; I should re-emphasize the dechallenge–rechallenge principle, set clear symptom monitoring, and consider checking CK only if symptoms recur rather than routinely [^116R3God] [^111Rja8b] [^117G7e77]. Let me verify expectations: the combination of ezetimibe plus even low-intensity statin often achieves additive LDL-C lowering sufficient to reach < 70 mg/dL in high-risk patients, and I should titrate carefully based on tolerance and goals [^115TKVoR].

> Tier 3, when any statin exposure is not acceptable or tolerated, is to substitute or add bempedoic acid 180 mg daily to ezetimibe, explaining the muscle-sparing mechanism and the available efficacy and safety data, while acknowledging that initial trials were relatively short and that outcomes evidence was being generated in CLEAR Outcomes; shared decision-making about cost, pill burden, and expected incremental LDL reduction is essential here [^111i19Vu] [^1132wKbc]. I should confirm potential drug–drug interactions and baseline uric acid or gout history when considering bempedoic acid as part of routine safety review, even though this detail is not in the provided references [^1132wKbc].

> Tier 4, if maximal oral therapy fails to achieve LDL-C targets or if the patient's risk escalates, is to consider PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, recognizing the robust LDL-C reductions and lack of muscle toxicity but balancing against cost, access, and that primary prevention stroke data are insufficient per AHA/ASA 2024 guidance; in practice, this step often requires documentation of statin intolerance and prior ezetimibe use for payer approval [^112Wg2FL] [^115EMi9w]. Let me reconsider one caveat: in the presence of established ASCVD, PCSK9 inhibitors would rise earlier in the sequence based on outcomes data, but that is not the case described here [^115TKVoR].

> I will now integrate comorbidities and potential interactions into the plan. For diabetes and obesity, continuation of metformin, glipizide, and semaglutide is appropriate, and ezetimibe is metabolically neutral; colesevelam, if later considered, may modestly improve glycemia but at the expense of GI tolerability and pill burden, which could affect adherence in this patient with multiple medications [^111mbp1D]. I should confirm avoidance of interacting agents if a statin is reintroduced, including limiting grapefruit juice to below excessive amounts and avoiding clarithromycin or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that can increase statin exposure and myopathy risk, which is more pronounced in older adults [^112KYfmn] [^115kxvrr].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I will repeat a fasting lipid panel in 6–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to assess LDL-C response, reassess SAMS, and check ALT/AST if clinically indicated; CK should be measured if muscle symptoms recur, consistent with SAMS management principles and ezetimibe labeling when combined with statins [^114nQ5Aa] [^111yEyfy]. Ongoing follow-up every 3–6 months will focus on adherence, side effects, and progress toward LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, with annual reassessment of global cardiovascular risk and lifestyle measures per guideline-directed care [^115TKVoR].

> Final recommendation and rationale: I recommend initiating ezetimibe 10 mg orally once daily now, with a plan to recheck lipids in 6–12 weeks and then either add a very low-dose, non-daily rosuvastatin or switch to fluvastatin XL 80 mg if partial statin tolerance is acceptable, or advance to bempedoic acid if statins remain intolerable; PCSK9 inhibitors can be considered if oral therapy fails to achieve LDL targets after shared decision-making regarding injections and cost [^112vz2JC] [^116R3God] [^111i19Vu] [^112Wg2FL] [^115EMi9w]. This stepwise approach aligns with consensus recommendations to maximize tolerated statin exposure, leverage ezetimibe first-line in intolerance, and then sequence additional agents to achieve LDL-C goals safely while attending to SAMS verification, comorbidity considerations, and monitoring for rare adverse effects [^111Rja8b] [^117G7e77] [^115TKVoR].

---

In this high-risk, statin-intolerant patient, **ezetimibe 10 mg daily is the preferred next step** [^115TKVoR] because it lowers LDL by ~18–25% [^111yEyfy] with a very low risk of muscle symptoms [^112vz2JC]; if additional LDL lowering is needed, consider **bempedoic acid 180 mg daily** or a PCSK9 inhibitor, both with low muscle risk [^1132wKbc], with bempedoic acid providing an extra ~18% LDL reduction and good tolerability in statin-intolerant patients [^111i19Vu] and PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab or evolocumab) offering ~50–60% LDL reduction [^112Wg2FL] without muscle cramps but being injectable and more costly. Avoid fibrates and niacin due to limited LDL benefit and higher adverse effects [^114JiuSr], and use omega-3s only for triglycerides > 500 mg/dL [^116KRVDw].

## Alternative lipid-lowering medications

### Ezetimibe

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, lowering LDL by ~18–25% [^111yEyfy].

- **Efficacy**: Reduces LDL by ~18–25% and is effective in statin-intolerant patients [^112vz2JC].

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Very low risk; suitable for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms [^111mbp1D].

- **Clinical evidence**: IMPROVE-IT showed cardiovascular benefit when added to statins; effective as monotherapy in statin-intolerant patients.

---

### Bempedoic acid

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits ATP citrate lyase upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, lowering LDL by ~18% [^1132wKbc].

- **Efficacy**: Reduces LDL by ~18% and is effective in statin-intolerant patients [^111i19Vu].

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Low risk; well tolerated in statin-intolerant patients [^1132wKbc].

- **Clinical evidence**: CLEAR Serenity demonstrated significant LDL reduction and good tolerability in statin-intolerant patients [^111i19Vu].

---

### PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab)

- **Mechanism of action**: Monoclonal antibodies that increase LDL receptor recycling, lowering LDL by ~50–60%.

- **Efficacy**: Highly effective LDL reduction; suitable for high-risk patients [^112Wg2FL].

- **Muscle-related side effects**: Very low risk; suitable for statin-intolerant patients.

- **Clinical evidence**: FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES showed significant cardiovascular risk reduction.

---

### Fibrates (fenofibrate, gemfibrozil)

Fibrates activate PPAR-alpha and **primarily lower triglycerides**, with only modest effects on LDL [^114JiuSr]. Thus, they are used mainly for hypertriglyceridemia [^116KRVDw]. They carry a higher risk of muscle-related adverse effects, especially with statins, and are **not preferred for LDL lowering** in statin-intolerant patients [^114JiuSr] [^113XDyYa].

---

### Niacin

Niacin reduces hepatic VLDL synthesis, lowering LDL and triglycerides [^114JiuSr]. However, **LDL reduction is modest** and cardiovascular benefit is limited [^111mbp1D]. Adverse effects include flushing, hepatotoxicity, and insulin resistance; therefore, it is not preferred in statin-intolerant patients [^115gab1G].

---

### Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids reduce hepatic triglyceride synthesis with minimal effect on LDL [^114JiuSr]. They are **primarily used for hypertriglyceridemia** [^116KRVDw]. Muscle-related adverse effects are minimal, and these agents are generally well tolerated [^114JiuSr].

---

## Recommended alternative therapy for the patient

Given the patient's profile and statin-associated muscle cramps, a stepwise approach is recommended [^115TKVoR], beginning with **ezetimibe 10 mg daily as first-line** for its efficacy, safety, and low muscle risk [^111yEyfy]. If additional LDL lowering is needed, add bempedoic acid 180 mg daily, which also has low muscle risk [^111i19Vu] [^1132wKbc]. If LDL targets remain unmet or cardiovascular risk is very high, consider PCSK9 inhibitors; they are highly effective with low muscle risk.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor a **lipid panel** 4–12 weeks after therapy changes and then every 3–12 months [^114JiuSr]. Assess for recurrent muscle symptoms and reassess therapy if they recur [^111Rja8b]. Check liver enzymes periodically [^111yEyfy], especially when using ezetimibe or bempedoic acid [^111i19Vu].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Emphasize Mediterranean or DASH dietary patterns, target at least 5–10% weight loss, and encourage **at least 150 minutes per week** of moderate exercise [^114JiuSr] [^116KRVDw].

---

Ezetimibe is the **preferred alternative** for this patient due to its efficacy and low muscle risk; bempedoic acid or PCSK9 inhibitors can be added if needed [^111yEyfy].

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^112vz2JC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ezetimibe was studied in two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials involving 1719 patients with primary hyperlipidemia. Results showed that ezetimibe significantly lowered total cholesterol (-13%), LDL cholesterol (-19%), Apo B (-14%), and triglycerides (-8%), while increasing HDL cholesterol (+3%) compared to placebo. The reduction in LDL cholesterol was consistent across different ages, sexes, and baseline LDL cholesterol levels.

Simvastatin has been evaluated in two large, placebo-controlled clinical trials: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Trial (with 4,444 patients) and the Heart Protection Trial (with 20,536 patients). These trials assessed the effects of simvastatin in patients at high risk of coronary events due to existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke, or other cerebrovascular diseases. Simvastatin was shown to reduce the risk of total mortality by lowering coronary heart disease deaths, the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as the need for coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures.

No incremental benefit of combining ezetimibe and simvastatin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was found beyond that demonstrated for simvastatin alone.

- **Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) in pediatric patients**: The effects of ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin were compared to simvastatin monotherapy in a study involving males and females with HeFH. In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial followed by an open-label phase, 142 males and 106 postmenarchal females, aged 10 to 17 years old (mean age 14.2 years, 43% females, 82% White, 4% Asian, 2% Black or African American, 13% multiethnic), were evaluated.

### Zetia [^111yEyfy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Warnings and precautions are essential to consider when using Zetia, especially in combination with other treatments.

- **Risks associated with combination treatment with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies**: Refer to the prescribing information of these products for a description of their risks, including but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of Zetia. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of Zetia if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN persist. Zetia may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring**: In controlled clinical combination studies of Zetia initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 × ULN) in hepatic transaminases have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Skeletal muscle effects (e.g. myopathy and rhabdomyolysis)**: Most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue Zetia and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^111i19Vu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The CLEAR Serenity trial enrolled patients with either a primary or secondary indication for lipid-lowering therapy, which, if not for demonstrated intolerance, would typically include a statin. The high baseline mean LDL-C, frequent absence of any lipid-lowering therapy at baseline, and marked prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities reflect both the high cardiovascular risk of this population and the paucity of treatment options for these patients. The CLEAR Serenity study is also notable for the large proportion of women, a group often underrepresented in clinical trials of pharmaceutical agents for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The greater percentage of women versus men in the study may be related to the observed increased risk for statin intolerance among women. Overall, the enrollment criteria of the study allowed for assessing bempedoic acid in the diversity of patients and background therapies encountered in clinical practice.

The efficacy and safety data presented herein must be interpreted with an understanding of the study's limitations, such as its comparatively short duration of 24 weeks. The durability of effect and safety of extended bempedoic acid use is currently being evaluated in a long-term, open-label extension study, during which all patients will receive bempedoic acid for up to 78 weeks.

The results from the CLEAR Serenity study demonstrate that bempedoic acid significantly reduces LDL-C and hsCRP in patients with statin intolerance, regardless of baseline LDL-C or concomitant lipid-lowering therapy.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111Rja8b]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Therapy for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms includes the following considerations:

- **Statin-based therapies**: If symptoms or creatine kinase (CK) abnormalities resolve after discontinuation of the statin, treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin should be considered. If tolerated, doses can be up-titrated to achieve the LDL-C goal or as much LDL-C reduction that can be achieved with minimal muscle complaints. If these strategies are not tolerated, alternate day or twice-weekly dosing can be considered to achieve the LDL-C goal. Despite methodological limitations (small size, retrospective, open-label, or non-randomized design), studies have shown that either alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38% and, importantly, are tolerated by approximately 70% of previously intolerant patients. Generally, lower doses of a high-intensity statin with a long half-life, such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin, are more appropriate.

### Lipid-lowering agents in solid organ transplant recipients [^112Wg2FL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

The first-line lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) in post-transplant patients is statins. The evidence showed that statins improved survival rates, reduced the incidence of graft rejection, and decreased the risk of primary graft dysfunction. In heart transplant (HTx) recipients, statins reduced the risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and in kidney transplant (KTx) recipients, they lowered the risk of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA). In lung transplant (LTx) recipients, the use of statins may be associated with a decreased risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients may also be treated with ezetimibe. Limited data are available on the use of monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 (alirocumab, evolocumab), inclisiran, and lipoprotein apheresis. Adherence to statin treatment remains an obstacle in achieving LDL-C goals. In the general population, only 20% of statin users are still on the drug after one year. The main causes are statin-related adverse effects, mainly statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and the elevation of liver enzymes.

In SOT recipients, concern related to the adjustment of immunosuppressants (IS) to avoid acute graft rejection, common polypharmacy, and drug–drug interactions with IS medications further impact statin use. Therefore, combination therapy with statin and ezetimibe, as well as novel agents like PCSK9 modulators, can provide safe and efficient LDL-C reduction. Long-term administration of parenteral evolocumab, alirocumab, and inclisiran can safely reduce LDL-C by 49–59%. Moreover, these medications have no pharmacokinetic interferences with IS.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, specifically concerning lipid-lowering therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend not to add niacin, fenofibrate, or dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic coronary disease on statin therapy.

### Baseline characteristics of participants in STAREE: A randomized trial for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events and prolongation of disability-free survival in older people [^116jJFkZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with previously published work, we found that the oldest people in our trial were more likely to live alone, have a lower quality of life, and take more medications. Similarly, the well-described pattern for women to be more likely to have depression than men is reflected in the higher Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale scores of women and may potentially explain the greater medication use by women than men in our study.

This study has a number of strengths. STAREE will assess the effect of statin on disability-free survival as well as the first cardiovascular disease (CVD) event in a large, older population, which has an advantage over previous trials that tended to focus on CVD in isolation. The agent choice of atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg also has an advantage over older studies that have used less potent statins such as simvastatin and pravastatin. Atorvastatin 40 mg is comparable in expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering to that of the most recent trials, with an expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of 30–50%. This expected reduction avoids the greater risks of adverse events associated with higher doses of alternate agents such as simvastatin ≥ 80 mg. The regular collection of detailed data regarding cognition and other symptoms that have been associated with statin use enhances the study's robustness, though the causal link remains unclear.

### Rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin [^115dRJKJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

As 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') are being increasingly prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, this case report describes adverse effects of statin therapy, which can sometimes be fatal. It highlights the need for physicians to be aware of individual patient risk factors predisposing to statin-induced myopathy. It also emphasizes the necessity for further research into cholesterol-lowering drugs that do not have such side effects. When prescribing statins for patients, physicians must explain potential side effects following the initiation of therapy and with dose titrations.

### Statin-induced debilitating weakness and myopathy [^1164QtMa]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A large percentage of the US population is either receiving or should be considered for statin therapy. Whether through primary or secondary prevention for atherosclerotic disease, statins remain one of the mainstay options available to physicians. Myalgias are the most commonly reported side effects, though they are largely self-limited and subjective in nature. Here, we report a case of drug-related myonecrosis following long-term use of atorvastatin. Prompt recognition of the condition and initiation of treatment are paramount to control the disease's progression. While high-dose steroids are first line, quick escalation to methotrexate, IVIG, or rituximab should be considered in refractory cases. This decision is guided by monitoring of serum markers such as CK and transaminases. The goal is quick normalization of these enzymes, signaling cessation of underlying muscle necrosis. Patients may never regain full function, and treatment can last months to years.

### Nutraceuticals in the management of patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms, with a note on real-world experience [^1168EZwQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence for the role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although statin therapy remains the most frequently prescribed medication to reduce LDL-C and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, a considerable number of patients develop muscle-related side effects. This review summarizes recent literature supporting the role of nutraceuticals as LDL-C-lowering therapy in statin-intolerant patients, with evidence from our own clinical practices.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115ymTH5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Atorvastatin, a widely used statin, has demonstrated significant LDL-C lowering effects and a reduction in cardiovascular events across various risk populations. Consequently, combination therapies that integrate supplementary lipid-lowering agents, such as ezetimibe, are gaining interest. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, has shown promise in further reducing LDL-C levels when added to statin therapy. This provides a potential strategy for patients who do not reach their lipid targets with statin monotherapy.

These findings support the complementary mechanisms of action and the potential of combining atorvastatin and ezetimibe to achieve effective LDL-C lowering and improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Although guidelines recommend a moderate-intensity statin that can lower LDL-C levels by 30%–49% for effective primary prevention in patients at low to moderate cardiovascular risk, there are limited studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of low-intensity atorvastatin and ezetimibe combination therapy to moderate-intensity statin.

In the RACING trial, the combination of a moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe was non-inferior to high-intensity statin therapy on the risk of CVD in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether a low-intensity statin plus ezetimibe is an alternative to a moderate-intensity statin in the general population. Thus, in this study, we aimed to compare the lipid-lowering effect and safety of a combination therapy of atorvastatin and ezetimibe.

- **Possible side effects of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets**: Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets can cause serious side effects, including muscle pain, tenderness, and weakness, known as myopathy. Muscle problems, including muscle breakdown, can be serious and, rarely, lead to kidney damage and even death. The risk of experiencing muscle problems increases if you:

	- Experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially if accompanied by fever or unusual tiredness while taking amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets.
	- Have muscle issues that persist even after your healthcare provider advises you to stop taking the tablets. Further tests may be conducted to diagnose the cause.
	- Are taking certain other medications while on amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets.
	- Consume large amounts of grapefruit juice.
	- Are 65 years of age or older.
	- Have uncontrolled thyroid problems (hypothyroidism).
	- Suffer from kidney issues.
	- Are taking higher doses of the tablets.

- **Liver problems**: Conduct blood tests to check hepatic function before starting amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets and if symptoms of liver problems occur while taking the medication. Patients should contact their healthcare provider immediately if they experience any of the following symptoms of liver problems:

	- Feelings of tiredness or weakness.
	- Nausea or vomiting.
	- Loss of appetite.

### Intolerance to statins: Mechanisms and management [^116R3God]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Efforts should focus on maintaining high-risk patients on a statin-based regimen, given that statins are the only agents with substantial evidence for reducing clinical endpoints.

Switching statins may prove effective. In one small study, 43% of 37 patients who had experienced statin-associated myopathy tolerated other statins without symptoms. The PRIMO study suggests that using statins with a lower risk of myopathy, such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, could be beneficial; however, these might not be potent enough if a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol is needed. In one study, 80 mg of fluvastatin XL daily (in a slow-release preparation) was tolerated by 97% of patients with previous statin intolerance due to muscle-related symptoms, achieving an LDL cholesterol reduction of 32.8%.

Another approach, evaluated in several studies, involves the use of long-acting statins, mainly rosuvastatin, at low doses or reduced frequency (1–3 times a week). For instance, a retrospective analysis of 51 patients on a statin showed that alternate-day rosuvastatin at a mean dose of 5.6 mg was tolerated by 72.5% of patients, with an LDL cholesterol reduction of 34.5%.

### Contemporary national patterns of eligibility and use of novel lipid-lowering therapies in the United States [^115tCR39]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Defining eligibility for novel lipid-lowering therapies:

Using the aforementioned eligibility criteria, we simulated eligibility populations for PCSK9i and IPE using two approaches:

- **Existing lipid-lowering therapy**: We assumed it as the maximum tolerated before determining eligibility for novel therapies.

- **Maximal escalation of preexisting therapies**: We assessed eligibility after assuming initiation and maximal escalation of preexisting lipid-lowering therapies (i.e. statin and ezetimibe) and accounted for their predicted lipid-lowering effects. The distributions of lipid profile changes were extrapolated from previously published data. These assessments aimed to address the underuse of existing agents in many patients with indications for their use. The recommendation was that baseline lipid-lowering therapy should be maximized before the use of novel agents.

- **Modeling eligibility for PCSK9i**: We assumed a stepwise escalation of lipid-lowering therapy for those who were not already optimized on therapy, starting with the addition or escalation of statin therapy, then with the addition of ezetimibe. We accounted for the predicted LDL-C lowering effects.

- **Simulated eligibility for IPE**: We assumed maximal escalation of statin therapy and accounted for the predicted triglyceride-lowering and HDL-C increasing effects.

These simulations were based on previously published distributions of lipid changes with varying statin intensities and ezetimibe. We assumed full toleration of the maximum dose of each agent without adverse effects.

### Lypqozet [^112gu9Xa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Atorvastatin has been associated with rare cases of rhabdomyolysis, a condition that can lead to acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, similar to other drugs in this class. Patients with a history of renal impairment may have an increased risk for developing rhabdomyolysis and should therefore be monitored closely for any skeletal muscle effects.

Like other statins, atorvastatin can occasionally cause myopathy, a condition characterized by muscle aches or weakness accompanied by increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The use of higher doses of atorvastatin, especially when combined with drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors), increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

- **Identification and management**: Myopathy should be considered in any patient exhibiting diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or significantly elevated CPK levels. It is critical for patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever, or if the muscle symptoms persist after discontinuing ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets. If markedly elevated CPK levels occur or if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected, therapy with ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets should be discontinued.

The risk of developing myopathy during statin treatment is heightened when co-administered with certain medications, including cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, hepatitis C antiviral agents such as telaprevir, and combinations of elbasvir plus grazoprevir.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^117SQbsF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**:

- **Risk summary**: Discontinue atorvastatin when pregnancy is recognized, or consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. Atorvastatin decreases the synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, it may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Additionally, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients.

Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. However, published data from these studies with atorvastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered atorvastatin at doses that resulted in up to 30 and 20 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m²). In rats administered atorvastatin during gestation and lactation, decreased postnatal growth and development were noted.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of RCT-proven non-statin therapy. This is likely to provide net clinical benefit in patients at increased ASCVD risk who experience severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^117G7e77]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Lowering LDL-C with statin therapy reduces CVD risk by up to 40% in a wide range of patients. Given that the main reason for statin non-adherence or discontinuation relates to the onset of perceived side effects, the high prevalence of SAMS reported from observational studies is likely to adversely affect the CVD benefits of statins. Strategies to prevent the loss of effective statin therapy because of SAMS are still lacking. In the absence of a gold standard definition, this EAS Consensus Panel proposes to base the probability of SAMS being caused by statins on the nature of symptoms and their temporal relationship with statin initiation, statin discontinuation (or dechallenge), and repetitive re-challenge (Figure 2). Optimal therapy should combine a maximally tolerated or even non-daily statin dose, together with non-statin-based lipid-lowering therapies, to achieve LDL-C targets.

This Consensus Panel also highlights the need for further research into the pathophysiology of SAMS. Accumulating preclinical data show that statins decrease mitochondrial function and alter muscle protein degradation, providing a possible pathophysiological link between statins and muscle symptoms. Studies in the clinical setting are a priority to further understanding of these mechanisms and may offer therapeutic potential. In the absence of therapies to prevent these symptoms, this Consensus Panel recommends that the response of patients with SAMS to three or more statins should be considered for referral to specialized settings. By recognizing SAMS and establishing proper management protocols, the benefits of statin therapy in reducing CVD risk can be preserved.

### Antioxidant and antiplatelet effects of atorvastatin by Nox2 inhibition [^112dqNsw]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, it has become evident that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in the thrombotic process. Statins are lipid-lowering agents capable of reducing serum cholesterol levels and mitigating atherosclerotic complications and their clinical consequences. There is evidence that among statins, atorvastatin may exert antiplatelet effects by interfering with redox signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated that atorvastatin possesses antiplatelet activity via the inhibition of platelet formation of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS. This effect results in the down-regulation of isoprostanes, which are pro-aggregating molecules, and the up-regulation of nitric oxide, a platelet inhibitor. These changes occur immediately after atorvastatin administration and are independent of its lipid-lowering properties.

Experimental and clinical studies have documented that statins possess antithrombotic effects, which may account for the reduction of thrombotic-related vascular outcomes. This has been evidenced in various cardiovascular clinical settings such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), myocardial infarction (MI), and venous thrombosis. Future studies should be directed toward analyzing whether the antiplatelet effect of atorvastatin may occur preferentially at high dosages. Interestingly, the antiplatelet effects of statins could be beneficial in clinical settings where the efficacy of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs is still uncertain.

### Efficacy of atorvastatin on renal function in patients with contrast-induced nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention [^115Kz3Ph]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The prognosis of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is poor, and patients with severe renal insufficiency can only be treated with dialysis. However, the treatment and prevention methods for CIN are limited. Clinical guidelines recommend the intravenous infusion of normal saline, minimizing the use of contrast medium, reducing the speed of administration, and using hypotonic or isotonic contrast medium for prevention; however, the prevention effect is not very strong.

Before applying contrast agents, it is best to reduce postoperative CIN by evaluating the basic condition and renal function of patients and by giving more effective preventive measures to high-risk patients. For patients with high-risk factors, contrast examination should be avoided as much as possible. This is especially true for patients with original renal insufficiency, the elderly, dehydration, diabetes, multiple myeloma, and hyperuricemia. If there is no alternative diagnostic method, saline should be supplemented before contrast, and the contrast examination should be performed after correcting dehydration, hypotension, and electrolyte disturbance. Once acute kidney injury occurs, it should be treated immediately.

Atorvastatin is a common drug for lowering blood cholesterol levels. It is manufactured by Pfizer and belongs to the statin class. It is used to lower blood cholesterol, stabilize blood plaque, inhibit platelet aggregation, and prevent stroke. The amount of atorvastatin used in the domestic sample hospital market has already surpassed that of simvastatin and has always been in a leading position.

### Efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in hyperlipidemic, type 2 diabetic patients. A 34-week, multicenter, open-label study [^113dAuFd]. Atherosclerosis (2000). Low credibility.

Hyperlipidemia is common in type 2 diabetic patients and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily atorvastatin, 10–80 mg, for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in type 2 diabetics with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels exceeding 3.4 mmol/l (130 mg/dl). One hundred and two patients met the study criteria and received 10 mg/day atorvastatin. Patients who reached the target LDL-C level of ≤ 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) maintained the same dosage regimen until they had completed 16 weeks of treatment. Patients not reaching the target LDL-C underwent dose titration to atorvastatin 20, 40, and 80 mg/day at Weeks 4, 8, and 12, respectively.

All 88 patients who completed the study attained target LDL-C levels, and 52 (59%) of patients achieved the target goal at the starting dose of atorvastatin 10 mg/day. In this group, the differences between baseline and post-treatment values for LDL-C were 4.3 ± 0.7 mmol/l (166 ± 26 mg/dl) versus 2.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l (87 ± 14 mg/dl) (P < 0.0001), respectively, a decrease of 47%. Similar trends were observed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels. The safety profile of atorvastatin in these patients was highly favorable and similar to those reported with other statins. Only one patient withdrew due to a possible drug-related adverse event. These data confirm the marked efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia.

### An introductory tutorial on cardiovascular pharmacogenetics for healthcare providers [^116z2rQU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

Statins are mostly well-tolerated, although some patients report statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMS). SAMS refers to a range of disorders, from the rare rhabdomyolysis (1 in 10,000) to muscle pain with evidence of muscle damage or myopathy (1 in 2,000), to muscle symptoms without evidence of damage or myalgia (up to 1 in 10). The SLCO1B1 gene encoding the hepatic transporter OATP1B1 is the most validated gene underlying the risk for statin myopathy. First identified through a genome-wide association study of myopathy in patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg, the reduced function haplotype (✱5) has since been extended to other SAMS phenotypes and statins. Beyond symptoms, the *5 variant has also been associated with premature statin discontinuation for simvastatin and atorvastatin. Importantly, SAMS risk (in *5 allele carriers) appears to be a class effect pharmacokinetically, although the strength of association is statin type- and dose-dependent. Additionally, there is recent evidence of a differential effect of SLCO1B1 genotype by sex, requiring further investigation.

The biggest updates to the most recent CPIC guidelines for statins (published in 2022), compared with the 2014 update, is the expansion of statin types and genotypes beyond only simvastatin and SLCO1B1, respectively. Designed to mirror the 2018 multi-society guidelines for managing blood lipids, the 2022 CPIC guidelines for statins begin with an assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk and desired statin lipid-lowering intensity (low, moderate, or high).

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^113yu2J3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of atorvastatin on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2,838 subjects (94% White, 2% Black or African American, 2% South Asian, 1% other, 68% male), ages 40 to 75 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria. These subjects had no prior history of cardiovascular disease and had LDL ≤ 160 mg/dL and triglycerides (TG) ≤ 600 mg/dL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had one or more of the following risk factors: smoking (23%), hypertension (80%), retinopathy (30%), microalbuminuria (9%), or macroalbuminuria (3%). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the trial.

In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either atorvastatin 10 mg daily (1,429 subjects) or placebo (1,411 subjects), in a 1:1 ratio, and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis focused on the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint.

Baseline characteristics of subjects were: mean age of 62 years; mean HbA1c 7.7%; median LDL-C 120 mg/dL; median total cholesterol (TC) 207 mg/dL; median TG 151 mg/dL; median HDL-C 52 mg/dL.

### Statins research unfinished saga: Desirability versus feasibility [^115dQVSE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Extensive evidence from intervention trials has been presented to demonstrate that "old" statin treatment results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By contrast, statin treatment has not been associated consistently with a reduction in plasma RLP-C levels. In general, however, it can be concluded that RLP-C lowering by statins depends on their ability to reduce triglyceride levels. Therefore, among all currently clinically available statins, only atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have the potential to reduce RLP-C levels.

In addition, the concomitant use of fibrate and statin seems to be attractive in patients whose LDL-cholesterol is controlled by statin but whose HDL-cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels are still inappropriate. A combination of statin/fibrate may be necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Safety concerns about some fibrates, such as gemfibrozil, may lead to exaggerated precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of these agents. However, other fibrates, such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate, appear to be safer and better tolerated.

The combination of fibrate with statins that are not mainly metabolized within the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (like pravastatin or fluvastatin) may be even less hazardous. We believe that a proper coadministration of statins and fibrates in some cases, selected on the basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving comprehensive lipid control compared with monotherapy. An alternative future combination may offer further insights into achieving optimal patient outcomes.

### Policosanol: Clinical pharmacology and therapeutic significance of a new lipid-lowering agent [^111zP2jm]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Policosanol is a mixture of higher primary aliphatic alcohols isolated from sugar cane wax, with octacosanol as its main component. This mixture has been shown to lower cholesterol in animal models, healthy volunteers, and patients with type II hypercholesterolemia.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature on placebo-controlled lipid-lowering studies using policosanol published in peer-reviewed journals, investigating its mechanism of action and clinical pharmacology.

- **Results**: At doses of 10 to 20 mg per day, policosanol lowers total cholesterol by 17% to 21% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 21% to 29%, and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8% to 15%. Since higher doses have not yet been tested, it is unclear if effectiveness might be greater. Daily doses of 10 mg of policosanol have shown equal effectiveness in lowering total or LDL cholesterol as the same dose of simvastatin or pravastatin. Triglyceride levels are not influenced by policosanol. At dosages of up to 20 mg per day, policosanol is safe and well tolerated, as studies of more than three years of therapy indicate. Evidence from in vitro studies suggests that policosanol may inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis at a step before mevalonate generation, but direct inhibition of the hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is unlikely. Animal studies suggest that LDL catabolism may be enhanced, possibly through receptor-mediated mechanisms, although the precise mechanism of action is not yet understood. Policosanol has additional beneficial properties.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^115bngEc]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10,000 people on standard statin doses.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7–29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding.

- **Recommendation for identifying SAMS**: The panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge.
- **Management recommendation**: In people with SAMS, the panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally.

### Statin treatment and muscle symptoms: series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials [^117Fy8kb]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Participant decisions about ongoing use of statins: Of the 114 participants who completed six treatment periods, 113 (57% of 200 randomised participants) received their results during an end-of-trial discussion. One participant did not attend. Of these 113 participants, 99 (88%) said that the trial had been helpful, and 74 (66%) said that they had already or intended to resume taking statins. Of the 113 participants, 17 (15%) had a mean muscle symptom score at least one unit higher during the statin than the placebo periods and had been informed that statins might be contributing to their muscle symptoms. Among these 17 patients, nine (53%) said they planned to restart treatment with statins. Of the remaining 96 participants who had been informed that statins were unlikely to be contributing to their muscle symptoms, 65 (68%) said they planned to restart treatment with statins.

- **Withdrawals**: Table 4 shows the reasons for withdrawal. Of the 80 withdrawals, 34 (43%) occurred during a statin period, 39 (49%) during a placebo period, and seven (9%) after randomisation but before the study drug was taken. Overall, few participants withdrew because of muscle symptoms. During statin periods, 18 (9%) participants withdrew because of intolerable symptoms compared with 13 (7%) during placebo periods. Appendix figure 4 shows the mean symptom scores for those who withdrew versus those that did not withdraw. Among the 193 participants who had not withdrawn before the start of the trial, our multinomial models showed no evidence of a difference in the probability of withdrawal related to treatment type.

### Use of the thyroid hormone analogue eprotirome in statin-treated dyslipidemia [^1166Vxbp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Dyslipidemia increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is incompletely reversed by statin therapy alone in many patients. Thyroid hormone lowers levels of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and has other potentially favorable actions on lipoprotein metabolism. Consequently, thyromimetic drugs hold promise as lipid-lowering agents if adverse effects can be avoided.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the thyromimetic compound eprotirome (KB2115) in lowering the level of serum LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia who were already receiving simvastatin or atorvastatin. In addition to statin treatment, patients received either eprotirome (at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 micrograms per day) or placebo. Secondary outcomes were changes in levels of serum apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and Lp(a) lipoprotein. Patients were monitored for potential adverse thyromimetic effects on the heart, bone, and pituitary.

- **Results**: The addition of placebo or eprotirome at a dose of 25, 50, or 100 micrograms daily to statin treatment for 12 weeks reduced the mean level of serum LDL cholesterol from 141 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter) to 127, 113, 99, and 94 mg per deciliter (3.3, 2.9, 2.6, and 2.4 mmol per liter) respectively, with a mean reduction from baseline of 7%, 22%, 28%, and 32%. Similar reductions were seen in levels of serum apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and Lp(a) lipoprotein. Eprotirome therapy was not associated with adverse effects on the heart, bone, or pituitary.

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, more specifically with respect to general principles, the 2019 guidelines recommend addressing and treating lifestyle factors, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, secondary factors, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or kidney disease and/or nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, and medications that increase triglycerides in adult patients aged 20 years and older with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (fasting or nonfasting triglycerides of 175–499 mg/dL; 2.0–5.6 mmol/L).

### Biaxin [^115kxvrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

**HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors**: Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). As with other macrolides, clarithromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been observed in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy. Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have also been noted in patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin concomitantly with clarithromycin. When used with clarithromycin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin should be administered in the lowest possible doses. Adjustment of the statin dose or the use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin) should be considered.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, lipid-lowering therapy, the AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of alirocumab or evolocumab for reducing the risk of a first stroke in patients without cardiovascular disease. These patients may qualify for lipid-lowering therapy but are not reaching goals or tolerating other therapies such as statins.

### Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin versus up titration of atorvastatin to 40 mg in patients ≥ 65 years of age (from the ZETia in the ELDerly [ZETELD] study) [^116Mb2o3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Few clinical studies have focused on the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies in patients aged 65 years or older. The percentage change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the percentage of patients achieving prespecified LDL cholesterol levels after 12 weeks of ezetimibe 10 mg plus atorvastatin versus up titration of atorvastatin were assessed in subjects aged 65 years or older with hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease.

After stabilization of atorvastatin 10 mg therapy, 1,053 patients, aged 65 years or older, at high risk of coronary heart disease, with and without atherosclerotic vascular disease and an LDL cholesterol level not < 70 or < 100 mg/dL, respectively, were randomized to receive ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg for 12 weeks versus up titration to atorvastatin 20 mg for 6 weeks followed by up titration to atorvastatin 40 mg for an additional 6 weeks.

Ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater changes at week 6 in LDL cholesterol (p < 0.001), significantly more patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease achieving an LDL cholesterol level of < 70 mg/dL (p < 0.001), and significantly more patients without atherosclerotic vascular disease achieving an LDL cholesterol level of < 100 mg/dL (p < 0.001) at weeks 6 and 12 compared to atorvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg.

In addition, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater changes at week 6 in total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (all p < 0.001).

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^114VNko1]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

From a treatment viewpoint, Zhang et al. showed that 90% of patients reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) to one statin were able to tolerate an alternative statin with continued use after 12 months, suggesting that statin-attributed symptoms may have had other causes or were not generalizable to other statins. Similar results were reported by Mampuya et al. Furthermore, increased prescription of statins itself appears to be associated with increased non-adherence or discontinuation, as illustrated for Denmark over the period 1995–2010 (Figure 1). Different factors may have contributed to this finding. Increased media coverage of statins and their perceived side effects, as well as wider prescription in primary prevention where the benefits may be less obvious to patients, may be contributing to greater non-adherence and discontinuation.

- **Trends in statin use and non-adherence/discontinuation**: Figure 1 shows the trends in statin use (upper panel) and statin non-adherence/discontinuation (lower panel) in adults aged ≥ 40 years in Denmark over the period 1995–2010. Statin use from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2010 was classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification of Drugs code C10AA, as registered in the national Danish Registry of Medicinal Products Statistics, recording information on all prescribed drugs dispensed at all Danish pharmacies from 1995 onwards. The percentage of the Danish population aged ≥ 40 years on statins increased from < 1% in 1995 to 11% in 2010. Correspondingly, non-adherence or discontinuation (defined as the percentage of patients starting statins who only redeemed one prescription) increased.

### Efficacy of rosuvastatin compared with other statins at selected starting doses in hypercholesterolemic patients and in special population groups [^113Y9hcm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). High credibility.

A total of five randomized, double-blind trials in patients with hypercholesterolemia were prospectively designed to allow pooling of plasma lipid data after 12 weeks of treatment. The purpose was:

- **To compare rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg with atorvastatin 10 mg** (data from three of the five trials).
- **To compare rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg with simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg** (data from two of the five trials).
- **To summarize overall efficacy and subset analyses** of rosuvastatin data from all five trials.

Rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 390) and 10 mg (n = 389) reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) (41.9% and 46.7% vs. 36.4%, both p < 0.001). Similarly, rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg showed greater reductions than simvastatin 20 mg (n = 402) and pravastatin 20 mg (n = 403) (46.1% and 51.3% vs. 32.9% and 30.8%, respectively, both p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses of patients aged ≥ 65 years, female sex, postmenopausal status, hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity demonstrated that rosuvastatin had consistent efficacy across patient subsets.

### Combination therapy with statins and omega-3 fatty acids [^114PQBDU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Combined dyslipidemia is the presence of multiple abnormalities in various lipid subfractions, including elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs), as well as decreased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) lowered the cut points for classification of TG levels, established non-HDL cholesterol levels as a secondary target of therapy in patients with TGs of ≥ 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and defined the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target of therapy.

Although 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line therapy for most patients with elevated LDL cholesterol, statin monotherapy may not be sufficient to achieve recommended non-HDL cholesterol goals, and statins have only modest effects on reducing TG levels. Similarly, patients whose TG levels remain elevated despite treatment with a TG-lowering agent may require the addition of a statin to provide further TG reduction. Additionally, statin therapy may be needed to offset the secondary increase in levels of LDL cholesterol that frequently results from treatment with a TG-lowering agent in patients with marked hypertriglyceridemia.

In a number of small studies, the combination of statins and omega-3 fatty acids has been consistently shown to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for combined dyslipidemia. Patients with recent myocardial infarction may also benefit from this combination.

### Effects of atorvastatin versus fenofibrate on lipoprotein profiles, low-density lipoprotein subfraction distribution, and hemorheologic parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus with mixed hyperlipoproteinemia [^114KiEsE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetic dyslipoproteinemia, characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and often elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with a predominance of small, dense LDL, is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis. It remains unclear whether fibrate or statin therapy is more effective in these patients. We compared atorvastatin (10 mg/day) with fenofibrate (200 mg/day), each administered for 6 weeks and separated by a 6-week washout period in 13 patients (5 men and 8 women; mean age 60.0 ± 6.8 years; body mass index 30.0 ± 3.0 kg/m²) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c 7.3 ± 1.1%) and mixed hyperlipoproteinemia (LDL cholesterol 164.0 ± 37.8 mg/dl, triglycerides 259.7 ± 107 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 48.7 ± 11.0 mg/dl) using a randomized, crossover design.

- **Lipid profiles and LDL subfraction distribution**: Atorvastatin decreased all LDL subfractions (LDL cholesterol, -29%; p < 0.01), including small, dense LDL. Fenofibrate predominantly decreased triglyceride concentrations (triglycerides, -39%; p < 0.005) and induced a shift in LDL subtype distribution from small, dense LDL (-31%) to intermediate-dense LDL (+36%). The concentration of small, dense LDL was comparable during therapy with both drugs (atorvastatin 62.8 ± 19.5 mg/dl, fenofibrate 63.0 ± 18.1 mg/dl).

- **HDL cholesterol and hemorheologic parameters**: Both drugs induced an increase in HDL cholesterol (atorvastatin +10%, p < 0.05; fenofibrate +11%, p = 0.06). In addition, fenofibrate decreased fibrinogen concentration (-15%; p < 0).

### Safety of niacin and simvastatin combination therapy [^115gab1G]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Niacin is the most potent lipid-altering agent for raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. It also lowers triglyceride (TG) levels, reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and improves lipoprotein particle size and subclass distribution. Niacin's major adverse experience (AE) is flushing. Additionally, niacin may increase glucose levels, liver enzymes, and uric acid levels, potentially causing other AEs that may have clinical relevance in selected patients.

Simvastatin is representative of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) class of lipid-altering drugs. Statins are the most effective agents for lowering LDL cholesterol levels and also provide modest benefits in raising HDL cholesterol and lowering TG levels. The most common AEs with statins are muscle AEs and modest liver enzyme elevations.

- **Combination therapy**: Because niacin and statins have complementary lipid effects and have been shown in outcomes studies to reduce atherosclerotic coronary artery disease events, the combined use of these two agents has significant potential to not only improve the lipid values of patients but also enhance their quality of life. Equally important is ensuring that the combination of niacin and simvastatin has an acceptable safety profile, with no greater AEs than would otherwise be expected by adding one agent to the other.

### Comparison of treatment of severe high-density lipoprotein cholesterol deficiency in men with daily atorvastatin (20 mg) versus fenofibrate (200 mg) versus extended-release niacin (2 g) [^115XYN1p]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

To determine whether available lipid-modifying medication can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in well-defined genetic or familial HDL-deficiency states, we studied 19 men with HDL deficiency (HDL cholesterol < 5th percentile for age and gender) aged 55 ± 10 years. Concomitant risk factors included diabetes (n = 3) and hypertension (n = 7), and 8 patients had coronary artery disease. Molecular analysis revealed that 4 patients had a mutation in the ABCA1 gene. Patients were assigned to sequentially receive atorvastatin 20 mg/day, fenofibrate 200 mg/day, and extended-release niacin 2 g/day for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout period between each treatment. Patients who required a statin, according to treatment guidelines, were maintained on atorvastatin throughout the study. The baseline HDL cholesterol level was 0.63 ± 0.12 mmol/L (24 ± 5 mg/dl), triglycerides 2.01 ± 0.98 mmol/L (180 ± 86 mg/dl), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 2.29 ± 0.95 mmol/L (94 ± 39 mg/dl). Mean percentage changes in HDL cholesterol on atorvastatin, fenofibrate, and niacin were -6% (p = NS), +6% (p = NS), and +22% (p < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, niacin significantly increased the large alpha-1 apolipoprotein A-I-containing HDL subspecies (12 to 17 nm). In conclusion, niacin was the only effective drug to increase HDL cholesterol. The absolute increase in HDL cholesterol, approximately 0.10 mmol/L (3.9 mg/dl), is of uncertain clinical significance. Biomarkers of HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux were not changed by niacin therapy.

### Zocor [^112xSukK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The Heart Protection Study (HPS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-centered study with a mean duration of 5 years, conducted in 10,269 patients on Zocor 40 mg and 10,267 on placebo. Patients had a mean age of 64 years (range 40–80 years old), 97% were white, and were at high risk of developing a major coronary event due to existing CHD (65%), diabetes (Type 2, 26%; Type 1, 3%), history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease (16%), peripheral vascular disease (33%), or they were males aged ≥ 65 years with hypertension (6%).

At baseline, 3,421 patients (17%) had LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dL, including 953 (5%) below 80 mg/dL; and 10,047 patients (49%) had levels greater than 130 mg/dL. Patients were randomized to Zocor or placebo using a covariate adaptive method, which considered the distribution of 10 important baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled.

- **Study HPS results**: The results showed that Zocor 40 mg/day significantly reduced total and CHD mortality, as well as non-fatal MI, stroke, and revascularization procedures (both coronary and non-coronary).

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: An individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^115WPayZ]. Lancet (2022).

- **Methods and analyses**: Methods and analyses were prespecified. Briefly, all trials of statin therapy with more than 1000 participants and a scheduled mean follow-up of 2 years or more were eligible if they involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of more intensive versus less intensive statin regimens.

- **Statin intensity**: Statin intensity (relative reduction in LDL cholesterol from baseline) for each statin regimen was defined according to the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines. A low intensity was classified as a less than 30% LDL cholesterol reduction, moderate intensity as a 30 to less than 50% reduction, and high intensity as a 50% or more reduction (appendix p 6). The main results were estimated separately for less intensive, moderate-intensity, and more intensive statin regimens.

- **Analysis criteria**: Analyses involved only unconfounded trials (i.e. those in which there were no protocol-mandated differences between randomly assigned groups other than those created by the random allocations). We requested individual participant data on all adverse events, including the timing of such events, the timing of and reasons for stopping study treatment, non-trial statin use, use of other (non-trial) medications, comorbidities, and laboratory results (including creatine kinase for those regarding muscle; appendix p 2). Data on the exclusion criteria of potential relevance to previous intolerance to a statin are shown in the appendix (p 3). Ethics approval was granted by the UK National Health Service Health Research Authority.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111mbp1D]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Non-statin based lipid-lowering therapy is important for patients whose LDL-C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statin dosage. In such cases, adding an alternative LDL-C lowering agent should be considered, especially for patients at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to improve LDL-C reduction. Ezetimibe can effectively reduce LDL-C by 15–20%, is easy to take with few side effects, and has been shown to reduce CVD events. In patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), the combination of ezetimibe plus fluvastatin XL has been shown to reduce LDL-C by 46% and is as well tolerated as ezetimibe alone.

Bile acid sequestrants are another option, capable of reducing LDL-C levels by 15–25%, depending on the type and dosage used. They may also improve glycaemia in patients with diabetes. Colesevelam, for instance, is easier to take and better tolerated than earlier formulations. The combination of a bile acid sequestrant and ezetimibe can lead to an LDL-C reduction of approximately 30–35%.

Fenofibrate is known to lower LDL-C by 15–20% in patients with high baseline levels who do not have concomitant hypertriglyceridaemia. It is easy to administer and has demonstrated an excellent safety profile in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes and Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes trials. Although no additional CVD benefit has been demonstrated, serum creatinine was reversibly increased during treatment. Importantly, unlike gemfibrozil, fenofibrate does not increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis when added to a statin.

Niacin also reduces LDL-C levels by 15–20%; however, recent large randomized trials have reported a significant excess of adverse effects and no significant CVD benefit when added to background statin treatment. Consequently, niacin derivatives are no longer considered a viable option.

### Management of dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^1132yGJr]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in high-risk patients. The identification and treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), suggest that patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥ 130 mg/dL, and perhaps even those with levels ≥ 100 mg/dL, should receive drug therapy. Optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL and < 115 mg/dL for high-risk patients by US and European guidelines, respectively. However, a recent survey shows that only about 20% of high-risk patients currently meet these goals.

In order to achieve therapeutic targets for LDL-C, the statins are the foundation of treatment, as they are the most effective and best-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapeutic options include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols, although seldom as monotherapy. Combination therapy with a statin and one of these other lipid-lowering agents can be useful in patients who are unable to achieve target lipid levels through monotherapy. There remains, however, a need for additional agents. Some of the new options for reducing LDL-C levels that may be available in the near future include 2 new statins, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin, which is currently under development, shows promise.

### Lypqozet [^111gNT9L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cyclosporine**: Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of OATP1B1, such as cyclosporine, can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to atorvastatin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Additionally, ezetimibe and cyclosporine used together can increase exposure to both ezetimibe and cyclosporine, with a potentially greater increase in ezetimibe exposure in patients with severe renal impairment. The coadministration of LYPQOZET with cyclosporine should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Grapefruit juice**: Grapefruit juice contains components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive consumption of grapefruit juice (> 1.2 liters per day).

- **Gemfibrozil**: Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of LYPQOZET with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Fenofibrates (e.g. fenofibrate and fenofibric acid)**: It is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with coadministration of fenofibrates. LYPQOZET should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with a fenofibrate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Fenofibrates may increase cholesterol levels.

### Rationale and design of the CLEAR-outcomes trial: Evaluating the effect of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular events in patients with statin intolerance [^1132wKbc]. American Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Although statins play a pivotal role in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, many patients fail to achieve recommended lipid levels due to statin-associated muscle symptoms. Bempedoic acid is an oral pro-drug that is activated in the liver and inhibits cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes, but is not activated in skeletal muscle, which has the potential to avoid muscle-related adverse events. Accordingly, this agent effectively lowers atherogenic lipoproteins in patients who experience statin-associated muscle symptoms. However, the effects of bempedoic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been studied.

- **Study design**: Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Included patients must have all of the following: (i) established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, (ii) documented statin intolerance, and (iii) an LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. The study randomized 14,014 patients to treatment with bempedoic acid 180 mg daily or matching placebo on a background of guideline-directed medical therapy. The primary outcome is a composite of the time to first cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization. The trial will continue until 1620 patients experience a primary endpoint, with a minimum of 810 hard ischemic events, including cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction.

### Approach to the patient who is intolerant of statin therapy [^114nQ5Aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If CK levels are less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals and the CK repeated when symptoms appear or worsen.

In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than five-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by:

- **Using a different statin**: For example, fluvastatin or pravastatin, starting with a low dose and titrating up.
- **Alternate dosing strategy**: An alternate daily or weekly more potent statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin.
- **Combination therapy**: Combining the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, such as ezetimibe, and/or a bile acid sequestrant.

Over-the-counter preparations, such as red yeast rice containing natural statin-like agents or plant sterols, can also lower cholesterol. However, these have limited efficacy in achieving targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored.

### Advicor [^113XDyYa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.

- **Gemfibrozil**: The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.

- **Other fibrates**: Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of this combination.

- **Cyclosporine**: The use of lovastatin with cyclosporine should be avoided.

- **Danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil with higher doses of lovastatin**: In patients taking concomitant danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 20 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), as the risk of myopathy increases at higher doses. The benefits of the use of lovastatin in patients receiving danazol, diltiazem, or verapamil should be carefully weighed against the risks of these combinations.

- **Amiodarone**: In patients taking concomitant amiodarone, the dose of lovastatin should not exceed 40 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), as the risk of myopathy increases at higher doses.

- **Colchicine**: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with lovastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing lovastatin with colchicine.

- **Ranolazine**: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of ranolazine. Dose adjustment of lovastatin may be considered during co-administration with ranolazine.

### Lovastatin [^112wcKPN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a study including 16 elderly patients between 70 to 78 years of age who received lovastatin 80 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18 to 30 years of age (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The increase in AUC for lovastatin and lovastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4.

The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of myopathy (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Lovastatin is a substrate for cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Grapefruit juice contains one or more components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In one study, 10 subjects consumed 200 mL of double-strength grapefruit juice (one can of frozen concentrate diluted with one rather than 3 cans of water) three times daily for 2 days and an additional 200 mL double-strength grapefruit juice together with and 30 and 90 minutes following a single dose of 80 mg lovastatin on the third day. This regimen of grapefruit juice resulted in a mean increase in the serum concentration of lovastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite (as measured by the area under the curve).

Regarding the medical management of statin-induced myopathy, particularly concerning treatment modifications, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend considering a switch to non-statin therapy. This approach is likely to provide a net clinical benefit in patients at increased ASCVD risk who experience severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or persistent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge.

### Current overview of statin-induced myopathy [^115AZV5z]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Statins are an efficacious and well-tolerated class of lipid-altering agents that have been shown to reduce the risk of initial and recurrent cardiovascular events. However, cerivastatin was withdrawn from the world market because of its potential for severe myotoxic effects. Since the benefits of statin treatment outweigh the small risk of adverse events, statins remain the first-line therapy for lipid lowering and preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

The risk of myopathy may be minimized with the appropriate choice of agent and by identifying patients at risk of myotoxic effects. Elderly or female patients, or those with concomitant medications or impaired metabolic processes, may be at increased risk and should be monitored closely. The risk of myopathy may also be inferred from the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the statin used. Since myotoxic events are more frequent at higher doses, statins that are effective in reducing cholesterol levels and helping patients to reach target levels at start doses may be useful. The lipophilicity of a statin and its potential for drug-drug interactions may also help to determine the likelihood of muscular effects. Drug-drug interactions may be avoided by selecting a statin that does not share the same metabolic pathway.

### Lescol [^114LtnNc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

In 12 placebo-controlled studies involving patients with Type IIa or IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, Lescol® (fluvastatin sodium) was administered to 1,621 patients in daily dose regimens of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) for at least six weeks. After 24 weeks of treatment, daily doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg resulted in median LDL-C reductions of 22% (n = 747), 25% (n = 748), and 36% (n = 257), respectively. Lescol treatment produced dose-related reductions in Apo B, triglycerides, and increases in HDL-C. The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment with Lescol at daily doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg were +2 (-4, +10), +5 (-2, +12), and +4 (-3, +12), respectively.

In a subgroup of patients with primary mixed dyslipidemia, defined as baseline TG levels > 200 mg/dL, treatment with Lescol produced significant decreases in Total-C, LDL-C, TG, and Apo B and variable increases in HDL-C. The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C after 12 weeks of treatment with Lescol at daily doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg in this population were +4 (-2, +12), +8 (+1, +15), and +4 (-3, +13), respectively.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^116jLC64]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). High credibility.

- **Interaction between statins and the natural decline of strength with aging**: In older patients, there is a natural decline in strength and agility, and concurrently, they are receiving statins; however, these patients are also at the greatest risk for a heart attack. The side-effect profile in this older population will be different. Younger patients may tend to complain more about cognitive dysfunction because they remain active in the workforce and can be very sensitive to their level of performance. Older patients, however, are more prone to complaints of generalized aches and pains that are, for the most part, easier to manage. Once they are beyond the age of 75 years, patients should be on statins to reduce the chances of myocardial infarction.

- **Dr. Sperling's insights on myopathies and myalgia**: The high prevalence of myopathies and myalgia is overemphasized, as most patients do not experience these symptoms. The message is not that 10% of patients experience these symptoms, but that 90% do not. Patients need to understand the typically favorable benefit‐to‐risk ratio, and as a whole, the messages for patients and physicians should focus on the positive.

- **Effects of acute physical activities on muscle complaints associated with statin use**: Following exercise, elevations in creatine kinase (CK) levels always seem to resolve quickly; but at the same time, it is prudent to see what the highest elevations look like, as there can be a great deal of variability with exercise. As the older population becomes more active, it can become more difficult to advise them.

### The role of nutraceuticals in statin intolerant patients [^114NZdV2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Statins are the most common drugs administered for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, due to statin-associated muscle symptoms, adherence to statin therapy is challenging in clinical practice. Certain nutraceuticals, such as red yeast rice, bergamot, berberine, artichoke, soluble fiber, and plant sterols and stanols, alone or in combination with each other, as well as with ezetimibe, might be considered as an alternative or add-on therapy to statins, although there is still insufficient evidence available regarding long-term safety and effectiveness on cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment. These nutraceuticals could exert significant lipid-lowering activity and might present multiple non-lipid-lowering actions, including improvement of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this expert opinion paper is to provide the first attempt at recommending the management of statin intolerance through the use of nutraceuticals with particular attention to those with effective low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction.

### The power of statins: Aggressive lipid lowering [^116hYCe2]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

A large body of evidence has demonstrated that reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decrease the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related adverse events. The greatest reductions in morbidity and mortality are attained in higher-risk patients, suggesting that targeting this group can maximize the cost-effectiveness of statins, since fewer patients need to be treated to prevent one event. High-risk individuals (those with preexisting CHD or CHD risk equivalents) require aggressive lipid lowering to achieve the stringent LDL-C goal levels established by the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III). The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have assumed the central role in this setting because of their superior ability to reduce LDL-C across the spectrum of CHD risk.

Rosuvastatin, a new agent in this class, reduces LDL-C to a significantly greater degree than atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin. The more aggressive goals put forward since ATP I (1987) have heightened interest in more efficacious statins. As a result, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and now rosuvastatin have been developed, adding sequentially greater LDL-C-reducing capacity for the physician. Substantially more patients, particularly high-risk patients, are thereby able to achieve NCEP ATP III target LDL-C levels with rosuvastatin. Other cholesterol-lowering drugs (bile acid sequestrants, niacin, plant stanols, and fibrates) are much less effective at lowering LDL-C and are much less well.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^1173JFv5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are a combination of two drugs, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (atorvastatin). The amlodipine component inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The atorvastatin component is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.

- **Amlodipine**: Amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle depend on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro, but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine.

Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated but are thought to include the following:
