## Question

Treatment SIADH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat SIADH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to stratify the patient by symptom severity and chronicity. Then, I should verify emergency management with hypertonic saline and safe correction limits. Next, I will review first-line therapy for non-emergent SIADH, followed by second-line pharmacologic options and their risks. After that, I should outline how to prevent and manage overcorrection. Finally, I need to address underlying etiologies, special scenarios, and monitoring protocols, making sure each step aligns with the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm initial assessment anchors, because the entire pathway depends on them. I need to distinguish severe symptomatic hyponatremia, which presents with vomiting, seizures, or reduced consciousness and mandates urgent therapy, from mild to moderate cases, and I must determine whether the hyponatremia is acute versus chronic or of unknown duration since this dictates correction limits and ODS risk, with special caution in malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, or liver disease as ODS risk enhancers [^111tDN7n]. I should also make sure the diagnosis of SIADH is sound using established criteria and exclude adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, and renal insufficiency, while avoiding vasopressin measurement as part of routine diagnostic evaluation per guidelines [^115cSj3z] [^117VQ1wD].

> I will now examine emergency management for severe symptomatic hyponatremia, and I need to be precise here. The guideline-concordant approach is bolus 3% hypertonic saline to achieve an initial 4–6 mmol/L rise in sodium over the first few hours to rapidly reduce intracranial pressure, using 100 mL 3% NaCl IV that can be repeated up to three times, or weight-based 2 mL/kg if weight is known, with frequent reassessment of symptoms and serum sodium [^111tDN7n] [^111kpjaA]. Wait, let me verify the comparative evidence for bolus versus infusion; both observational and randomized data suggest boluses achieve faster neurological improvement than slow infusions, though both strategies can be safe when carefully monitored, which supports choosing bolus dosing in most emergencies [^117PCqqg] [^113SHKnQ].

> Hold on, I should verify correction limits before proceeding, because overshooting is a common pitfall. In chronic or unknown-duration hyponatremia, safe correction is typically 4–8 mmol/L in 24 hours, not exceeding 10 mmol/L in 24 hours, and for high-risk patients I should target 4–6 mmol/L in 24 hours, with very frequent sodium checks and close urine output monitoring to detect sudden aquaresis that can accelerate the rise more than intended [^111tDN7n] [^116VvNY1] [^113SHKnQ]. I need to ensure that after the initial bolus response, I stop or slow further correction to respect the 24-hour budget, because spontaneous water diuresis after reversal of the AVP stimulus is a major driver of inadvertent overcorrection and is not safer than iatrogenic overcorrection [^113Ucrn6].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for non-emergent, largely asymptomatic or mildly to moderately symptomatic SIADH. Fluid restriction is consensus first line, typically to less than 1,000 mL/day of all fluids, acknowledging real-world adherence challenges and only about 50% efficacy based on limited RCT and observational data, and I should recheck sodium every 6–12 hours initially, then daily when stable [^113PdLtM] [^111tDN7n] [^114MVSuY] [^116dVYFV]. Wait, let me verify a citation I initially used; I had written "ref 2328b498d" for the restriction threshold, but that identifier does not exist in the reference list, so I should correct this to cite the Endocrine Reviews and European guideline sources that explicitly endorse fluid restriction and describe its modest efficacy and tolerability issues [^111tDN7n] [^113PdLtM] [^114MVSuY]. I should also confirm predictors of failure such as urine osmolality greater than 500 mOsm/kg, which support earlier escalation to second-line options when present [^114FMmfr].

> Now, if fluid restriction fails or is contraindicated, I need to consider second-line therapies, and let me think through urea first. Oral urea at 0.25–0.50 g/kg/day increases osmotic excretion of water and is recommended by European guidelines as a second-line option, with systematic review data showing mean sodium increases around 9 mmol/L and generally favorable safety, though palatability and availability can be limiting factors, and it can be particularly useful when maintaining adequate caloric fluids is necessary, such as in infants [^112MGZPb] [^114aNjKF] [^115kygab]. I should confirm that patient education and monitoring for overcorrection, albeit less common with urea, remain necessary [^112MGZPb].

> Let me also consider the combination of a loop diuretic with oral sodium chloride, because I don't want to miss a practical alternative. This pairing reduces urinary concentrating ability while providing solute, is listed as an equal second-line option in the European guideline, but has limited efficacy data and requires careful selection to avoid volume depletion, with some oncology contexts suggesting use when urine osmolality is high relative to plasma [^112MGZPb] [^113uB81Q]. I should double-check renal and cardiac function before choosing this route and keep a close eye on volume status and electrolytes [^112MGZPb].

> But wait, tolvaptan warrants a careful, balanced discussion because of guideline conflicts and overcorrection risk. Most international recommendations outside Europe position tolvaptan as second-line after fluid restriction or even earlier in likely non-responders, and RCTs show it is highly efficacious at raising sodium, yet European guidelines advise against vaptans in moderate or profound hyponatremia, largely due to safety concerns and lack of hard outcome data, so I must individualize decisions and closely monitor if I use it [^115TyEPt] [^114HvXRh] [^115Rs8Kk] [^116dVYFV]. I should confirm the real-world overcorrection risk, which rises to about 25% when baseline sodium is 120 mmol/L or lower, consider a lower starting dose such as 7.5 mg to mitigate risk, and institute a strict 24-hour protocol with sodium checks at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours, plus proactive rescue thresholds using dextrose 5% and desmopressin if the rise is too brisk, while acknowledging that even ultra-low doses do not eliminate overcorrection and cost remains a barrier [^112C1CHA] [^1112hMeE] [^116NVVn4] [^116syrTq].

> I need to check how to prevent and manage overcorrection, because this is where morbidity occurs. If sodium rises by more than 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours or more than 8 mmol/L in any subsequent 24 hours, I should immediately stop sodium-raising therapies and re-lower with electrolyte-free water, typically intravenous dextrose 5%, and administer desmopressin 2 mcg IV, repeatable no more often than every 8 hours, to clamp urine output, as per European guidance and expert protocols, even if the patient is asymptomatic, since ODS symptoms may be delayed [^116VvNY1] [^114oqYXZ] [^113ToEcJ] [^113Ucrn6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "proactive DDAVP"; while a clamp strategy can precisely control correction in select high-risk situations, the evidence base is limited and a reactive approach to anticipated overcorrection appears best supported, so I should reserve proactive use for carefully selected cases with specialist oversight [^115eEJTN] [^117PQvbh] [^113GqJQ3].

> Next, I should review how addressing the underlying etiology can be decisive for durable correction. In malignancy-associated SIADH, prompt cancer therapy is essential and may be facilitated by rapid sodium correction, with reports in SCLC showing that tolvaptan-based algorithms enabled timely chemotherapy initiation and performance status improvement, though these data are observational and small [^111WR71R]. I need to check for and discontinue culprit drugs such as serotonergic antidepressants and linezolid, both of which have documented associations with SIADH or hyponatremia, and I should anticipate transient SIADH after pituitary surgery where conservative measures and avoidance of excess IV fluids are emphasized [^113Gn64Y] [^115GEEFh] [^114fEmSn].

> I should also consider emerging or adjunctive strategies when first- and second-line options are insufficient or poorly tolerated. Empagliflozin added to fluid restriction produced a modest additional rise in sodium in a small RCT of SIADH with acceptable short-term safety, suggesting a role for SGLT2 inhibitors in select patients, but I need to monitor renal function and recognize that guideline adoption is still evolving in this space [^111af2Rz] [^112J1dsn]. Let me reconsider isotonic saline; in euvolemic SIADH it can be ineffective or worsen hyponatremia if urine osmolality exceeds infusate tonicity, so it should not be a routine therapy outside of specific diagnostic or volume-assessment contexts [^113uB81Q].

> Finally, I need to ensure the monitoring and follow-up plan is concrete and safe. I should double-check the SIADH diagnosis using essential criteria, exclude endocrine mimics, and document urine osmolality and sodium to inform therapy choice and predict fluid restriction response, then set a laboratory schedule based on acuity: every 2 hours during active hypertonic saline correction, every 6–12 hours during initiation or escalation of non-emergent therapy, and daily once stable, with frequent urine output checks to detect emerging aquaresis [^115cSj3z] [^111tDN7n]. If I reach the daily correction limit early, I need to pause further sodium-raising therapy and, if necessary, re-lower so the net 24-hour rise stays within the safe range, thereby minimizing ODS risk while achieving symptom relief [^116VvNY1] [^113Ucrn6].

The cornerstone of SIADH management is **fluid restriction** to 800–1,000 mL/day [^113PdLtM], with **hypertonic saline** for severe symptoms [^111tDN7n] and tolvaptan or urea as second-line options if restriction fails [^112MGZPb] [^114HvXRh]. Sodium correction must be **slow** (≤ 8–10 mmol/L/24 h) [^116VvNY1] to avoid osmotic demyelination, and any overcorrection should be reversed with desmopressin and hypotonic fluids [^113Ucrn6] [^111tDN7n]. Treat **underlying causes** [^111tDN7n] and monitor sodium closely [^113SHKnQ]; avoid rapid correction, and use tolvaptan cautiously because of overcorrection risk [^112C1CHA] [^114HvXRh].

---

## General principles of management

Identify and treat underlying causes, such as malignancy, CNS or pulmonary disease, or causative drugs [^111tDN7n] [^115cSj3z]. Fluid restriction is **first-line therapy** [^111tDN7n] at 800–1,000 mL/day [^113PdLtM]. Monitor **serum sodium** every 6–8 hours initially, then daily once stable [^113SHKnQ].

---

## Acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia (medical emergency)

### Indications for urgent intervention

Urgent treatment is indicated for **severe symptoms** — such as seizures, coma, or profound confusion [^111tDN7n] — or when serum sodium falls by more than 10 mmol/L within 24 hours.

---

### Hypertonic saline administration

- **Initial bolus**: 100 mL of 3% NaCl over 10 minutes [^111tDN7n]; repeat up to three times if needed [^117PCqqg].

- **Target rise**: 4–6 mmol/L [^113SHKnQ] initially to reduce intracranial pressure [^111tDN7n].

- **Avoid overcorrection**: Do not exceed 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^116VvNY1] [^111tDN7n].

---

### Monitoring and precautions

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check sodium every 2–4 hours during correction [^113SHKnQ].

- **Stop infusion**: Discontinue hypertonic saline once symptoms resolve or target achieved [^114BWXt2].

- **Relowering if needed**: Use desmopressin and hypotonic fluids [^113Ucrn6] if sodium rises too quickly [^111tDN7n].

---

## Chronic SIADH management

### First-line therapy: fluid restriction

Fluid restriction to 800–1,000 mL/day is the **first-line** approach [^111tDN7n] [^113PdLtM]. Adherence is challenging and efficacy is modest, with approximately 50% of patients responding [^111tDN7n] [^116dVYFV].

---

### Second-line therapies

#### Tolvaptan (vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist)

- **Indication**: Use when fluid restriction fails or is not feasible [^111tDN7n] [^114HvXRh].

- **Dose**: Start 7.5–15 mg/day; titrate to 30 mg/day if needed [^114HvXRh].

- **Monitoring**: Sodium every 6 hours initially; watch for rapid correction [^112C1CHA] [^116NVVn4].

- **Risks**: Overcorrection (10–25%); use cautiously, especially if sodium < 120 mmol/L [^112C1CHA] [^114HvXRh].

---

#### Urea

Urea is dosed at **0.25–0.5 g/kg/day** in divided doses [^112MGZPb]. It increases sodium by about 9 mmol/L and is effective within 24–48 hours [^114aNjKF]. Tolerability is generally good, though gastrointestinal upset can occur [^114aNjKF].

---

#### Loop diuretics with oral sodium chloride

Use this option when **fluid restriction is ineffective or not tolerated** [^112MGZPb]. The combination increases free water excretion while promoting sodium retention.

---

#### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)

Empagliflozin **25 mg/day** can raise sodium by approximately 3 mmol/L over 4 days [^111tDN7n] [^111af2Rz]. This emerging option may be considered when other therapies are unsuitable [^111tDN7n].

---

## Prevention and management of overcorrection

Limit correction to **≤ 8–10 mmol/L per 24 hours**, or **≤ 4–6 mmol/L per 24 hours** in patients at high risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^116VvNY1] [^113SHKnQ] [^111tDN7n]. If overcorrection occurs, lower sodium again using desmopressin and hypotonic fluids [^113ToEcJ] [^111tDN7n].

---

## Special considerations

In pediatric patients, use fluid restriction and urea, and avoid rapid correction [^115kygab]. Elderly patients require **close monitoring** due to a higher risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Postoperative SIADH is common after pituitary or spinal surgery; monitor carefully and restrict fluids [^114fEmSn] [^111tY5vT].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute severe symptoms | Hypertonic saline (3%) | Desmopressin + hypotonic fluids if overcorrection | Sodium every 2–4 h |
| Chronic SIADH | Fluid restriction (800–1,000 mL/day) | Tolvaptan, urea, loop diuretics + NaCl, SGLT2i | Sodium every 6–8 h initially |
| Overcorrection | Desmopressin + hypotonic fluids | ∅ | Sodium every 2–4 h |

---

Effective **SIADH management** requires addressing the cause [^111tDN7n], implementing fluid restriction [^113PdLtM], and careful sodium correction [^112MGZPb]; use tolvaptan or urea when restriction fails, and prevent overcorrection with close monitoring and desmopressin as needed.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with SIADH, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend considering either of the following second-line treatments in patients with SIADH and moderate or profound hyponatremia:

- **Increasing solute intake with urea**: 0.25–0.50 g/kg/day
- **A combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride**.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^112C1CHA]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, several real-world studies have reported a substantial risk of overly rapid hyponatremia correction, estimated at around 25% for individuals with a starting serum sodium of 120 mmol/liter. This significantly greater magnitude of sodium rise in real-life data compared with RCTs is most likely explained by real-life tolvaptan use in individuals with much lower baseline serum sodium levels. The underlying explanation may be that patients starting with lower serum sodium have higher volumes of excess body water, which becomes available for renal excretion after tolvaptan administration, leading to a more pronounced aquaresis and a greater increase in serum sodium.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111tDN7n]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting around 15% of hospitalized patients. While most cases are mild (≥ 130 mmol/L), 4% record plasma sodium concentration (pNa) below 130 mmol/L. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) due to excess arginine vasopressin (AVP), despite low serum tonicity, is the leading cause of nonmild hyponatremia.

Severe symptomatic hyponatremia manifests as vomiting, seizures, and reduced conscious state, constituting a medical emergency. Urgent bolus hypertonic saline (100 mL of 3% NaCl, up to 3 doses) is indicated to achieve an initial pNa increase of 4 to 6 mmol/L, aiming to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP).

To prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) in hyponatremia of chronic or unknown duration, target a pNa increase of 4 to 8 mmol/L/24 hours, limiting to 10 mmol/L/24 hours. Lower targets of 4–6 mmol/L/24 hours are advisable for those with risk factors for ODS, such as alcohol use or malnutrition.

Fluid restriction (FR) of less than 1000 mL/day is the first-line therapy for chronic SIAD and is endorsed by guidelines. However, it is effective in only about half of cases. Second-line therapies supported by current limited evidence include tolvaptan, urea, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), or high-dose salt tablets. Of these, tolvaptan may be associated with the highest risk of overcorrection.

If sodium correction limits are exceeded, relowering of pNa with hypotonic fluid, either oral water or intravenous (IV) 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output, is indicated.

In the context of hyponatremia, particularly for patients with SIADH, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend considering fluid intake restriction as a first-line treatment. This approach is specifically advised for patients with SIADH and moderate or profound hyponatremia.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116syrTq]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), the most common cause of hyponatremia, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, induces aquaresis to increase serum sodium concentration and is the only medication licensed in Europe for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia. Randomized controlled trials have shown that tolvaptan is highly efficacious in correcting SIAD-related hyponatremia. Real-world data confirm the marked efficacy of tolvaptan, but they also report a high risk of overly rapid sodium increase in patients with a very low baseline serum sodium. The lower the baseline serum sodium, the higher the tolvaptan-induced correction rate occurs.

A lower starting tolvaptan dose of 7.5 mg has been evaluated in small cohort studies, demonstrating its efficacy. However, it remains unclear whether this dose can reduce the risk of overcorrection. Most international guidelines, except for the European ones, recommend tolvaptan as second-line treatment for SIAD after fluid restriction. The risk of unduly rapid sodium correction combined with its high cost has limited its routine use. Prospective controlled studies are warranted to evaluate whether tolvaptan-related sodium increase can improve patient-related clinical outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay in the acute setting, or neurocognitive symptoms and quality of life in the chronic setting. Additionally, the potential role of a low tolvaptan starting dose needs further exploration.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", which involves early empirical coadministration of both desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following the resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach is that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with. However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbating or prolonging hyponatremia symptoms, especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (e.g. paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue. The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with pNa less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics, treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium of 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours; 2 patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and 2 patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: Treatment with tolvaptan [^111WR71R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia based on the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH) is observed in up to 15% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The electrolyte imbalance is associated with high morbidity and mortality and often delays appropriate treatment. Management of hyponatremia proved to be challenging until new vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists, such as tolvaptan, became available. This is the first report that presents a prospective case series with an efficient management of hyponatremia, including tolvaptan, in ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l).

- **Methods**: Ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH were followed after the onset of clinical symptoms of SIADH. Patients were chosen based on a histologically proven diagnosis of SCLC and the clinical picture of a neurocognitive deficit caused by SIADH-related hyponatremia. All patient data were monitored for clinical improvement based on ECOG status, commencement of chemotherapy, and correction of sodium levels.

- **Results**: The treatment followed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm, leading to a rapid and efficient correction of both clinical symptoms and plasma sodium level.

- **Conclusions**: Based on this algorithm, all patients started chemotherapy in time. Subsequently, the treatment with tolvaptan led to an improvement of the ECOG-performance status. In addition, all patients benefited from the effective management of SIADH, which omitted prolonged hospital stays and non-elective hospitalizations due to an unstable clinical condition due to severe hyponatremia.

### Vasopressin antagonists: Role in the management of hyponatremia [^111PjRuv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration [Na+] are regulated by thirst, the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), and renal water and sodium handling. Hyponatremia is frequently caused by dysregulation of AVP, which accompanies disorders of water retention such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Clinical trials with AVP receptor antagonists have confirmed the important role of AVP in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia and suggest these agents are efficacious in treating hyponatremia associated with SIADH, cirrhosis, and CHF. Acting directly at AVP receptors in the renal tubules, these agents promote aquaresis — the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water — in patients with hyponatremia. In clinical trials, AVP receptor antagonists have been shown to increase the serum [Na+] and urine output while decreasing urine osmolality.

### Oncological emergencies associated with gastrointestinal tumors [^113uB81Q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) occurs in approximately 1–2% of cancer patients. It should be suspected in any cancer patient with hyponatremia combined with hypo-osmolality and high urine osmolality. It results from ADH-induced retention of ingested water. Ectopic production of ADH by a tumor is most often associated with lung carcinoma (especially small cell) but can also occur in other tumors such as head and neck cancer and, rarely, in gastrointestinal (GI) tumors such as esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colon cancer. Antineoplastic drugs such as cisplatin are also well known to cause hyponatremia by a mechanism that may involve SIADH.

Clinical symptoms depend on the level of hyponatremia and the rapidity of onset. Symptoms include changes in mental status, apathy, fatigue, headache, seizures, and ultimately coma. Management involves controlling the underlying tumor as well as fluid restriction of 500 mL to 1 L/day. In severe cases, patients can be treated with hypertonic saline by slow infusion at a rate to increase the serum sodium level by 0.5–1.0 mEq/L/h. Sometimes isotonic saline is used as an alternative; however, the electrolyte concentration of the administered fluid must be greater than the concentration in urine. Otherwise, isotonic saline will not be effective and will even lead to further lowering of the serum sodium. Loop diuretics are only recommended when urine osmolality is more than twice the plasma osmolality, thereby increasing water excretion.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115Rs8Kk]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

For patients with hyponatremia, particularly those diagnosed with SIADH, the 2014 guidelines from ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM recommend not using lithium, demeclocycline, or vasopressin receptor antagonists in cases of moderate or profound hyponatremia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis/hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^112J1dsn]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

The treatment of hyponatremia varies depending principally on the extracellular fluid volume (EFV) and the severity of symptoms. In cases of severely symptomatic hyponatremia, intravenous hypertonic (3% NaCl) saline solution should be administered, independent of the EFV. In non-critical situations, rehydration with isotonic (0.9% NaCl) saline infusion is the main therapy for hyponatremia with reduced EFV. Patients with hyponatremia and normal or increased EFV may be treated with fluid restriction, urea, loop diuretics, and vaptans. The use of tolvaptan, the only vaptan available in Europe, has been restricted to patients with hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). More recently, the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in patients with SIAD has been advocated. Notably, the rate of serum sodium ([Na+]) correction is a critical issue, especially in chronic hyponatremia, due to the risk that an increase beyond 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours may cause osmotic demyelination.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^112qU7s1]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, specifically for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia who exhibit an inadequate response to initial management, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend continuing an intravenous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline. This approach aims for an additional increase in serum sodium concentration by 1 mmol/L per hour.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^114MVSuY]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Fluid restriction is the first-line therapy currently recommended for patients with SIAD by EU and US hyponatremia guidelines. However, evidence for its efficacy is limited. Fluid restriction has the advantages of being free and readily accessible.

- **Limitations**: Potential issues include patient adherence, the accuracy of fluid balance monitoring in real-world conditions, and the need for medications that require coadministration of oral or IV fluid. Additionally, there is potentially poor tolerability in terms of thirst and quality of life.

Interestingly, the osmotic threshold for thirst is lower in those with chronic SIAD, which may contribute to discomfort with fluid restriction. In a study comparing water intake post-hypertonic saline infusion in 8 patients with chronic SIAD and 8 healthy controls, the onset of thirst occurred at a significantly lower serum osmolality in those with SIAD, 264 mOsm/kg H2O vs 285 mOsm/kg H2O.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116NVVn4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

We follow a stringent protocol for the first 24 hours of tolvaptan use:

- **Monitor serum sodium**: Conduct checks every six hours at baseline, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after the initial dose.

- **Maintain accurate fluid balance chart**: Record fluid input and urine output at two-hour intervals.

- **Notifiable conditions**: If the six-hour sodium rise exceeds 6 mmol/litre, the 12-hour rise exceeds 8 mmol/litre, the 18-hour rise exceeds 10 mmol/litre, or urine output exceeds 200 ml/h for two consecutive hours, notify the clinical team in charge of tolvaptan therapy and intensify monitoring. Halt further correction by administering an intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% at a rate equal to urine output or, alternatively, administer desmopressin 2 μg as a stat dose intravenously and after eight hours.

- **Reversal of overly rapid correction**: If the sodium rise is even more pronounced, requiring reversal, there are two regimens for re-lowering serum sodium. The first involves administering an intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% at a rate of 6–10 ml/kg over two hours, rechecking serum sodium after two hours, and continuing the infusion until target serum sodium is reached. Alternatively, administer desmopressin 2 μg intravenously plus an intravenous infusion of dextrose 5% in water at a rate of 3–5 ml/kg over two hours, rechecking serum sodium after two hours, and continuing the infusion until the target sodium is reached if needed.

Following the first day after tolvaptan initiation, the preferred strategy for most patients, especially those receiving active treatment for the underlying etiology of SIAD, is daily evaluation and decision to offer stat doses on a day-to-day basis if and when required.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice. However, the management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with this syndrome are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the state of management of hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings. This includes which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia clinically diagnosed as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1,524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1,034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with a more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, identified via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters, was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^117PQvbh]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A systematic review of DDAVP in hyponatremia identified three different approaches: "proactive" DDAVP in high-risk patients in combination with hypertonic saline before any correction, which is not widely recommended as discussed in "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"; "reactive" in response to actual or anticipated above-target pNa increase; or "rescue" after pNa limits have been exceeded or on development of neurological symptoms. Although there have been no prospective comparisons, a follow-up retrospective study concluded that a reactive strategy to maintain pNa within the target range, if overcorrection is deemed likely, was best supported by their data.

In summary, relowering pNa with electrolyte-free water and/or DDAVP to achieve a safe net 24-hour correction is an important tool that may be required during the often delicate management of hyponatremia, to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance that is independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality due to osmotically induced cerebral edema, while excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can lead to severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose significant challenges in managing this disorder.

In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the "Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations", which defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Consequently, additional guidance was deemed necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts (including all the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia, based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115cSj3z]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SIADH, a condition characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. The criteria are primarily used to identify patients with hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, who may have SIADH as the underlying cause.

- **Essential criteria**: Effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg, absence of clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia, urine sodium concentration greater than 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake, absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, or renal insufficiency, and no recent use of diuretic agents.

- **Supplemental criteria**: Provide additional diagnostic support, including serum uric acid less than 0.24 mmol/L, serum urea less than 3.6 mmol/L, failure to correct hyponatremia after 0.9% saline infusion, fractional sodium excretion greater than 0.5%, fractional urea excretion greater than 55%, fractional uric acid excretion greater than 12%, and correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction.

The Diagnostic Criteria for SIADH is a comprehensive tool that incorporates a wide range of clinical and laboratory parameters, providing a structured approach to diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1117skm3]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, seven guidance documents recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Three guidance documents advocated concomitant salt restriction without clear dose recommendations and one advised avoiding hypotonic infusion solutions. Additionally, three proposed the use of loop diuretics, while three others generally stated the need to treat the underlying disease. One guideline suggested considering the cessation of diuretics. As a second-line treatment for refractory hyponatremia, one guideline proposed demeclocycline and two proposed vasopressin receptor antagonists, while another specifically recommended against the use of both demeclocycline and vasopressin receptor antagonists.

- **Targets and limits of speed of correction**: Key areas include targets and limits for the increase in serum sodium concentration.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline and is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and hyponatremia after spinal surgery [^111tY5vT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia caused by an inappropriately high level of antidiuretic hormone secretion after spinal surgery is an uncommon and self-limiting phenomenon that resolves within 2 or 3 weeks. During the early postoperative period, the patient's urine output and serum sodium levels should be monitored closely to prevent possible serious complications of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the hyponatremia and can range from mild headache, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting to convulsions, coma, and death. Treatment options include fluid restriction, oral intake of salt, and hypertonic saline. It is important that spine surgeons recognize this phenomenon early and treat it appropriately and conservatively to prevent possible serious complications.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1112hMeE]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A lower initial dose of tolvaptan, 7.5 mg, has become more widely prescribed in recent years as there is some evidence of lower overcorrection risk. In two small trials (each with 12 mmol/L in 24 hours), overcorrection rates were observed with the 7.5-mg dose. However, with the standard 15-mg dose, 13% to 40% of patients experienced overcorrection. It is important to note that the risk is not completely eliminated, as even an ultra-low dose of 3.75 mg did not prevent overcorrection greater than 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in a study of patients with acute postneurosurgical hyponatremia. Overcorrection rates above 30% were observed for both the 3.75 mg and 7.5 mg doses in this acute cohort.

Notably, these studies were not designed to determine the degree to which tolvaptan use, rather than autocorrection following resolution of reversible stimuli to AVP secretion, contributed to the overly rapid rise in pNa, as there was no placebo control group. The ultra-low dose of 3.75 mg is often impractical and inaccurate as it requires quartering a triangular tablet with formulations available in many markets. An alternative approach to achieve an even lower overall dose is to administer 7.5 mg every second day. However, there are no published data to support this strategy, and it does not reduce the risk of overcorrection with the initial dose. The potential for overcorrection upon initiation means that in our experience, tolvaptan is best prescribed as single doses, with ongoing therapy reviewed daily.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dV2Et]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Our recommendations about tolvaptan use revolve around individualizing the treatment of SIAD based on a benefit-risk analysis for each patient. Several individual factors must be considered, including the chronicity of hyponatraemia, the aetiology of SIAD, comorbidities, symptoms, and biochemical parameters.

- **Tolvaptan as main pharmacotherapy**: We advocate for the use of tolvaptan as the primary pharmacotherapy for SIAD due to its efficacy in correcting hyponatraemia. Although evidence supporting tolvaptan's improvement of hard clinical outcomes is currently lacking, this is true for all SIAD treatments. Therefore, clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis is necessary to determine if an individual is likely to benefit from increased serum sodium levels.

- **Regulatory approval and evidence basis**: Tolvaptan is the only treatment modality licensed for SIAD in the United States and Europe, having passed a stringent risk-benefit review by regulatory authorities based on high-quality evidence for efficacy and safety. Conversely, other agents are supported by low-quality data, primarily from retrospective uncontrolled studies and case series.

- **Concerns about rapid correction**: There are concerns regarding tolvaptan-related overly rapid hyponatraemia correction, as greater effectiveness can increase the risk of too-rapid correction. This risk can be substantially mitigated by ensuring rigorous monitoring at frequent intervals and implementing specific measures, when needed, to prevent or even reverse overly rapid correction.

### Tolvaptan for the management of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: Lessons learned in titration of dose [^113QnQQS]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To report a patient with idiopathic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) who developed profound aquaresis with symptomatic extracellular fluid depletion after initiation of therapy with tolvaptan, and who was later successfully treated with smaller doses of compounded tolvaptan to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium.

- **Methods**: Case report and review of the literature.

- **Results**: A 51-year-old woman was diagnosed with SIADH during admission for elective surgery resulting in multiple complications. The patient failed multiple therapies including fluid restriction, salt tablets, and demeclocycline. She was admitted to the hospital for initiation of tolvaptan therapy. After a 15-mg dose of tolvaptan, the patient had a rapid increase in urine output and symptomatic hypotension. Sodium levels corrected rapidly overnight from 126 mEq/L to 139 mEq/L. A lower dose of tolvaptan resulted in similar symptoms and sodium correction. Due to continuing symptoms of hyponatremia including headaches, nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias after reinitiation of fluid restriction and salt tablets, tolvaptan was compounded to continue to titrate at lower doses. The patient was then admitted and tolvaptan was initiated at a dose of 1.5 mg with no significant improvement in sodium levels. Tolvaptan was titrated to 3 mg, which resulted in correction of sodium to 129 mEq/L with no associated symptoms of hypovolemia.

- **Conclusions**: Tolvaptan should be initiated in an inpatient setting with close monitoring of serum sodium levels. In patients who are not able to tolerate…

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^116VRq9H]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the main regulating hormone of body fluid homeostasis. It is secreted from the posterior pituitary upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli, with the main osmotic stimulus being increased plasma osmolality and the main nonosmotic stimulus being hypovolemia. AVP promotes water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidney, thereby normalizing hypertonicity and vasomotor tone.

Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyperosmolar and hypoosmolar circumstances. The classical hyperosmolar disorder, characterized by a deficiency of body fluid relative to body solute, is diabetes insipidus. The most common hypoosmolar disorder, characterized by an excess of body fluid relative to body solute, is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Diabetes insipidus belongs to the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and is characterized by a high urinary output of more than 50 mL per kg body weight per 24 hours, accompanied by polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. After the exclusion of osmotic diuresis (such as hyperglycemia), the differential diagnosis of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome includes impaired AVP synthesis (central diabetes insipidus) or action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) as well as primary polydipsia.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the predominant cause of hyponatremia and is characterized by reduced free water excretion and secondary natriuresis, mostly due to imbalanced secretion of the antidiuretic hormone AVP.

Arginine vasopressin measurement could theoretically help guide the diagnosis and treatment of such disorders.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^111j3stj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and is often described in patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. In this report, we described both Castleman's disease and lymphoma coexisting in one patient with SIADH.

- **Case presentation**: A 70-year-old Chinese woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy had severe hyponatremia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Through a series of examinations, common causes such as pulmonary carcinoma were excluded. An abdominal mass was detected by computed tomography. Although the peripheral lymph node biopsy showed the pathological result as Castleman's disease, the pathology of the abdominal lymph node revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After chemotherapy, the hyponatremia was treated during a period of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This patient presented with the rare clinical condition of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion alongside Castleman's disease and lymphoma. Asymptomatic hyponatremia may persist for some time, suggesting that clinical physicians should pay attention to the mild cases of hyponatremia. We also hypothesized that Castleman's disease is a condition of pre-lymphoma with both having the ability to cause SIADH. The possibility of lymphoma as well as Castleman's disease triggering the development of SIADH should also be taken into consideration for conducting biopsies.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^113VBoKn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity, such as salt depletion, is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biological parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH.

In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70%) compared to salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, despite dilution.

In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; > 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0.5% in 70% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare.

Finally, the measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy. Patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH, it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and through laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear.

Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means such as fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, and demeclocycline, with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline being commonly used. Recently, vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy for SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction, and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff due to their efficiency and reliability; however, side effects include thirst, polydipsia, and frequency of urination.

In any therapy for chronic SIADH, it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter since higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 hours are critical for preventing an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: Treatment with tolvaptan [^117Wa7uo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia based on the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH) is observed in up to 15% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The electrolyte imbalance is associated with high morbidity and mortality and often delays appropriate treatment. Management of hyponatremia proved to be challenging until new vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists such as tolvaptan became available. This is the first report to present a prospective case series with an efficient management of hyponatremia, including tolvaptan in ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l).

- **Methods**: Ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH were followed after the onset of clinical symptoms of SIADH. Patients were selected based on histologically proven diagnosis of SCLC and the clinical picture of a neurocognitive deficit caused by SIADH-related hyponatremia. All patient data were monitored for clinical improvement based on ECOG status, commencement of chemotherapy, and correction of sodium levels.

- **Results**: The treatment followed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm and led to a rapid and efficient correction of both clinical symptoms and plasma sodium levels.

- **Conclusions**: Based on this algorithm, all patients started chemotherapy in time. Subsequently, the treatment with tolvaptan led to an improvement in the ECOG-performance status. In addition, all patients benefited from the effective management of SIADH, which omitted prolonged hospital stays and non-elective hospitalizations due to an unstable clinical condition caused by severe hyponatremia.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^114rePbs]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is caused by the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary gland and can cause hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, with an incidence as high as 30%. SIADH is generally seen in patients diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which was first described by Schwartz et al. in two patients with lung cancer.

SIADH is not difficult to diagnose in a clinical setting. It can be secondary to a variety of disorders, such as medications, malignancies, surgery, HIV infection, or be idiopathic. While SCLC is the primary malignancy causing SIADH, lymphoma can also induce this condition. In this report, the diagnosis of Castleman's disease was established before we suspected SIADH was caused by a malignancy. After extensive examinations, we made the final diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy treatment was recommended for the patient and significantly ameliorated the SIADH symptoms.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^112wNUbn]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

SIAD has been classified into a number of distinct pathophysiological categories based on the evaluation of AVP concentrations (Fig. 6). This classification was pioneered by Zerbe and colleagues, who measured AVP concentration before and after raising the serum osmolality with hypertonic saline in patients with SIAD, and identified four patterns of AVP response, known as types A to D. These phenotypes correlate with certain etiologies; however, whether the categories are clinically meaningful or simply a vehicle for better understanding pathophysiology is less clear.

- **Type A**: Refers to a persistently raised AVP concentration regardless of an increase in serum osmolality. This pattern occurs in the most common forms of SIAD due to ongoing "inappropriate" AVP secretion, either from the pituitary or a paraneoplastic source.

- **Type B**: Characterized by a lower osmotic threshold for AVP secretion ("reset osmostat"), with serum sodium typically maintained at a stable lower level of 125 to 135 mmol/L. In this pattern, AVP will still suppress at lower osmolarities than this (unless another interpathology occurs). This pattern may be more common in older age.

- **Type C and D**: Rarer patterns include type C, characterized by an abnormal AVP response only at low osmolalities, potentially due to dysfunction of inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus, and type D, in which AVP is undetectable. This could be due either to the secretion of an unidentified antidiuretic substance from tumor cells or, alternatively, a gain-of-function mutation in the V2 receptor (i.e. nephrogenic SIAD).

More recently, the same patterns have been shown for copeptin.

### Successful long-term treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with satavaptan (SR121463B), an orally active nonpeptide vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist [^115PfxJU]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). High credibility.

The effects of satavaptan (SR121463B), a novel long-acting orally active vasopressin V(2)-receptor antagonist, were investigated in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In the first part of this randomized, double-blind study, 34 patients were treated with satavaptan (versus placebo) for up to 5 days and then during a 23-day open-label dosage-adjustment period. In the second part of the study, the long-term efficacy and safety of satavaptan was assessed in an open-label trial lasting at least 12 months.

Mean (± SD) serum sodium (SNa) levels before treatment were 127 ± 2 mmol/L (placebo, n = 8), 125 ± 6 mmol/L (25 mg, n = 14), and 127 ± 5 mmol/L (50 mg, n = 12). Responders, defined as patients whose SNa levels normalized or increased by at least 5 mmol/L from baseline during the double-blind period, were 79% in the 25-mg group (SNa 136 ± 3 mmol/L; P = 0.006), 83% in the 50-mg group (SNa 140 ± 6 mmol/L; P = 0.005), and 13% in the placebo group (SNa 130 ± 5 mmol/L). No drug-related serious adverse events were recorded.

During the long-term treatment phase, 15 of 18 enrolled patients achieved 6 months of treatment, and 10 achieved 12 months. The SNa response was maintained during this time with good tolerance. The new oral vasopressin V(2)-receptor antagonist satavaptan adequately corrects mild or moderate hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and has a good safety profile.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^113GqJQ3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided by replacing urinary water losses or by stopping them with desmopressin (DDAVP). Alternatively, desmopressin can be given at the beginning of therapy and at regular intervals thereafter to keep the urine concentrated until the serum sodium has been gradually returned to near-normal levels by the administration of hypertonic saline, given as a slow continuous infusion or small titrated boluses. This technique, known as the "DDAVP clamp", has been reported to successfully meet correction goals; however, more data are needed comparing the technique to other therapeutic options.

Some experts have never accepted the term "osmotic demyelination syndrome", asserting that limits recommended by guidelines are too strict, potentially deterring physicians from providing life-saving therapy with hypertonic saline. They have maintained since the beginning of the controversy that neurologic complications from untreated or undertreated hyponatremia — such as seizures, respiratory arrests, and herniation — are more common than neurologic complications due to excessive therapy.

### Continuous versus bolus infusion of hypertonic saline in the treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia caused by SIAD [^117PCqqg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Acute hyponatremia is a medical emergency that confers high mortality, attributed primarily to cerebral edema. Expert guidelines advocate the use of intravenous boluses of hypertonic saline rather than traditional continuous infusion to achieve a faster initial rise in plasma sodium (pNa) concentration. However, there is a limited evidence base for this recommended policy change.

- **Methods**: We prospectively assessed the clinical and biochemical outcomes in patients treated for symptomatic hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis in response to intravenous bolus treatment with 3% saline (100 mL, repeated up to two more times) and compared the outcomes to retrospective data from patients treated with continuous intravenous infusion of low-dose (20 mL/h) 3% saline.

- **Results**: Twenty-two patients were treated with bolus infusion and 28 with continuous infusion. A 3% saline bolus caused a more rapid elevation of pNa at 6 hours [median (range) 6 (2 to 11) vs. 3 (1 to 4) mmol/L, P < 0.0001], with a concomitant improvement in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [median (range) 3 (1 to 6) vs. 1 (-2 to 2), P < 0.0001] at 6 hours. Median pNa concentration was similar at 24 hours in the two treatment groups. The administration of a third saline bolus was associated with a greater need for dextrose/dDAVP to prevent overcorrection (OR 24; P = 0.006). There were no cases of osmotic demyelination in either group.

- **Conclusion**: A 3% saline bolus produces a faster initial elevation of pNa than continuous infusion, with quicker restoration of GCS and without osmotic demyelination.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^114FMmfr]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Fluid restriction (FR) involves limiting intake of all liquids, not solely water. In patients prescribed an FR where there is difficulty adhering to the limit, a review of medications may reveal opportunities for substitution of therapy. Oral tablets that can be taken with a sip of water will require less fluid intake than formulations that are effervescent or dissolved in water, or intravenous preparations.

In patients with persistent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) not responding to FR, without other causes of hyponatremia or mimics of SIAD as listed earlier, and without severe symptoms necessitating hypertonic saline, the question regarding the choice of second-line therapy arises, especially for those with sodium below 125 mmol/L (according to regulatory approval thresholds and prescribing guidelines for second-line agents) or with nonsevere symptoms. As seen earlier and advocated in US guidelines, early second-line therapy may be considered in those with a lower likelihood of FR response, such as urine osmolality greater than 500 mOsm/kg/H₂O. Potential adverse effects of chronic hyponatremia (see "Chronic Hyponatremia") support the rationale for treatment, although at the time of writing, there has been no dedicated primary endpoint RCT that has unequivocally established that correcting mild to moderate hyponatremia leads to clinically important long-term health benefits.

- **Tolvaptan**: Tolvaptan is an oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist that blocks the action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the kidney, inducing a water diuresis (termed aquaresis to differentiate this from the effect of diuretics that induce a natriuresis) to raise plasma sodium.

### Suprasellar arachnoid cyst resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^113s5ykg]. Journal of Neurosurgery. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is occasionally seen after hypothalamic injury or dysfunction, although it typically occurs in association with other endocrine disturbances. It has never been described as a presenting feature of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst (SAC) in the pediatric population. The authors describe the case of an enlarging SAC resulting in SIADH as the only presenting feature, with an otherwise normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis. An SAC was diagnosed in utero in this 5-month-old girl who had a normal functioning hypothalamic-pituitary axis on presentation. Because of cyst enlargement and hydrocephalus, the patient was scheduled for surgery; however, preoperative labs revealed SIADH.

After stabilizing the serum sodium concentration with fluid restriction and the administration of 3% sodium chloride, the patient underwent endoscopic cyst fenestration. Postoperatively, she had complete resolution of the SIADH. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as the presenting symptom of an SAC has not been previously described. In the aforementioned patient, the proposed mechanism for SIADH was enlargement of the suprasellar arachnoid cyst causing compression of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, thus overstimulating the secretion of arginine vasopressin, which resulted in SIADH. The association of SIADH with an SAC is reportable, as is the resolution of the SIADH via cyst fenestration. The authors suggest that SIADH is an uncommon presenting feature of SACs and that syndrome resolution is possible with cyst fenestration.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dVYFV]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most frequent electrolyte abnormality encountered in hospital practice, is defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/liter and is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality. The most common cause is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Fluid restriction has been the mainstay treatment for SIAD in the last decades despite the limited evidence base supporting its use. The modest efficacy of fluid restriction in increasing serum sodium, noted in large observational studies, was also confirmed in the first and only prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), which reported a failure to respond in more than one-third of patients, highlighting the need for other therapies for SIAD.

Vaptans are non-peptide antagonists of arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors that have been shown to be useful for the treatment of hyponatremia by selectively increasing solute-free water excretion from the kidneys. Several vaptans have been developed and tested in humans, including tolvaptan, conivaptan, mozavaptan, lixivaptan, and satavaptan. However, the only vaptan that is currently licensed and available in Europe is tolvaptan. Its role in the treatment of SIAD has been disputed, and its place in therapeutic strategies remains unclear. This review summarizes the state of knowledge on the use of tolvaptan for hyponatremia due to SIAD, exploring its effectiveness and safety. It also attempts to define its place in the treatment armamentarium of SIAD and to form a protocol for its optimal use in clinical practice.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111af2Rz]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), approved for the treatment of diabetes and heart failure, may be beneficial in patients with SIAD. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) located in the proximal renal tubule is responsible for 90% of renal glucose resorption and 65% of sodium resorption. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glycosuria, accompanied by osmotic diuresis. Due to the increased free water excretion, SGLT2is have been investigated as a novel therapy in SIAD.

A randomized trial involving 87 inpatients with SIAD compared 4 days of treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo, in addition to 1000-mL fluid restriction (FR), in patients with a mean baseline plasma sodium (pNa) level of 125.5 mmol/L. The pNa increased by 10 mmol/L over 4 days in the empagliflozin plus FR group, compared to 7 mmol/L with placebo and FR (P = .04). Comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 14% of participants, with an equal distribution between the empagliflozin and placebo arms. Overcorrection of pNa occurred in two patients in the empagliflozin group (5%), compared to one patient in the placebo group. The only other potentially related adverse event was decreased renal function in 7% of empagliflozin participants, which subsequently resolved. No hypotension or hypoglycemia was observed.

The relatively high sodium increment in the placebo group (i.e. FR alone) suggests that, in some patients, reversible stimuli to arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion may have been present. It is worth noting that the causes of SIAD were unbalanced between the two groups, which may have affected the rates of autocorrection. However, the higher rate of malignancy (a nonreversible stimulus) in the SGLT2i group would, if anything, be expected to bias the response.

He was subsequently admitted for acute severe hyponatremia due to SIADH. His sodium was slowly corrected with hypertonic saline, aiming for an increase of 6–8 mEq/L per day, and he was also placed on fluid restriction, allowing less than 2 L of free water daily. His symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and dizziness, improved by the next day as his serum sodium levels began to normalize. All symptoms resolved by the second day of hospitalization. His hospitalization lasted for 2 days, and he was discharged with a serum sodium level of 130 mEq/L. He was counseled to maintain a 2 L per day fluid restriction and advised to have close follow-up with his primary care physician for repeat labs. On follow-up labs 2 days after his hospital discharge, his sodium remained within normal limits, and his fluid restriction was lifted.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115TyEPt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The role of tolvaptan in the management of SIAD is noteworthy. With the exception of the European guidelines, all other published recommendations and consensus statements recommend tolvaptan as a second-line treatment option for SIAD in patients who do not respond to fluid restriction. Tolvaptan may also be used as a first-line agent in SIAD patients who are unlikely to respond to fluid restriction due to very limited renal excretion of solute-free water.

Data do not support the use of tolvaptan in patients with severe symptoms of hyponatremia. Mechanistically, tolvaptan offers an elegant and attractive treatment option for euvolemic hyponatremia since it specifically reverses its pathophysiologic derangement. However, clinicians must rely on good judgment rather than unequivocal evidence to decide which patients with hyponatremia should be given tolvaptan. This is because the landmark SALT and SALTWATER studies have provided high-quality evidence that tolvaptan is effective in correcting hyponatremia, but they were not designed or powered enough to assess improvement in symptoms or survival. This raises the key unanswered question of whether treatment of hyponatremia can improve hard endpoints.

Since the key question of whether tolvaptan can improve patient-related clinical outcomes has not been answered, tolvaptan cannot comprise the mainstay of therapy for SIAD. There is also considerable uncertainty as to which symptoms and what degree of severity of hyponatremia should be considered indications for tolvaptan treatment.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111kpjaA]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Two recent studies have compared bolus versus slow infusion of hypertonic saline, and both reported results in favor of a bolus regimen. An Irish observational study compared outcomes for 22 hyponatremic patients (mean baseline pNa 120 mmol/L) treated with bolus 100 mL 3% NaCl, up to three doses, against a historical cohort of 28 patients managed with a relatively slow 20 mL/hour 3% NaCl infusion. Bolus hypertonic saline was associated with a faster elevation of serum sodium at 6 hours (median increase 6 mmol/L versus 3 mmol/L with infusion; P < 0.0001), and significantly greater improvement in GCS at 6 hours (median improvement 3 points versus 1 point; P < 0.0001), though with a greater need for reversal with IV dextrose and/or desmopressin, which occurred for 5 of 22 bolus patients (23%) versus none of the infusion patients (P = .008). There were no cases of ODS in either group, and pNa was similar at 24 hours. The non-randomized and retrospective data for the control group limits the comparison, but the authors concluded that the faster neurological improvement with bolus therapy supports this regimen.

A larger randomized trial from Korea (SALSA) allocated 178 patients with hyponatremia and pNa less than 125 mmol/L (mean pNa 118 mmol/L) to either bolus NaCl 3% (2 mL/kg, or 100 mL if weight unknown; repeated if persistent symptoms or insufficient pNa increment) or continuous infusion (0.5–1 mL/kg/h, titrated to aim for pNa increment 5–9 mmol/24 hours — a higher initial rate than the Irish historical cohort). They concluded that both therapies were effective and safe, with no statistically significant differences in outcomes observed.

**In case of overcorrection: Relowering of plasma sodium**: Overcorrection of serum sodium can occur as a consequence of any sodium-raising intervention, or may occur spontaneously with the resolution of a reversible stimulus for AVP secretion or cessation of excessive water input, and subsequent aquaresis. There is no evidence that spontaneous overcorrection of chronic (> 48 h) hyponatremia is any safer than iatrogenic overcorrection. To maintain the rate of correction within the target range, "relowering" of serum sodium can be achieved with administration of hypotonic fluid, with or without iatrogenic AVP therapy (desmopressin, DDAVP) to suspend urine output (see Figures 8 and 10), and of course ceasing any active sodium-increasing therapy. Because the symptoms of ODS are delayed by several days, relowering remains essential for patients who are asymptomatic — but may also improve symptoms and outcomes for those with early clinical ODS.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone following high dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: a case report [^1123m7BH]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

SIADH can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with certain malignancies, most commonly small cell carcinoma. Small cell carcinoma, a neuroendocrine tumor, is most commonly diagnosed in the lung; however, this histology is occasionally seen in the prostate. There have been some reports of SIADH diagnosed in small cell prostate cancer patients, as well as in patients with adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features, unrelated to brachytherapy. In our case, the patient had adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation, suggesting an etiology other than the histology of his malignancy.

Timely and accurate recognition of SIADH-induced hyponatremia is crucial, as it is a potentially permanent and life-threatening condition and often not managed adequately. Delay in diagnosis can result in longer hospital stays and, in some instances, higher morbidity and mortality. In some instances, SIADH-induced hyponatremia can be worsened by the presence of polydipsia, which is a consequence of the release of ADH under normal physiological conditions. Ways to prevent the development of hyponatremia in the case of SIADH involve adequate monitoring of fluid intake and output for early diagnosis and intervention. This includes tracking fluid intake post-operatively, identifying polydipsia, and early limitation of fluid intake. In addition to fluid restriction, another step in the management of SIADH includes the intravenous administration of hypertonic fluids, such as a 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution. Isotonic fluids, such as normal saline, should be avoided.

- **Evaluate the effect of treatment**: The impact of hyponatremia treatment on patient outcomes with SIAD should be assessed.

- **Comparison of treatment methods**: Bolus hypertonic 3% NaCl treatment in both fixed doses and weight-adapted doses should be compared. Followed by an evaluation of fluid restriction (FR) and other treatment options.

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: Conduct RCTs to assess the efficacy and safety of urea and SGLT2 inhibitors. Different second-line therapies, such as tolvaptan, urea, and SGLT2 inhibitors, should also be compared.

- **Therapeutic approaches to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)**: Investigate therapeutic strategies aimed at ODS.

- **Implementation of standardized pathways**: RCTs should determine if implementing standardized diagnostics and treatment pathways can improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients.

### Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in Sweden [^115RqkA8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia (HN) is the most common electrolyte disturbance in clinical practice, occurring in approximately 15–30% of hospitalised patients. It is commonly defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) < 135 mmol/L, with severe HN defined as < 125 mmol/L. Hyponatraemia is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay.

Hyponatraemia can be euvolaemic (i.e. without an associated change in body fluid volume), hypervolaemic (i.e. body fluid volume is increased), or hypovolaemic (i.e. body fluid volume is decreased). These three types of HN have different sets of possible aetiologies. The most common cause of euvolaemic HN is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is the focus of our analysis. In SIADH, water retention is caused by inappropriate increased release of or responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This can be due to malignancy, pneumonia, central nervous system disorders, or certain drugs. Although SIADH can be associated with many different types of malignancy, it is most commonly observed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and studies have shown a higher mortality rate in SCLC patients with HN than in those without. Drug-induced SIADH usually resolves upon discontinuation of the medication.

Swedish guidelines for HN, published by the Swedish Endocrine Society and the Swedish Association for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, recommend resolution of the underlying condition as the primary treatment strategy in patients with SIADH. If symptoms are mild, HN secondary to SIADH may be managed by addressing the underlying condition.

### Zyvox [^115GEEFh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)**: Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been observed in patients treated with linezolid. In reported cases, the signs and symptoms included confusion, somnolence, generalized weakness, and, in severe cases, led to respiratory failure and even death. Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly, in patients taking diuretics, and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH while taking Zyvox. If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia and/or SIADH occur, discontinue Zyvox and institute appropriate supportive measures.

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zyvox for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 5 mL of the 100 mg/5 mL oral suspension contains 20 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Zyvox for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Zyvox for oral suspension. The other Zyvox formulations do not contain phenylalanine.

- **Development of drug-resistant bacteria**: Prescribing Zyvox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Cerebral salt wasting versus SIADH: what difference [^112yF7YH]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The term cerebral salt wasting (CSW) was introduced before the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) was described in 1957. Subsequently, CSW virtually vanished, only to reappear a quarter-century later in the neurosurgical literature. A valid diagnosis of CSW requires evidence of inappropriate urinary salt losses and reduced "effective arterial blood volume". With no gold standard, the reported measures of volume depletion do not stand scrutiny. We cannot tell the difference between CSW and SIADH. Furthermore, the distinction does not make a difference; regardless of volume status, hyponatremia complicating intracranial disease should be treated with hypertonic saline.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can result in severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including the identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### A copeptin-based classification of the osmoregulatory defects in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^1121QQXQ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most frequent electrolyte disorder, is caused predominantly by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). A comprehensive characterization of SIAD subtypes, defined by the type of osmotic dysregulation, is lacking, but may aid in predicting therapeutic success. In this study, we analyzed serial measurements of serum osmolality and serum sodium, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), and plasma copeptin concentrations from 50 patients with hyponatremia who underwent hypertonic saline infusion. A close correlation between copeptin concentrations and serum osmolality existed in 68 healthy controls, with a mean osmotic threshold ± SD of 282 ± 4 mOsM/kg H2O. Furthermore, saline-induced changes in copeptin concentrations correlated with changes in AVP concentrations in both controls and patients.

Using copeptin concentration as a surrogate measure of AVP concentration, patients with SIAD were grouped according to osmoregulatory defect. Ten percent of patients had grossly elevated copeptin concentrations independent of serum osmolality (Type A). Fourteen percent had copeptin concentrations that increased linearly with rising serum osmolality but had abnormally low osmotic thresholds (Type B). Forty-four percent had normal copeptin concentrations independent of osmolality (Type C), and twelve percent had suppressed copeptin concentrations independent of osmolality (Type D). A novel SIAD subtype discovered in 20% of patients was characterized by a linear decrease in copeptin concentrations with increasing serum osmolality (Type E, or "barostat reset"). In conclusion, a partial or complete loss of AVP osmoregulation was observed.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^114HvXRh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), the most common cause of hyponatremia, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, leads through aquaresis to an increase in serum sodium concentration and is the only medication licensed in Europe for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia. Randomized controlled trials have shown that tolvaptan is highly efficacious in correcting SIAD-related hyponatremia. Real-world data have confirmed the marked efficacy of tolvaptan, but they have also reported a high risk of overly rapid sodium increase in patients with very low baseline serum sodium.

- **Efficacy and safety**: The lower the baseline serum sodium, the higher the tolvaptan-induced correction rate occurs. Therefore, a lower starting tolvaptan dose of 7.5 mg has been evaluated in small cohort studies, demonstrating its efficacy. However, it still remains unclear whether it can reduce the risk of overcorrection.

- **Guideline recommendations**: Most international guidelines, except for the European ones, recommend tolvaptan as a second-line treatment for SIAD after fluid restriction. However, the risk of unduly rapid sodium correction combined with its high cost has limited its routine use.

Prospective controlled studies are warranted to evaluate whether tolvaptan-induced sodium increase can improve patient-related clinical outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay in the acute setting, or neurocognitive symptoms and quality of life in the chronic setting. In addition, the potential role of a low tolvaptan starting dose needs further exploration.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: Indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^114fEmSn]. Pituitary (2019). Low credibility.

Transient syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) may occur within the first 3–7 days postoperatively, with an incidence ranging from 4 to 20%. Transient SIADH is due to iatrogenic manipulation of the posterior pituitary gland, resulting in excessive antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release. In rare cases, it may result in severe, life-threatening, acute hyponatremia.

Treatment strategies include fluid restriction, hypertonic saline administration, or vasopressin two receptor antagonist treatment. It is important to avoid excessive administration of intravenous fluids in the postoperative period. Prophylactic fluid restriction is recommended by some during the first 10 days after surgery to reduce the frequency of SIADH or minimize the degree of hyponatremia due to SIADH.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is not uncommon in patients receiving treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine. This case report discusses a 47-year-old man with depression who developed hyponatremia after commencing treatment with desvenlafaxine. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which desvenlafaxine-associated SIADH was reported since the introduction of the drug. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of desvenlafaxine-associated hyponatremia in patients under the age of 65.

### Urea as safe treatment for hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone in infant with solitary central incisor and neurofibromatosis-1 [^115kygab]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Classic treatment for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is fluid restriction. However, this is not ideal for infants who need large fluid volumes to ensure adequate caloric intake for growth. The use of urea has not been thoroughly studied in children.

- **Case presentation**: This infant had SIADH complicated by poor growth, solitary central incisor, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Following failed attempts to correct hyponatremia with fluid restriction and other therapeutics, urea normalized sodium levels and allowed liberalization of formula volumes, which resulted in improved weight gain.

- **Conclusions**: Urea is a safe, cost-effective, long-term treatment for SIADH in infants who are unable to fluid restrict due to caloric goals.

### Urea to treat hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aNjKF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Use of urea to treat hyponatremia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has not been universally adopted due to questions about effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addresses these questions.

- **Study design**: This PRISMA-guided study examined published research across four electronic databases.

- **Study populations**: Patients with SIADH-related hyponatremia were included.

- **Selection criteria**: Clinical trials and observational studies reporting at least one outcome related to serum sodium concentration, symptom resolution, or adverse effects after oral or nasogastric urea administration were considered.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers using a standardized form recording study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and treatment outcomes.

- **Analytical approach**: A meta-analysis was conducted using the restricted maximum likelihood method for the random effects model to assess the effect of urea treatment on serum sodium and serum urea compared with other treatment modalities. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on treatment duration and SIADH severity.

- **Results**: Urea treatment significantly increased serum sodium (mean difference [MD], 9.08 [95% CI, 7.64–10.52], P < 0.01) and urea (MD, 31.66 [95% CI, 16.05–47.26], P < 0.01) in patients with SIADH, albeit with significantly high heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on the treatment duration showed a significant rise in the serum sodium level after 24 hours.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^114dm6hA]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

While some preclinical evidence suggests that sex steroids may modulate the secretion of AVP, there is no consistent effect of sex on hyponatremia rates. Some studies report a slight male predominance, others a female predominance, and some no effect.

In population-based studies, SIAD is the most commonly attributed cause of hyponatremia, accounting for 35% to 40% of cases. However, most retrospective studies aimed at determining the etiology of hyponatremia are limited by incomplete diagnostic workups. Notably, a multicenter registry found that less than 50% of 3087 patients with hyponatremia had all appropriate investigations performed.

A prospective study of 121 consecutive inpatients with pNa less than 130 mmol/L at a single hospital in Germany, assessed by a senior endocrinologist using a rigorous diagnostic protocol, determined the following distribution of causes: 35% had SIAD, 32% hypovolemia, 20% hypervolemia (heart failure, cirrhosis, angioedema), 7% thiazide-induced hyponatremia, 4% primary polydipsia, and 2% adrenal insufficiency.

Another prospective study at a tertiary neurosurgical referral center in Ireland examined 1323 patients admitted with pNa less than or equal to 130 mmol/L. Initially, 573 (43.4%) of these patients were classified as having SIAD. However, after further investigation, 22 of these patients (3.8%) were reclassified to adrenal insufficiency.
