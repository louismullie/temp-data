## Question

Prescription to increase milk supply breastfeeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prescribing to increase breast milk supply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true low milk supply and excluding modifiable causes. Then, I should verify what nonpharmacologic measures must be optimized before any medication. Next, I will review the evidence for galactagogues, especially domperidone and metoclopramide, including efficacy, safety, and regulatory status. After that, I need to check dosing, duration, and monitoring if a galactagogue is used. Finally, I should consider special populations, documentation, and follow-up, and close with a concise, risk–benefit summary and practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of low milk supply and rule out modifiable contributors, because medication will not help if the problem is latch, ineffective milk removal, or maternal/infant illness; I need to check infant growth, stool/urine output, and feeding frequency, and I should screen for retained placental fragments, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, and medications that suppress lactation such as pseudoephedrine, estrogen-containing contraceptives, and dopamine agonists like bromocriptine or aripiprazole, since these can reduce supply and must be addressed first [^114LEW4n] [^113GvFob] [^114n2DKP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting a galactagogue; I should verify that nonpharmacologic management has been optimized, including frequent and effective milk removal (breastfeeding or pumping at least 8–12 times per day), ensuring correct latch and positioning, using hands-on techniques, and instituting a structured pumping plan for pump-dependent mothers, because supply is driven primarily by adequate drainage and autocrine control rather than serum prolactin once lactation is established [^113GvFob] [^116dpNM3] [^114JQSMF].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for pharmacologic galactagogues; domperidone has the most consistent signal for increasing milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, with randomized trials and meta-analyses showing modest increases around 80–100 mL/day, whereas metoclopramide shows mixed or nonsignificant effects and carries higher maternal CNS risks, and herbal galactagogues have very low-certainty evidence and quality concerns, so I need to be cautious about recommending them outside of research or exceptional circumstances [^113xchxz] [^115QtGsZ] [^112YFn9M] [^111X4S6H].

> Wait, let me verify regulatory and safety issues before naming a drug; domperidone is not FDA-approved for lactation enhancement in the United States and carries warnings for QT prolongation and torsades, with an FDA import alert, so use should be exceptional, risk–benefit justified, and coordinated with cardiology if indicated, while metoclopramide has an FDA boxed warning for tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal effects, limiting its role to short courses when benefits clearly outweigh risks and alternatives are unsuitable [^117H38Dc] [^112YFn9M].

> I will now examine dosing and duration if domperidone is used off-label after nonpharmacologic measures fail; typical trial regimens use 10 mg orally three times daily for 7–14 days, with some protocols extending to 28 days, and I should start at the lowest effective dose, reassess at 7–14 days, and taper rather than stop abruptly if effective, while monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects; I need to ensure ECG screening in patients with cardiac risk factors and avoid interacting drugs that prolong QT [^112YFn9M] [^113uFTMR] [^113xchxz].

> Let me consider special populations; mothers of preterm infants are the group with the most consistent benefit signal for domperidone, yet even there, longer-term breastfeeding continuation is uncertain and may hinge on sustained lactation support rather than the drug itself, so I should coordinate with NICU lactation teams and set expectations accordingly; for mothers of term infants, evidence is limited and heterogeneous, so I should be more conservative and prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies; for those with prior breast surgery, primary glandular insufficiency, or endocrine disorders, I should confirm the diagnosis and counsel that galactagogues may be less effective, and I should avoid dopamine agonists like bromocriptine or cabergoline unless the goal is lactation suppression, not augmentation [^113JPQVR] [^113GvFob] [^115bq9Cy].

> I need to ensure shared decision-making and documentation; I should discuss uncertain long-term infant outcomes, potential maternal adverse effects, and the need for close follow-up, and I will document the indication, informed consent, dosing plan, and monitoring strategy; I should also coordinate with the infant's pediatrician and, when possible, a lactation consultant to track maternal response, infant growth, and any adverse events during therapy [^113uFTMR] [^117LA1sH] [^113JPQVR].

> But wait, what if the mother is already on a medication that suppresses lactation; I should double-check the medication list for pseudoephedrine, estrogen-containing contraceptives, high-dose nicotine, and dopamine-active agents like aripiprazole, and if present, I should consider switching to safer alternatives when feasible because these can meaningfully reduce supply and undermine galactagogue therapy [^114LEW4n] [^116oSdKp] [^114n2DKP].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line; after confirming true low supply and optimizing milk removal, a cautious, time-limited trial of domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 7–14 days, with reassessment and taper if effective, is reasonable in select cases, particularly for mothers of preterm infants, provided there is informed consent, cardiac risk screening, and coordination with lactation support; metoclopramide may be considered only when domperidone is unavailable or contraindicated and for the shortest duration possible due to neurologic risks, and herbal galactagogues should generally be avoided outside of research given quality and safety concerns [^113JPQVR] [^112YFn9M] [^115QtGsZ] [^111X4S6H].

---

Domperidone is the **most effective prescription galactagogue** [^115QtGsZ] for increasing milk supply, with evidence showing a modest increase of about 90–100 mL/day in mothers of preterm infants [^113xchxz] [^115QtGsZ]. It is not FDA-approved in the US due to rare but serious cardiac arrhythmias [^117H38Dc]; use is off-label and requires ECG screening and careful monitoring. Metoclopramide is an alternative [^112YFn9M] but is less effective and carries risks of CNS side effects, including tardive dyskinesia [^11743Xk7]. Nonpharmacologic measures (frequent feeding, pumping, latch support) should be optimized before prescribing any galactagogue [^113GvFob] [^113JPQVR].

## Pharmacological galactagogues

Key characteristics of domperidone and metoclopramide:

| **Aspect** | **Domperidone** | **Metoclopramide** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist that increases prolactin and milk production [^111j5Qzy] [^112QhXSv] | Dopamine antagonist that increases prolactin [^notfound] |
| Evidence of efficacy | RCTs and meta-analyses show a modest increase in milk volume (~90–100 mL/day) in mothers of preterm infants [^113xchxz] [^112U9yjE] [^115QtGsZ] | Mixed; some studies show modest benefit, others none [^112YFn9M] [^11743Xk7] |
| Safety considerations | Not FDA-approved in the US; rare QT prolongation and torsades de pointes reported [^117H38Dc]; use requires ECG screening and caution with CYP3A4 inhibitors | CNS side effects (anxiety, depression, extrapyramidal symptoms) and rare tardive dyskinesia; limit use to short courses [^112YFn9M] |
| Regulatory status | Off-label in the US; approved in some countries for GI indications | FDA-approved for GI indications; off-label for lactation |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line management**: Optimize breastfeeding technique, frequency, and milk removal before medications [^113GvFob] [^113JPQVR].

- **Indications for pharmacological therapy**: Consider only after nonpharmacologic measures fail and supply remains inadequate [^113GvFob] [^113JPQVR].

- **Monitoring**: Track maternal and infant outcomes, including side effects and growth [^113uFTMR].

---

## Nonpharmacological interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are foundational and should be **optimized before prescribing**:

- **Frequent feeding/pumping**: 8–12 times/day; empty breasts to maintain supply [^113GvFob].

- **Latch and positioning**: Correct technique improves milk transfer [^notfound].

- **Maternal factors**: Address anxiety, fatigue, and stress; ensure adequate nutrition and hydration [^113GvFob].

- **Lactation support**: Consult lactation specialists for individualized plans [^1138DgR3].

## Risks and benefits of pharmacological galactagogues

| **Medication** | **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|
| Domperidone | - Modest increase in milk volume <br/> - Minimal infant exposure | - QT prolongation <br/> - Torsades de pointes <br/> - Off-label in US |
| Metoclopramide | - Modest benefit in some studies <br/> - FDA-approved for GI use | - CNS side effects <br/> - Tardive dyskinesia <br/> - Limited efficacy |

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Counsel patients on **limited efficacy**, potential risks, and the need for close monitoring [^notfound]. Use shared decision-making to align treatment with patient preferences and clinical context [^116hGsdb].

---

Domperidone is the **most effective option** for increasing milk supply, but it is off-label in the US and requires cardiac screening; metoclopramide is less effective and has higher CNS risks. Nonpharmacologic measures should be optimized before prescribing any galactagogue [^113GvFob].

### Drugs in lactation [^114UM8xV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication management in lactation is a challenging topic for healthcare practitioners around the world. In contrast to traditional advice, very few medications are now thought to be absolutely contraindicated in breastfeeding. As data from case reports, quantitative studies of medication transfer to milk, and lactation physiology accumulate, fact-based guidance for use of medications can be increasingly provided. This review presents the strengths and weaknesses of current scientific knowledge underlying recommendations for use of medications during breastfeeding, describes key pharmacokinetic factors influencing infant drug exposure in breastmilk, and provides a practical algorithm and case study on use of clinical resources as well as pharmacologic data to help in development of a management plan for lactating individuals with various medication needs.

### Medications in the breast-feeding mother [^1161CZrc]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Prescribing medications for a breast-feeding mother requires weighing the benefits of medication use for the mother against the risk of not breast-feeding the infant or the potential risk of exposing the infant to medications. A drug that is safe for use during pregnancy may not be safe for the nursing infant. The transfer of medications into breast milk depends on a concentration gradient that allows passive diffusion of nonionized, non-protein-bound drugs. The infant's medication exposure can be limited by prescribing medications to the breast-feeding mother that are poorly absorbed orally, by avoiding breast-feeding during times of peak maternal serum drug concentration and by prescribing topical therapy when possible. Mothers of premature or otherwise compromised infants may require altered dosing to avoid drug accumulation and toxicity in these infants. The most accurate and up-to-date sources of information, including Internet resources and telephone consultations, should be used.

### Medications in pregnancy and lactation [^112a3bdK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

### Transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk [^115t7NuB]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics places emphasis on increasing breastfeeding in the United States. A common reason for the cessation of breastfeeding is the use of medication by the nursing mother and advice by her physician to stop nursing. Such advice may not be warranted. This statement is intended to supply the pediatrician, obstetrician, and family physician with data, if known, concerning the excretion of drugs into human milk. Most drugs likely to be prescribed to the nursing mother should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. This information is important not only to protect nursing infants from untoward effects of maternal medication but also to allow effective pharmacologic treatment of breastfeeding mothers. Nicotine, psychotropic drugs, and silicone implants are 3 important topics reviewed in this statement.

### Medication safety in breastfeeding [^112G4tmg]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding is universally recognized as the preferred method of infant nutrition, but is sometimes abbreviated because of fear of harm to the infant from maternal medication. The amount of medication that enters breast milk varies based on the maternal serum concentration and the pharmacologic properties of the medication. When prescribing medications for a breastfeeding patient, those with the lowest risk to the infant should be selected, and dosing should be before the infant's longest sleep interval. Prescribers should use current, accurate resources. LactMed is a convenient, government-sponsored, authoritative resource that lists safety information for many medications and is available free online. When mental health conditions occur during lactation, priority should be given to effectively treating the mother, often with medications that were effective during pregnancy. Most antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding. Stimulant medications may decrease milk supply. Insulin, metformin, and second-generation sulfonylureas are generally preferred to treat diabetes mellitus during breastfeeding, but newer agents require caution because they have not been studied in lactation. Inhaled and nasal treatments for asthma and allergic rhinitis are unlikely to affect breastfed infants. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are preferred analgesics during lactation. Maternal opioid use can cause infant sedation. Herbal supplements are concerning for risk of impurities and lack of study of effects on breastfed infants. Nonhormonal and progestin-only contraceptives are preferred over combination oral contraceptives. Contrast for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is not concerning during lactation, but use of radiopharmaceuticals, such as iodine 131, can accumulate in the lactating breast and increase risk to the infant.

### Medications for increasing milk supply in mothers expressing breastmilk for their preterm hospitalised infants [^113xchxz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Breastmilk remains the optimal form of enteral nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age. Mothers of preterm infants who have not established suck feeds must express their breastmilk and often have difficulty in maintaining sufficient volume for their infants' needs (Donath 2008). In preterm infants, donor breastmilk reduced the occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, when compared with formula feeds (McGuire 2003). Also, case-control studies have suggested that breastmilk is associated with an improvement in feeding tolerance, a reduction in significant gastrointestinal infective events (Beeby 1992) and a reduction in late-onset sepsis (Schanler 1999) when compared with formula feeds in preterm hospitalised infants.

Objectives

To assess the effect of medication given for at least seven days to mothers of preterm infants whose breastmilk is insufficient for their infants' needs on the outcomes of expressed milk volume and duration of breastfeeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of breastmilk-augmenting medications (compared with placebo or with other augmenting medications) in mothers with preterm hospitalised infants whose breastmilk volumes failed to meet their infants' requirements. We did not include trials with a cluster-randomised or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Two trials (involving 59 mothers) that examined the use of domperidone in a total of 59 mother-infant pairs met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of these trials showed a modest increase in expressed breastmilk (EBM) of 99.49 mL/day (95% confidence intervals -1.94 to 200.92; random-effects, T² 3511.62, I² 63%) in mothers given domperidone. Both trials gave the same dose of domperidone (10 mg three times per day) with a duration of seven days in the smaller trial and 14 days in the larger. Neither trial showed significant improvements in longer-term outcomes of breastfeeding in a preterm population and no adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Two studies with a total of 59 mothers suggest modest improvements in short-term EBM volumes when a medication is used after insufficient EBM occurs in mothers following preterm delivery. In both studies, the medication was commenced ≧14 days post delivery and following insufficient EBM supply with other lactation supports. Currently, no studies support prophylactic use of a galactagogue medication at any gestation. Use of any galactagogue medication has only been examined at more than 14 days post delivery and after full lactation support has been given. Further trials should examine larger groups of preterm mothers and consider breastfeeding outcomes over a longer period.

### Medication use during lactation: either a potential contributor to premature weaning or evidence-based support of the mother / child couplet [^116hGsdb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is well established that breastfeeding improves the health of women, children, and populations. According to the 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report Card, 83% of women initiated breastfeeding, but only 58% maintained breastfeeding at the 6-month mark, and 36% continued to 12 months. Reasons for cessation of breastfeeding are multifactorial and include issues surrounding safe use of medications while breastfeeding for acute or chronic conditions. There are a wide variety of resources that clinicians may consult to help decide if medications are compatible with breastfeeding. The resources have varying data and recommendations, which can make counseling challenging for the clinician. There are some resources that are updated regularly with the most current information about drug safety in lactation, as well as call centers that can answer questions from clinicians and patients. A case scenario is presented to help illustrate the many facets of how medication use can affect breastfeeding. Very few medications are absolutely contraindicated during lactation. Involving the woman and her family in a shared decision-making approach regarding medication use may help women feel more confident in the medication recommendations given and ultimately help women achieve their breastfeeding goals.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^112h8qxn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Professional entities including SMFM, ACOG, and AAP strongly advocate that women breast-feed their infants because of its numerous maternal and neonatal health benefits. Breast-feeding rates have increased approximately 2% per year between 1996 and 2001. Stultz et al studied 46 women who provided medication history during their pregnancy and while they breast-fed their infants. In this cohort, there was a significant increase in both prescription and OTC medication use during lactation compared with when they were pregnant. More than 70% of women were taking medications that were potentially unsafe, or had unknown safety profiles. Anderson et al evaluated 100 articles between 1966 and 2002 to examine possible adverse outcomes in neonates due to their exposure to maternal medication(s) during breast-feeding. These authors reported that 47% of adverse outcomes in the neonates as "possibly" linked to medication exposure during breast-feeding; 53% as "probably" linked and no infant-related deaths were associated with medications. However, there is little research focusing on understanding the quantity of medication and their chemical effects on neonates during breast-feeding.

Only 5% of the 213 new pharmaceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2012 contained human data in their pregnancy section; almost one-half did not have any safety information concerning the medication use for lactating women. Because of the lack of studies on specific drugs in pregnancy and lactation, the efficacy and dosing data are generally extrapolated from studies from adult subjects (men and nonpregnant women) and safety data are collated from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance. Such data often come from the use of pregnancy-exposure registries that, while useful, are greatly limited by inherent design biases.

During the workshop, the expert panel focused on the "current" state of practice and reviewed available data on select drugs in pregnancy. The group discussed what providers optimally should know about the pharmacokinetics of drugs particularly given the physiologic changes that occur in the course of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the time of greatest vulnerability in terms of drug effects on the fetus and newborn. There was evidence presented about the interaction of drugs and breast milk, indicating that some assumptions could be made about the efficiency with which certain drugs may cross into breast milk and potentially pose further exposure risks to the neonate. Potential lessons learned from the pediatric experience with enrolling children in drug trials to enhance knowledge in this unique population and the robust safety systems in place to monitor vaccines were reviewed. The presentations and discussions from the 2-day workshop are summarized here.

### Is maternal opioid use hazardous to breast-fed infants? [^113CnT6s]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades, the rate of breastfeeding has increased steadily in the developed countries of the world. During this time, opioid use in the general population has steadily increased as well. Despite this, clinicians remain unclear whether opioid use is safe during breastfeeding. While the vast majority of medications used during breastfeeding occur without incident, case reports and studies have reported possible opioid toxicity in breast-fed infants. Multiple enzymes are involved in the metabolism of opioids. CYP2D6 catabolizes O-demethylation of codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone to more potent metabolites. CYP3A4 inactivates methadone, meperidine, and buprenorphine. Glucoronide conjugation by the UGT enzyme family inactivates morphine and hydromorphone. Genetic polymorphisms and interfering medications affect the maternal metabolism, which in turn determines the exposure and risk to the breast-fed neonate. We review the production of breast milk, the transfer of xenobiotics from blood to milk, the characteristics that alter xenobiotic breast-milk concentrations, and we review the evidence of specific common opioids and infant toxicity. The short-term maternal use of prescription opioids is usually safe and infrequently presents a hazard to the newborn.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^113JPQVR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — use of galactogogues in lactation management advises that in the absence of evidence for low milk supply, the mother should be reassured, and when intervention is indicated, modifiable factors such as maternal anxiety and mental health issues, comfort and relaxation for the mother, frequency and effectiveness of milk removal, and any underlying medical conditions should be addressed; medication should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors. It notes there remain selected indications for the use of galactogogues, but the current data are insufficient to make any definitive recommendations; a number of high-quality studies have found domperidone to be useful in mothers of preterm infants, although there is concern about rare, but significant, adverse effects, and herbal galactogogues are problematic because of lack of regulation of preparations and insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety. Clinicians should prescribe galactogogues with appropriate caution with regard to drug-to-drug (or drug-to-herb) interactions, use an overall risk-to-benefit assessment with complete informed consent, and ensure close follow-up of both mother and infant to monitor lactation status and any adverse effects.

### Extent of medication use in breastfeeding women [^113AynmQ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The types of and extent to which medications are used by breastfeeding women have not been thoroughly investigated in the United States. The relationship between medication use during pregnancy and lactation has also been insufficiently investigated.

Methods

A survey was given to a cohort of women who delivered their babies at a single center. The participants were asked to record the medications they had taken during pregnancy and subsequently were contacted each month during lactation to determine what medications they had taken.

Results

Breastfeeding women took significantly more medications per month than pregnant women (p < 0.0001). Women who were breastfeeding also took prescription medications more frequently than women who were pregnant (p < 0.0001). The number of medications taken per month showed no trend throughout the course of breastfeeding. The medications most often used by breastfeeding women were multivitamins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, progestins, antimicrobials, and decongestants. Over a third of the subjects took medications rated possibly or probably unsafe, or had unknown safety.

Conclusion

The women in this study took more prescription and nonprescription medications while breastfeeding than they did during pregnancy. Many of the medications taken have unknown safety for the breastfed infant. The results of this study should direct further research toward determining the safety of medications commonly used during lactation and to promote the labeling of these medications.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^113C5nTw]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — conclusions and research needs — notes that despite many publications, the scientific literature lacks robust large-scale studies to guide confident, drug-specific decisions, although reviews broadly suggest tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are relatively safe and recommend individual risk–benefit assessments. It prioritizes randomized clinical trials in lactating women with sufficient control for level of depression; provision of infant serum levels, the amount detected in human milk, maternal serum levels, and timing of sampling; information on infant milk consumption and behavioral outcomes; evaluation of the impact of continued breastfeeding on mitigating infant withdrawal symptoms; and studying why mothers and clinicians defer treatment with follow-up behavioral outcomes in infants.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^115LP8T7]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — potential indications for galactagogues explains that galactagogues have commonly been used to increase low or perceived low milk supply, with low supply often related to suboptimal milk removal due to infant drainage problems, inappropriate breastfeeding management, maternal or infant illness and hospitalization, and regular mother–infant separation such as work or school. It notes frequent use in the neonatal intensive care setting for mothers with preterm infants to stimulate initial secretory activation or augment declining milk secretion, and describes additional contexts including inducing lactation without pregnancy with the current child, relactation after weaning, and use in transgender women. It reports that many breastfeeding medicine specialists and lactation consultants have recommended various drugs and herbs when other nonpharmacological measures have not increased milk volume, while cautioning that some providers may inappropriately recommend galactogogues before emphasizing frequent and effective milk drainage at regular intervals or evaluating other medical factors.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^113YeTPA]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Including lactating women in clinical trials is imperative to generate relevant drug exposure and safety data needed to advise on clinical use of drugs in this understudied population. Recent changes in perspectives, regulatory guidance, and international networks which outline pragmatic approaches for advancing the conduct of clinical lactation studies are discussed. Case studies demonstrating successful application of modeling and simulation to complement clinical lactation data for enhanced knowledge of infant drug exposure are presented.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^1166Etye]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Future perspective

Breastfeeding women will continue to form a key part of all societies in the world, and remain at risk of a wide range of medical conditions requiring medication use. Studies must be designed with the communities in mind, bring together diverse skill sets and be underpinned by strong stakeholder and community engagement. Furthermore, there is a rich opportunity for continued capacity strengthening and multi-directional knowledge exchange. Given the wealth of clinical experience with breastfeeding mothers requiring medication in Africa, South to North partnerships should enable transfer of the clinical skills required to deliver these studies to a high quality whilst minimising the potential burden on the mother and her child.

It has also been recognised by these networks that the use of modelling to inform or support clinical lactation studies in a drug development or clinical setting is essential. Thus, these collaborative efforts between clinicians, quantitative pharmacologists and modellers along with healthcare professionals in the field are likely to lead to an increasing application of these modelling approaches, drive decision making and support enrolment of this demographic in clinical trials during drug development. For this change to occur, regulators and policy makers across the globe need to become more familiar with modelling and simulation to gain confidence about its application in this area. Finally, to overcome the historical neglect of this population, the pharmaceutical industry and other funding agencies should continue to support lactation pharmacology research Table 1.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^113uFTMR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — general guidance when prescribing galactogogues states that if the healthcare provider chooses to prescribe a galactogogue after weighing potential risks versus potential benefits, they should follow these steps: inform women about available data concerning efficacy, timing of use, and duration of therapy and about potential adverse effects; screen the mother for contraindications, allergies, or drug interactions; provide ongoing care or transfer care to ensure appropriate follow‑up and attention to any side effects; prescribe at the lowest possible doses for the shortest period and do not exceed recommended therapeutic doses; consider gradually discontinuing rather than abruptly discontinuing, with no clear advantage to either method; if milk production wanes after stopping and improves with resumption, attempt to gradually decrease to the lowest effective dose and then discontinue later if possible; and consider documenting discussion of contraindications and information about benefits and risks.

Metoclopramide — trial scope, dosing, effectiveness, and adverse effects are as follows: Three randomized, placebo-controlled blinded studies researching the effect of metoclopramide have been published between 1980 and 2011, with participants in three studies commencing metoclopramide within 4 days of birth without a diagnosis of low milk supply, one study in women who were relactating, and one in women whose infants had gained 500 g within the first month of life. To date, however, results have not consistently demonstrated increases in milk volumes and/or breastfeeding duration between metoclopramide and placebo groups, even with optimal breast expression and counseling. Older studies reported a significant increase in milk yield using metoclopramide, 5–20 mg, three times a day for periods of 5 days to 4 weeks, and one dose-comparison study found no response with 15 mg per day, but similar responses with 30 and 45 mg per day. As for potential risks, metoclopramide may cause neurological side effects in the mother.

### The transfer of drugs and therapeutics into human breast milk: an update on selected topics [^115fmfKr]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Many mothers are inappropriately advised to discontinue breastfeeding or avoid taking essential medications because of fears of adverse effects on their infants. This cautious approach may be unnecessary in many cases, because only a small proportion of medications are contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers or associated with adverse effects on their infants. Information to inform physicians about the extent of excretion for a particular drug into human milk is needed but may not be available. Previous statements on this topic from the American Academy of Pediatrics provided physicians with data concerning the known excretion of specific medications into breast milk. More current and comprehensive information is now available on the Internet, as well as an application for mobile devices, at LactMed (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov). Therefore, with the exception of radioactive compounds requiring temporary cessation of breastfeeding, the reader will be referred to LactMed to obtain the most current data on an individual medication. This report discusses several topics of interest surrounding lactation, such as the use of psychotropic therapies, drugs to treat substance abuse, narcotics, galactagogues, and herbal products, as well as immunization of breastfeeding women. A discussion regarding the global implications of maternal medications and lactation in the developing world is beyond the scope of this report. The World Health Organization offers several programs and resources that address the importance of breastfeeding (see http://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/).

### Macronutrients in human milk exposed to antidepressant and anti-inflammatory medications [^116NHoPF]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding is known to have several health benefits for both mother and child, and is the recommended sole source of nutrition for the first 6 months of life. The nutritional components of human milk are carbohydrates mainly consisting of lactose (8 g/100 mL), fat (3.5–4 g/100 mL), and protein (1 g/100 mL), with a total energy content around 66 kcal/100 mL (19 kcal/oz). There is natural variation in macronutrient levels in human milk based on time of day, times fed per day, size of the milk portion, infant age, maternal age, maternal diet, maternal body mass index (BMI), and infant weight percentile. The method of analysis also affects the accuracy of the results.

Generally, the macronutrient composition of human milk is well tailored to match the needs of the breastfed infant, and the clinical implications of the varying macronutrient levels for the breastfed infant are mainly studied in the context of donor milk banks. The carbohydrate levels in human milk seem positively correlated with infant weight and protein with infant length. The levels of fat are the main determinant of the total energy of human milk and are known to aid in the development of the central nervous system of the breastfed infant.,

More than 70% of women who provide human milk to their infants take some form of medication. Whether external exposures could affect the composition of human milk is only studied in a few single studies, with cannabis suggested to affect the levels of protein and carbohydrates by some, but not confirmed by others.

However, physiologic and biochemical phenomena that influence the composition of plasma may also affect the composition of milk. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are suggested to increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Similarly, treatment with systemic steroids is known to cause hyperglycemia, and some monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are suggested to cause hyperglycemia. For these reasons, there might be at least a theoretical risk of altered macronutrient levels in human milk produced by mothers treated with these medications. However, the concentrations of lactose are known to be fairly constant in mature milk (ie, after 21 days post partum).

To our knowledge, the association of prescription medications with human milk composition has not been studied previously. We aimed to compare macronutrient levels in human milk from mothers exposed to long-term antidepressant and anti-inflammatory medications with levels in milk from disease-matched and healthy mothers.

### Maternal opioid treatment after delivery and risk of adverse infant outcomes: population based cohort study [^1144V1TY]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Most mothers in North America initiate breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period. All opioids pass into breast milk in small amounts, although not in quantities expected to cause respiratory or central nervous system depression in nursing infants. Isolated reports describe opioid toxicity in breastfed infants, which some authors have hypothesised reflects the ingestion of large quantities of opioids in breast milk. However, the plausibility of these reports — and one high profile case in particular — has been repeatedly questioned, and two related articles were recently retracted by the editors of the journals in which they were published.

Owing in part to ongoing regulatory warnings arising from case reports, concerns remain about the possibility of breastfeeding related opioid toxicity in infants. This uncertainty might undermine postpartum analgesia and generate unnecessary anxiety for parents. Whether maternal opioid use while breastfeeding truly presents a risk to newborn infants remains the subject of debate. Using eight years of comprehensive population based healthcare data, we examined whether there was an association between maternal opioid prescription after delivery and short term increased risks of adverse outcomes in infants.

### The use of mood stabilizers during breastfeeding [^115svEtZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The literature and majority of professional organizations endorse breastfeeding as a means to provide a number of health benefits to both mother and child. Notably, the postpartum period heralds an increased vulnerability for both new onset and symptom worsening of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder in women. While pharmacologic treatment is important for these patients, many physicians have been hesitant to prescribe medication for women who choose to breast-feed, despite the fact that a variety of medical illnesses are routinely treated in breastfeeding women (e.g., epilepsy, infection, allergies, and migraine) and that nursing infants may also directly receive medications for colic and reflux. To date, all psychotropic medications studied enter human breast milk, and many of these medications have undergone detailed investigations. While breastfeeding may complicate pharmacotherapy, it does not preclude it. There are limited scientifically derived guidelines in the treatment of women who choose to breast-feed. The pharmacokinetic properties and potential impact of infant exposure to mood stabilizers must be considered in the decision to breast-feed infants born to mothers receiving pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder. Past practices and methodologies for determining continuation of treatment are discussed in this article, as well as the current data for newer categories of drugs being used to treat bipolar disorder and their indications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Treating pregnant women with neuropsychiatric illnesses in their childbearing years who are breastfeeding involves a thorough risk:benefit analysis to determine the relative safety of pharmacologic therapy. Familiarity with the extant literature and its limitations and practical considerations will enable optimizing treatment plans that maintain maternal mental health, minimize nursing infant exposures, and provide infant monitoring.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^1129YUSB]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Transfer of Drug in Human Breast Milk

There is limited information on most drugs used by breast-feeding women, which poses challenges for women and their providers. Consequently, many providers will recommend stopping a medication based on theoretical concerns about its safety for the neonate, and this may lead to inadequately treated maternal disease. Information needed to make decisions about medications and breast-feeding includes knowledge of the need for the drug, the excretion of the drug into breast milk, the extent of oral absorption of the drug by the neonate, the potential adverse effects on the neonate, and the potential effect of the drug on lactation. In addition, the infant's age is relevant and should be considered as adverse events are rarer in infants older than 6 months. As in pregnancy, the biochemical properties of a given drug are important elements such as drug ionization, molecular weight, volume of distribution, lipid solubility, and protein binding, and they may influence how much of the drug is excreted into breast milk. Furthermore, the half-life of the drug and its oral bioavailability will influence how much is absorbed by the neonate. One example of these complexities include emerging data demonstrating that there are specific patient genotypes that influence the toxicity of given drugs. Stover and Davis suggest that this area of pharmacogenomics holds promise in understanding how neonates with in utero exposure to opioids may have different withdrawal patterns based on specific polymorphisms.

The main recommendations from the workshop were focused in the following areas: clinical care recommendations, research gaps, and policy-related considerations.

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^116Fav1J]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding is beneficial for the health of the mother and child. However, at least 50% of postpartum women need pharmacotherapy, and this number is rising due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and pregnancies at a later age. Making informed decisions on medicine use while breastfeeding is often challenging, considering the extensive information gap on medicine exposure and safety during lactation. This can result in the unnecessary cessation of breastfeeding, the avoidance of pharmacotherapy or the off-label use of medicines. The UmbrelLACT study aims to collect data on human milk transfer of maternal medicines, child exposure and general health outcomes. Additionally, the predictive performance of lactation and paediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, a promising tool to predict medicine exposure in special populations, will be evaluated.

Methods and analysis

Each year, we expect to recruit 5–15 breastfeeding mothers using pharmacotherapy via the University Hospitals Leuven, the BELpREG project (pregnancy registry in Belgium) or external health facilities. Each request and compound will be evaluated on relevance (ie, added value to available scientific evidence) and feasibility (including access to analytical assays). Participants will be requested to complete at least one questionnaire on maternal and child's general health and collect human milk samples over 24 hours. Optionally, two maternal and one child's blood samples can be collected. The maternal medicine concentration in human milk will be determined along with the estimation of the medicine intake (eg, daily infant dose and relative infant dose) and systemic exposure of the breastfed child. The predictive performance of PBPK models will be assessed by comparing the observed concentrations in human milk and plasma to the PBPK predictions.

Ethics and dissemination

This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven (internal study number S67204). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at (inter)national scientific meetings.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112U9yjE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed. The use of domperidone for breast milk stimulation must be prescribed by a physician, and potential side effects should be considered. Women should receive appropriate guidance on ways to enhance breast milk production in hospital and in the 30 days following hospital discharge, before considering to medication to increase milk production.

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^112QBQ9R]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding is highly recommended by the WHO, more specifically exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months after birth and continued partially, in combination with complementary feeding, until 2 years of age. This is because breastfeeding has a positive impact on the development and general health of children. Breastfed children are less likely to suffer from childhood infections, at least in part due to antibodies in human milk, and have a lower risk of being overweight. According to Castro et al breastfeeding is also related to higher intelligence, with a possible increase up to seven intelligence quotient points and a reduction in child morbidity and mortality. In addition, breastfeeding is also beneficial for maternal health, for example, by reducing the risk of developing breast or ovarian carcinoma.

At least 50% of women need pharmacotherapy in the postpartum period, and this proportion has been rising due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and later-age pregnancies. Meanwhile, an immense information gap regarding the safety of medicines during lactation still exists today, complicating evidence-based decisions on the use and selection of medicines during breastfeeding. This often results in unnecessary cessation of breastfeeding or poor adherence to or avoidance of pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, the majority of medicines are used off-label during breastfeeding, which may put the child at risk for unknown side effects.

To assess the transfer of medicines in human milk, the relative infant dose (RID) and the milk-to-plasma (M/P) ratio are commonly used as parameters in clinical lactation studies. M/P ratios reported in the literature are often based on single time point assessments. However, as the concentration profiles in human milk and plasma vary individually over time and may not be exactly the same, the M/P ratio may differ significantly depending on the timing of sampling. Ideally, the M/P ratio should be based on the (24-hour) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in human milk and plasma. Assuming that only the unbound and unionised medicine fraction will cross the blood–milk barrier, the M/P ratio can be calculated based on the physicochemical properties of a medicine (eg, pH partitioning, protein binding and distribution into milk lipid), for instance, using the non-clinical phase distribution model.

### ABM clinical protocol # 15: analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, revised 2017 [^112V7J5G]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) Clinical Protocol #15 — opioid use and brief procedures: The most concerning class of medications used for anesthesia and analgesia in breastfeeding mothers is opioids, as these medications transfer into breast milk and may cause infant sedation or apnea, though judicious use of opioids for short periods is likely to be safe for most breastfeeding mothers and infants (IV). For brief procedures such as dental extractions or other short procedures requiring single doses for sedation and analgesia, mothers can breastfeed as soon as they are awake and stable.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^115PZ8bW]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding mothers — maternal lactation status should not delay treatment (II-2), and women with moderate to severe symptoms may require only antidepressant drug treatment; in the setting of moderate to severe depression, the benefits of treatment likely outweigh the risks of the medication to the mother or infant. There is no widely accepted algorithm for antidepressant medication treatment of depression in lactating women, and an individualized risk–benefit analysis must be conducted in each situation and take into account the mother's clinical history and response to treatment, the risks of untreated depression, the risks and benefits of breastfeeding, the benefits of treatment, the known and unknown risks of the medication to the infant, and the mother's wishes. If a mother has no history of antidepressant treatment, an antidepressant such as sertraline that has evidence of lower levels in human milk and infant serum and few side effects is an appropriate first choice (II-2), and sertraline has the best safety profile during lactation; the recommended starting dose is 25 mg for 5–7 days to avoid side effects, which then can be increased to 50 mg/day.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^113GvFob]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — practice recommendations for low milk production emphasize initial evaluation and nonpharmacologic management: evaluate the mother for medical causes of low milk supply and treat the condition as indicated, and for many of these women, a galactogogue should not be recommended or prescribed; assess and increase the frequency and effectiveness of milk removal, use nonpharmacologic measures, and when infants are not effective or are unable to feed at the breast regularly expressing by hand and/or breast pump is necessary; ensure that the expressing technique and any breast pumps used are effective, as galactogogues will not increase the milk supply if there is infrequent or inadequate breast drainage, and ABM cannot recommend any specific galactogogue at this time.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide in breastfeeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QtGsZ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide used by breastfeeding women. Methods: A systematic literature search retrieved citations from PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Medline, EBSCO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov (from inception to January, 2021) and bibliographies of known articles. Randomized controlled trials exploring the effects of domperidone and metoclopramide in breastfeeding women with term and preterm infants experiencing adequate or low milk supply were identified. Human milk volume and maternal side effects were presented as mean difference (MD) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Sixteen trials involving 729 women were included in the qualitative analysis and 14 trials involving 607 women were included in the meta-analysis. In mothers of preterm infants with low milk supply, domperidone demonstrated a significant increase in daily human milk volume (MD = 90.53mL/day, 95% CI [65.42 to 115.64], I² = 9%). However, metoclopramide did not show significant difference in daily human milk volume in women with preterm infants (MD = -1.14mL/day, 95% CI [-31.42 to 29.14], I² = 0%). No differences in maternal side effects were noted with domperidone (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.74 to 1.97], I² = 0%) or metoclopramide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.52 to 2.11], I² = 27%) in women with preterm infants. Regarding the women with term infants, there were insufficient data in the current review. Conclusions: Domperidone can be used to treat low milk supply in women with preterm infants without significant side effects based on the current review. More evidence exploring the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide are still needed for breastfeeding women in the future.

### The prevalence of nonserious events in a cohort of breastfed infants [^1179cJei]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Data on baseline rates of nonserious events in breastfed infants in the general population are sparse. This results in difficulty determining if there is an increase in infant nonserious events potentially due to prescription medication exposure through human milk. In this study, we determined the prevalence of nonserious events in infants consuming human milk whose mothers reported no exposure to any prescription medications, tobacco, or recreational drugs in the previous 14 days. Materials and Methods: Between August 2014 and December 2019, 487 breastfeeding mothers without any recent exposure to prescription medications, tobacco, or recreational drugs enrolled in the Human Milk Research Biorepository at the University of California, San Diego. Participants completed a semistructured telephone interview with trained research staff and provided information on maternal and child health, breastfeeding habits, recent medication, and lifestyle exposures, and completed a standard checklist of infant adverse reactions. Results: We found 131 (44.1%) participants reported one or more infant nonserious adverse events in the past 14 days at the time of their study interview. The most commonly reported nonserious events were rash (12.1%), irritability (9.4%), constipation (7.8%), poor sleep (7.1%), and fever (6.3%). Conclusions: These baseline frequencies provide a benchmark for rates of recent nonserious events in breastfed infants in the general population. These data can be used as a reference point for studies that examine adverse events in breastfed infants following maternal use of prescription medications or exposures due to other lifestyle habits such as tobacco or other substances. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT05553743.

### An equitable, community-engaged translational framework for science in human lactation and infant feeding-a report from "Breastmilk ecology: genesis of infant nutrition (BEGIN) " working group 5 [^111vAJUm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Elaboration of dissemination and implementation research (T4 stage)

The field of breastfeeding and lactation is not immune to the "know-do gap", the long-recognized lag between knowledge generation and translation into practice. In order to benefit both infants and lactating parents, discoveries in human milk require implementation research to determine how to improve the dissemination and uptake of scientific advancements across diverse populations and contexts. Implementation science methods can support the process of adapting research to specific populations and new environments, identify and address implementation determinants, and guide evaluations. As the field of implementation science evolves, there has been concerted effort to identify strategies and processes that facilitate successful implementation and sustainment of evidence-based interventions. In Text Box 3, we list 9 implementation science clusters, informed by concept mapping of 73 discrete examples, aligned with published strategies in the field of human lactation and breastfeeding. To be effective, the clusters need to "adapt and tailor to the context". These contextual factors are critical to understand variation in implementation outcomes across populations. Context is elaborated upon later in this section under overarching Principle 3.

Text Box 3
Examples of applying human lactation and breastfeeding research discoveries to the 9 strategy clusters of implementation science.

- Provide interactive assistance ➢ Leverage pharmacists to address questions regarding medication use during breastfeeding.
- Adapt and tailor to context ➢ Use formative research to design a context-specific kangaroo mother care intervention.
- Develop stakeholder interrelationships ➢ Improve breastfeeding initiation and duration in communities with the lowest breastfeeding rates through grassroots peer support.
- Train and educate stakeholders ➢ Identify and train "breastfeeding champions" at each primary care office within a health care system.
- Support clinicians ➢ Ensure adequate staffing of lactation support professionals.
- Engage consumers ➢ Publish commentary submitted by patient advocate groups, such as groups advocating for improving the management of persistently low milk supply.
- Utilize financial strategies ➢ Incentivize exclusive breastfeeding through modifying the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) food package for the breastfeeding parent.
- Change infrastructure ➢ Implement laws to improve workplace breastfeeding support.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^116xhnZN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale for phase II trial

Mothers of preterm infants are at a higher risk of a decline in milk production. It has been recommended that they should be evaluated no later than two weeks postpartum to determine what intervention may be required to assist them in augmenting and maintaining an adequate supply of milk. Although other measures can and should be considered, the use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. The limited body of research on domperidone suggests that it has potential as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants; this has led to widespread use of this medication. However, there is a paucity of research to best guide clinicians as to the optimal dose, timing of administration and duration of treatment and to reaffirm safety. EMPOWER was initiated to firmly establish the safety of domperidone for mothers of preterm infants but also guide clinicians regarding initiation, timing and duration of treatment.

### Delphi survey of international pharmacology experts: an attempt to derive international recommendations for use of medicine in breastfeeding women [^112YSw2A]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are currently no common guidelines used by health professionals to aid decision-making around the use of medicines during breastfeeding. Several specialized books, Web sites, and drug information services exist; however, all use slightly different criteria to derive their "safety hierarchy". The aim of this study was to build consensus among international experts in pharmacology and breastfeeding to develop an agreed-upon classification system for safety of medicine use in breastfeeding women.

Study Method

A three-round Web-based Delphi qualitative research design was used.

Results

Seventeen experts in pharmacy/pharmacology and breastfeeding identified 15 key parameters that are used to inform decisions about medicines and breastfeeding. The most important parameters about the infant were the age and health of the child, and those of the medicine were the safety profile and experience of use in infants. The experts had a clear understanding of the complexity of decision-making when prescribing for breastfeeding women. Although the current number or letter classification systems do not incorporate important considerations such as infant age, a longer "descriptive text" incorporating all considerations may be impractical in busy clinical practice.

Conclusions

Although clinicians and lay people would appreciate a simple classification scheme, in practice, decision-making about the safety of medicines for breastfeeding women is complex.

### Lactation safety recommendations and reliability compared in 10 medication resources [^112CisJP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Discontinuation of breast-feeding is linked with an increased risk of acute and chronic diseases in children, as well as increased risk of maternal disease. Mothers and physicians often depend on pharmacists for accurate drug information. Their information is only as good as the sources available to them.

Objective

To determine the reliability of safety recommendations for drugs used during lactation, based on current research and information, and determine whether resources may be inappropriately advising the interruption of breast-feeding.

Methods

A comparison of 10 frequently used sources for information on medication used during breast-feeding was done for 14 commonly used drugs. Our sources included the databases used by 2 retail pharmacy chains, available text references, and electronic references. We assessed the number of drugs thought to be safe in breast-feeding for each source. The drugs reviewed included those widely accepted as safe, widely regarded as not safe, and drugs that fit into neither category.

Results

We found that many sources did consider the most recent research. For drugs thought to be unequivocally safe, the 2 retail pharmacy databases gave an alternative recommendation at least 75% of the time.

Conclusions

If healthcare practitioners are using outdated sources for making safety recommendations to their patients, such a practice may result in many women being inappropriately advised to stop breast-feeding, thus increasing the potential health risks to them and their infants. As the most accessible medication expert, the pharmacist needs to be well educated and continually updated using the most reliable resources for lactation recommendations.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^112YFn9M]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — Table 1 pharmacologic galactogogues (domperidone and metoclopramide) summarize evidence, dosing, duration, effects on lactation, and safety. Domperidone has "Five Level IB studies; others have inadequate methodology or excessive dropout rates" and was used at "10 mg, orally, 3 times per day" in most trials, with one study comparing "10 mg 3 times per day with 20 mg 3 times per day" and noting more milk production; "Doses > 60 mg per day have not been studied in this context". Reported treatment courses were "between 7 and 28 days", with "Increased rate of milk secretion in both pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants and other mothers with low milk supply". Adverse events included "psychomotor withdrawal symptoms from a dose of 160 mg per day" and rare arrhythmias "(1.3/10,000 postpartum women)". For metoclopramide, evidence is "IB-IIB… mixed results; effect on overall rate of milk secretion is unclear, but may be effective", with dosing "10 mg, orally, 3 to 4 times per day" for "7–14 days in various studies", effects described as "Possible increased rate of milk secretion; possible responders versus nonresponders", and safety concerns including "Reversible CNS effects with short-term use… " and "Rare reports of tardive dyskinesia (usually irreversible), causing the FDA to place a black box warning on this drug in the United States".

### Diagnosis and management of breast milk oversupply [^114LEW4n]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Managing breastfeeding problems is an essential part of newborn care. While much is written on breast milk undersupply, little is written on oversupply, sometimes known as hyperlactation or hypergalactia. Infants of mothers with oversupply may have increased or decreased weight gain. Some may have large, frothy stools. They may develop a disordered latch. Mothers may report overly full, leaking breasts. Thyroid function should be assessed. Treatment is mostly anecdotal and includes methods to maintain breast fullness, such as block feedings. Pseudoephedrine and oral contraceptive pills may decrease the supply. Dopamine agonists such as carbergoline can be used as a last resort.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111j5Qzy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of mother's own breast milk during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their infants' prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply.

Methods/design

EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2-week period; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an estimated 30% change between the two groups (from 40% to 28%, corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80% power and alpha = 0.05. To account for a 15% dropout, this number is increased to 560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36–40 months.

Discussion

The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast milk.

### ABM clinical protocol # 14: breastfeeding-friendly physician's office-optimizing care for infants and children [^117LA1sH]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Medication use during breastfeeding — prescribing guidance emphasizes to "Be aware of breastfeeding safety before prescribing medication, and when appropriate, consider alternative medications with more evidence to support safety in breastfeeding". It directs that "The risk–benefit ratio should be weighed against the risks of not breastfeeding" when initiating or modifying treatment and that this discussion "should be not only be encouraged but deemed necessary". Clinicians are told to "Keep a list of resources to aid you in this including knowledgeable pediatricians, family physicians, OBs/GYNs, pharmacists, and reputable websites addressing breastfeeding and medication use that is, LactMed, E-lactancia, Embryotox, and your county's specific website addressing this topic", and to "Dispel breastfeeding myths regarding the use of certain medications (i.e., antidepressants, antibiotics, and opioids)".

Promote shared decision making — A breastfeeding mother's illness can present a difficult decision about discontinuing breastfeeding, making accurate information — particularly about the safety of necessary medications — essential. Mothers should be informed about risks to their own health if the infant's normal breastfeeding routine is interrupted; those with decreased milk production due to separation or interrupted milk removal will require professional lactation support, and decisions should follow a full explanation of maternal and infant risks and benefits with access to professional support. Level of evidence: 3 and strength of recommendation: C are stated.

Breastfeeding

The risks and benefits to the mother–infant dyad have to be considered when breastfeeding recommendations are made in PPP. Although breastfeeding is recommended where possible, we argue that in PPP, the risks of breastfeeding to the mother–infant dyad may often outweigh the benefits. Sleep deprivation is common in breastfeeding women and can lead to deterioration of symptoms in PPP. The choice of medications that may be used to treat PPP is limited in breastfeeding (e.g. lithium, with the best evidence base for treatment of PPP, is a relative contraindication to breastfeeding in many healthcare systems). Please see section 'Lithium and other mood stabilisers' for further discussion of lithium and breastfeeding), with additional constraints on doses of medications that may be used. The resulting inadequate treatment of PPP combined with the perpetuating effect of sleep deprivation can prolong the episode of PPP, further impacting the mother–infant dyad.

We acknowledge that in certain situations, such as low- and middle-income countries, formula feeding may not be feasible due to the costs of infant formula and hygiene concerns with bottles. Breast milk is vital for the development of preterm infants and the use of a breast milk bank where available might be considered in this circumstance. Occasionally, when the prescribed medication is safe in breastfeeding, daytime breastfeeding may be supplemented by nocturnal formula feeds offered by the partner or carer to facilitate maternal sleep. Reference to the latest guidance on medications in breastfeeding is recommended before prescribing. There is limited long-term safety data for psychotropic medication in breastfeeding. Information on the levels of individual drugs in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the breastfeeding infant may be found, in databases such as the Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed).

For infants at risk for apnea, hypotension, or hypotonia, a brief interruption of breastfeeding (6–12 hours) after maternal anesthesia may benefit; in this situation, mothers can express and store her milk in small amounts or mix it with fresh milk containing no medications to dilute milk with medications present.

Clinical lactation studies during clinical development of a new drug if there is anticipated use by women of reproductive age

More than 80% of mothers in all settings breastfeed and the duration of (exclusive and nonexclusive) breastfeeding is reportedly highest in LMIC. Hence, understanding the extent of infant exposure to maternal drugs used for chronic or acute medical conditions is crucial to properly assess potential consequences: theoretical concerns for toxicity from high levels of exposure, prophylaxis with adequate exposure, or resistance development from subtherapeutic ARV exposure among infants who acquire HIV infection. Importantly, there is no need for extra preclinical data to justify a clinical lactation study. Existing ethics and regulatory frameworks support the conduct of PK studies in lactating women receiving a drug prescribed as part of standard clinical care. Examples exist of opportunistic PK studies that have significantly expanded our understanding of the clinical pharmacology of drugs used by lactating women. To further advance this field and obtain these data at earlier stages of drug development, the following recommendations are proposed:
Include phase I clinical lactation studies as part of phase III trials: Based on FDA guidance, breastfeeding will need to be temporarily interrupted (a woman may pump and discard her milk and feed her infant stored breastmilk) for the duration of the study to prevent infant exposure to an investigational drug. To get some insight into breastmilk transfer under this recommendation, milk could be pumped just after delivery (before the first breastfeeding session) in women who received the study drug during pregnancy in a phase III trial. An alternative approach is to include lactating women in phase III trials, in a setting where breastfeeding is recommended. Significantly, the FDA recommends noncompartmental and/or compartmental modeling approaches in the analysis of lactation PK data. PBPK modeling is especially promising to predict infant exposure where only breastmilk drug concentration data are available. An important consideration in using a PBPK approach in lactation studies is the availability of reliable drug and system parameters for both the maternal model and the "infant submodel" to adequately describe drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, including the milk‐to‐plasma ratio. Predictions from such models may serve as a basis for IRBs to evaluate the safety of prospective studies to evaluate infant exposure in a follow‐up clinical lactation study. PBPK models may also be a useful approach in evaluating potential changes in drug exposure during the pregnancy‐lactation transition period.
Encourage clinical lactation studies in LMIC: The contribution to infant health and the advice of breastfeeding in these countries compared with higher income countries presents an opportunity to impact public health and accelerate availability of lactation PK data. Reducing the time lag in new drug availability in these settings and making life‐saving medications available as soon as possible after approval will help build trust and facilitate early clinical lactation studies which can be conducted as opportunistic studies. Training and retraining of IRBs in LMIC will help facilitate these studies as the regulatory and ethical landscapes change. Endorsement statements of relevant agencies and organizations, including the WHO, FDA, and EMA, may help to get ethical approval and reach consensus on informed consent process, as the infant is a subject in the trial, with potentially a need for both maternal and paternal informed consent.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111fLnjL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of mother's own breast milk during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their infants' prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply.

Methods/Design

EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2-week period; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an estimated 30% change between the two groups (from 40% to 28%, corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80% power and alpha = 0.05. To account for a 15% dropout, this number is increased to 560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36–40 months.

Discussion

The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast milk.

### Longitudinal trends in domperidone dispensing to mothers of very preterm infants and its association with breast milk feeding at infant discharge: a retrospective study [^112bZoKX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Breast milk is widely recognised as the best source of nutrition for all infants, particularly for preterm infants. However, lactation insufficiency, when a mother cannot produce enough breast milk to meet her infant's requirements, is frequent after preterm birth and is one of the most common reasons women discontinue breast feeding. Despite recognition that mothers of preterm infants face additional challenges with breastfeeding, lactation support for this high-risk group is often suboptimal. When lactation insufficiency persists following non-pharmacological supports, medications such as domperidone are often used to increase breast milk production.

Domperidone increases serum prolactin, a hormone required for breast milk production. Meta-analyses of trials involving mothers of preterm infants with diagnosed lactation insufficiency demonstrate that domperidone is effective for increasing short-term breast milk production by up to 88 mL/day at doses of 30 mg/day for 5–14 days. In contrast, limited evidence supports using domperidone as a preventative therapy immediately or soon after birth. Consequently, use is not typically recommended until after milk letdown has occurred and a trial of non-pharmacological strategies has been completed.

Whether identified short-term benefits of domperidone translate to improved longer-term breast milk feeding outcomes for mothers of preterm infants remains inconclusive. Previous studies report continued breast milk feeding rates at infant discharge from hospital ranging from 58% to 95% among women prescribed domperidone. Clinical trial evidence is inconsistent, with reports of higher breastfeeding rates at discharge or no difference, based on domperidone use. These studies also have significant limitations, including small sample sizes and differences in the treatment regimens. Consequently, it remains difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the longer-term impacts of domperidone use for lactation insufficiency.

Despite uncertainties surrounding longer-term breastfeeding outcomes, the use of domperidone among mothers of preterm infants has increased in high-income countries such as the UK and Canada, with reports suggesting up to 44% of all mothers of preterm infants are prescribed domperidone. Concurrently, safety concerns have been raised about domperidone. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed domperidone's safety and efficacy data and recommended changes in practice due to a small risk of serious cardiac side effects.

### The identifying and counseling of breastfeeding women by pharmacists [^1143Y2er]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Concerns about medications influence breastfeeding decisions. Mothers may stop breastfeeding when they take medications. After the distribution of Thomas Hale's Medications and Mother's Milk (MMM) (Hale Publishing, Amarillo, TX, 2006) by the Rhode Island Department of Health (Providence, RI) in November 2006 to Rhode Island pharmacies, we investigated, during the summer of 2007, what strategies and resources pharmacists were using to identify breastfeeding women and guide medication recommendations.

Methods

Copies of MMM were sent to 47 pharmacies in Rhode Island. Subsequently, one pharmacist at each site completed a confidential, 10-question written survey.

Results

The survey response rate was 92%. More than half (58%) of the pharmacists surveyed never asked women if they were breastfeeding. Most (85%) of pharmacists reported feeling somewhat or very comfortable giving advice to breastfeeding women. All but one pharmacist who had received MMM reported using the reference at least monthly. More than half (52%) of the pharmacists reported using the Physician's Desk Reference (Thomson PDR, Montvale, NJ).

Discussion

Pharmacists need a consistent approach to identify breastfeeding women and access to reliable, continuously updated resources to guide their advice about medication use to breastfeeding women. Physicians and pharmacists should collaborate to prevent medication use from being a barrier to breastfeeding.

Eligible and consenting woman will be randomized in blocks of four. Pharmacy staff will randomly (using a computer based code) assign mothers to receive either domperidone, 10 mg orally three times daily or placebo for a two week period. Mothers of infants > 3 but < 4 weeks postpartum will be randomized separately from those ≥ 4 weeks postpartum in order to ensure identical proportions within the domperidone and placebo groups (i.e. randomizations will be stratified by postpartum duration at study entry). Participants will receive their 2- week drug or placebo supply following enrollment. They will be provided with instruction related to self-administration and asked to return the medication vial and any unused medication at the completion of the two-week period. The study nurse/investigators will be in close contact with the mothers and review instruction related to medication on study days 4, 7, and 14.

### From inception to concePTION: genesis of a network to support better monitoring and communication of medication safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding [^116uNfvq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

More than 200 million women worldwide become pregnant every year, and a majority take at least one medication during pregnancy. However, merely 5% of available medications have been adequately monitored, tested, and labeled with safety information for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have long been overlooked in medical research, especially in randomized controlled clinical trials, due to complex practical, ethical, and legal challenges. Since the 2000s, data generated in routine healthcare have been increasingly used and recognized as a valuable source for evidence generation, offering the possibility of filling evidence gaps left by randomized controlled clinical trials and rendering the lack of information on pregnancy and breastfeeding even more untenable from ethical, medical, and societal perspectives. In 2019, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) funded the ConcePTION project — Building an ecosystem for better monitoring and communicating safety of medicines use in pregnancy and breastfeeding: validated and regulatory endorsed workflows for fast, optimised evidence generation — with the vision that there is a societal obligation to rapidly reduce uncertainty about the safety of medication use in pregnancy and breastfeeding. ConcePTION aims to contribute to filling the knowledge gap regarding the effects of medicines in pregnancy and lactation, by developing a system across European Data Access Providers (DAPs) that transforms existing and routinely collected healthcare data into evidence in a robust and transparent manner.

Hyperlactation differential diagnosis — hyperlactation may be self-induced, iatrogenic, or idiopathic; self-induced hyperlactation occurs when the mother stimulates production of more milk than the infant requires, which may occur from excessive pumping in addition to breastfeeding. Mothers may fear not having sufficient milk in the future, desire to donate milk, or misunderstand that they do not need to store high volumes of milk for return to work, and women who exclusively pump may produce more milk than needed for the infant(s). Women also may self-induce a rate of milk production higher than needed by their infant(s) by taking herbal substances and/or prescription medications that may increase milk production.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^114P8QrT]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, especially after the Women's Health initiative (WHI) was established in 1992, there has been increased emphasis on generation of evidence to guide clinical practice and develop therapeutics for conditions that predominantly affect women. Although this was ground-breaking, the WHI by design focussed on preventive strategies for chronic disorders like cancer, healthier ageing, and postmenopausal disorders, and thereby neglected to focus on the disposition and safety of drugs in Women of Child-Bearing Potential (WOCBP). Within the demographic of WOCBP, different categories of women exist; some who wish to conceive, and others who may be in different stages of pregnancy, postpartum and/or breastfeeding. It is estimated that more than half of all breastfeeding women worldwide require drug therapy. However, in most situations, clear evidence quantitatively describing drug transfer from mother to breastfed infants (through breastmilk) and informing the clinical risk-to-benefit ratio does not exist. This evidence gap may preclude prescribing such therapeutics in the real-world setting. This applies to both established and newly approved therapeutics. A 2016 review by the FDA scrutinising the eligibility criteria of trials of 38 drugs approved between 2014 and 2017 observed that lactation was among the most frequent exclusion criteria.

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^111xZ9Qx]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Breastfeeding women and their breastfed children are often excluded from clinical trials due to ethical and practical reasons, which result in a therapeutic orphan population and a huge knowledge gap. Due to this existing information gap, performing clinical lactation studies is highly needed and can provide valuable information. However, a broad variability in conducting and reporting on clinical lactation studies exists where, for example, essential PK data might be missing, such as dosage or time of medicine intake relative to the sampling time. In addition, obtaining ethics approval for samples of each individual woman and each specific compound makes conducting clinical lactation studies time-consuming, while the breastfeeding period is generally limited in time. However, the collection of in vivo human data is essential for the evaluation of lactation PBPK models. These thoroughly evaluated PBPK models will lead to a generic set of breastfeeding-specific population parameters, enabling the construction of structural PBPK frameworks for breastfeeding women and breastfed infants. Such frameworks might subsequently be applied with increasing certainty to similar medicines for which in vivo data are still lacking.

The UmbrelLACT study is a prospective, observational, clinical lactation study to collect data on human milk transfer of maternal medicines and, subsequently, data on child intake and systemic exposure through human milk and the general health outcome of the child. In addition, the results will be used to evaluate the predictive performance of lactation and paediatric PBPK models.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^115RtATH]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — recommendations for further research state that there are ongoing studies investigating the effects of insulin resistance on milk supply and whether met- formin can act as a galactagogue in women with insulin resistance or prediabetes, and that the outcome of these studies is awaited. The document indicates that existing studies about galactogogues remain small, randomized controlled trials often have conflicting results or are not powered, many are based primarily on opinion with suboptimal and not standardized nonpharmacological breastfeeding support, and most have been conducted on mothers of preterm infants with mechanical breast pumps rather than on mothers of term infants whose problems usually arise in the first few days to weeks postpartum. It asserts there is a clear need for well-designed, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials using adequate doses of galactogogues in populations of women in which both the maternal and control groups receive up-to-date, appropriate lactation support; studies need to include mothers of both term and preterm infants, measure clinically relevant outcomes such as infant weight gain, need for artificial feeding, quantification of maternal milk production, and adverse drug effects, and research should be undertaken investigating cultural practices and foods used to stimulate and maintain milk production.

### Metoclopramide or domperidone for increasing maternal breast milk output: a randomised controlled trial [^114Mziz1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of metoclopramide and domperidone on the breast milk output of mothers with infants in neonatal intensive care.

Design

Double-blind randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Sample

Eighty mothers expressing breast milk for their infants (mean gestational age 28 weeks) based in NICU and the amounts expressed fell short of the prescribed target.

Intervention

Mothers were randomised to receive domperidone or metoclopramide for 10 days (10 mg three times a day).

Outcome Measures

Total milk volume daily for up to 10 days before the medication, 10 days during the trial and up to 10 days after medication. Adverse side effects were also recorded.

Results

Mothers produced more milk in the domperidone group and achieved a mean of 96.3% increase in milk volume (mean increase/pretrial volume) compared with a 93.7% increase for metoclopramide. After adjusting for the amount of milk produced prior to medication, the mean amount of milk produced while taking medication for those on domperidone was 31.0 ml/24 h (95% CI -5.67 to 67.6) greater than the mean for those on metoclopramide. Seven mothers taking metoclopramide reported side effects and three taking domperidone; a further eight women (of 29) who had a follow-on prescription for metoclopramide also reported side effects.

Conclusions

Oral domperidone and metoclopramide increased the volume of milk produced by mothers who are expressing to feed their babies in NICU. There were small differences in milk output between the two medications and in the incidence of side effects, but the differences were non-significant.

### Domperidone for lactation: what health care providers need to know [^117H38Dc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

This commentary serves to raise health care provider awareness about the regulatory status and available evidence regarding domperidone for insufficient lactation. Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits for mothers and infants, and insufficient milk production remains the most common reason for early weaning. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist that may increase milk production, is not approved for any human use in the United States. It is approved in some countries for certain gastrointestinal disorders, but is not approved in any country for lactation enhancement. Domperidone is associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an import alert in 2004, updated in 2012, explaining that the importation of domperidone is illegal with limited exceptions, including when imported pursuant to an investigational new drug application. The FDA also issued a public safety warning regarding the use of domperidone for lactation. Nonetheless, domperidone is sometimes being obtained illegally and used in attempts to increase milk production in lactating mothers. There is limited quality evidence for the effectiveness of domperidone for lactation enhancement. In contrast, considerable information exists on domperidone's cardiac risks including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death, including among lactating women. In light of limited efficacy data that do not offset safety concerns from a public health perspective, we continue to caution against using domperidone for lactation enhancement. Research and drug development are needed to address the significant unmet medical need for lactation disorders.

### Industry perspective of drug development for pregnant / breastfeeding women [^115VnUpx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

As part of drug development, drug companies conduct experiments to gather data about the potential toxicity of medications in pregnant and lactating animals. Increasingly, physiologically based pharmacokinetic models are developed to simulate drug concentrations in pregnant and lactating women. As these women are not usually included in clinical trials, targeted postapproval safety monitoring, registries, or clinical studies may be performed to gather safety and efficacy information about drug use in these special populations.

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^115uqsjN]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods and analysis

Study design

This UmbrelLACT protocol, listing the generic steps of recruitment, sampling, sample storage and data management, has been developed within an interdisciplinary team with the aim of including lactating cases using medicines for which only limited safety information during breastfeeding is available in the literature.

Distribution of the study awareness and information may occur via different channels, that is, the University Hospitals Leuven, the BELpREG pregnancy registry in Belgium or external health facilities, so that interested breastfeeding women are able to contact the study team. Each request and compound is evaluated on relevance (ie, added value to available scientific evidence) and feasibility (including timely access to analytical assay). Optionally, available cases in the literature or data from other biobanks with a similar sampling method can be pooled with new data achieved from the current study protocol while respecting all guidelines and regulations in the relevant biobanks to generate more insights from the pooled available observations.

This prospective observational study will evaluate the presence and transfer of medicines in human milk, along with systemic concentrations and health outcomes of the child, without interfering with the maternal pharmacological therapy as previously initiated by the women's treating physician(s). This means lactating women will not be asked by the researchers to initiate or use medicines for research purposes while breastfeeding or expressing milk. In addition, this study does not interfere with the decision to give human milk to the child through breastfeeding or expressed milk.

Due to the umbrella approach, defining a predefined sample size is challenging. We anticipate to enrol about five cases, with a maximum of 15 lactating women, per year, according to feasibility. This will provide evidence of the achievability of implementing the UmbrelLACT protocol in practice.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Breastfeeding women can be included when they are at least 18 years old and are exclusively or partially breastfeeding (or expressing milk) at the time of milk sampling. Eligible cases are using medicines, for any indication, for at least five half-lives of the medicine (ie, to be at a steady-state concentration of the medicine) and are willing to express and collect human milk during at least 24 hours. Mothers of twins are excluded. Their breastfed neonate (from birth up to 28 days postnatal age), infant (1 month–23 months) or preschool child (2–6 years) can be included if the gestational age is at least 24 weeks and if written informed parental consent is obtained.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^116dpNM3]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — background and physiology relevant to galactogogues states that galactagogues are medications or other substances believed to assist initiation, maintenance, or augmentation of maternal milk supply, and notes that once lactation is established there is no direct correlation between serum prolactin levels and the volume of milk produced in lactating women. It describes hormonal control, including that systemic endocrine control of other supporting hormones is important and that prolactin secretion functions in a negative feedback system in which dopamine serves as an inhibitor, with increases in prolactin when dopamine decreases. It further explains that once secretory activation has occurred and milk supply is established, the rate of milk synthesis is mainly controlled locally in the mammary gland by autocrine control, and emphasizes breast emptying mechanics by stating that lactating breasts are never completely empty and that inadequate drainage causes milk production to decline, whereas more frequent and thorough drainage typically increases milk secretion with both immediate and delayed effects.

### Medication use in breastfeeding women: a national study [^112nS6U9]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

A wealth of evidence reveals the benefits of breastfeeding. During the breastfeeding period, nursing mothers may face many medical conditions that require medical management. The medication use among breastfeeding women in Jordan is largely unknown.

Objective

This study assessed the beliefs and attitudes of breastfeeding women in Jordan toward medication use.

Methods

The data were collected from breastfeeding women in hospitals and maternal and children care centers from north, middle, and south Jordan by semistructured interviews using a self-administered questionnaire from February 2015 to November 2015.

Results

Of the 903 participants (96% response rate), 17% used over-the-counter medications and 33% took prescribed medications. Of these, 7% (n = 64) used both over-the-counter and prescribed medications. Analgesics followed by antibiotics were the most commonly used medications among breastfeeding women in Jordan. The majority of breastfeeding women consulted with their physician or pharmacist before initiating or changing any medication. Product Information was the most commonly used drug information resource utilized by breastfeeding women to inquire about safety of medication use during breastfeeding.

Conclusion

Breastfeeding women should be educated about the reliable sources of medication information and the importance of physician consultation before initiation or modification of medication therapy. Physicians and pharmacists should be encouraged to be actively involved in detailed discussion with breastfeeding women regarding medication use.

### Lactation and the use of biologic immunosuppressive medications [^112xRoFH]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Biologic medications are effective therapeutic options for treating autoimmune diseases, but information on their safety in lactation is still scarce. Autoimmune conditions occur frequently in women of childbearing age, creating difficult decisions regarding optimizing maternal health and supporting breastfeeding. Available data, in addition to the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of biologics, suggest that these medications are compatible with breastfeeding. A review of the available evidence and information is presented, as well as recommendations on counseling the nursing mother and her healthcare team to make informed decisions about maternal and infant care.

### A critical review of pharmaceutical galactagogues [^117Sc91x]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Use of plant and drug products to enhance lactation is widespread, and numerous papers have been published in the medical literature claiming efficacy for various products. This paper will review and evaluate the published literature on the most widely used pharmaceuticals that are used as galactagogues. Breastfeeding physiology is reviewed with the aim of creating a framework for understanding galactagogue pharmacology. Published articles were selected and evaluated using the principles of evidence-based medicine, and were also evaluated using the principles of good lactation management. Only three studies on oxytocin and seven studies on dopamine antagonists were found to be useful. Oxytocin is probably not useful as a galactagogue, except possibly in rare circumstances of tetraplegic mothers. Dopamine antagonists appear not to enhance milk supply if mothers are given good lactation support and employ these practices. The safety of the dopamine antagonists has not been adequately evaluated, so their use should be avoided unless other measures have failed.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Rx1oz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding is the most advantageous nutrition for the newborn infant, especially for those preterm. The advantages of breastfeeding have been well documented, including the psychological benefits of maternal–infant bonding, increases immunity and protection against certain infections, and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. Breastfeeding also could reduce the maternal risk of breast and ovarian cancers, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases.

Referring to the World Health Organization, the exclusive breastfeeding is advised for infants until they reach the age of six months. However, lactation insufficiency is a prevalent issue among women, particularly those who give birth prematurely. Several factors will lead to lactation insufficiency, such as irregular hormone levels, whether they had a prior breastfeeding history, maternal pain (including painful nipples). According to the latest research data, almost 50% of mothers in the United States and two-thirds of women worldwide claimed "breastmilk insufficiency" as a primary reason for discontinuing breastfeeding before six months.

Although infant formula can alleviate insufficient breast milk supply to some extent, formula may also bring some risks, including eczema, upset stomach, runny nose, and necrotizing enterocolitis in premature babies. Various strategies to address concerns about insufficient milk supply include breastfeeding education, appropriate lactation counseling, other nonpharmacological interventions (such as skin contact, initiating the process of milk expression shortly after childbirth, frequent pumping, and relaxation techniques), and galactagogues, which may be beneficial. The definition of galactagogue is a substance that induces, maintains, or increases milk production in humans and other animals. Galactagogues can be synthetic or plant-derived. Various herb-derived galactagogues have been reported in the literature. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of scientific data available to demonstrate their efficacy. Therefore, pharmacological galactagogues are usually recommended after non-pharmacological strategies have failed.

Several pharmacological galactagogues have been studied in postpartum mothers. Domperidone and metoclopramide have been extensively investigated as pharmacological galactagogues. Others, such as sulpiride, only had limited evidence of efficacy as pharmacological galactagogues. Meanwhile, the results were inconsistent among the studies which evaluated the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues in postpartum mothers. The purpose of this study was to provide an extensive assessment of these two mainstream galactagogues using network meta-analysis (NMA).

### ABM clinical protocol # 15: analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, revised 2017 [^113nb72a]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #15 — local anesthetics and limited sedatives in breastfeeding mothers notes that local anesthetics are given during a variety of procedures and are used in varying modalities, and use of these medications typically helps minimize the need for additional systemic medications, and their use should be encouraged in breastfeeding mothers to decrease the need for opioids. Local anesthetics such as lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine can be safely used in breastfeeding mothers, and these and other local anesthetics are poorly absorbed orally and the large polarized molecules do not easily transfer into milk, and local anesthetics given by injection or topical application are considered safe for breastfeeding mothers. It also states that preferred, single doses of meperidine/pethidine or diazepam are unlikely to affect the breastfeeding infant.

### Breastfeeding challenges: ACOG committee opinion, number 820 [^114A37BB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Breastfeeding is associated with a decrease in a woman's risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes mellitus, and hypertensive heart disease. Breastfeeding initiation rates in the United States are increasing, and many women are aware of the maternal and infant health benefits of breastfeeding. However, problems may arise that can keep women from achieving their breastfeeding goals, and only 25% of women in the United States are breastfeeding exclusively at 6 months. Many women experience early and undesired weaning because of persistent pain or nipple injury. A focused history and physical examination are essential to help obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care professionals distinguish the specific cause of their patients' pain and determine appropriate treatment. Studies have shown that pain with breastfeeding may be associated with postpartum depression; therefore, postpartum depression screening is an important part of the medical history when caring for these patients. Some women choose not to initiate breastfeeding, stop breastfeeding sooner than intended, or are unable to complete treatment with prescribed medications because they may have concerns regarding medication use during lactation. Health care professionals prescribing medications during lactation should base their counseling on accurate, current information from resources such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Drugs and Lactation database (known as LactMed). Causes of early weaning also may be attributed to societal factors, such as limited access to paid maternity leave and barriers to breastfeeding in the workplace. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care professionals are uniquely positioned to support women in these situations.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^114rU7JZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

During the past two decades, significant advances in medical technology have contributed to the increased survival of preterm, very low birth weight infants. As mortality rates have declined, the focus has shifted to decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay for these high-risk infants. Nutritional care is one area with great potential for improvement. There continue to be many unanswered questions as to what constitutes optimal nutrient intake for the extremely preterm neonate. Although the current literature states that fortified human breast milk is most desirable, the optimal macronutrient composition of prepared fortifiers continues to be studied. Also, the shift from formula feeding of preterm infants to human breast milk has caused an increase in mothers of preterm infants providing expressed breast to their babies over prolonged periods.

Many mothers of very preterm infants experience difficulty maintaining milk production over several months, and hence medications such as domperidone are often recommended to help augment milk supply. Such medications increase maternal prolactin levels and have been shown to significantly increase the quantity of breast milk a lactating woman produces. Higher prolactin levels have been linked to accelerated decline in protein levels in term breast milk. However, there is a paucity of information in the literature, on the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient content of breast milk. Although pharmacological augmentation of breast milk volume is valuable, carefully conducted quantitative studies are required to assess the effect of such medication on human breast milk composition including protein, fat and other constituents. We, therefore, designed a study to determine the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient (protein, fat, and energy) and macromineral (calcium, phosphorus, and sodium) content of breast milk among mothers of very preterm infants.

Will compliance be a concern?

Since side effects are rare, we do not anticipate problems with compliance. The majority of mothers will be visiting their baby on a regular basis, hence providing milk and blood samples should not be a great inconvenience. Participants will receive their 2-week supply of domperidone or placebo following enrollment. They will be provided with instruction related to self-administration and asked to return the medication vial and any unused medication at the completion of the two-week period. Pill counts will be done in pharmacy to ensure drug accountability and evaluate compliance. The study nurse/investigators will be in close contact with the mothers and review instruction related to medication on study days 4, 7 and 14.

Based on our past clinical observations, we anticipate that the majority of the participants enrolled will be mothers of infants delivered between 24–28 weeks gestational age. The infants will be 29–33 weeks corrected gestational age at the end of the study period. Although many of these infants will receive skin to skin care from their mothers (kangaroo care), few will be actively breast feeding. For those infants who are enrolled at a later gestational age (who will be closer to 35 weeks at the end of the study period) and able to begin breast-feeding, milk volumes will be calculated using pre and post feeding weights. Mothers will be asked to refrain from breast-feeding and to express breast milk on days 0, 4, 7 and 14 as per our usual practice to ensure that a 24-hour pooled breast milk sample will be obtained. Recruitment and compliance therefore will not be adversely affected.

### Safety issues of maternal drug therapy during breastfeeding [^113nEPic]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Two goals when counseling breastfeeding mothers taking medication are protecting the infant from adverse events and permitting necessary maternal therapy. Madadi et al. report a case-control study of neonatal and maternal opioid toxicity after codeine administration. Therapeutic considerations in counseling breastfeeding mothers include susceptibility to drug toxicity of the very young and/or premature infant, significant interindividual variations in drug response, the dose-response relationship with respect to drug toxicity, and the role of pharmacogenetics in both the mother and the infant. These host factors may combine in a particular patient to act synergistically to produce an adverse reaction.

### Seven years of breastfeeding consultations at the national lactation study center-June 2018 to December 2024 [^115dmBGD]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: The National Lactation Study Center was established by Ruth Lawrence, MD, in 1981 to offer consultations on complex breastfeeding and lactation issues. In 2018, a REDCap® database was developed to track cases. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational review of cases from June 2018 to December 2024. We report frequencies of exposures (medication and toxin), along with geographic area, provider type, and lactation concerns. Results: We recorded 4,965 consultations (4,791 exposures and 174 breastfeeding management encounters). There were 4,941 cases from 44 states (United States), and 24 cases from other countries. Most occurred by telephone (n = 3,394; 71%), with fewer by email (n = 1,522; 28%). There were 4,049 (82%) from providers and 916 cases (18%) from consumers/patients. Of these, lactation consultants were the primary users (n = 2,915; 72%), with physicians accounting for 14% (n = 578). There were 10,435 total medications reviewed, with most cases involving ≤ 2 medications (n = 6,395; 61%). Drugs with central nervous system (CNS) activity accounted for the largest portion of queries (n = 5,389; 52%). Most lactation management cases were primarily maternal-side concerns such as low milk supply or oversupply (n = 116; 85%), fewer were primarily infant concerns, such as rare metabolic and cardiac conditions (n = 21; 15%), and questions related to human milk, including milk storage and properties (n = 17; 11%). Conclusion: Inquiries regarding medications with CNS activity were the most prevalent. Of management concerns, most were related to low or oversupply of milk. The use of this service reflects an ongoing need for information on medication use and complex concerns in lactation.

### Oral galactagogues (natural therapies or drugs) for increasing breast milk production in mothers of non-hospitalised term infants [^111X4S6H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many women express concern about their ability to produce enough milk, and insufficient milk is frequently cited as the reason for supplementation and early termination of breastfeeding. When addressing this concern, it is important first to consider the influence of maternal and neonatal health, infant suck, proper latch, and feeding frequency on milk production, and that steps be taken to correct or compensate for any contributing issues. Oral galactagogues are substances that stimulate milk production. They may be pharmacological or non-pharmacological (natural). Natural galactagogues are usually botanical or other food agents. The choice between pharmacological or natural galactagogues is often influenced by familiarity and local customs. Evidence for the possible benefits and harms of galactagogues is important for making an informed decision on their use.

Objectives

To assess the effect of oral galactagogues for increasing milk production in non-hospitalised breastfeeding mother-term infant pairs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Health Research and Development Network - Phillippines (HERDIN), Natural Products Alert (Napralert), the personal reference collection of author LM, and reference lists of retrieved studies (4 November 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including published abstracts) comparing oral galactagogues with placebo, no treatment, or another oral galactagogue in mothers breastfeeding healthy term infants. We also included cluster-randomised trials but excluded cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two to four review authors independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data for analysis and checked accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for clarification.

Main Results

Forty-one RCTs involving 3005 mothers and 3006 infants from at least 17 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted either in hospitals immediately postpartum or in the community. There was considerable variation in mothers, particularly in parity and whether or not they had lactation insufficiency. Infants' ages at commencement of the studies ranged from newborn to 6 months. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low because of high risk of biases (mainly due to lack of blinding), substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and imprecision of measurements. Pharmacological galactagogues Nine studies compared a pharmacological galactagogue (domperidone, metoclopramide, sulpiride, thyrotropin-releasing hormone) with placebo or no treatment. The primary outcome of proportion of mothers who continued breastfeeding at 3, 4 and 6 months was not reported. Only one study (metoclopramide) reported on the outcome of infant weight, finding little or no difference (mean difference (MD) 23.0 grams, 95% confidence interval (CI) -47.71 to 93.71; 1 study, 20 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three studies (metoclopramide, domperidone, sulpiride) reported on milk volume, finding pharmacological galactagogues may increase milk volume (MD 63.82 mL, 95% CI 25.91 to 101.72; I² = 34%; 3 studies, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicates there may be increased milk volume with each drug, but with varying CIs. There was limited reporting of adverse effects, none of which could be meta-analysed. Where reported, they were limited to minor complaints, such as tiredness, nausea, headache and dry mouth (very low-certainty evidence). No adverse effects were reported for infants. Natural galactagogues Twenty-seven studies compared natural oral galactagogues (banana flower, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, ixbut, levant cotton, moringa, palm dates, pork knuckle, shatavari, silymarin, torbangun leaves or other natural mixtures) with placebo or no treatment. One study (Mother's Milk Tea) reported breastfeeding rates at six months with a concluding statement of "no significant difference" (no data and no measure of significance provided, 60 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (fennel, fenugreek, moringa, mixed botanical tea) reported infant weight but could not be meta-analysed due to substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity (I² = 60%, 275 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis shows we are very uncertain whether fennel or fenugreek improves infant weight, whereas moringa and mixed botanical tea may increase infant weight compared to placebo. Thirteen studies (Bu Xue Sheng Ru, Chanbao, Cui Ru, banana flower, fenugreek, ginger, moringa, fenugreek, ginger and turmeric mix, ixbut, mixed botanical tea, Sheng Ru He Ji, silymarin, Xian Tong Ru, palm dates; 962 participants) reported on milk volume, but meta-analysis was not possible due to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 99%). The subgroup analysis for each intervention suggested either benefit or little or no difference (very low-certainty evidence). There was limited reporting of adverse effects, none of which could be meta-analysed. Where reported, they were limited to minor complaints such as mothers with urine that smelled like maple syrup and urticaria in infants (very low-certainty evidence). Galactagogue versus galactagogue Eight studies (Chanbao; Bue Xue Sheng Ru, domperidone, moringa, fenugreek, palm dates, torbangun, moloco, Mu Er Wu You, Kun Yuan Tong Ru) compared one oral galactagogue with another. We were unable to perform meta-analysis because there was only one small study for each match-up, so we do not know if one galactagogue is better than another for any outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to extremely limited, very low certainty evidence, we do not know whether galactagogues have any effect on proportion of mothers who continued breastfeeding at 3, 4 and 6 months. There is low-certainty evidence that pharmacological galactagogues may increase milk volume. There is some evidence from subgroup analyses that natural galactagogues may benefit infant weight and milk volume in mothers with healthy, term infants, but due to substantial heterogeneity of the studies, imprecision of measurements and incomplete reporting, we are very uncertain about the magnitude of the effect. We are also uncertain if one galactagogue performs better than another. With limited data on adverse effects, we are uncertain if there are any concerning adverse effects with any particular galactagogue; those reported were minor complaints. High-quality RCTs on the efficacy and safety of galactagogues are urgently needed. A set of core outcomes to standardise infant weight and milk volume measurement is also needed, as well as a strong basis for the dose and dosage form used.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^113uKcEg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Currently, there is no clear approach in managing mothers of preterm infants experiencing an inadequate production of breast milk. With EMPOWER, we hypothesize that domperidone, through its pharmacologic action on increasing prolactin levels, will assist mothers of very preterm infants, experiencing inadequate breast milk production, in increasing breast milk volumes to a level identified as being sufficient for continued pumping in the hospitalization period. We also hope to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in helping a mother who is experiencing an inadequate milk supply, and how it should be considered in the care of the mother and her preterm infant without causing adverse consequences to either the mother or infant.

### Information seeking behavior and strategies to increase milk supply among breastfeeding mothers in the United States [^113S6c5L]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Some breastfeeding mothers try to increase their milk supply through pharmaceutical, dietary, and behavioral strategies that vary in effectiveness. Information seeking behaviors may influence which strategies mothers use. Objective: To describe where mothers obtain information about increasing milk supply, describe the perceived influence of each information source on decision-making about strategies for increasing milk supply, and explore associations between information sources and mothers' use of galactagogues (i.e., pharmaceutical and dietary strategies) and behavioral strategies. Methods: Women who were currently breastfeeding and living in the United States were recruited through Facebook advertisements to complete an online survey between December 2020 and February 2021. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and chi-square tests compared participants' use of galactagogues and behavioral strategies by information sources. Results: Participants were 1,351 breastfeeding mothers (81% non-Hispanic white; 47% first-time breastfeeding; 21% Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children participants). Nearly all participants (97%) obtained information about increasing milk supply from at least one source, most commonly lactation consultants (68%), Facebook (61%), search engines (50%), websites (47%), and nurses (41%). There was high variability in the perceived influence of each source on decision-making. Galactagogue use was higher among participants who obtained information from the internet (Yes: 68% vs. No: 43%, p < 0.000), social media (Yes: 65% vs. No: 40%, p < 0.000), family and friends (Yes: 65% vs. No: 53%, p < 0.000), and lactation consultants (Yes: 63% vs. No: 54%, p < 0.002). Behavioral strategies were more commonly reported among participants who accessed these same sources, maternal health care professionals (Yes: 98% vs. No: 91%, p < 0.000), and pediatricians (Yes: 98% vs. No: 94%, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Breastfeeding mothers commonly obtained information about increasing milk supply from a variety of sources. Information sources accessed were associated with mothers' use of galactagogues and behavioral strategies for increasing milk supply.

### ABM clinical protocol # 7: model maternity policy supportive of breastfeeding [^116LNATa]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #7 — Potential contraindications to breastfeeding in mothers include suspected or confirmed Ebola virus; active herpetic lesions on the breast(s) where the affected breast should not be used for breastfeeding but pumping is allowed, with milk discarded if any pump part contacts lesions and expression with discarding encouraged to maintain supply; maternal Human Immunodeficiency Virus where artificial feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, with local guidance varying (e.g. U.S. non-recommendation noted); human T‑cell lymphotropic virus type I or II; varicella with onset within 5 days before or up to 48 hours after delivery prompting separation with expressed milk until no longer contagious plus Varicella‑Zoster Immune Globulin for the infant, avoidance of close contact with lesions, and no separation for older infants; untreated maternal brucellosis; active, untreated pulmonary tuberculosis until no longer contagious (15 days of treatment) with expressed milk allowed and infant isoniazid prophylaxis if diagnosis not made in the 15 days pre‑delivery, with separation potentially unnecessary if infant treated; medication exposures such as chemotherapy where temporary or permanent cessation may be advised with resources listed; and current illicit drug use assessed case‑by‑case by the infant's health care provider.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^1157GeCG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Domperidone, a drug that enhances upper gastric motility, is an anti-dopaminergic medication that also elevates prolactin levels. It has been shown to safely increase the milk supply of lactating women. To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels in the breast milk. However, the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient composition of breast milk has not been studied and current guidelines for fortification of human milk for premature infants do not distinguish between those women using or those not using domperidone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of domperidone (given to lactating mothers of very preterm infants) on the macronutrient composition of breast milk.

Methods/Design

Mothers of infants delivered at less than 31 weeks gestation, who are at least 3 weeks postpartum, and experiencing lactational failure despite non-pharmacological interventions, will be randomized to receive domperidone (10 mg three times daily) or placebo for a 14-day period. Breast milk samples will be obtained the day prior to beginning treatment and on days 4, 7 and 14. The macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate and energy) and macromineral content (calcium, phosphorus and sodium) will be analyzed and compared between the two groups. Additional outcome measures will include milk volumes, serum prolactin levels (measured on days 0, 4, and 10), daily infant weights and breastfeeding rates at 2 weeks post study completion and at discharge. Forty-four participants will be recruited into the study. Analysis will be carried out using the intention to treat approach.

Discussion

If domperidone causes significant changes to the nutrient content of breast milk, an alteration in feeding practices for preterm infants may need to be made in order to optimize growth, nutrition and neurodevelopment outcomes.

### ABM clinical protocol # 7: model maternity policy supportive of breastfeeding [^115SkoBz]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Exclusive breastfeeding and supplementation guidance — initial days postpartum: Breastfeeding mothers will be encouraged to exclusively breastfeed (feeding only breast milk, no other liquids or solids except for vitamins/medications), and supplements will not be offered to newborns unless medically indicated or by the mother's documented and informed request; on the first 1–2 days of life, term infants do not need more than 2–15 mL per feeding; and mothers will be encouraged to express colostrum or milk directly into the infant's mouth or to feed by alternative methods rather than bottle/artificial teats.

### Evaluation of the effect of different diets applied to breastfeeding mothers on the composition and quantity of human milk [^117ViXdh]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Participant recruitment

The sample group was selected from among voluntary mothers who were included in this universe and met the specified study criteria. The eligibility criteria for participation included being a Turkish citizen, aged between 24 and 35 years, in the lactation periods of 4–7 or 13–19 weeks at the beginning of the study, feeding the infant only breast milk, expressing breast milk using a breast pump, not implementing a specific dietary program during the lactation period, refraining from engaging in heavy or regular physical activity, not undergoing treatment for any illness, not employed during the research period, having given birth at term, avoiding the use of herbal or chemical supplements that may affect milk production, not taking medications for any chronic conditions, abstaining from smoking and alcohol consumption, not using formula milk or introducing complementary feeding, the infant does not having a condition preventing breastfeeding (such as heart disease), and voluntary participation in the study. The exclusion criteria for constructing the sample were illness during the data collection period, starting medication during the study, not adhering to the prescribed nutrition programs, not attending routine meetings, and voluntarily leaving the study.

Considering that there may be periodic changes in the amount of breast milk, the mothers were divided into four groups for the study. The study was conducted with a total of 72 mothers, comprising 18 mothers aged 24–29 in the 13–24 weeks lactation period, 18 mothers aged 30–35 in the 13–24 weeks lactation period, 18 mothers aged 24–29 in the 4–12 weeks lactation period and 18 mothers aged 30–35 in the 4–12 weeks lactation period. Based on the results of the post-power analysis conducted on milk quantity and milk components, with an alpha level of 0.05, power of 0.85, and effect size of 0.45, the power of the study was determined to be 85% when evaluated based on milk components, and 99.9% when assessed using data obtained from milk quantity.

### Supporting lactation in otolaryngology patients through medication optimization, radiology considerations, and more: a literature review [^1124oV6k]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The benefits of breastfeeding are well established, with the American Academy of Pediatrics and Canadian guidelines recommending exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. However, maternal hospitalization, illness, medication use, and poor support can result in early termination of breastfeeding. Caring for breastfeeding patients in otolaryngology is a challenge because of the lack of literature regarding otolaryngology-specific medication safety, patient concerns, and inadequate education among otolaryngologists. This review highlights recent literature regarding lactation in otolaryngology patients, including medication, radiologic imaging, perioperative considerations, and subspecialty-specific considerations for lactating patients.

Observations

The majority of common medications used in general otolaryngology are safe for breastfeeding patients, including antihistamines, mucolytics, antitussives, antifungals, and decongestants. Certain analgesics and anti-inflammatories, such as tramadol, are not preferred in breastfeeding individuals. Some subspeciality-specific medications such as biologics (dupilumab) and methotrexate should be avoided. Lactating patients require special perioperative attention to ensure that optimal patient care is provided, such as managing supply, considering length of surgery, managing postoperative pain, and determining the safe amount of time until an infant can be fed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most medications can be safely used with lactating patients. If physicians are unsure about a medication's safety, they should consult appropriate resources prior to recommending breastfeeding cessation or to discard pumped milk.

### ABM clinical protocol # 15: analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, revised 2017 [^112DyU8f]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #15 — dexmedetomidine, FDA exposure advisory, and neuromuscular blockers indicates that dexmedetomidine has low oral availability and that a single study of milk levels following infusion used during cesarean delivery determined that a breastfed infant would receive a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.04–0.098%. The United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 issued a Drug Safety Communication warning of the risk of using general anesthesia and some sedative medications in young children and pregnant women, focusing on possible effects on brain development when these agents are used repeatedly or for more than 3 hours, and it notes that there is no evidence to suggest a similar concern over use of anesthetic agents and medications in a breastfeeding mother. It adds that neuromuscular blocking agents are safe for the breastfeeding infant, as they have very low lipid solubility and are largely distributed in the extracellular fluid volume.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11743Xk7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Metoclopramide

Metoclopramide is another widely used galactagogue. Early clinical trials in the pharmacological treatment for improving breastmilk insufficiency often focused on metoclopramide. Our analysis revealed there was no difference in the increased breast milk volume between metoclopramide and placebo for mothers with breast milk insufficiency. This finding was consistent with two recent systematic reviews. The difference in lactation efficacy between domperidone and metoclopramide, which are both dopamine antagonists, may be due to the following two reasons: First, metoclopramide is more lipid soluble, has lower molecular weight, higher protein binding than domperidone. Second, the medication duration of metoclopramide is too short. A recent meta-analysis found that two-week metoclopramide therapy didn't elevate prolactin levels, but three-week therapy did. However, in the studies involved in our analysis, the duration of metoclopramide was 9.3 ± 5.1 days (only one study > two weeks).

One reason for the limited duration of metoclopramide administration is concern about its potential side effects. Unlike domperidone, metoclopramide does readily cross the blood-brain barrier, and has the potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects and other serious maternal adverse events, including depression. The prolonged use of metoclopramide is associated with an elevated frequency of tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, the experts' recommended dosage (less than five days, less than 10 mg three times daily) is not sufficient to improve breast milk insufficiency.

Limitation

Several limitations are still in our study. First, due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed, our conclusions are limited. Second, the included studies were heterogeneous in the details of interventions, including the treatment initiation, the treatment durations, and the dosage of medicine. Third, not all non-pharmacological breastfeeding strategies in the included studies were well described. Fourth, eligibility criteria varied widely across studies (details in Supplemental Table S2).

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^1138Q4JW]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Delivery and lactation — breastfeeding benefits and general guidance: The benefits of breastfeeding cannot be overstated and human milk provides an optimal amount of micro- and macronutrients for the newborn with both immunologic and antibacterial properties; breastfeeding favors maternal–infant bonding and is associated with decreased postpartum weight retention; long term, exclusively breastfed infants commonly have optimal growth and development, decreased incidence of acute and chronic diseases, and fewer developmental and psychological disorders; breastfeeding should be encouraged in the absence of medical contraindications; given the overwhelming evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding (for both the mother and the neonate), in most cases, continuing lactation will outweigh any theoretical risks associated with medication exposure; in all cases, extensive counseling is recommended with a detailed discussion of the risk-benefit ratio for each individual case; the route of delivery, vaginal or cesarean, is generally determined by obstetric considerations rather than the maternal arrhythmia; pain management during labor in patients at risk of arrhythmic complications or receiving antiarrhythmic therapy is important to prevent triggering maternal arrhythmias.

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^114JQSMF]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding support for late preterm and early term infants — milk expression and triple feeding — Institute or increase frequency of expressing (hand or pump), especially after a breastfeed if the breasts are not well drained, and if already using a breast pump appropriately, switch to a more effective type (e.g., hand to mechanical, mechanical to hand, or a more efficient mechanical pump); expressing more than six times a day may not be feasible for many mothers once their infant is home, whereas expressing eight or more times a day may be necessary to maximize milk removal. Triple feeding regimens (breastfeeding, followed by supplementation and then expressing) for every feed are effective, but they may not be sustainable for some mothers, especially if they have limited support at home, and the mother's ability to cope and manage breastfeeding and expressing must be taken into account when devising a feeding plan. Explore ways for the mother to relax while expressing: Arrange for help with other chores and to get more sleep, and in conjunction with the mother, consider the use of a galactogogue (a medicine or herb to increase her milk supply).

### ABM clinical protocol # 32: management of hyperlactation [^114yKyQp]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #32 — hyperlactation, also termed hypergalactia or oversupply, is the production of breast milk in excess of the volume required for growth of healthy infant(s), and no precise definition for this term exists; an average term infant consumes 450–1,200 mL daily, and production volumes higher than this may represent hyperlactation. Patients with hyperlactation may experience breastfeeding complications including breast pain, plugged ducts, and mastitis, and dyads are at risk for early weaning and/or exclusive pumping due to latch difficulties and/or forceful letdown. If medical complications and/or psychological distress occur, women with hyperlactation may be advised to decrease their milk production, and behavioral interventions, herbal therapies, and prescription medications have been used to treat hyperlactation, with varying success rates and levels of evidence, although determination of optimal therapy regimens, such as dosage and frequency, remains challenging.

### Aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada INITIO) [^114n2DKP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period may lead to clinically relevant decreases in milk supply which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the post-partum period. Effects on milk supply may be mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor the breastfeed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ARISTADA INITIO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ARISTADA INITIO or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ARISTADA INITIO in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ARISTADA INITIO in patients > 65 years of age have not been evaluated.

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. ARISTADA INITIO is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see
Warnings and Precautions
(5.1, 5.2)].

8.6 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers

Approximately 8% of Caucasians and 3–8% of Black/African Americans cannot metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM). Avoid use of ARISTADA INITIO in these patients because dosage adjustments are not possible (it is only available in one strength in a single-dose pre-filled syringe) [see
Dosage and Administration
(2.3),
Clinical Pharmacology
(12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic and Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment for ARISTADA INITIO is required based on a patient's hepatic function (mild to severe hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh score between 5 and 15), or renal function (mild to severe renal impairment, glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 90 mL/minute) [see Clinical Pharmacology
(12.3)].

8.8 Other Specific Populations

No dosage adjustment for ARISTADA INITIO is required on the basis of a patient's sex, race, or smoking status [see
Clinical Pharmacology
(12.3)].

### The use of galactogogues in the breastfeeding mother [^116A7HNz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data regarding the efficacy of galactogogues available in the US to increase breast milk production in postpartum mothers.

Data Sources

Literature was sought using PubMed (1966-June 2012) and EMBASE (1973-June 2012). Search terms included breastfeeding, breast milk, lactation, galactogogue, metoclopramide, oxytocin, fenugreek, milk thistle, silymarin, growth hormone, thyroid releasing hormone, medroxyprogesterone, domperidone, goat's rue, beer, Asparagus racemosus, shatavari, Medicago sativa, alfalfa, Onicus benedictus, blessed thistle, Galega officinalis, brewer's yeast, and herbals.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies including humans and published in English with data assessing the efficacy of galactogogues for increasing breast milk production were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Breast milk is considered the optimal food source for newborns through 1 year of age. Many factors influence overall maternal production, including maternal pain, illness, balance of time when returning to work, anxiety, or emotional stress. Although a variety of herbal and pharmaceutical options have anecdotal evidence of their ability to improve breast milk production, peer-reviewed studies proving their efficacy are lacking. Metoclopramide, oxytocin, fenugreek, and milk thistle have shown mixed results in improving milk production; however, the trials were small and had a variety of limitations.

Conclusions

Nonpharmacologic recommendations should be exhausted before adding therapy. Although anecdotal evidence encourages the use of metoclopramide, fenugreek, asparagus, and milk thistle for their galactogogue properties, efficacy and safety data in the literature are lacking. Oxytocin and domperidone are potentially available for compounding purposes, but safety data are limited. More studies are needed to evaluate the effects of available galactogogues on breast milk production.

### What supports mothers of very preterm babies to start and continue breast milk feeding neonatal units? A qualitative COM-B analysis of mothers' experiences [^114N2AM7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding how to sustain and increase milk supply

The majority of mothers had no previous experience of expressing. They valued information from staff about how to maintain or increase their milk supply during long-term expressing (C), including pumping at night, power pumping, eating nutritious foods, taking the milk-stimulating medication domperidone, and keeping a record of their expressing in order to work out the best times.

A few mothers at Units A, C and D commented that they had not been given this information, or nurses made idiosyncratic suggestions, for example "have sweet desserts with almonds in it and coconut powder" (M01), without the mother having a way to evaluate the validity of the advice:

"The nurses, just because they're also mums, I feel that most of them rely more on their personal experience rather than the correct knowledge… I think maybe they can make an induction package for mums, rather than every time you meet a new nurse she will ask you, 'Have you tried this?' " M18.

Several mothers commented that they found it difficult to ask for feeding information unless it was specifically offered. Mothers who had experienced support from specialist infant feeding staff at Units A and B found this helpful: these staff had greater expertise, they took the initiative in checking on progress and offering support, and the mothers did not feel guilty taking staff time away from looking after the babies, as they did with regular nurses.

"Mums can sometimes be too nervous to ask… [The specialist] would check in on us and see how we were doing and asked what she could do to help. It was very proactive… The nurses were looking after three or four babies at a time, so it was nice to go, 'Okay, I'm not going to put pressure on the nurses, I'll go and speak to the specialist who is free and around to talk about this particular subject'. M04.

However, mothers at Units A and B could not always access this specialist support when they needed it.

"There was no set place where the breastfeeding women were, they were just floating, so you don't know where to find them, it's just if they happen to come into your room you'd collar them. I don't even know if there was a breastfeeding specialist there every day". M03.

### Improving drug exposure knowledge during lactation: quality improvement initiative in low-income women [^111fpmmF]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To improve maternal knowledge on medication and substance usage during lactation through prenatal breastfeeding education and assess breastfeeding rates at 2–4 and 6–8 weeks postpartum. Study Design: This quality improvement initiative occurred between August 2016 and October 2017. Pregnant women without contraindications to breastfeeding receiving prenatal care at one of four prenatal sites in Florida were eligible. Enrolled women participated in a 1-hour interactive session consisting of basic breastfeeding education and medication or substance use during lactation. Demographic information, medical history, and pre/post breastfeeding knowledge scores were obtained. Regression analysis was utilized to evaluate the influence of medication usage on breastfeeding rates at 2–4 and 6–8 weeks postpartum. Results: The majority of participants (N = 121; median age = 26) were Hispanic (64%), unmarried (70%), and unemployed (60%). Approximately 25% were on medications other than supplements. Of those, one-third reported concerns regarding medication usage and infant safety during lactation. Knowledge regarding postpartum medications or substances and their breastfeeding compatibility increased significantly postintervention; however, women who were using medications at 2–4 and 6–8 weeks postpartum were 4 times as likely to mix feed or formula feed as compared with mothers not taking medications (adjusted odds ratio [OR] at 2–4 weeks = 3.693 confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.398–9.757) and adjusted OR at 6–8 weeks = 4.208 (95% CI: 1.009–17.548). Conclusions: This prenatal breastfeeding education targeting low-income women improved knowledge on medication usage and lactation. However, despite increasing breastfeeding knowledge, medication use appears to influence infant feeding behaviors at 2–4 and 6–8 weeks postpartum.

### Longitudinal trends in domperidone dispensing to mothers of very preterm infants and its association with breast milk feeding at infant discharge: a retrospective study [^115YL58u]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

We found breastfeeding rates remained lower at infant discharge despite domperidone dispensing compared with women who were not dispensed domperidone. Our real-world evaluation of breast milk feeding rates at infant discharge was 63% and compares to continued breastfeeding rates of 54.6%–95% in previous clinical trials of mothers of preterm infants. The variation in breastfeeding rates across different clinical trials and our study may stem from variations in the breastfeeding supports available at other sites, and differences in the patient population, such as gestational ages at birth. As noted in the prescribing checklist, domperidone should only be prescribed following the provision and trial of appropriate non-pharmacological lactation support strategies.

Despite a significant reduction in the prevalence of domperidone prescribing following the EMA recommendations, no corresponding changes were identified in the overall prevalence of continued breast milk feeding at infant discharge. This could be interpreted as suggesting that dispensing of domperidone has a limited overall effect on longer-term breast milk feeding outcomes. Within those dispensed domperidone, we found improved breastfeeding outcomes associated with multiple domperidone dispensings compared with a single dispensing of domperidone. These findings may indicate that longer durations of domperidone use (greater than 7 days) may be associated with improved treatment outcomes. Alternatively, differences in outcomes based on treatment duration could reflect those in which domperidone is considered effective, choosing to continue to use it for longer. What remains clear is that determining the optimal treatment duration and identifying individual-level factors influencing treatment response to domperidone remain clear research priorities.

Limitations

The current study has several limitations. We had no information on domperidone dispensing occurring outside of the hospital. However, given that the hospital has a well-established internal process for prescribing and dispensing domperidone from the hospital pharmacy, where the medication is provided free of charge, we anticipate that the number of women choosing to get domperidone dispensed outside the hospital is small. In addition, no information was available about the degree of lactation support women had before their domperidone prescription. Lastly, routinely collected data on continued breast milk feeding at infant discharge did not discriminate between whether infants were exclusively fed their mother's breast milk or receiving mixed feeds.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111pACGD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Methods/design

Primary research question

The primary research question is: in mothers of preterm infants 23–29 completed weeks (23 1/7–29 6/7 weeks) gestation at birth who are pumping to provide expressed breast milk for their infant(s) and are identified as having an inadequate milk supply, does the administration of domperidone compare to placebo increase breast milk volume without any signs of harm over a 2 week period?

Secondary research questions

There are several secondary research questions:

i. Is there a relationship between the volume of breast milk produced and timing of initiation and duration of domperidone to treat mothers with defined low breast milk supply?

ii. Does gestation at birth contribute to any treatment effect from domperidone in mothers with defined low breast milk supply?

iii. Is there a difference in the volume of breast milk produced in mothers identified having an inadequate supply within 7–14 days post delivery versus mothers identified 15–21 days post delivery?

iv. Is there a difference in the use of supplementation such as donor breast milk or preterm infant formula between the different strategies of administration during the study period?

v. Is there a difference in the use of supplementation, such as formula or donor breast milk by the mother to her infant at 40 weeks post conceptual age (term) and at 6 weeks corrected age (6 weeks post term) between the two groups?

vi. Is there a difference in potential adverse events or effects, in particular, those related to gastrointestinal or cardiac difficulties between the two approaches?

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114jJMNP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding is the most advantageous nutrition for infants because of its many health benefits. However, lactation insufficiency is a prevalent issue among women, particularly those who give birth prematurely. Galactagogues, such as domperidone and metoclopramide, have been reported and may be beneficial for lactation insufficiency. However, the optimal pharmacological galactagogue remains unclear.

Methods

The PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from their inception to April 23, 2023. The primary aim of this research was to assess the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide using Bayesian network meta-analysis. The efficacy outcome was the increased breast milk volume (in mL/day). The safety outcome was the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse events during the study period.

Results

Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the final analyses. Preterm mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 82.84, 95% CI: 37.04–118.95; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 88.30, 95% CI: 59.48–118.62). However, in the term mothers, domperidone did not show the above benefit compared with metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 93.67, 95% CI: -186.11–375.59; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 126.25, 95% CI: -49.91–304.55). Both in preterm and term mothers, metoclopramide was no better than the placebo. There was no difference in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse outcomes among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo.

Conclusion

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 21: breastfeeding in the setting of substance use and substance use disorder (revised 2023) [^111d1gZD]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ABM Protocol #21 — relative infant dose (RID) and pharmacokinetics explains that RID depends on drug pharmacology, maternal exposure and metabolism into breast milk, infant gastrointestinal absorption, metabolism, and gestational age, and sets thresholds: substances with RID values < 10% are generally considered safe for a breastfeeding infant, whereas substances with RID values of > 25% should be avoided in breastfeeding mothers. Because data for most illicit substances are limited, pharmacokinetic and RID data from prescribed substances with similar properties are included to inform decision-making, and Tables 1 and 2 list key measures including half-life and peak effect relative to maternal plasma concentration to guide timing of breastfeeding.

### Domperidone to increase breast milk supply in mothers of… [^112QhXSv]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Breast milk is considered optimal nutrition for all infants, even in the neonatal intensive care unit. Increasingly, mothers of preterm infants are encouraged to express breast milk for their newborns. However, providing an adequate milk supply for preterm infants can be difficult, and medications such as domperidone and metoclopramide are often used to increase the milk supply. Domperidone augments lactation by increasing prolactin concentration. The galactagogue dosage of 10 to 20 mg three times per day is less than the maximum approved oral dosage, and is generally well tolerated. Domperidone does not cross the blood-brain barrier and is excreted only minimally into breast milk. Women were excluded if they were already taking domperidone or any medication known to alter or interact with it; or if they had mastitis, chronic illness, previous breast surgery, or known lactose intolerance.

The primary outcome was the change in breast milk protein concentration, with secondary outcomes of changes within patients of fat, carbohydrate, lactose, energy, calcium, phosphate, and sodium concentration; daily breast milk volume; prolactin levels; and breastfeeding rates two weeks after study completion and at infant's discharge. Women enrolled in the study took 10 mg of domperidone three times a day or an identical placebo for two weeks, and recorded baseline and daily milk volumes. Samples were collected on days 0, 4, 7, and 14 for protein and electrolyte analysis. Results: The study was powered to detect a change of 20 percent or more in protein content in the domperidone group compared with the placebo group. Of the 278 mothers who delivered before 31 weeks' gestation, 46 provided informed consent and were randomized to participate.

The mean within-patient breast milk volume increased by 267 percent in the domperidone group and by 19 percent in the placebo group. Protein and fat concentration did not change significantly, although the carbohydrate concentration increased 2. 7 percent in the domperidone group and decreased
2. 7 percent in the placebo group. No adverse events were reported in mothers or infants. Conclusion: The authors conclude that domperidone notably increases breast milk volume without substantial changes to breast milk composition.
