## Question

Is mastitis associated with neonatal infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mastitis is associated with neonatal infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entities involved and make sure we distinguish neonatal mastitis from maternal lactational mastitis. Then, I should verify the directionality of association: does neonatal mastitis predict concurrent serious bacterial infection in the neonate, and does maternal mastitis increase neonatal infection risk via breast milk transmission. Next, I will review the best available evidence for each direction, including large cohorts, case series, and guidelines. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and note exceptions and management implications.

> Let me first confirm the entities so I don't conflate them. Neonatal mastitis is an uncommon breast infection in infants, typically presenting with erythema, induration, and tenderness of the breast bud, and it can progress to abscess; most cases are localized and well-appearing, though systemic illness can occur [^111y3fjS]. Maternal lactational mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the lactating breast, often segmental, with a spectrum from noninfectious inflammation to bacterial infection, most commonly due to Staphylococcus or Streptococcus species, and it is not considered contagious to the infant in routine care [^112SdFAY] [^113H1epL].

> Now, I will examine the first direction: does neonatal mastitis indicate a concurrent serious bacterial infection in the infant. Wait, let me verify the best evidence here. A large multicenter cohort of 657 infants with mastitis found that 98% were well-appearing and that serious bacterial infections were rare: bacteremia 0.3%, UTI 1.1%, and meningitis 0.4%, with only 1.5% developing sepsis or shock and no deaths, supporting that most neonatal mastitis is localized and low risk for SBI [^117BSdm3]. Hold on, I should double-check the testing burden because practice often overcalls SBI; indeed, cultures were obtained in many infants but remained overwhelmingly negative, reinforcing that routine SBI workups are often unnecessary in well-appearing, afebrile neonates with mastitis [^117BSdm3]. A companion review echoes this, concluding that evaluation for SBI is likely unnecessary in most afebrile, well-appearing infants with mastitis, which aligns with a more conservative, observation-first approach in low-risk presentations [^111y3fjS].

> Next, I should review the second direction: does maternal mastitis increase neonatal infection risk via breast milk transmission. Let me consider the strongest signals. Multiple case reports and small series document late-onset neonatal GBS disease linked to GBS in breast milk, including recurrent episodes with clonal isolates, suggesting milk as a plausible reservoir in some cases even when mothers are asymptomatic or rectovaginal cultures are negative [^115qrfQz] [^114PZHjr] [^116T4nzN]. I need to check broader syntheses; a literature review identified 48 cases of GBS late-onset disease associated with contaminated breast milk, with high recurrence and clonality in typed cases, supporting a transmission pathway in a subset of infants, though the absolute risk appears low given the rarity relative to breastfeeding exposure overall [^117KN51p]. But wait, what if maternal carriage is the real driver rather than milk per se; observational data show that maternal rectovaginal colonization is common at the time of neonatal LOD, whereas overt maternal mastitis is infrequent, implying that silent ductal colonization or a circular infant–mother–infant transmission model may be operative in some cases [^112uoQSx] [^1167rsEN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should reconcile these findings with guideline perspectives. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine emphasizes that bacterial mastitis is not a contagious entity and does not require interruption of breastfeeding, reflecting that most maternal mastitis is manageable without posing a direct transmission risk to infants, which fits the general experience of low event rates despite frequent breastfeeding during maternal infection [^112SdFAY]. I should confirm that this applies to typical pathogens like Staphylococcus; yes, ABM guidance supports continued breastfeeding during maternal bacterial mastitis unless there is a specific contraindication, aligning with the notion that routine cessation is unnecessary [^111q9yLk].

> I will now examine special contexts that modify risk or management. In maternal HIV infection, mastitis and related breast conditions can increase the risk of HIV transmission via breast milk, and guidelines recommend prompt identification and treatment of mastitis, temporary cessation if viral load becomes detectable, and coordinated infant prophylaxis and testing plans, underscoring a different risk calculus than for bacterial mastitis alone [^111oT8zN] [^111JK4kc]. Let me also consider outbreak contexts; reports describe clusters where maternal S. aureus mastitis coincided with neonatal skin infections, suggesting potential intrafamilial or nursery transmission dynamics in select settings, though these are exceptional rather than routine scenarios [^112tpk7r] [^112ea62Z].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, there is an association, but it is asymmetric and context dependent. Neonatal mastitis is only weakly associated with concurrent serious bacterial infection; most cases are localized and low risk, so routine SBI evaluation is unnecessary in well-appearing, afebrile infants, though clinicians must remain vigilant for red flags such as fever, lethargy, or poor feeding [^117BSdm3] [^111y3fjS]. Conversely, maternal mastitis can, in rare instances, be associated with neonatal infection via breast milk transmission, particularly for GBS late-onset disease, but this appears uncommon and often relates to maternal colonization dynamics and a subset of high-risk scenarios rather than typical maternal mastitis presentations [^117KN51p] [^1167rsEN]. Management should be individualized: continue breastfeeding during maternal bacterial mastitis unless contraindicated, treat maternal disease promptly, and consider milk culture in recurrent or high-risk contexts, while avoiding unnecessary invasive testing in low-risk neonates with isolated mastitis [^112SdFAY] [^113HAQcj].

---

Mastitis is associated with neonatal infections, but the risk is **low** and most cases are localized and mild [^117BSdm3]. Serious bacterial infections (SBI) such as bacteremia, meningitis, or UTI occur in **about 1–2%** of neonates with mastitis, and are strongly linked to systemic symptoms (fever, lethargy, poor feeding) [^111y3fjS]. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus species [^117BSdm3]; rare cases of GBS transmission via breast milk have been reported [^115qrfQz] [^114PZHjr]. Routine SBI evaluation is **unnecessary in well-appearing, afebrile infants** with localized mastitis, but clinicians should maintain a low threshold for testing and treatment if systemic signs are present [^111y3fjS] [^111xmq75].

---

## Incidence and clinical presentation of neonatal mastitis

Neonatal mastitis is **uncommon**, typically presenting in the first 2 months of life with erythema, induration, tenderness, and sometimes fluctuance or purulent discharge [^111y3fjS]. Most infants are well-appearing and afebrile, though fever and systemic symptoms can occur [^117BSdm3].

---

## Association with serious bacterial infections (SBI)

Although neonatal mastitis is usually localized, there is a recognized association with SBI, including bacteremia, meningitis, and urinary tract infection (UTI) [^117BSdm3]. The incidence of SBI in neonates with mastitis is approximately **1–2%**, with higher risk in infants who are febrile, ill-appearing, or have systemic symptoms [^111y3fjS].

---

## Common pathogens associated with neonatal mastitis

The most frequently isolated pathogens in neonatal mastitis include:

| **Pathogen** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) | Most common |
| Streptococcus species (including group B Streptococcus) | Less common |
| Gram-negative enteric organisms (e.g. Escherichia coli) | Rare |

---

Rarely, **group B Streptococcus (GBS)** has been implicated in neonatal mastitis, with documented cases of transmission through breast milk, particularly in recurrent or late-onset infections [^111xmq75] [^115qrfQz] [^114PZHjr].

---

## Risk factors for concurrent serious bacterial infections

Several factors increase the risk of SBI in neonates with mastitis:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, lethargy, poor feeding, or irritability significantly increase the risk of SBI [^notfound].
- **Age**: Younger infants, particularly those under 28 days, have a higher risk due to immature immune systems [^notfound].
- **Pathogen type**: MRSA or GBS infections are associated with more severe disease and higher risk of complications [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Routine evaluation for SBI in all neonates with mastitis is **not necessary** [^115QmaML]. A targeted approach is recommended:

- **Well-appearing, afebrile infants**: Clinical observation and localized management are appropriate; routine blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures are not indicated [^111xmq75].
- **Febrile or ill-appearing infants**: Blood cultures, urinalysis, and CSF analysis should be considered due to the higher risk of SBI [^notfound].
- **Breast milk or abscess cultures**: Useful in guiding antibiotic therapy, particularly in recurrent or severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Most neonates with mastitis experience **favorable outcomes** with appropriate antibiotic therapy [^111y3fjS]. Complications such as breast abscess, tissue necrosis, or scarring are rare but can occur, particularly if treatment is delayed or inadequate [^117BSdm3] [^115nLS9e]. Severe complications, including sepsis or meningitis, are uncommon but require prompt recognition and aggressive management [^117BSdm3].

---

## Preventive measures and management strategies

Effective management of neonatal mastitis includes:

- **Prompt antibiotic therapy**: Empiric coverage for Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus species is recommended, with adjustments based on culture results [^111xmq75].
- **Drainage**: Surgical drainage may be necessary if an abscess forms [^115nLS9e].
- **Supportive care**: Analgesia, hydration, and close clinical monitoring are essential [^notfound].
- **Breastfeeding**: Continued breastfeeding from the affected breast is generally safe and beneficial, except in rare cases where the mother is on contraindicated medications or has severe infection [^112Drvzq].

---

## Conclusion

Mastitis in neonates is associated with a **low but significant risk of serious bacterial infections**, including bacteremia, meningitis, and UTI [^117BSdm3]. The risk is higher in infants with systemic symptoms or specific pathogens such as MRSA or GBS. Routine evaluation for SBI is not necessary in well-appearing, afebrile infants, but clinicians should maintain a low threshold for testing and treatment in infants with systemic signs or risk factors [^117BSdm3].

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^111Woo6U]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization and Australian authorities recommend that babies are exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life. During this time, and especially in the early weeks, breastfeeding women can experience a range of breastfeeding problems, in particular breast and nipple pain, or breast infections such as mastitis or "breast thrush".

Mastitis is an acute, debilitating infection that occurs in 15 to 20% of Australian breastfeeding women who experience a red, painful breast with fever. Seventy five percent of mastitis episodes occur in the first seven weeks following birth. It is a painful, distressing condition which may require hospitalisation or lead to development of a breast abscess. Traditionally, S. aureus has been considered the most common aetiological agent of mastitis and is commonly isolated in infective mastitis and from breast abscesses. However, recent studies have suggested that other micro-organisms such as coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) may also play an important role in infectious mastitis. CNS such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are normal inhabitants of the skin in healthy hosts and are considered commensal bacterial skin flora. The suggestion that CNS such as S. epidermidis may be involved in infective mastitis highlights that, although S. aureus is certainly one cause of mastitis, commensal skin flora which have previously been thought of as non-pathogenic, may also be responsible for this illness in a proportion of breastfeeding women.

Breastfeeding women may also experience burning nipple/breast pain known as breast thrush (not associated with breast redness or fever) which occurs in about 10% of breastfeeding women. While the aetiology of mastitis has been investigated, the organism(s) associated with the development of breast thrush have not been identified. Some researchers and clinicians believe that the underlying pathogenesis in lactating women with burning nipple and breast pain is infection with C. albicans. However, it has proved difficult to identify this organism from breast milk, and others attribute the pain to infection with S. aureus and treat women with long-term anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. Another possibility is that this syndrome could be caused by multiple organisms. Co-infection with S. aureus and C. albicans or other Candida spp in the lactating nipple and breast may be leading to inflammation and pain. These organisms co-exist in infectious conditions in other moist parts of the body, such as angular cheilitis (in the corners of the mouth) and paronychia (infection around the finger nail). This is currently a hotly debated issue and the pathogenesis of breast thrush is unclear.

### Serotype III Streptococcus agalactiae from bovine milk and human neonatal infections [^111XxhMg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]) causes invasive human infections and bovine mastitis. This study examined the genetic relationship between bovine and human serotype III GBS by using molecular techniques that classify human serotype III GBS into four distinct phylogenetic lineages. Bovine serotype III GBS were largely contained in two lineages, which are distinct from the two major lineages (restriction digest types III-2 and III-3) that infect human neonates. One of the bovine lineages closely resembles the human III-1 lineage, whose members occasionally cause human neonatal infections. The bovine strains in the other lineage characteristically have an initiation factor IF2 gene (infB) H allele and multilocus sequence types that are not found in human GBS strains. Evidence suggests that this "H allele" lineage is related to the human III-3 lineage. These results support the assertion that human and bovine GBS are largely unrelated and provide further insight into the genetic relation between human and bovine GBS.

### The controversial role of breast milk in GBS late-onset disease [^115kA4Vm]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is one of the most common causes of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Intra-partum antibiotic prophylaxis does not play a significant role in reducing the risk of GBS late-onset disease. One of the proposed mechanisms for GBS late-onset disease is infection through contaminated breast milk. Infants in whom breast milk is thought to be the source for GBS late-onset disease are more heavily colonised and reports suggest they have a higher recurrence rate compared to infants with other potential sources. There is no consensus whether the breast milk of mothers of infants with GBS late-onset disease, especially those with recurrent episodes, should be tested for GBS. In addition, recommendations differ on whether breast-feeding should be interrupted or breast milk pasteurised, or whether the mother and infant should be treated for colonisation. In this review we discuss these different approaches.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^113PVoxb]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — pump and household hygiene: Avoid routine sterilization of pumps and household items. Mastitis is not contagious and does not result from unhygienic practices. Pump parts should be cleaned appropriately after each use, but routine sterilization of pumps and other household items is not necessary to prevent mastitis. Avoid cleaning of nipple as this may cause skin maceration and pain. Ascending infection is not supported by the highly vascular nature of nipple physiology and anatomy, and similar to other open sites of trauma in the body, external communication prevents deep tissue infection rather than promotes it.

### NASPGHAN practice guidelines: diagnosis and management of hepatitis C infection in infants, children, and adolescents [^114pBKZC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Perinatal transmission modifiers and delivery practices — High maternal HCV viral load (≥ 6,000,000 IU/mL) appears to favor mother-to-infant HCV transmission, and internal fetal monitoring, prolonged rupture of membranes, and fetal anoxia around delivery as indicated by decreased cord blood pH may enhance the risk of infection, whereas the role of amniocentesis cannot be evaluated based on available data. Elective cesarean section is not required for HCV-monoinfected women because it confers no reduction in the rate of mother-to-infant HCV transmission; with vaginal delivery, large vaginal tears should be avoided. Breast-feeding does not promote HCV transmission from mother to infant, but it is prudent to avoid breast-feeding if the nipples are bleeding, if mastitis is present, or if the mother is experiencing a flare of hepatitis with jaundice postpartum. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that screening all of the asymptomatic mothers for CHC is not cost-effective; however, mothers at high risk for HCV should be screened for HCV.

### Group B streptococci in milk and late neonatal infections: an analysis of cases in the literature [^117KN51p]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The source for late-onset neonatal infections (LONI) due to group B Streptococcus (GBS) has not been fully explored. We reviewed GBS LONI cases associated with contaminated breast milk to determine whether breast milk was a possible route for neonatal infection.

Data Sources

A PubMed search from January 1977 to March 2013 was performed with MeSH words "Streptococcus agalactiae", "group B Streptococcus", "infection", "milk", "human", "late-onset infection" and/or "neonate"; relevant cross references were also reviewed.

Results

Forty-eight documented cases of GBS LONI matched our search criteria and were retrieved from the literature. When performed, molecular typing identified clonal isolates in the neonate and milk samples taken after LONI in all cases, with the hypervirulent sequence type 17 (ST-17) clone identified in two of these cases. Caesarean delivery combined with the absence of GBS recovery from maternal samples other than milk was noted for four cases. The rate of recurrent infections was high (35%) and, together with the data reviewed, points to a potential role of breast milk in GBS LONI.

Conclusions

The cases reviewed here, together with the evidence of breast milk transmission for other pathogens, suggest that breast milk, which would account for repeated GBS transmission to the neonate, may favour gut translocation and subsequent LONI. Further investigations are nevertheless needed to study the relative importance of this contamination route compared with persistent postnatal gut colonisation and the dynamics of milk and neonatal gut colonisation.

### Neonatal mastitis and concurrent serious bacterial infection [^117BSdm3]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Describe the clinical presentation, prevalence, and outcomes of concurrent serious bacterial infection (SBI) among infants with mastitis.

Methods

Within the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Collaborative Research Committee, 28 sites reviewed records of infants aged ≤ 90 days with mastitis who were seen in the emergency department between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were summarized.

Results

Among 657 infants (median age 21 days), 641 (98%) were well appearing, 138 (21%) had history of fever at home or in the emergency department, and 63 (10%) had reported fussiness or poor feeding. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were collected in 581 (88%), 274 (42%), and 216 (33%) infants, respectively. Pathogens grew in 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–1.2) of blood, 1.1% (95% CI 0.2–3.2) of urine, and 0.4% (95% CI 0.01–2.5) of cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Cultures from the site of infection were obtained in 335 (51%) infants, with 77% (95% CI 72–81) growing a pathogen, most commonly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (54%), followed by methicillin-susceptible S aureus (29%), and unspecified S aureus (8%). A total of 591 (90%) infants were admitted to the hospital, with 22 (3.7%) admitted to an ICU. Overall, 10 (1.5% [95% CI 0.7–2.8]) had sepsis or shock, and 2 (0.3% [95% CI 0.04–1.1]) had severe cellulitis or necrotizing soft tissue infection. None received vasopressors or endotracheal intubation. There were no deaths.

Conclusions

In this multicenter cohort, mild localized disease was typical of neonatal mastitis. SBI and adverse outcomes were rare. Evaluation for SBI is likely unnecessary in most afebrile, well-appearing infants with mastitis.

### NASPGHAN practice guidelines: diagnosis and management of hepatitis C infection in infants, children, and adolescents [^116qUwbT]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Special considerations for pediatric hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — For blood exposures, "Thoroughly clean spill area using a dilution of 1 part household bleach to 10 parts water. Gloves should be worn when cleaning up blood spills (refer to www.CDC.gov)". For minor cuts or bruises, "Observe universal precautions". Regarding over-the-counter analgesics/antipyretics, "Occasional use is acceptable. NSAIDs should be avoided in those with varices". Immunization guidance states children "Should receive all of the age-appropriate immunizations, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines". Additional counseling includes "Obesity may further burden liver health and negatively influence response to HCV therapy (88,89)", "No restrictions to school and sports", and "Avoid alcohol consumption because it strongly correlates with rapid progression of liver disease (90)". Risk reduction advises to "Avoid high-risk behaviors that will promote HCV reinfection (posttreatment) and transmission of other viruses". In pregnancy, "Because there are presently no effective strategies to prevent perinatal HCV transmission, universal screening of pregnant women is not recommended (91)". Obstetrical-perinatal guidance states, "Vertical transmission of HCV is similar between infants born by C-section or vaginally; however, prolonged rupture of membranes and the use of fetal scalp probes are associated with increased HCV transmission rates and should be avoided (1B; AII) (92–94)". Postnatally, "The rate of vertical transmission is similar between breast- and bottle-fed infants. Hence, breast-feeding is not generally contraindicated in mothers with HCV infection. Breast-feeding should be avoided if there is mastitis or bleeding (1B; AII) (95–97)".

### Streptococcus agalactiae clones infecting humans were selected and fixed through the extensive use of tetracycline [^114u9F6r]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae, or Group B streptococcus (GBS) generate considerable neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the 1960s, it became the leading cause of neonatal infections in the US and in Europe. The first descriptions of the increase of GBS disease were reported in 1964 as between December 1961 to June 1963 GBS was described as the most frequent cause of neonatal sepsis at the Boston city hospitaland in 1965, when Kexel and Schönbohmreported three independent cases of meningitis caused by GBS at the Children's Clinic of the University of Bonn in Germany. However, in humans S. agalactiae is primarily a commensal of the digestive and urinary tracts, colonizing about 15–30% of healthy adults. Surprisingly, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of GBS isolated from different countries showed that most human carriage and clinical isolates cluster into only five major clonal complexes (CC) (CC1, CC10, CC17, CC19 and CC23)(Table 1). Among those, CC17 strains are considered 'hypervirulent' as they are responsible for the vast majority of the meningitis among neonates, and for more than 80% of the late-onset disease cases appearing after 7 days of life. In contrast, strains responsible for early-onset disease, appearing before the 6th day of life, belong to all five major CCs. A sixth CC, CC26 is common in African countries. In addition to causing disease in humans, GBS is also a veterinary pathogen, causing bovine mastitis. Distinct from human isolates, the majority of bovine isolates belongs to the CC67, a CC for which no human strains have been described. Phylogenetic analysis of 238 isolates of human and bovine origin based on the sequences of 15 genes revealed that CC17 strains represent a homogeneous group of strains of recent origin. The expansion of CC17 strains was suggested to have contributed to the emergence of GBS infections. However, until now, the events responsible for this expansion and the emergence of GBS neonatal infections were unknown.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^116CvmRi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to identify potential predisposing factors associated with human infectious mastitis.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study among breastfeeding women, with 368 cases (women with mastitis) and 148 controls. Data were collected by a questionnaire designed to obtain retrospective information about several factors related to medical history of mother and infant, different aspects of pregnancy, delivery and postpartum, and breastfeeding practices that could be involved in mastitis. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression model were used to examine the relationship between mastitis and these factors.

Results

The variables significantly- and independently-associated with mastitis were cracked nipples (P < 0.0001), oral antibiotics during breastfeeding (P < 0.0001), breast pumps (P < 0.0001), topical antifungal medication during breastfeeding (P = 0.0009), mastitis in previous lactations (P = 0.0014), breast milk coming in later than 24 h postpartum (P = 0.0016), history of mastitis in the family (P = 0.0028), mother-infant separation longer than 24 h (P = 0.0027), cream on nipples (P = 0.0228) and throat infection (P = 0.0224).

Conclusions

Valuable factors related to an increased risk of infectious mastitis have been identified. This knowledge will allow practitioners to provide appropriate management advice about modifiable risk factors, such as the use of pumps or inappropriate medication. They also could identify before delivery those women at an increased risk of developing mastitis, such as those having a familial history of mastitis, and thus develop strategies to prevent this condition.

### Adverse outcomes associated with neonatal mastitis… [^115UzJQG]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

If you see a young infant under 2 months of age who has mastitis, does that patient immediately receive a full sepsis workup. What criteria do you use to decide on a management plan. Until now, there has been little published evidence upon which to base our management of this condition. This week in. Pediatrics, we are early releasing an article by Dr. Ron Kaplan at the University of Washington and his colleagues on the American Academy of Pediatrics' Pediatric Emergency Collaborative Research Committee, entitled "Neonatal Mastitis and Concurrent Serious Bacterial Infection, " which discusses this topic. The authors conducted a retrospective study of 657 infants 90 days of age and younger who were diagnosed with mastitis in 28 emergency departments in the US, Canada, and Spain between 2008 and 2017. The median age of the infants was 21 days.

Although 98% were described as well-appearing, it is not surprising that blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were collected on 88%, 42%, and 33% of patients, respectively. 99% of these cultures remained negative. However, of the half who had cultures of the infected breast, 77% were positive. Perhaps not surprisingly, the most common organisms were methicillin-resistant. Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The vast majority of infants were hospitalized, but only 3. 7% required intensive care. Take a look at this article. It may change how you approach management of young infants with mastitis, particularly those who are afebrile and well-appearing.

### Correlates of mother-to-child human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission: association with maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA load, genital HIV-1 DNA shedding, and breast infections [^116uMcp1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of plasma, genital, and breast milk human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and breast infections on perinatal HIV-1 transmission, a nested case-control study was conducted within a randomized clinical trial of breast-feeding and formula feeding among HIV-1-seropositive mothers in Nairobi, Kenya. In analyses comparing 92 infected infants with 187 infants who were uninfected at 2 years, maternal viral RNA levels > 43,000 copies/mL (cohort median) were associated with a 4-fold increase in risk of transmission (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2–7.2). Maternal cervical HIV-1 DNA (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3–4.4), vaginal HIV-1 DNA (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1–4.7), and cervical or vaginal ulcers (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2–5.8) were significantly associated with infant infection, independent of plasma virus load. Breast-feeding (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–2.9) and mastitis (relative risk [RR], 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2–12.7) were associated with increased transmission overall, and mastitis (RR, 21.8; 95% CI, 2.3–211.0) and breast abscess (RR, 51.6; 95% CI, 4.7–571.0) were associated with late transmission (occurring > 2 months postpartum). Use of methods that decrease infant exposure to HIV-1 in maternal genital secretions or breast milk may enhance currently recommended perinatal HIV-1 interventions.

### Evaluation and treatment of community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus infections in term and late-preterm previously healthy neonates [^11318A2V]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe the evaluation and treatment of neonatal community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus disease in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the evaluation and treatment of 126 community-acquired S. aureus infections of term and late-preterm previously healthy neonates who were ≤ 30 days of age between August 2001 and July 2006 at Texas Children's Hospital.

Results

S. aureus infections included 43 pustulosis, 68 cellulitis/abscess, and 15 invasive infections. We found 84 methicillin-resistant and 42 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. Twenty-one patients received outpatient antibiotics before hospital presentation. Systemic infection evaluation included urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures in 79, 102, and 84 neonates, respectively. Culture revealed S. aureus urinary tract infections in 1, S. aureus bacteremias in 6, and aseptic cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis of unclear cause in 11 neonates. Physicians admitted 106, transferred 5 to other hospitals, and discharged 15 afebrile patients with topical or oral antibiotics. Clindamycin was the predominant antistaphylococcal intravenous and oral antibiotic for pustulosis and cellulitis/abscess infections. One patient with systemic S. aureus and herpes simplex virus infection died. At discharge after inpatient treatment, physicians prescribed no antibiotics for 43 patients and oral or topical antibiotics for 62 patients. Outpatient treatment failed for 1 patient who was discharged after intravenous therapy and was readmitted. Eighty percent (16 of 20) of patients with mastitis alone completed treatment with outpatient oral antibiotics.

Conclusions

Evaluation and treatment strategies for neonatal community-acquired S. aureus disease are varied at our hospital. Prospective studies are needed to determine optimal management strategies.

### Risk factors for treatment failure in neonates with skin and soft tissue infection: a retrospective cohort study [^1171GTgs]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

We aimed to describe the frequency of treatment failure and associated risk factors for treatment failure amongst neonates with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of neonates 0 to 28 days old with uncomplicated SSTIs presenting to the emergency department of a quaternary care children's hospital from 2009 to 2017. Data were collected via chart review. Skin and soft tissue infections included the following: cellulitis, abscess, mastitis, perirectal SSTI, carbuncle, and furuncle. Of the 202 neonates in the study, most were term, afebrile with mastitis, or perirectal SSTI. Treatment failure occurred in 8% (17/202) of neonates receiving oral antibiotics; 10 of these neonates had perirectal SSTIs and 2 had clindamycin and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with treatment failure had increased odds of having perirectal SSTIs (odds ratio [OR] = 4.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.46–11.31). Further studies are needed to identify strategies to prevent treatment failure in neonates with perirectal SSTIs.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^114zQVK4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long term infant and maternal health outcomes. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first 6 months of life as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is of concern that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at 5 months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation in order to extend the overall duration and improve long term maternal and child health outcomes.

Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It occurs in 15–21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia. Most episodes occur in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding. Almost one-third of women experience a recurrent episode, and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalisation.

Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition. Though not well described, the risk factors appear to be associated with milk stasis, nipple damage and maternal fatigue. Cracked nipples may facilitate entrance of microorganisms through the skin, and incomplete emptying of the breasts may result in milk stasis which provides a susceptible and receptive culture media for microorganisms. Decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection may be a result of maternal fatigue. Other risk factors include a history of mastitis with a previous child, using an antifungal nipple cream and using a manual breast pump.

Current management of mastitis generally centers on symptom management (i.e. applying hot/cold compresses, analgesics), encouragement of the continuation of breastfeeding (including fully emptying the affected breast, feeding more frequently, and changing feeding positions often), and antibiotic therapy. A Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in treating symptoms of mastitis in breastfeeding women showed a trend towards a benefit of treatment, but only 2 trials were included and were of limited quality, with one conducted over 30 years ago. As such, authors deduced there was insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^112VnUGF]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Lactational breast abscess — drain the abscess to achieve source control, with needle aspiration with fluid culture and sensitivity often recommended as the first-line intervention for lactational abscess; however, patients most often require recurrent aspirations and drain placement as the initial intervention should be considered for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction, and vacuum-assisted wound devices on a lactating breast should be strictly avoided. After aspiration or drain placement, mothers should continue breastfeeding from the affected breast, with milk fistula rate < 2%, and antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, though a shorter course may be appropriate if cellulitis resolves rapidly. Tissue inflammation and phlegmonous changes may persist for several weeks; patients should undergo interval examination and imaging to ensure resolution. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendations: C.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^111J24zt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Lactational mastitis constitutes one of the main medical causes of premature weaning due to pain and discomfort or as a result of inappropriate advise of a health professional. Since breastfeeding provides a wide range of health benefits for the mother-infant pair, mastitis constitutes a relevant Public Health issue. Some epidemiologic studies have been carried out to investigate the incidence and the potential risk factors that could be involved in infectious lactational mastitis. Risk factors that have been suggested to be strongly associated to mastitis include, among others, mastitis with a previous child, cracked or sore nipples, use of ointments, inappropriate breastfeeding practices, and peripartum antibiotherapy.

In Spain, the most recent National Survey of Health available (2011–2012) showed that the estimated prevalence of exclusive (mixed) breastfeeding was 66.2 (72.4)%, 53.6 (66.6)% and 28.5 (46.9)% at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, respectively, after birth. On the other hand, Spain ranks regular (24 out of 36) in the Breastfeeding Policy Scorecard for Developed Countries published recently according to maternity leave laws and right to daily nursing breaks, among other indicators. Furthermore, the number of centers that hold the Baby Friendly Hospital designation as institutions that promote breastfeeding, as well as the Breastfeeding Support Groups, has increased during the last decade. However, in contrast to this renewed interest that breastfeeding and human milk are receiving nowadays, lactational mastitis still remains widely unknown to the medical community, including the Spanish practitioners. In this sense, the Recommendations on Breastfeeding of the Lactation Committee of the Spanish Association of Paediatrics do not even mention mastitis as a common condition during lactation and one of the main medical causes of premature weaning.

In this study, a broad range of risk factors have been evaluated in a Spanish population. We have addressed some risks factors from literature and others that have not been taken in account in previous studies. To our knowledge this is the first large epidemiological study about risk factors for infectious mastitis among lactating women in a Spanish population.

### Incidence of mastitis in the neonatal period in a traditional breastfeeding society: results of a cohort study [^114AtFUB]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis is a painful problem experienced by breastfeeding women, especially in the first few weeks postpartum. There have been limited studies of the incidence of mastitis from traditionally breastfeeding societies in South Asia. This study investigated the incidence, determinants, and management of mastitis in the first month postpartum, as well as its association with breastfeeding outcomes at 4 and 6 months postpartum, in western Nepal.

Subjects and Methods

Subjects were a subsample of 338 mothers participating in a larger prospective cohort study conducted in 2014 in western Nepal. Mothers were interviewed during the first month postpartum and again at 4 and 6 months to obtain information on breastfeeding practices. The association of mastitis and determinant variables was investigated using multivariable logistic regression, and the association with breastfeeding duration was examined using Kaplan-Meier estimation.

Results

The incidence of mastitis was 8.0% (95% confidence interval, 5.1%, 10.8%) in the first month postpartum. Prelacteal feeding (adjusted odds ratio = 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.03, 7.40) and cesarean section (adjusted odds ratio = 3.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.09, 11.42) were associated with a higher likelihood of mastitis. Kaplan-Meier estimation showed no significant difference in the duration of exclusive breastfeeding among the mothers who experienced an episode of mastitis and those who did not.

Conclusions

Roughly one in 10 (8.0%) women experienced mastitis in the first month postpartum, and there appeared to be little effect of mastitis on breastfeeding outcomes. Traditional breastfeeding practices should be encouraged, and the management of mastitis should be included as a part of lactation promotion.

### Hypervirulent Listeria monocytogenes clones' adaption to mammalian gut accounts for their association with dairy products [^111ABAyj]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

L isteria monocytogenes (Lm) is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen that can cause a severe invasive infection in human and animals called listeriosis. In humans, it occurs mostly in immunocompromised individuals, the elderlies and pregnant women, and has one of the highest case fatality rate among foodborne pathogens (20–30%). Human listeriosis manifests mostly as septicemia, central nervous system infections, and maternal–neonatal infections leading to major fetal or neonatal complications in 80% of the cases. In animals, especially in ruminants, it induces rhombencephalitis and abortions, and less frequently mastitis, which is often undiagnosed owing to the frequent absence of associated symptoms. Although very little is known about Lm fecal carriage in human, it occurs in clinically healthy ruminants, and correlates with Lm fecal shedding in the environment –. Indeed, a high prevalence of Lm has been observed in fecal samples of ruminant herds (e.g. 46.3% of dairy cattle, 30.6% of beef cattle, and 14.2% of sheep herds were contaminated in a total of 343 studied herds).

Lm is a genetically heterogeneous species in which isolates can be grouped into lineages, PCR serogroups, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) clonal complexes (CCs or clones)and core genome MLST (cgMLST) sublineages and types (CTs). A considerable heterogeneity in pathogenic potential among Lm isolates has been observed –. In particular, hypervirulent MLST clones with high clinical frequency have been identified, such as CC1, CC2, CC4, and CC6. CC1 is also highly associated with Lm -associated rhombencephalitis in ruminants, and the analysis of fecal samples of beef cattle and sheep herds has shown that serotype 4b (which includes CC1) is the most prevalent. Together, these data highlight the high virulence of this clone for cattle and its presence in farm environments. In contrast, CC9 and CC121 are associated to a food origin, are hypovirulent, and infect mostly highly immunocompromised individuals, in part owing to truncations in InlA, a major Lm virulence factorinvolved in the crossing of host barriers. In addition, CC121 has been shown to persist in food production environment.

### Risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of lactational mastitis [^113H1epL]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lactational mastitis:

- **Definition**: Lactational mastitis is a spectrum of inflammatory conditions of the breast in breastfeeding women, characterized by milk stasis, hyperlactation, and/or mammary dysbiosis, which can lead to infection.
- **Pathophysiology**: The primary factor in the pathophysiology of lactational mastitis is milk stasis due poor milk drainage or ductal obstruction, which triggers an inflammatory response. Disruption of the milk microbiome is another contributing factor. Acute bacterial mastitis is often caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains.
- **Epidemiology**: Lactational mastitis is estimated to occur in 2–33% of breastfeeding women.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for lactational mastitis include nipple trauma or fissures, plugged milk ducts, wearing a tight bra, deep breast massage, hyperlactation, frequent breast pumping, abrupt weaning, history of mastitis in previous pregnancies, as well as maternal obesity and smoking.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of lactational mastitis typically begins with localized breast pain, tenderness, erythema, and warmth, progressing to systemic symptoms if untreated.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for lactational mastitis is generally good with appropriate management. Most cases resolve within 48–72 hours of initiating treatment. However, recurrence is possible, particularly in the presence of underlying risk factors.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^111pTuLQ]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Milk microbiota

Human milk contains approximately 10⁶ bacteria/mL and is a continuous source of commensal, mutualistic, and/or potentially probiotic bacteria to the developing infant's gut. Dominant genera include Staphylococcus and Streptococcus with hundreds of other taxa identified through 16S rRNA sequencing. Human milk microbiota communities vary between women and over time, and likely comprise both maternal-origin bacteria and infant oral cavity bacteria that enter the milk duct via suckling. Human milk and infant gut microbiomes share a number of commensal organisms by the first week of life, with breastfeeding duration and exclusivity influencing these associations in a dose-dependent manner. However, human milk-derived species become less dominant in infants' guts by the first month, suggesting that these initial colonizers could have a specific, early role in infant immune development. Human milk bacteria may protect newborns from AMR pathogen colonization and infection through competitive exclusion of exogenous pathogens, production of antimicrobial compounds, and by enhancing intestinal cell mucin production, which reduces intestinal permeability and improves intestinal barrier function. For example, strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolated from human milk have been demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting a wide range of pathogenic bacteria in vivo, including multidrug-resistant E. coli. Finally, it is hypothesized that human milk bacteria prime the infant immune system by training intestinal cells to respond appropriately to commensals versus harmful pathogens. Development of a robust immune response is key to preventing AMR pathogen proliferation and infection in the developing child.

A substantial portion of the human milk microbiota is thought to comprise non-pathogenic maternal gut bacteria that have been endogenously transported from the mother's intestinal lumen to the mammary glands during late pregnancy and lactation. Because maternal-origin bacteria are particularly stable in the infant gut, it has been proposed that modulating the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy and/or lactation could positively impact the development of the infant gut microbiome. To our knowledge, associations between maternal gut microbiome modifications and increased infant resilience against AMR pathogen colonization or infection have not been directly explored.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^114k9k2N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

We must acknowledge that there are other limitations in this study. Firstly, women had a strong commitment to breastfeeding since many of them were members of breastfeeding support groups. Secondly, the data were obtained retrospectively, which leads to a reporting bias due to lack of information about some questions. And thirdly, the results must be carefully interpreted because some identified associations could be consequences of mastitis rather than its causes, which is also a limitation in the design of case–control studies. On the other hand, further studies are needed to confirm the relationship between mastitis and all the exploratory variables of this study that have not been considered in previous research findings. Additionally, the long and complex questionnaire, as well as the elapsed time from the analyses of milk samples to the questionnaire reception, accounted for the low response rate in cases (34%). In fact, this rate would have been improved if the questionnaire had been delivered and responded to by the time the breast milk samples were collected to be analyzed. This fact will be taken into account in future studies to increase the response rates.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^1134GvRW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mastitis is a common condition that affects up to 33% of women during lactation, although its incidence may be underestimated because of differences in case definition and reporting. However, as it has recently been addressed, most of the studies have not reported the true mastitis incidence to date, since it would be necessary to define a time limit for the collection of data and to know the size of the population at risk, that is, breastfeeding mothers in the area of study. On one hand, the term "infectious mastitis" has been applied only to acute cases, with both local (breast redness, engorgement and pain) and systemic symptoms; however, subacute mastitis, that include only local symptoms and are often characterized by a reduced milk secretion, have been systematically underreported. On the other hand, human milk cultures are rarely performed and, therefore, there are not standardized sampling and analysis procedures.

### Mastitis in children from birth to 17 years [^115vHKvM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Twenty-two cases of mastitis were evaluated between 1995 and 2003. Nine of the children were younger than 2 months of age, and 12 were older than 8 years of age. Girls accounted for 82% of the cases. Seven of the infections were true abscesses. Pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus in 5, Gram-negative bacilli in 3, group A Streptococcus in 1 and enterococcus in 1. These data suggest that mastitis in children occurs in 2 distinct age groups, neonates and pubescent/postpubescent; however, the clinical disease is similar in both populations.

### Single-dose oral azithromycin prophylaxis in planned vaginal delivery for sepsis prevention: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115GDn3B]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of oral azithromycin (AZI) as a preventive measure against postpartum infections of planned vaginal births has garnered a lot of interest in recent years and has been the subject of many randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, the results from these trials have not been consistent. Therefore, we aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the use of a single-dose of oral AZI is clinically significant.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central for RCTs from May to June 2023, comparing a single dose of oral AZI with placebo in patients undergoing planned vaginal delivery at a minimum of 28weeks of gestational age. The main outcomes were puerperal and neonatal sepsis. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.4.1 (Cochrane Collaboration). Heterogeneity was assessed with I² statistics.

Results

Four RCTs were included (mothers, n = 42235; newborns n = 42492). Approximately 49.8% of mothers received a single dose of oral AZI for sepsis prophylaxis. Compared with placebo, AZI significantly reduced the incidence of puerperal sepsis (risk ratio [RR], 0.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55–0.77]; P < 0.001), mastitis or breast abscess (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.42–0.79]; P < 0.001), endometritis (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.54–0.77]; P < 0.001), wound infection (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69–0.96]; P = 0.013), infection rate (RR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.51–0.76]; P < 0.001), and fever (RR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.28–0.89]; P = 0.018) in mothers. No statistically significant differences were identified between groups regarding maternal all-cause mortality and the use of prescribed postpartum antibiotics. Similarly, no statistical differences were noted in the neonatal group regarding sepsis, infection rate, and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

AZI appears to be an effective preventive measure against many postpartum infections in mothers but a substantial impact on neonatal outcomes has not yet been conclusively observed.

### Group B. streptococcus late-onset disease, contaminated breast milk and mothers persistently GBS negative: report of 3cases [^116T4nzN]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Human milk is fundamental for its nutritional properties and to protect newborns, but it is not sterile and can sometime transmit bacteria. Few anecdotal cases suggest that breast milk could be a possible source of group B Streptococcus (GBS) late onset disease, although the pathogenesis is not entirely understood.

Case Presentation

We report 3 cases of GBS late onset disease in full-term newborns. Fresh breast milk cultures yielded GBS, but mothers of neonates had no signs of mastitis and remained persistently GBS negative at rectovaginal site.

Conclusions

Breast milk containing group B Streptococcus can be a risk factor for late onset disease. The persistent negative maternal GBS status supports the assumption that newborns, colonised in the throat, could be the initial source of GBS, while the mammary gland could act as a GBS replication site. It is unclear whether a low bacterial load may represent only contamination rather than true milk infection.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — the mastitis spectrum — states that scientific evidence demonstrates that mastitis "encompasses a spectrum of conditions resulting from ductal inflammation and stromal edema", and that the "pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of each condition in the mastitis spectrum (ductal narrowing, inflammatory mastitis, bacterial mastitis, phlegmon, abscess, galactocele, and subacute mastitis) will be discussed hereunder", with "Early postpartum engorgement, a distinct condition" also reviewed. It describes progression whereby "If ductal narrowing and alveolar congestion are worsened by overstimulation of milk production, then inflammatory mastitis can develop, and acute bacterial mastitis may follow", which "can progress to phlegmon or abscess, particularly in the setting of tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage", and notes that "Galactoceles, which can result from unresolved hyperlactation, can become infected" and "Subacute mastitis occurs in the setting of chronic mammary dysbiosis, with bacterial biofilms narrowing ductal lumens". Protocol scope statements emphasize that "These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care", and that "Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient". Inclusivity language specifies that "The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recognizes that not all lactating individuals identify as women" and that the position is "to interpret clinical protocols within the framework of inclusivity of all breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk-feeding individuals". The document also states that it "now replaces ABM Protocols #4, Mastitis, and #20, Engorgement, which will both be retired; ABM Protocols #32 (Management of Hyperlactation) and #35 (Supporting Breastfeeding During Maternal or Child Hospitalization) may serve as useful adjuncts to this protocol".

Effect of CDI on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes

Of all patients, 68 cases and 67 controls had antenatal CDI. Data for delivery outcomes were available in 63 cases and 66 controls. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed for the 67 matched pairs with antenatal CDI (Tables 2–4). On univariate analysis, cases were more likely than controls to undergo cesarean delivery and had lower odds of GBS infection/colonization (Tables 2 and 3). On multivariable conditional logistic regression, after controlling for labor arrest disorders, the odds of cesarean delivery were higher in cases than controls (OR: 17.23, 95% CI, 2.19–543.19; p = 0.004). Controlling for antibiotic use, the odds for GBS infection remained low (OR: 0.25, 95% CI, 0.04–0.99; p = 0.049). The odds of cesarean delivery were higher, and the odds of GBS infections were lower in patients with CDI during pregnancy, but not with CDI in the pre-pregnancy period (Tables 2 and 3).

Table 2.
Association of antenatal CDI with pregnancy outcomes. *

Table 3.
Association of antenatal CDI with obstetric complications. *

Table 4.
Association of maternal antenatal CDI with neonatal outcomes.

As maternal and neonatal medical records are not routinely linked, data for several neonates were unavailable. Of the 54 documented live births in cases (of the 68 total cases: 9 had an abortion and 5 had no data on delivery outcome), data on neonatal complications and birthweight were available in 74.1% (40) and 85.2% (46) cases, respectively. Similarly, of the 57 controls with documented live births (of the 67 total controls: 9 had an abortion and 1 had no data on delivery outcome), data on neonatal complications and birthweight were available in 73.7% (42) and 82.5% (47), respectively. Of the patients with available information, neonatal outcomes were similar amongst cases and controls (Table 4).

Effect of postpartum CDI on obstetric complications

CDI in the postpartum period was not associated with higher odds of postpartum complications (mastitis, vaginitis, GBS infection/colonization, abscess at any site; p > 0.05).

### The challenge of mastitis [^11469QCn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

The process of lactation and feeding, referred to by some as the final stage of labour is remarkably successful. This phase of infant care has been subjected to considerable evolutionary pressure since the earliest mammals, reptiles and birds diversified. It has allowed thousands of species to occupy a vast range of ecological niches. Yet a significant complication of breast feeding remains inflammation of the lactating tissue: the pathology of mastitis. Mastitis rarely develops outside lactation, although it may affect individuals at any age in relation to congenital lesions such as duct ectasia, chronic disseminated infections such as tuberculosis, or during granulomatous, autoimmune or malignant processes. The immunology and consequences of mastitis as well as its impact on vertical transmission of infection require careful examination.

Pathophysiology of mastitis spectrum — mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland that most often presents in a segmental distribution of ducts, alveoli, and surrounding connective tissue, and ductal lumens can be narrowed by edema and hyperemia associated with hyperlactation as well as mammary dysbiosis. Mammary dysbiosis, or disruption of the milk microbiome, results from a complex interplay of factors including maternal genetics and medical conditions, exposure to antibiotics, use of probiotics, regular use of breast pumps, and Cesarean birth. Basic science research has demonstrated that multiple factors contribute to the development of mastitis and include host factors such as hyperlactation, microbial factors such as diversity of the milk microbiome, and medical factors such as antibiotic and probiotic use. Milk stasis has been postulated to be a potential initiating factor for mastitis, although scientific evidence has not proven a causation, and no evidence exists that specific foods cause mastitis. The lactating breast is a dynamic gland that responds to internal and external hormonal stimulation; the breast requires feedback inhibition to regulate milk production, and although reducing milk removal may transiently increase pain and erythema from alveolar distention and vascular congestion, it ultimately prevents future episodes as feedback inhibitor of lactation and other regulatory hormones decrease milk production. Mothers who experience persistent high milk production despite eliminating iatrogenic causes of excessive milk removal may require additional pharmacological treatment of hyperlactation.

### Group B. streptococcus late-onset disease, contaminated breast milk and mothers persistently GBS negative: report of 3cases [^1139PzL6]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Breast milk has primary importance for feeding of the newborn, because of its nutritional properties and the contribution to the development of host defences. However, human milk is not sterile and can sometime transmit bacteria. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal infections in developed countries. Two distinct syndromes are recognized: early-onset disease (EOD, from birth to day 6) and late-onset disease (LOD, from day 7 to 89). Several case reports have suggested breast milk as a possible source of GBS LOD. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of GBS transmission and LOD pathogenesis are not yet clear. GBS gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract colonisation is common, and it ranges in pregnant women from 4 to 36%. However, only 0.8 to 3.5% of mothers carry GBS in their breast milk.

We report 3 cases of LOD in full-term newborns who were breastfed with GBS contaminated milk. The newborns' mothers had no signs of mastitis and their rectovaginal swabs were permanently GBS negative (both at prenatal screening and at the time of diagnosis of LOD). These findings suggest that the transmission may occur through a circular mechanism: the newborn (colonised in the throat) could be the initial source of GBS, while the mammary gland could act as a GBS replication site.

### Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in skin and soft tissue infections, Northern Italy [^112ea62Z]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Skin and Soft Tissue Infections in Mothers and Neonates

Examination of medical records and microbiologic data from the Codogno Hospital showed a cluster of postpartum mastitis involving 13 women that had occurred from October 2003 through January 2004, before the family clusters were identified. The women had delivered in the same hospital 2–12 weeks before the onset of symptoms. In 6 case-patients, mastitis had progressed to breast abscesses and required surgical drainage. Culture of the drainage yielded MRSA in 1 case-patient and MSSA in the other case-patients. MSSA isolates had a susceptibility pattern identical to that of the community-acquired MSSA. Molecular studies were not performed on these isolates.

In early 2004, several cases of skin infections (mainly pustulosis of the groin or upper thigh) were observed in neonates in the hospital nursery or after discharge when they were examined during routine follow-up visits. From January through March 2004, 14 such skin infections were observed. No other cases were identified until December 2004, when 9 cases occurred. From January through September 2005, skin infections developed in a total of 65 neonates, with peak incidence in June and July when 14 and 17 cases were identified, respectively. In July 2005, screening for nasal S. aureus carriage was initiated, and infection control measures were enforced (see Infection Control Measures). Cases of infection gradually diminished, and no new cases were observed after September 2005. MSSA isolates were obtained from all neonates whose specimens had been cultured with skin infections in 2004 and 2005, but the isolates were not stored and were not available for molecular studies.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^114Q3Bpx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this case–control investigation was to identify factors associated with mastitis, including potential risk or protective factors. Among them, the separation of the infant from his mother longer than 24 h after birth due to hospitalization or for any other reason increased the risk of mastitis. This highlights the crucial importance of the first postnatal hours for establishing mother-infant interaction. Among other aspects of pregnancy, delivery and postpartum, Caesarean delivery and antibiotherapy during delivery as well as the use of epidural analgesia in labor were more frequently reported by mothers with mastitis, although these factors were not included in the final model obtained after the multivariable analysis. In this sense, a negative association between Caesarean delivery and breastfeeding exists because postoperative care routines delay the onset of lactation, disrupt mother-infant interaction and inhibit infant suckling. Peripartum antibiotherapy has emerged as a strong risk factor for human mastitis because it induces the selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the mammary gland and the elimination of potential competitors. Antibiotics also affect vaginal and intestinal microbiota of the mother and the development of intestinal microbiota in the infant. The link between epidural intrapartum analgesia and breastfeeding difficulties has also been debated, but there are not conclusive evidences and further studies are required.

### Group B. streptococcus late-onset disease: 2003–2010 [^112uoQSx]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is insufficient population-based data on group B streptococcus (GBS) late-onset disease (LOD). Risk factors and routes of GBS transmission are poorly understood.

Methods

A prospective, cohort study was conducted to collect incidence data on LOD and evaluate GBS infections over an 8-year period (2003–2010). Starting from January 2007, maternal rectovaginal and breast milk cultures were routinely collected on confirmation of the LOD diagnosis to assess maternal GBS culture status.

Results

The incidence rate of LOD was 0.32 per 1000 live births (1.4 and 0.24 per 1000 live births for preterm and term newborns, respectively). The registered cases of LOD (n = 100) were classified as sepsis (n = 57), meningitis (n = 36), or focal infection (n = 7). Thirty neonates were preterm (2 had recurrent infection); 68 were term. Four infants died (3 early preterm, 1 term). At the time the LOD diagnosis was confirmed, 3 (6%) of 53 mothers had GBS mastitis, and 30 (64%) of 47 carried GBS at the rectovaginal site. Early (7–30 days) LOD presentation was associated with neonatal brain lesions or death (odds ratio: 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.99]). Intrapartum antibiotic exposure was significantly associated with mild (12 of 22) rather than severe (11 of 45; p = 0.03) LOD.

Conclusions

Preterm neonates had the highest rates of LOD and mortality. Most mothers carried GBS at the time of the LOD diagnosis, whereas 6% had mastitis. Intrapartum antibiotics were associated both with delayed presentation of symptoms and milder LOD.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^114G9zxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus Aureus. Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1996 to 2007) and EMBASE (January 1985 to 2007). We contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as "supportive therapy" versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded randomized clinical trials to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Human milk sodium and potassium as markers of mastitis in mothers of preterm infants [^113dAhfY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: This prospective longitudinal study examined changes in milk sodium concentration (Na) and sodium:potassium ratio (Na:K), microbiological culture, milk production, and breast health in relation to mastitis after preterm birth. Methods: We studied women who gave birth at 29–34 weeks of gestation in a tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Milk samples, 24-hour milk production, and breast health data were collected every second day to day 10 postpartum, then every third day until infant discharge from the neonatal unit. Milk Na and K were measured at point of care (POC) using handheld ion selective meters, and Na:K calculated. Cultures were performed on postnatal days 8, 13, and every 6 days thereafter. For episodes of mastitis, milk was cultured at onset, and Na and Na:K measured daily until resolution. Women were followed up at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum. Results: In a sample of 44 women, 4 mastitis cases were detected in 3 women during their infants' neonatal stay; all had elevated milk Na and Na:K that resolved within 48 hours; 2/4 experienced reduced milk production and 1/4 had heavy growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. A further 2 mastitis cases were reported in 39 women followed up to 8 weeks postpartum. Four women had elevated milk Na and Na:K without clinical signs of mastitis; three also had reduced milk production. Conclusions: POC testing of milk Na and/or Na:K may offer a useful indicator of breast health. Mastitis may cause an acute reduction in milk production regardless of the presence of culture-positive infection.

### Recurrent neonatal group B streptococcal disease associated with infected breast milk [^115qrfQz]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of severe systemic infections among the newborn. Both recurrent and maternal mastitis-associated, group B streptococcus diseases are uncommon. Persistence of GBS colonization of infants' mucous membrane is postulated to influence the pathogeneses of recurrent GBS infection. The authors describe a term infant who was treated for GBS sepsis and meningitis and then later developed recurrent GBS sepsis, without meningitis, due to feeding of infected breast milk. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to demonstrate that the GBS isolates from the first and second episode of infection and the maternal milk are identical. The authors conclude that transmission of GBS through breast milk should be considered in cases of recurrent neonatal GBS infection and bacterial culture of breast milk should be routinely performed in such cases.

### Group B. streptococcus sequence type 103 as human and bovine pathogen, Brazil [^111PgTt5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of life-threatening neonatal infections and bovine mastitis. The GBS population is composed of host-specialist lineages, such as sequence type (ST) 17, and host-generalist lineages, such as ST23. ST103 is common among bovine GBS (bGBS) in Europe, Colombia, and China; reports of human GBS (hGBS) ST103 are rare and mostly limited to Asia. This difference may reflect limitations to host or geographic range or may be attributable to surveillance efforts. We investigated the molecular epidemiology of GBS STs in humans and cattle in Brazil.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^114HZdg1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis and accompanying pain have been associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast and may be a result of decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. Mastitis affects up to one in five breastfeeding women with most episodes occurring in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis, but have not been popular or proven effective as a preventative agent. The WHO has highlighted significant concerns relating to adverse harms of antibiotic use with the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms. Increasing research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. While animal studies have shown promising results in the use of probiotics for preventing mastitis, their use in human trials has had limited investigation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.

Methods

APProve (CAn Probiotics ImProve Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomised controlled trial designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus a placebo daily for 8 weeks following birth. A total of 600 women (300 to each arm) who intend to breastfeed will be randomised after the birth of a term, healthy infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8 weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6 and 12 months after birth will assess the primary outcome of mastitis in the first 8 weeks following birth as well as secondary maternal outcomes of breastfeeding duration (total/partial), antibiotic use, maternal health and well-being, and treatment compliance; and infant outcomes including gastroenteritis, infant health and well-being and growth and development. The acceptability and compliance using a novel mobile phone application system will also be evaluated.

Discussion

There is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing mastitis in breastfeeding women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may also increase breastfeeding duration, providing long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children. Decreased antibiotic usage also benefits the community and health system.

### Effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to prevent infections in planned vaginal births in low-income and middle-income countries: a post-hoc analysis of data from a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112fxfLu]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

In 2023, the Azithromycin Prevention in Labor Use (A-PLUS) trial showed intrapartum azithromycin reduces maternal sepsis or death in women with planned vaginal delivery in low-resource settings, but whether it reduces maternal infection is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin in reducing maternal infection.

Methods

We performed a post-hoc analysis of the multicentre, facility-based, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled A-PLUS trial. This trial compared prophylactic intrapartum single oral dose of 2 g azithromycin versus placebo on maternal morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings in southeast Asia and Africa from Sept 9, 2020, to Aug 18, 2022. The trial enrolled women in labour at 28 weeks' gestation (or later) at eight sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Zambia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Guatemala and found that azithromycin reduced the incidence of maternal sepsis or death. The primary outcome of the present analysis was the incidence of any maternal infection in the azithromycin versus placebo groups, which was defined as one or more of these infections after randomisation: chorioamnionitis, endometritis, perineal or caesarean wound infection, abdominopelvic abscess, mastitis or breast abscess, and other infections. Any neonatal infection was also analysed. All analyses were by intention to treat in all those with data available for that outcome. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated with a Poisson model adjusted for treatment group and site. Subgroup analyses included a two-way interaction test between intervention group and subgroup. A-PLUS was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03871491.

Findings

29278 women were randomly assigned to groups: 14590 to receive azithromycin, 14688 to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between the azithromycin and placebo groups (43·3% vs 43·4% primiparous, 8·5% vs 8·7% high risk for infection). The presence of any maternal infection occurred less often in the azithromycin group (580 [4·0%] of 14558) compared with the placebo group (824 [5·6%] of 14661 women; RR 0·71, 95% CI 0·64–0·79, p < 0·0001). Any neonatal infection did not differ between treatment groups. Adverse events were not detected.

Interpretation

Among women planning vaginal delivery, this analysis provides evidence indicating that intrapartum azithromycin is associated with a lower incidence of maternal infections than placebo.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^113mCBUh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast, with or without infection. It can be viewed as a continuum of disease, from non-infective inflammation of the breast to infection that may lead to abscess formation.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of preventive strategies (for example, breastfeeding education, pharmacological treatments and alternative therapies) on the occurrence or recurrence of non-infective or infective mastitis in breastfeeding women post-childbirth.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 October 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women. Quasi-randomised controlled trials and trials reported only in abstract form were eligible. We attempted to contact the authors to obtain any unpublished results, wherever possible. Interventions for preventing mastitis may include: probiotics, specialist breastfeeding advice and holistic approaches. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 10 trials (3034 women). Nine trials (2395 women) contributed data. Generally, the trials were at low risk of bias in most domains but some were high risk for blinding, attrition bias, and selective reporting. Selection bias (allocation concealment) was generally unclear. The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to risk of bias and to imprecision (low numbers of women participating in the trials). Conflicts of interest on the part of trial authors, and the involvement of industry funders may also have had an impact on the certainty of the evidence. Most trials reported our primary outcome of incidence of mastitis but there were almost no data relating to adverse effects, breast pain, duration of breastfeeding, nipple damage, breast abscess or recurrence of mastitis. Probiotics versus placebo Probiotics may reduce the risk of mastitis more than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.75; 2 trials; 399 women; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if probiotics reduce the risk of breast pain or nipple damage because the certainty of evidence is very low. Results for the biggest of these trials (639 women) are currently unavailable due to a contractual agreement between the probiotics supplier and the trialists. Adverse effects were reported in one trial, where no woman in either group experienced any adverse effects. Antibiotics versus placebo or usual care The risk of mastitis may be similar between antibiotics and usual care or placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.34; 3 trials; 429 women; low-certainty evidence). The risk of mastitis may be similar between antibiotics and fusidic acid ointment (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.81; 1 trial; 36 women; low-certainty evidence) or mupirocin ointment (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.05 to 3.89; 1 trial; 44 women; low-certainty evidence) but we are uncertain due to the wide CIs. None of the trials reported adverse effects. Topical treatments versus breastfeeding advice The risk of mastitis may be similar between fusidic acid ointment and breastfeeding advice (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.22; 1 trial; 40 women; low-certainty evidence) and mupirocin ointment and breastfeeding advice (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.35; 1 trial; 48 women; low-certainty evidence) but we are uncertain due to the wide CIs. One trial (42 women) compared topical treatments to each other. The risk of mastitis may be similar between fusidic acid and mupirocin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.00; low-certainty evidence) but we are uncertain due to the wide CIs. Adverse events were not reported. Specialist breastfeeding education versus usual care The risk of mastitis (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.17 to 4.95; 1 trial; 203 women; low-certainty evidence) and breast pain (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.37; 1 trial; 203 women; low-certainty evidence) may be similar but we are uncertain due to the wide CIs. Adverse events were not reported. Anti-secretory factor-inducing cereal versus standard cereal The risk of mastitis (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.72; 1 trial; 29 women; low-certainty evidence) and recurrence of mastitis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.03 to 4.57; 1 trial; 7 women; low-certainty evidence) may be similar but we are uncertain due to the wide CIs. Adverse events were not reported. Acupoint massage versus routine care Acupoint massage probably reduces the risk of mastitis compared to routine care (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78;1 trial; 400 women; moderate-certainty evidence) and breast pain (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23; 1 trial; 400 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse events were not reported. Breast massage and low frequency pulse treatment versus routine care Breast massage and low frequency pulse treatment may reduce risk of mastitis (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.21; 1 trial; 300 women; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that acupoint massage is probably better than routine care, probiotics may be better than placebo, and breast massage and low frequency pulse treatment may be better than routine care for preventing mastitis. However, it is important to note that we are aware of at least one large trial investigating probiotics whose results have not been made public, therefore, the evidence presented here is incomplete. The available evidence regarding other interventions, including breastfeeding education, pharmacological treatments and alternative therapies, suggests these may be little better than routine care for preventing mastitis but our conclusions are uncertain due to the low certainty of the evidence. Future trials should recruit sufficiently large numbers of women in order to detect clinically important differences between interventions and results of future trials should be made publicly available.

### Risk factors of HIV vertical transmission in a cohort of women under a PMTCT program at three peri-urban clinics in a resource-poor setting [^113pfxDe]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our finding that vaginal infections in HIV-infected pregnant women in the last trimester are a risk of HIV vertical transmission is important. The infections, namely, C. albicans, T. vaginalis and B. vaginosis, double the risk. There is paucity of data on these findings, but in a study by Fawzi et al.gonorrhea was found to be related to intrauterine transmission. A possible biological explanation is that these infections can be associated with chorioamnionitis, increased viral shedding in secretions and inflammatory cytokine production, which facilitate HIV transmission. This study was performed at low-risk peripheral clinics where all women delivered vaginally. An increased risk of perinatal HIV transmission among herpes simplex virus type-2 seropositive women and an increased risk of intrapartum HIV transmission among women shedding herpes simplex type-2 were reported by Bollen et al.

Mastitis has been reported to increase the risk of breastfeeding transmission. There is paucity of information on antenatal mastitis in HIV-infected women. In our study, the presence of abnormal breasts at about 36 weeks' gestation, which was a proxy for mastitis, was associated with a four times risk of HIV vertical transmission. Breastfeeding infants at 6 weeks of age were three times more likely to be HIV infected after multivariate analysis, although this was not statistically significant with a wide confidence interval. The trend of the adjusted risk ratios becomes more precise by 9 months of age. When feeding replacements are affordable and the practice is feasible, alternative foods are preferred to breast milk. The women were counseled to stop breastfeeding at 6 months, if feasible, but a significant proportion continued breastfeeding up to 9 months and beyond. Breastfeeding is a major health-promoting factor for infants and children in developing countries, but the risk of MTCT of HIV by this route is challenging traditional practices and health policies in low resource countries. Exclusive breastfeeding has been found to reduce transmission relative to mixed feeding. In our study, the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding in HIV-infected infants was only 3 months after our mothers were counseled about the benefits of exclusive breast feeding.

### Sonographic features of neonatal mastitis and breast abscess [^115nLS9e]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal mastitis and neonatal breast abscess are uncommon. Although well described in the pediatric and surgical literature, there is a paucity of reports describing their sonographic features.

Objective

To describe and illustrate the sonographic features of neonatal mastitis and neonatal breast abscess.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the medical database of a large children's health-care center from 2000 through 2008 for patients presenting in the first 8 weeks of life with mastitis. The findings were correlated with clinical presentation and course, laboratory findings and clinical outcome.

Results

Four neonates (three girls and one boy) presented with mastitis. They all had prominent breast buds on the affected side with poorly defined margins, slightly more echogenic focally or diffusely compared to normal with hyperemia on color flow Doppler US. The surrounding subcutaneous tissue was thick and echogenic. Two abscesses presented as avascular areas without color flow on Doppler US, subtly increased through-transmission and surrounding hyperemia. One abscess was of increased echogenicity while the other was anechoic.

Conclusion

Neonatal mastitis and breast abscess are unusual diseases that should be appropriately treated with antibiotics and drainage to avoid generalized sepsis, breast hypoplasia, and scarring. US is useful in distinguishing mastitis from breast abscess and guiding treatment options.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^114Q1HJs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Regarding breastfeeding characteristics and practices, the risk of developing lactational mastitis was also associated with the breast milk coming in later than 24 h postpartum. Previous studies focused on a potential relationship between positioning, attachment problems and mastitis have provided contradictory results. The bivariate analysis showed that mastitis was less common in women that breastfed her infant immediately after birth and also in women whose infants did not have difficulties in the first latch. In fact, it has been reported that timing of the first feeding is a key determinant for establishing mother-infant interaction and breastfeeding success. Other factors more frequently found in control women were feeding two children and exclusive breastfeeding versus mixed feeding while the opposite was detected for bottle-feeding, in agreement with other studies. Exclusive breastfeeding not only avoids the use of nursing bottles, but provides better interaction between mother and infant; therefore, increasing the nursing frequency and contributing to an adequate milk drainage. Considering these facts, breastfeeding twins or tandem nursing might be also considered a protective factor for mastitis. Regarding the amount of milk produced, milk over- or undersupply versus normal supply was more likely reported by cases. It has been suggested that mastitis may arise from a higher milk supply because of the risk of milk stasis if the infant delays or misses feeds; this situation may provide good conditions for bacterial overgrowth. On the other hand, low milk supply could give to the mother a false perception of low milk production when, actually, only secretion is compromised due to the formation of thick bacterial biofilms inside the milk ducts. This situation may also lead to longer feedings that were reported by women with mastitis.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^113hEPQb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Finally, mastitis was apparently associated with the lactation period, and the risk of mastitis decreased with the infant age (OR = 0.92). This could be a confounding factor because there was an age difference between cases (mean 3.35 months) and controls (mean 6.68 months) in spite of the fact that the same midwives and lactation consultants attending various health centers were in charge of recruiting cases (mastitis) and controls (healthy) women over a 21-month period. Actually, this difference in infant age due to unrestricted sampling of subjects may reflect the circumstance that lactational mastitis develops more frequently in the early stages of lactation. A higher incidence of mastitis during the first 4 weeks of breastfeeding and 75–95% of cases observed in the first 3 months has been reported previously. A reduced number of the variables considered in the study could be influenced by infant's age, including jaundice, hypoglycemia or eczema symptoms; however, the frequency of these conditions did not differ between cases and controls in the initial bivariate analysis. Regarding the length of feedings, feedings longer than 45 min were more frequently reported by cases. This fact could be related with younger children in cases compared to controls since the younger is the child, the longer is the feeding, but it might also be linked to a subclinical mastitis characterized by a decreased milk secretion that induces the baby to have longer feedings. However, taking these facts into account, this variable (feeding longer than 45 min) was excluded from the multivariable analysis and further studies will be carried out to clarify the link between breastfeeding length and mastitis.

Table 1.
Progress for Ending Preventable Deaths for Women, Neonates, Children, and Stillbirths

Worldwide from 2000 to 2015, 9 of the 10 most rapidly reducing causes of child death were infections. The fastest progress has been made for AIDS deaths in children, reducing at 6.7% per year and now down to 103000 deaths. Crucial to this rapid progress were disease burden estimates for all countries, and targeted interventions with drugs or vaccines, with coverage data to monitor progress. Data are critical for public health decision making, to prioritize investment in the largest-burden conditions affecting the poorest populations. Yet while the poorest and most vulnerable populations have the highest risk of most diseases, they also have the least data — the "inverse data law". This particularly applies to the estimated 600000 child deaths due to neonatal infections, which is more than that for malaria and AIDS combined (Figure 1). Yet data are lacking regarding the etiology of these deaths. The current global intervention strategy is to use sensitive but nonspecific algorithms to identify possible serious bacterial infection and then to treat all these neonates and infants with antibiotics. With improved diagnostics, targeted treatment could be delivered to support care, and reduce use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that select for antimicrobial resistance. With improved etiological data, targeted interventions, such as prevention by immunization, may also be possible.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, is a β-hemolytic gram-positive coccus. It can be part of the normal human and animal microflora, and was first identified as a pathogen in animals, causing bovine mastitis, in 1887. GBS was subsequently identified as a human pathogen causing puerperal sepsis in London, United Kingdom, in 1938. Later, GBS emerged as an important cause of neonatal septicemia and meningitis in the United States, with cases increasing from the 1960s, followed by increases in other high-income contexts, such as the United Kingdom, by the 1980s. The reasons for the emergence of GBS are unclear; theories have included the mechanization of dairy farming increasing the spread of GBS, a species jump from bovines, and/or the spread of a virulent GBS clone, possibly related to the development of tetracycline resistance, with its widespread use.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ABM 2022 guidelines recommend to avoid using IV antibiotics and admitting to the hospital routinely unless a known multidrug-resistant organism is present or the clinical presentation mandates (severe sepsis or inability to tolerate oral medication or fluid). Consider administering IV fluids if the oral intake is suboptimal.

### Associations between breast milk viral load, mastitis, exclusive breast-feeding, and postnatal transmission of HIV [^1144TXtX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background. Exclusive breast-feeding is protective against postnatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), compared with mixed breast-feeding. Accordingly, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is the World Health Organization's recommendation to HIV-infected mothers for whom exclusive replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable, safe, or sustainable. The mechanism of exclusive breast-feeding protection is unknown but is hypothesized to be mediated through reduced mastitis.

Methods

We compared breast milk and plasma specimens of exclusive breast-feeding and mixed breast-feeding HIV- positive mothers archived from the ZVITAMBO trial in which mixed breast-feeding was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of postnatal transmission at 18 months. Plasma HIV load, breast milk HIV load and sodium/potassium ratio were measured as a proxy for subclinical mastitis.

Results

Mixed breast-feeding was not associated with mastitis or breast milk HIV load. Mastitis was associated with breast milk HIV load, and this effect increased with increasing maternal plasma HIV load; mastitis was associated with postnatal transmission only when maternal plasma HIV load was high (> 3.7 log₁₀ copies/mL). Initiation of breast-feeding within an hour of delivery was associated with exclusive breast-feeding (adjusted odds ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.58).

Conclusions

Exclusive breast-feeding is associated with reduced postnatal transmission of HIV from mother to child, but this protection is not mediated by reduced mastitis or breast milk HIV load. The deleterious effect of mastitis increases as the mother's plasma HIV load increases.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^111oT8zN]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — breastfeeding management and infant prophylaxis — Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth. If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated, and additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended. Provide guidance on good breast care, promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples, and note that these conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown. Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers; since very rapid weaning was associated with increased risk of HIV shedding into breast milk and risk of transmission in the pre-ART era, weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer with attention to breast care. There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding during maternal HIV — key directives include "Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth". If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, "the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated. Additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended". The guidance states to "Provide guidance on good breast care, including strategies to avoid and promptly resolve over production of breast milk, milk stasis, and breast engorgement, which can lead to sore nipples, mastitis, or breast abscess", and to "Promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples", noting "These conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown". It also advises to "Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers", and that "weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer", and further notes "There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding".

### Postpartum mastitis and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^113QSmnT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Postpartum mastitis (PPM) occurs in as many as one third of breastfeeding women in the United States and leads to breast abscess formation in ≈10% of cases. Although breast milk cultures are not routine in PPM management, the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (such as β-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus) is associated with longer time to recovery and more frequent abscess formation. S. aureus is the most common bacterium isolated from such cultures, representing 37%–50% of isolates.

Reports of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) PPM among young, healthy women lacking traditional risk factors for MRSA have emerged in the past few years. Isolates in these cases of community-acquired infection (CA-MRSA) remain susceptible to multiple non–β-lactam antibiotics and possess distinct molecular features.

Although risk factors associated with skin and soft tissue infections due to CA-MRSA have been described, characteristics unique to patients with CA-MRSA PPM are unknown. To identify risk factors, complications, and outcomes among patients with CA-MRSA PPM, we conducted a retrospective, case-control study to include all S. aureus –associated cases at a single institution over an 8-year period. MRSA isolates were analyzed by PCR for the presence of the Staphylococcus cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type IV gene, which is commonly associated with community-acquired infection.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^115LMj11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Neonatal mastitis: clinical presentation and approach to evaluation and management [^111y3fjS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Mastitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Characteristic findings include erythema, induration, and tenderness around the breast bud. Fluctuance and purulent drainage may be present with abscess formation. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection. Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of neonatal mastitis in high-income countries, and no literature available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infection such as meningitis or urinary tract infection. A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most neonatal mastitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes. Treatment of neonatal mastitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration. Surgical intervention, such as incision and drainage or intraoperative debridement, may be needed for frank abscesses. While antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower risk infants with mastitis.

Conclusions

Relevant factors related to an increased risk of infectious mastitis have been identified in this study. This knowledge will allow practitioners to provide appropriate management advice about modifiable risk factors, such as the use of pumps or inappropriate medication. They also could identify those women at an increased risk of developing mastitis, such as those having a familial history of mastitis, before delivery, and thus develop strategies to prevent this condition. There are still many questions to answer about infectious mastitis, but work is in progress to broaden our knowledge in this relevant Public Health issue.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^115kmHWY]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Human milk as a source of antimicrobial resistance

Although breastfeeding likely cultivates a gut environment that is ultimately protective against children's colonization and infection with AMR pathogens, human milk may also be source of AMR bacteria and ARGs to the developing infant. In a recent study of 16 mother-infant pairs by Pärnänen et al. approximately 70% of ARGs and 76% of bacterial species detected in mothers' human milk were also detected in their infants' guts, suggesting vertical transmission. The same study observed that maternal antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery was associated with both a higher number and abundance of ARGs in breastfed infants' guts for up to 6 months, indicating that maternal antibiotic exposures may have lasting impacts on breastfed infants' gut resistomes. AMR Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, and Corynebacterium strains have also been cultured from human milk. AMR bacteria and ARGs detected in human milk likely do not originate solely from the mammary glands, as bacteria from mothers' skin and infants' mouths (through retrograde inoculation during suckling) are also thought to contribute to the milk microbiota. Nevertheless, human milk appears to be one of many sources of AMR bacteria and ARGs to the developing infant. This could be consequential if antibiotic use during delivery becomes more common to prevent maternal and neonatal infections, particularly in LMIC settings.

### Neonatal mastitis and omphalitis: presentation, outcomes, and concurrent serious bacterial infection… [^115QmaML]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Neonatal mastitis and omphalitis are uncommon but potentially serious infections in neonates. Clinical findings may range from localized soft tissue infection to more invasive necrotizing local infection or systemic illness with other concurrent serious bacterial infections. Modern literature on these diseases is scant, and there is very little evidence available to guide evaluation and treatment decisions. Subjects were identified using ICD codes, and charts were reviewed to confirm a clinical diagnosis consistent with mastitis or omphalitis. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were obtained from ED and inpatient medical records. Results: 657 infants with mastitis and 566 with omphalitis were included. For both diagnoses, most were admitted to the hospital, but very few had a clinical diagnosis of sepsis or shock, or documented severe cellulitis or necrotizing soft tissue infection.

There were no deaths in either cohort. Conclusion: In these cohorts, the vast majority of infants with neonatal mastitis or omphalitis had relatively mild localized disease, and prevalence of concurrent SBI and adverse outcomes was low. Routine testing for SBI with cultures is likely not necessary in all infants with mastitis or omphalitis.

### Maternal carriage in late-onset group B. streptococcus disease, Italy [^1167rsEN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study, we found GBS in ≈20% of breastfeeding mothers. Mastitis in LOD was infrequent; mothers with positive breast milk culture were more often asymptomatic, although their milk bacterial counts were sometimes high. This finding suggests a silent maternal duct colonization, and it is consistent with case reports of GBS breast milk–associated LOD, in which most mothers have no sign of mastitis.

Furthermore, in our study most mothers with positive breast milk culture carried GBS at the VR site, which was often heavily colonized. Maternal VR carriage would appear to be associated with GBS transmission into breast milk, perhaps in some cases after translocation from the gastrointestinal tract through the lymphatic system to the mammary glands. In contrast, only 3 mothers who had positive breast milk culture were persistently GBS-noncolonized at the VR site. In such cases, a circular mechanism of GBS transmission to neonates could be implicated. The retrograde theory assumes that GBS, present in the infant's throat, colonizes the mammary ducts during breast-feeding; GBS load increases in the milk, and, in turn, the infant is infected during breast-feeding. Our data do not suggest that breast milk itself is a risk factor for LOD. Breast milk is known to contain immunomodulatory and antimicrobial components (i.e. sIgA and cytokines) that may protect from LOD, and the lack of these components seems to increase the risk of persistent neonatal colonization and LOD.

### Neonatal mastitis and concurrent serious bacterial infection… [^111xmq75]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

In this multicenter cohort, mild localized disease was typical of neonatal mastitis. SBI and adverse outcomes were rare. Evaluation for SBI is likely unnecessary in most afebrile, well-appearing infants with mastitis. Mastitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Modern literature on neonatal mastitis is scant, and there is little evidence to guide evaluation and treatment decisions. Among infants with clinically diagnosed mastitis, serious bacterial infections and adverse events were rare. Routine testing for serious bacterial infections with cultures is likely unnecessary in most afebrile well-appearing infants with mastitis. Neonatal mastitis occurs most commonly in the first 2 months of life and is related to the physiologic breast hypertrophy seen in term infants. Physiologic breast enlargement occurs in ∼70% of term neonates, related to stimulation of the breast tissue by placental and maternal hormones.

1–3 Although it is thought to be uncommon, the prevalence of neonatal mastitis is unknown. Pathogenesis involves the spread of bacterial pathogens to the breast parenchyma through the nipple. 3 Mastitis is distinguished from physiologic hypertrophy by characteristic clinical findings, including erythema, induration, and tenderness. 1–3 Fluctuance may be present in the setting of frank abscess, reported to occur in more than half of cases. 4 Other clinical findings may include purulent nipple discharge, skin lesions, and axillary adenopathy. 1–4 Most cases are due to Staphylococcus aureus and, less commonly, Gram-negative enteric organisms, with reports of anaerobes and group B Streptococcus as well. 1–7. When evaluating infants with mastitis, the clinician must consider whether they have a concomitant serious bacterial infection or are at risk for potentially serious outcomes, such as sepsis or extensive or necrotizing soft tissue infection.

Although numerous treatment decisions must be considered, there is little evidence available to guide the optimal approach to diagnostic evaluation and management of infants with mastitis. Previous studies suggest a low prevalence of concurrent SBI and adverse outcomes among infants with mastitis but are limited to several small case series from individual centers. The low prevalence of SBI and adverse outcomes is consistent with previous studies. In several case series, the rate of concurrent bacteremia was ∼4%; however, these estimates included potential contaminants.

### Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in skin and soft tissue infections, Northern Italy [^112tpk7r]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have described a large and prolonged outbreak caused by a PVL-positive MSSA strain that was probably initiated in the maternity ward and nursery of the local hospital and spread to the community. Striking similarities exist between the principal features of this outbreak and recent descriptions of outbreaks caused by typical CA-MRSA. First, skin infections occurred predominantly in children and young adults without risk factors, with intrafamilial spread and recurrences (several examples of familial transmission of CA-MRSA have been described in which family members can serve as a reservoir of CA-MRSA). Second, the epidemic MSSA clone was prolonged in the community (in northern Denmark, a CA-MRSA strain was responsible for a community outbreak of recurring infections that involved 46 persons > 6 years of age). Third, a mastitis outbreak occurred and neonatal infections emerged in the local hospital (an outbreak of CA-MRSA infections in a neonatal intensive care unit was likely initiated by the mother of the index case who had a CA-MRSA wound infection and mastitis). Twenty-one percent of neonates with CA-MRSA infections at the Texas Children's Hospital had a mother with a history of skin infections, including mastitis and axillary abscesses.

Our study has some clear limitations because the PVL-positive MSSA outbreak strain was only demonstrated in isolates from 3 family clusters, in community infections in 2006, and in the hospital carriers. That the epidemic clone was responsible for the other 2 family clusters and the postpartum mastitis outbreak can only be inferred from the records of isolation of MSSA with a distinctive susceptibility pattern (i.e. resistant to penicillin and gentamicin only). As for infections in neonates, these were generally considered mild, and microbiologic cultures were performed in only a few cases. In addition to the microbiologic findings, epidemiologic and clinical data support the presence of an unusually virulent strain. In the Codogno Hospital outbreak, the temporal relationship between the mastitis outbreak and the emergence of neonatal MSSA infections suggests that the source of the strain might have been a mother who had undetected infection or colonization at delivery and transmitted the strain to the baby. Subsequently, the strain spread inside the newborn nursery, possibly with the contribution of colonized healthcare workers, leading to the colonization of babies and the emergence of skin infections a few days after birth. The colonized/infected mothers and neonates in turn spread the MSSA strain in the community.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: radiological-pathological correlation [^112Drvzq]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Breast abscess

Acute bacterial mastitis will either resolve with antibiotic therapy or evolve into an abscess if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Approximately 4.8–11% of lactation-related mastitis is complicated by breast abscesses. Infection is most commonly due to S. aureus (with increasing cases of methicillin-resistant S. aureus MRSA) and Streptococcus. The patient presents with fever, chills, tenderness and breast erythema. Imaging with ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis, provide a means to drain the collection to tailor antibiotic therapy and can be safely used for regular follow-up of abscess. Ultrasound is the modality of choice and typically reveals a complex hypoechoic cystic mass of varied shape, commonly multiloculated with indistinct margins, peripheral vascularity and posterior acoustic enhancement (Fig. 9b); however, there should be no vascularity within the fluid collection. Mammography is performed only if unclear of diagnosis and may show signs such as mass, distortion, asymmetric density and skin thickening, which are not specific to cancer. Presence of suspicious calcifications is more specific for cancer. Percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy provides effective treatment. In some cases multiples drainages are required. Warm compresses and frequent breast feeding also help to shorten the duration of symptoms. The presence of mastitis and/or abscess poses no risk to the breast feeding infant. Cessation of breast-feeding is necessary only when treatment with an antibiotic contraindicated for the newborn is prescribed (e.g. tetracycline, ciprofloxacin or chloramphenicol) or if surgical drainage is performed. Due to overlap of radiological findings in infection and inflammatory breast cancer, if there is clinical suspicion, strong family history or atypical course breast biopsy or skin punch biopsy should be considered.

### Effect of intrapartum azithromycin vs placebo on neonatal sepsis and death: a randomized clinical trial [^116uMrTP]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. New interventions are needed to decrease neonatal sepsis and mortality in regions with highest burden.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of intrapartum azithromycin to reduce neonatal sepsis or mortality, as well as neonatal and maternal infections.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial enrolled and followed up birthing parents and their infants at 10 health facilities in The Gambia and Burkina Faso, West Africa, between October 2017 and May 2021.

Interventions

Participants were assigned at random to receive oral azithromycin (2 g) or placebo (ratio 1:1) during labor.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of neonatal sepsis or mortality, with the former defined based on microbiologic or clinical criteria. Secondary outcomes were neonatal infections (skin, umbilical, eye and ear infections), malaria, and fever; postpartum infections (puerperal sepsis, mastitis), fever, and malaria; and use of antibiotics during 4-week follow-up.

Results

The trial randomized 11 983 persons in labor (median age, 29.9 years). Overall, 225 newborns (1.9% of 11 783 live births) met the primary end point. The incidence of neonatal mortality or sepsis was similar in the azithromycin and placebo groups (2.0% [115/5889] vs 1.9% [110/5894]; risk difference [RD], 0.09 [95% CI, -0.39 to 0.57]), as was the incidence of neonatal mortality (0.8% vs 0.8%; RD, 0.04 [95% CI, -0.27 to 0.35]) and neonatal sepsis (1.3% vs 1.3%; RD, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.38 to 0.43]). Newborns in the azithromycin group compared with the placebo group had lower incidence of skin infections (0.8% vs 1.7%; RD, -0.90 [95% CI, -1.30 to -0.49]) and need for antibiotics (6.2% vs 7.8%; RD, -1.58 [95% CI, -2.49 to -0.67]). Postpartum parents in the azithromycin group had lower incidence of mastitis (0.3% vs 0.5%; RD, -0.24 [95% CI, -0.47 to -0.01]) and puerperal fever (0.1% vs 0.3%; RD, -0.19 [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.01]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Azithromycin administered orally during labor did not reduce neonatal sepsis or mortality. These results do not support routine introduction of oral intrapartum azithromycin for this purpose.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^116d529F]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^115jbkJh]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — d. Minimize breast pump usage states that mechanical breast pumps stimulate breast milk production without physiologically extracting milk as an infant will, and that pumping does not provide the opportunity for bacterial exchange between the infant's mouth and mother's breast, and may, therefore, predispose to dysbiosis. Breast pumps also can cause trauma to breast parenchyma and the nipple areolar complex if improper flange sizes are used, suction is too high, or the mother is pumping for an excessive duration of time. Milk expression should be limited to when a mother is separated from her infant or requires pumping for other medically indicated reasons for herself or her infant. Women should not be instructed to express and discard their milk, as bacterial mastitis is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, and women using a breast pump should express milk at a frequency and volume that mimics physiological breastfeeding. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.

### ABM clinical protocol # 35: supporting breastfeeding during maternal or child hospitalization [^113RGjrt]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Supporting breastfeeding during maternal or child hospitalization — introduction and scope emphasizes that hospitalization of a breastfeeding mother or child can disrupt breastfeeding, leading to unintended weaning and complications such as mastitis, that no formal guidelines exist for management of lactation during hospitalization, and that this protocol outlines recommended care and standards to implement these policies. The document notes that staff outside obstetric, pediatric, or neonatal units may have limited experience and knowledge of lactation physiology or management and may not understand the short-term and long-term risks of disruptions to lactation. It describes that concerns may arise when a breastfeeding infant or young child is present on adult inpatient, perioperative, or intensive care unit settings, including child safety and hospital liability, and that management related to medications, procedures, and fluids may require special attention. It emphasizes assessing a breastfeeding mother's desires regarding initiating or continuing lactation and meeting those needs through shared decision making. Related guidance on model maternity policy, analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, preprocedural fasting, and radiology and nuclear medicine may serve as useful adjuncts. Background statements affirm that breastfeeding is the biologically normative way to feed human infants and that early cessation of breastfeeding is associated with increased infections and chronic diseases in children. The protocol also clarifies that these are guidelines that do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care, that variations may be appropriate for individual patients, and that the Academy recognizes not all lactating individuals identify as women and its position is to interpret clinical protocols within an inclusive framework for breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk-feeding individuals.

### Serotype III Streptococcus agalactiae from bovine milk and human neonatal infections [^1137hRdD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]) is the major etiologic agent of invasive neonatal infections in humans in industrialized countries, causing sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and soft tissue infections. GBS has also been increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in immunocompromised and elderly persons. GBS emerged as an important cause of neonatal infections in the 1960s; before this time, it was mainly recognized as a cause of bovine mastitis. Most data suggest that GBS strains that infect humans are distinct from strains isolated from bovine sources, since bovine strains frequently cannot be typed with antisera to determine capsular polysaccharide serotype, often express protein antigens not found on human isolates, and tend to have different biochemical properties. The possibility remains, however, that subgroups of GBS infect both humans and cows. If so, these two closely associated hosts could act as reservoirs for each other and sites for the emergence of novel pathogens.

A number of molecular methods, including multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of restriction enzyme digest products of genomic DNA, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), have been used to demonstrate that the population of GBS that infects humans is highly clonal and limited to a relatively small number of phylogenetic lineages. Martinez and colleagues reported in 2000 that a large sample of GBS isolated from cows in Quebec Province in Canada could be classified into five major RAPD groups, which indicates that this sample of bovine GBS also comprised a limited number of lineages.

The Quebec sample is particularly useful for further investigating the relationship between bovine and human GBS because most typeable bovine isolates in the sample were serotype III. Serotype III GBS strains account for a substantial proportion of early-onset neonatal human GBS infections and almost all late-onset neonatal infections. Four distinct phylogenetic lineages of human serotype III GBS have been identified by PFGE of restriction digest patterns and designated restriction digest patterns type III-1, III-2, III-3, and III-4. Human GBS strains can also be assigned to each restriction digest pattern type by a distinct set of molecular markers, which include analysis of nucleotide substitutions in the centrally conserved region of the translation infB, the presence or absence of the inserted sequences GBSi1 and IS 1548 in three chromosomal loci, and MLST.

### Cow's milk and the emergence of group B streptococcal disease in newborn babies [^116vXdsm]. Neonatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS), the most significant cause of neonatal bacterial sepsis, is thought to have emerged in the 1960s. GBS also causes mastitis in cows, and there is indirect evidence that human GBS is derived from a bovine ancestor.

Objective

A major change in the collection of milk from farms, using bulk tanks rather than churns, occurred in the 1960s. We sought to define the temporal relationship between this change in farming and the emergence of GBS neonatal disease.

Methods

We searched PubMed for reports of GBS disease from 1930 until 1980 to more exactly determine the time of emergence of neonatal infection and supported this data with UK hospital admission statistics for GBS infections. We identified the dates of the change from churns to bulk tanks by searching the internet and books for information on the history of milk transportation, farming and milk collection in the UK.

Results

There are no PubMed reports of neonatal GBS disease between 1930 and 1950, and reports from the UK only emerged in the mid-1960s, confirming the notion that GBS neonatal infection was a newly emergent disease in the 1960s. No national data on hospital admissions are available around this time, but the Oxford Record Linkage Study, with admission data available for Oxford from 1968, showed no cases of neonatal disease until 1974. Cow's milk collection in the UK switched to bulk tank between 1960 and 1979, and publications relating to GBS disease emerged soon after.

Conclusions

There is a temporal relationship between the emergence of neonatal GBS disease reports in the UK in the 1960s and a change in cow's milk collection. This finding may be a temporal coincidence or may add support to the notion that human GBS was historically derived from a bovine ancestor.

### Effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to prevent infections in planned vaginal births in low-income and middle-income countries: a post-hoc analysis of data from a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116k8PUF]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Background

In 2023, the Azithromycin Prevention in Labor Use (A-PLUS) trial showed intrapartum azithromycin reduces maternal sepsis or death in women with planned vaginal delivery in low-resource settings, but whether it reduces maternal infection is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin in reducing maternal infection.

Methods

We performed a post-hoc analysis of the multicentre, facility-based, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled A-PLUS trial. This trial compared prophylactic intrapartum single oral dose of 2 g azithromycin versus placebo on maternal morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings in southeast Asia and Africa from Sept 9, 2020, to Aug 18, 2022. The trial enrolled women in labour at 28 weeks' gestation (or later) at eight sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Zambia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Guatemala and found that azithromycin reduced the incidence of maternal sepsis or death. The primary outcome of the present analysis was the incidence of any maternal infection in the azithromycin versus placebo groups, which was defined as one or more of these infections after randomisation: chorioamnionitis, endometritis, perineal or caesarean wound infection, abdominopelvic abscess, mastitis or breast abscess, and other infections. Any neonatal infection was also analysed. All analyses were by intention to treat in all those with data available for that outcome. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated with a Poisson model adjusted for treatment group and site. Subgroup analyses included a two-way interaction test between intervention group and subgroup. A-PLUS was registered at, number.

Findings

29 278 women were randomly assigned to groups: 14 590 to receive azithromycin, 14 688 to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between the azithromycin and placebo groups (43·3% vs 43·4% primiparous, 8·5% vs 8·7% high risk for infection). The presence of any maternal infection occurred less often in the azithromycin group (580 [4·0%] of 14 558) compared with the placebo group (824 [5·6%] of 14 661 women; RR 0·71, 95% CI 0·64–0·79, p < 0·0001). Any neonatal infection did not differ between treatment groups. Adverse events were not detected.

Interpretation

Among women planning vaginal delivery, this analysis provides evidence indicating that intrapartum azithromycin is associated with a lower incidence of maternal infections than placebo.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^116uRszH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The distribution of knowledge dimensions regarding breastfeeding and mastitis revealed both areas of strength and potential misconceptions among the participants. Notably, a substantial percentage of respondents correctly recognized the benefits of breastfeeding for infant intellectual and growth development, the association between low mood and mastitis risk, and the role of breastfeeding in enhancing infants' immunity to infections and diseases like childhood asthma. These findings are consistent with existing literature, highlighting the awareness of these crucial aspects of breastfeeding. However, it is concerning that a significant number of participants incorrectly believed that mothers with other related diseases during pregnancy cannot breastfeed, that breastfeeding should cease when mastitis occurs, and that babies need to be breastfed on a strict schedule. These misconceptions can have negative implications for breastfeeding initiation and duration. In light of these results, clinical practice can be improved by addressing and correcting these misconceptions through targeted educational programs. Healthcare providers should emphasize the safety and importance of breastfeeding for mothers with certain medical conditions during pregnancy, provide guidance on managing mastitis while continuing to breastfeed, and promote responsive feeding rather than rigid schedules to encourage successful breastfeeding experiences. These efforts may contribute to a more informed and confident breastfeeding population, ultimately leading to improved maternal and infant health outcomes.

The attitude dimension offers important insights into how individuals perceive breastfeeding and related aspects. A significant portion of participants acknowledged the benefits of breastfeeding, including its positive impact on infant growth and development, emotional bonding between mother and child, and the superiority of breastmilk as an ideal infant food. These attitudes align with established literature and emphasize the significance of promoting and supporting breastfeeding in clinical practice. However, it's notable that a considerable proportion of respondents expressed concerns about the burdens associated with breastfeeding, suggesting potential challenges or misconceptions that need to be addressed. In clinical practice, there is a need to address and alleviate these concerns through personalized support and education. Additionally, the positive attitudes towards preventing lactational mastitis and the willingness to acquire knowledge in this area present opportunities for implementing targeted education and prevention strategies. Healthcare providers can play a pivotal role in educating pregnant and postpartum women about mastitis prevention, fostering proactive management, and recognizing early symptoms.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^116g7XqT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Another relevant factor associated with mastitis was the use of antibiotics during breastfeeding. In fact, widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics is leading to increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance among mastitis-causing agents. On the other hand, biofilm formation is an important virulence factor of the strains implicated in mastitis, taking in account that the penetration capacity through bacterial biofilms depends on each antibiotic. Resistance to antibiotics and ability to form biofilms are common findings among mastitis-causing strains and may explain the often recurrent nature of this infectious condition. This fact emphasizes the need of a milk culture and antibiogram for a rational treatment of mastitis. Widespread antibiotic therapy used to treat throat infections could also affect the mammary gland microbiota and lead to mastitis. Conversely, broad range antibiotics to treat mastitis are linked to a variety of adverse effects, including urinary infections and vaginal candidiasis. Microbial habitats in the human body, including the skin, constitute a network of interrelated communities. This could explain why pathogens involved in throat and urinary infections may spread to the mammary gland and those implicated in mastitis development may spread to throat and urinary tract. In this work, the bivariate analysis revealed that urinary and skin infections were also more frequent among breastfeeding mothers with mastitis. Interestingly, anemia was also more common in the group of women with mastitis, since women suffering from anemia might be more vulnerable to infections. In addition, iron supplements enhance growth and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus and other mastitis-associated species; as a consequence, women receiving them may also be more prone to mastitis. No clinical trials have evaluated the impact of iron supplementation on mastitis but the study of iron acquisition pathways seems to be a good target to define the underlying mechanisms of mastitis severity.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ABM 2022 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining milk culture to evaluate for resistant and/or less common pathogens, such as MRSA, if there is no symptomatic improvement after 48 hours of first-line therapy. Consider obtaining local susceptibility testing and resistance patterns and proceed to empiric therapy. Consider obtaining early milk culture in mothers expressing breast milk for an immunocompromised infant in the NICU, healthcare workers in areas with a high prevalence of MRSA, and patients with recurrent infections.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^112SdFAY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — bacterial mastitis is described as cellulitis in a specific region of the breast that may spread to different quadrants, with common organisms including Staphylococcus (e.g. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, and S. hominis) and Streptococcus (e.g. S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae). Evaluation by a medical professional "should be performed if there are persistent systemic symptoms (> 24 hours) such as fever and tachycardia", and if systemic signs are absent, diagnosis should be considered when the breast is not responding to conservative measures. The protocol notes that "Bacterial mastitis is not a contagious entity and does not pose a risk to the infant nor require an interruption in breastfeeding", advises that "There is no evidence to support poor hygiene as a cause of bacterial mastitis or the need for routine sterilization of pumps" with basic handwashing and pump cleaning, and states that despite perceptions about yeast, "no scientific evidence exists to support this diagnosis".

### The risk of preterm birth in low risk pregnant women with urinary tract infections [^116NVFVx]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Urinary tract infections are among the most common infections during pregnancy. The association between symptomatic lower urinary tract infections during pregnancy and fetal and maternal complications such as preterm birth and low birthweight remains unclear. The aim of this research is to evaluate the association between urinary tract infections during pregnancy and maternal and neonatal outcomes, especially preterm birth.

Study Design

This study is a secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective cohort study, which included patients between October 2011 and June 2013. The population consists of women with low risk singleton pregnancies. We divided the cohort into women with and without a symptomatic lower urinary tract infection after 20 weeks of gestation. Baseline characteristics and maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to correct for confounders. The main outcome was spontaneous preterm birth at < 37 weeks.

Results

We identified 4,918 pregnant women eligible for enrollment, of whom 9.4% had a symptomatic lower urinary tract infection during their pregnancy. Women with symptomatic lower urinary tract infections were at increased risk for both preterm birth in general (12 vs. 5.1%, adjusted OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.7–3.5) as well as a spontaneous preterm birth at < 37 weeks (8.2 vs. 3.7%, adjusted OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.5–3.5). This association was also present for early preterm birth at < 34 weeks. Women with symptomatic lower urinary tract infections during pregnancy are also at increased risk of endometritis (8.9 vs. 1.8%, adjusted OR 5.3; 95% CI 1.4–20) and mastitis (7.8 vs. 1.8%, adjusted OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.6–10) postpartum.

Conclusion

Low risk women with symptomatic lower urinary tract infections during pregnancy are at increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. In addition, an increased risk for endometritis and mastitis postpartum was found in women with symptomatic lower urinary tract infection during pregnancy.

Key Points

· UTIs increase the risk of preterm birth. · UTIs increase the risk of endometritis postpartum. · UTIs increase the risk of mastitis postpartum.

### Hyperinvasive neonatal group B. streptococcus has arisen from a bovine ancestor [^115Z9N5i]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

The genetic relatedness and evolutionary relationships between group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates from humans and those from bovines were investigated by phylogenetic analysis of multilocus sequence typing data. The collection of isolates consisted of 111 GBS isolates from cows with mastitis and a diverse global collection of GBS isolates from patients with invasive disease (n = 83) and carriers (n = 69). Cluster analysis showed that the majority of the bovine isolates (93%) grouped into one phylogenetic cluster. The human isolates showed greater diversity and clustered separately from the bovine population. However, the homogeneous human sequence type 17 (ST-17) complex, known to be significantly associated with invasive neonatal disease, was the only human lineage found to be clustered within the bovine population and was distinct from all the other human lineages. Split decomposition analysis revealed that the human isolate ST-17 complex, the major hyperinvasive neonatal clone, has recently arisen from a bovine lineage.
