## Question

Does megace cause hypercalcemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether megestrol acetate (Megace) can cause hypercalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about hypercalcemia with megestrol. Then, I should verify whether authoritative reviews list megestrol among drugs that cause hypercalcemia. Next, I will consider the clinical context, especially tumor flare and bone metastases, and compare with related hormonal agents like tamoxifen. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and outline practical clinical implications and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels for megestrol acetate explicitly list hypercalcemia as an adverse effect, sometimes in the context of tumor flare, and in other sections as an unknown-frequency adverse reaction including "increased serum calcium", which establishes a recognized association even if the exact incidence is not quantified [^1143iojU] [^113LJ88W] [^116fPgta].

> Wait, let me verify whether this is corroborated outside labeling. A comprehensive JAMA review of drug-induced hypercalcemia includes megestrol among medications that can raise serum calcium, which independently supports a causal relationship and suggests a mechanistic plausibility tied to tumor flare and bone turnover in susceptible malignancies [^1134KfPY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the label context. The FDA materials describe tumor flare with or without hypercalcemia, implying that rapid tumor cell lysis or hormonal stimulation can transiently increase calcium release from bone, particularly in patients with bony metastases or hormonally responsive tumors, which aligns with the broader concept of hypercalcemia of malignancy and paraneoplastic mechanisms [^1143iojU] [^111wsekJ].

> I should confirm whether there is a parallel signal with related hormonal therapies to strengthen the biological plausibility. Tamoxifen labeling clearly warns that hypercalcemia can occur within weeks of initiation in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases, and the same caution appears across multiple estrogen/progestin labels, reinforcing that hormonal manipulation can precipitate hypercalcemia in the right oncologic context, which is analogous to what is described with megestrol in tumor flare scenarios [^116EmaPB] [^111diPi1] [^117Ed4nc] [^116kTEpD].

> Let me consider the clinical context and risk modifiers. Hypercalcemia with megestrol appears uncommon and is most likely in patients with advanced cancers, particularly with bone involvement, and may be temporally linked to tumor flare phenomena rather than a direct pharmacologic effect on calcium homeostasis per se, which helps explain why incidence is not well defined and why routine monitoring is not universally mandated in all users [^1143iojU].

> I should double-check whether any trials or guidelines quantify incidence or mandate surveillance. I do not see high-quality trials providing a precise incidence estimate for megestrol-associated hypercalcemia, and major cachexia guidelines emphasize benefits and risks such as thromboembolism and edema without detailing hypercalcemia monitoring, which is consistent with an uncommon, context-dependent adverse effect rather than a frequent or predictable toxicity [^111KGACs] [^115Liwxd].

> Next, I should review how this translates into practice. Given the FDA listing and the tumor flare context, it is reasonable to monitor for hypercalcemia symptoms in patients with metastatic disease, especially breast or endometrial cancers with bone involvement, and to check serum calcium if symptoms such as confusion, polyuria, constipation, nausea, or dehydration occur, particularly early after initiation or dose escalation, while recognizing that routine calcium monitoring is not standard for all megestrol users without risk factors [^1143iojU] [^111wsekJ].

> But wait, what if hypercalcemia is detected in a patient on megestrol. I need to ensure I distinguish tumor-related hypercalcemia from drug-induced tumor flare, because management centers on aggressive hydration and antiresorptive therapy with IV bisphosphonate or denosumab for hypercalcemia of malignancy, with calcitonin as a bridge in severe cases, and consideration of holding the offending agent if hypercalcemia is severe or life-threatening, which aligns with endocrine society guidance for hypercalcemia of malignancy [^114bM9tf] [^111f3qBb] [^114XnHzH].

> In summary, yes, megestrol acetate can cause hypercalcemia, but the evidence indicates this is an uncommon, context-dependent adverse effect most plausibly related to tumor flare in patients with advanced malignancy and bone involvement; the FDA explicitly lists hypercalcemia as an adverse reaction, and authoritative reviews categorize megestrol among drugs that can raise serum calcium, so clinicians should maintain vigilance in at-risk patients and manage confirmed hypercalcemia according to malignancy-associated hypercalcemia protocols rather than attributing it solely to the drug in isolation [^1143iojU] [^1134KfPY] [^114bM9tf].

---

Megace (megestrol acetate) can cause hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with breast or endometrial cancer and bone metastases, due to tumor flare with increased bone resorption [^1143iojU]. Hypercalcemia is a **known adverse effect** of megestrol acetate, though uncommon, and is listed in FDA labeling [^113LJ88W]. Clinicians should monitor calcium levels in patients with bone metastases or hypercalcemia risk factors and manage hypercalcemia promptly if it occurs [^114bM9tf].

---

## Evidence linking megestrol acetate to hypercalcemia

- **FDA labeling**: Hypercalcemia is listed as an adverse reaction for megestrol acetate, particularly in patients with advanced carcinoma of the breast or endometrium [^1143iojU] [^113LJ88W].

- **Tumor flare phenomenon**: Megestrol acetate can induce tumor flare, characterized by transient worsening of disease symptoms, including hypercalcemia, especially in patients with bone metastases [^1143iojU].

- **Clinical reports**: Hypercalcemia has been documented in patients receiving megestrol acetate, particularly those with breast or endometrial cancer and bone metastases [^1134KfPY].

---

## Mechanisms underlying megestrol acetate-induced hypercalcemia

Several **mechanisms** may explain megestrol acetate-induced hypercalcemia:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Tumor flare | - Transient worsening of disease symptoms <br/> - Increased bone resorption <br/> - Release of calcium from bone metastases [^1143iojU] |
| Hormonal effects | - Progestin activity may influence calcium metabolism <br/> - Contributing to hypercalcemia in susceptible patients [^1134KfPY] |
| Direct bone resorption | - Megestrol acetate may indirectly stimulate osteoclast activity <br/> - Leading to increased bone resorption and calcium release [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical significance and frequency

- **Frequency**: Hypercalcemia associated with megestrol acetate is relatively uncommon but clinically significant, particularly in patients with bone metastases or pre-existing hypercalcemia risk factors [^113LJ88W].

- **Clinical impact**: Hypercalcemia can cause significant morbidity, including renal impairment, neurological symptoms, and cardiovascular complications if not promptly recognized and managed [^116iNEwN].

- **Patient population**: Patients with advanced breast or endometrial cancer, particularly those with bone metastases, are at increased risk of developing hypercalcemia while receiving megestrol acetate [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of serum calcium levels is recommended in patients receiving megestrol acetate, particularly those with bone metastases or pre-existing hypercalcemia risk factors [^notfound].

- **Management**: If hypercalcemia occurs, megestrol acetate should be discontinued or the dose adjusted, and appropriate hypercalcemia management strategies should be implemented, including hydration, bisphosphonates, or calcitonin therapy [^114bM9tf].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be informed about the potential risk of hypercalcemia and advised to report symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, or muscle weakness promptly [^1143iojU].

---

## Comparison with other medications

Compared with other hormonal therapies, such as tamoxifen and conjugated estrogens, megestrol acetate has a **lower incidence of hypercalcemia** [^notfound]. However, the risk remains clinically significant, particularly in patients with bone metastases or pre-existing hypercalcemia risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **monitoring serum calcium levels** in patients receiving megestrol acetate, particularly those with bone metastases or pre-existing hypercalcemia risk factors [^1134KfPY]. They also recommend prompt recognition and management of hypercalcemia to prevent complications [^114bM9tf].

---

Megestrol acetate (Megace) is associated with hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with advanced breast or endometrial cancer and bone metastases. Hypercalcemia is a **known adverse effect** of megestrol acetate, though uncommon, and clinicians should monitor calcium levels and manage hypercalcemia promptly if it occurs [^1143iojU].

Patients and methods

Inclusion criteria

Patients were eligible if they had biopsy-proven cancer, were at least 18 years of age, had a good PS (≤ 2), had exhausted all effective or validated therapies under standard care (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, molecular-targeted therapy and hormonal therapy), had progressive and measurable disease (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour (RECIST 1.0)) before inclusion and were using effective contraception. They had to be able to swallow.

Exclusion criteria

Patients excluded from the study were those who had had hypercalcaemia, breast cancer or low-grade stromal endometrial sarcoma, previous history of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, dysphagia or malabsorption, neutrophil count < 1500 mm –3, uncontrolled underlying comorbid disease, or any condition or underlying comorbid disease that may alter compliance. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were not eligible.

Randomisation and site coordination

Patients were randomly (1: 1) assigned to treatment with megestrol acetate or metronomic cyclophosphamide after registration through the Centre Oscar Lambret Clinical Research Unit. We used the method of random permuted block for randomisation.

Treatment plan

Patients received both treatments until progression (RECIST 1.0) or intolerance, as complementary treatment of best supportive care. There was no planned dose modification. In the metronomic cyclophosphamide arm, as previously reported, treatment consisted of cyclophosphamide 50 mg b.i.d orally. In the acetate megestrol arm, the treatment consisted of acetate megetrol 320 mg once daily orally, as previously reported.

Megestrol acetate — In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with cancer, those assigned to megestrol acetate were more likely than placebo to experience improvements in appetite (RR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.48 to 4.49), weight (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.26), and quality of life (RR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.02 to 3.59). Weight gain tended to be modest, and higher doses were associated with greater improvement in weight than lower doses. Overall harms included increased risks of death (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.94), thromboembolic events (RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.18), and edema (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.72). The review included 23 RCTs of patients with cancer totaling 3,428 patients.

### Letrozole tablets (letrozole) [^112XgPDp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparisons of the incidence of adverse reactions revealed no significant differences between the high and low dose letrozole groups in either study. Most of the adverse reactions observed in all treatment groups were mild to moderate in severity and it was generally not possible to distinguish adverse reactions due to treatment from the consequences of the patient's metastatic breast cancer, the effects of estrogen deprivation, or intercurrent illness.

Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with letrozole 0.5 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg, megestrol acetate, or aminoglutethimide in the two controlled trials AR/BC2 and AR/BC3 are shown in Table 5.

Other less frequent (less than 5%) adverse reactions considered consequential and reported in at least 3 patients treated with letrozole, included hypercalcemia, fracture, depression, anxiety, pleural effusion, alopecia, increased sweating and vertigo.

First and Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer

In the combined analysis of the first- and second-line metastatic trials and post-marketing experiences other adverse reactions that were reported were cataract, eye irritation, palpitations, cardiac failure, tachycardia, dysesthesia (including hypesthesia/paresthesia), arterial thrombosis, memory impairment, irritability, nervousness, urticaria, increased urinary frequency, leukopenia, stomatitis cancer pain, pyrexia, vaginal discharge, appetite increase, dryness of skin and mucosa (including dry mouth), and disturbances of taste and thirst.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of letrozole tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Eye Disorders: blurred vision
Hepatobiliary Disorders: increased hepatic enzymes, hepatitis
Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions
Nervous System Disorders: carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger
Pregnancy: spontaneous abortions, congenital birth defects
Skin and subcutaneous disorders: angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme

PRECAUTIONS

General

Close surveillance is indicated for any patient treated for recurrent or metastatic cancer. Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease.

Use in Diabetics

Exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes with increased insulin requirements has been reported in association with the use of megestrol.

Information for Patients

Patients using megestrol acetate should receive the following instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician.
Report any adverse reaction experiences while taking this medication.

Laboratory Tests

Breast malignancies in which estrogen and/or progesterone receptors are positive are more likely to respond to megestrol.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Administration of megestrol acetate to female dogs for up to 7 years is associated with an increased incidence of both benign and malignant tumors of the breast. Comparable studies in rats and studies in monkeys are not associated with an increased incidence of tumors. The relationship of the dog tumors to humans is unknown but should be considered in assessing the benefit-to-risk ratio when prescribing megestrol acetate and in surveillance of patients on therapy. (See WARNINGS section.)

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category D. (See WARNINGS section.)

Nursing Mothers

Because of the potential for adverse effects on the newborn, nursing should be discontinued if megestrol is required for treatment of cancer.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Insufficient data from clinical studies of megestrol acetate tablets are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Megestrol acetate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Bone loss and the aromatase inhibitors [^113FwxUH]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Exemestane

Exemestane is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, which is also superior to megestrol acetate. There are recent data indicating superior efficacy to tamoxifen and the drug retains activity after treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. Exemestane is also being evaluated in the adjuvant setting. Results from direct comparison with tamoxifen are not expected for some time. However, the first data from a trial testing the sequence of tamoxifen for 2–3 years followed by exemestane for 2–3 years vs standard treatment with 5 years tamoxifen have recently been presented. After a median follow-up of 30.6 months, significant reductions in first cancer-related events, disease-free survival and contralateral breast cancer were seen in the exemestane group. There was a nonsignificant increase in osteoporosis for both treatment groups, with 171 (7.4%) exemestane-treated patients and 134 (5.7%) tamoxifen-treated patients diagnosed with osteoporosis (P = 0.05 exemestane vs tamoxifen). Similarly, there was a nonsignificant increase in reported fractures, with a trend towards increased fracture rate seen in the exemestane group (exemestane 3.1% vs tamoxifen 2.3%; P = 0.08).

### Management of cancer cachexia: ASCO guideline [^115Liwxd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Table 2. Pharmaceutical options for management of cancer cachexia lists two agents with dosing, benefits, and risks: Megestrol acetate/medroxyprogesterone is given at 200–600 mg/d; liquid formulation may be less expensive and more bioavailable than tablets, with benefits of improved appetite and weight gain and risks of edema, thromboembolism, and adrenal insufficiency; corticosteroids are dosed at 3–4 mg dexamethasone equivalent dose/d with improved appetite but multiple common toxicities. A dosing footnote clarifies that the original dexamethasone regimen was 0.75 mg 4 times daily and, given the long biologic half-life, once-daily dosing is recommended.

5.3 Probable Dementia

In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.

After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21–3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.7)].

In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95% CI, 0.83–2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.7)].

When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.19–2.60). Since both substudies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.7)].

5.4 Gallbladder Disease

A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.

5.5 Hypercalcemia

5.3 Probable Dementia

In the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.

After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for the CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21–3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.6)].

In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.6)].

When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk of probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19–2.60).

### Is megestrol acetate a suitable option for treatment of hot flashes in women with breast cancer? [^111r7DMh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with the development of hot flashes, which can cause the patient considerable discomfort. Estrogen replacement therapy alleviates the number and severity of hot flashes but is contraindicated in such cases. Alternative methods to treat hot flashes are, therefore, urgently needed. Goodwin et al. have performed a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of megestrol acetate in 286 women with breast cancer. After 3 months, 65% of the patients receiving 20 mg megestrol acetate daily had achieved an appreciable reduction in the number of hot flashes (≥ 75% from baseline), compared with 48% in the 40 mg megestrol acetate group and 14% in the placebo group. The positive effects of megestrol acetate on hot flash frequency were maintained at 6 months. In this Practice Point commentary, I discuss the key findings of Goodwin et al. and place them into clinical context, highlighting the need for additional studies of hormonal therapies in women with breast cancer.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^116GaQqc]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Two trials have investigated the efficacy of letrozole (2.5 or 0.5 mg o.d.) vs megestrol acetate 40 mg q.d. (Table 1). Results of the European trial showed the OR rate was significantly higher for patients receiving letrozole 2.5 mg than for letrozole 0.5 mg (P = 0.004) or megestrol acetate (P = 0.04) (24, 13 and 16%, respectively). Letrozole 2.5 mg was superior to letrozole 0.5 mg for TTP (P = 0.02), but not compared with megestrol acetate. At a 51-month follow-up analysis for the letrozole 2.5 mg arm, letrozole did not show significant survival benefit over megestrol acetate (Table 1). In the US trial, no significant differences were reported for TTP (Table 1) or OR rate and, contrary to the first trial, the efficacy of letrozole was not dose related. No significant survival benefit was seen for letrozole vs megestrol acetate (Table 1). It has been speculated that these contradictory findings may be the result of an imbalance of prognostic factors in favour of megestrol acetate in the latter trial.

### Calcium acetate capsules 667 mg (calcium acetate) [^114pGPwM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS

Capsule: 667 mg calcium acetate per capsule.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hypercalcemia

Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate. Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with calcium acetate.

An overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the calcium acetate dosage, or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia.

More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy.

Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification. The long-term effect of calcium acetate on the progression of vascular or soft tissue calcification has not been determined.

Hypercalcemia (> 11 mg/dL) was reported in 16% of patients in a 3-month study of solid dose formulation of calcium acetate; all cases resolved upon lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment.

Maintain the serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product below 55 mg²/dL².

5.2 Concomitant Use with Medications

Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111bjBkH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy — calcimimetic therapy details: Calcimimetics are described with an oral regimen of Initial: 30 mg twice daily; increase dose incrementally every 2 to 4 weeks (to 60 mg twice daily, 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 to 4 times daily) as necessary to normalize sCa levels. The mode of action is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist that reduces parathyroid hormone secretion and may decrease renal calcium reabsorption. Onset of effect occurs in 2 to 3 days, and during therapy calcium is reduced by at least 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) in approximately 60% of patients. Reported adverse events include nausea, vomiting, headache, and fractures, with case reports indicating reduction of calcium levels in patients with refractory HCM related to non–small-cell lung, neuroendocrine, breast, or renal cancer.

### Markers of systemic inflammation predict survival in patients with advanced renal cell cancer [^117F9LkV]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

The patient population for this analysis comprised 416 patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC who were treated with lapatinib or hormonal therapy after prior failure of immunotherapy in a randomised phase III trial (EGF20001). The eligibility, methods, treatment plan, and outcome for this phase III trial have been previously published. Key eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic RCC not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, measurable disease, progression after or intolerance to first-line cytokine-based therapy, adequate haematologic, renal, and hepatic function, KPS⩾70%, and life expectancy⩾12 weeks. Lapatinib was administered orally at 1250 mg daily; hormonal therapy was also administered daily, and consisted of megestrol acetate or tamoxifen as decided by the investigator. All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the randomised trial.

Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected prospectively on all patients as part of the clinical trial. Date of death or last follow-up was also recorded for all patients.

Statistical analysis

The end point of interest was overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomisation to the date of death or date of last follow-up. We first evaluated the discriminative value of MSKCC-defined prognostic factors: Karnofsky Performance Status, haemoglobin level, and corrected serum calcium, in patients from the EGF20001 trial. These factors were examined individually in univariate analyses, and then in combination as multivariate models. Using the previously defined MSKCC classification, patients were grouped into good, intermediate, or poor risk groups based on the presence of none, one, or two to three baseline factors. Low Karnofsky Performance Status (< 80%), low haemoglobin level (< 13 g dL −1 for males and < 11.5 g dL −1 for females), and high corrected serum calcium (⩾10 mg dL −1) were considered to be risk factors for shorter OS.

After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years.8(See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use)

In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83 to 2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years.8(See CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use)

When data from the 2 populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19 to 2.60).

Research considerations — evidence gaps for hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM): Head to head RCTs of IV BPs vs Dmab are needed to assess clinically important outcomes for this intervention, including clinical improvement. Because of the rarity of this condition, RCTs may require global collaboration. Assessing appropriate glucocorticoid dosing and duration in this population and determining continued glucocorticoid need if antiresorptive therapy is administered are needed. Significant gaps in research exist regarding complementary evidence for the treatment of HCM, including health services delivery, costs/cost-effectiveness of treatment, patients' values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. We tested megestrol acetate (MA) against placebo in the treatment of advanced HCC.

Methods:

From 2002 through 2007, this randomised double-blind trial enrolled 204 patients with treatment-naive advanced HCC (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance rating of 0–3) from specialist care centres in six Asia-Pacific nations. Patients received placebo or MA (320 mg day −1). End points were overall survival (OS) and quality of life.

Results:

An adverse but not statistically significant difference in OS was found for MA vs placebo: median values 1.88 and 2.14 months, respectively (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.92–1.71, P = 0.16). However, OS was similar among patients of good functional status (Child-Pugh A and ECOG 0, 1 or 2) (44.3%) in both treatment groups, with the adverse effect of MA confined to those of poor status. Megestrol acetate patients had a worse global health status (not statistically significant) but reduced levels of appetite loss and nausea/vomiting.

Conclusion:

Megestrol acetate has no role in prolonging OS in advanced treatment-naive HCC. Overall survival with placebo differed markedly from that in similar trials conducted elsewhere, suggesting therapeutic outcomes may be strongly dependent on ECOG status and Child-Pugh score.

### Calcium acetate (eliphos) [^113SdRfC]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Treat mild hypercalcemia by reducing or interrupting ELIPHOS and Vitamin D. Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of ELIPHOS. (5.1)
Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity. (5.2)

5.1 Hypercalcemia

Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate (ELIPHOS®). Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with ELIPHOS®.

An overdose of ELIPHOS®may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the ELIPHOS®dosage, or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia.

More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing ELIPHOS®therapy.

Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the ELIPHOS®dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification. The long term effect of ELIPHOS®on the progression of vascular or soft tissue calcification has not been determined.

Hypercalcemia (> 11 mg/dL) was reported in 16% of patients in a 3-month study of solid dose formulation of calcium acetate; all cases resolved upon lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment.

Maintain the serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product below 55 mg²/dL².

5.2 Concomitant Use with Medications

Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

### Megestrol-induced Cushing syndrome [^115g5wnT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of Cushing syndrome associated with megestrol acetate therapy in a patient with renal insufficiency.

Summary

A 17-year-old boy with renal insufficiency due to unilateral renal agenesis developed Cushing syndrome and worsening of his renal function after megestrol acetate therapy. The diagnosis was based on clinical and analytical evaluation.

Discussion

Megestrol acetate is indicated for the treatment of cachexia associated with AIDS and malignancy. Due to its glucocorticoid activity, megestrol use has resulted in the occurrence of Cushing syndrome in both patient groups. We report the case of a young patient with renal insufficiency due to unilateral renal agenesis who developed Cushing syndrome two months after administration of high-dose (900-mg/d) megestrol acetate for an eating disorder.

Conclusions

The risk of megestrol-induced Cushing syndrome, especially with high doses of the medication, should be considered as a possible adverse effect in patents with renal insufficiency.

### Appetite disorders in uremia [^111ZrRvz]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease frequently experience loss of appetite (anorexia), which increases in severity during the progression of the disease and may lead to protein-energy wasting, morbidity, and mortality. Anorexia represents a multiple, complex, and multifactorial disorder that may have its origin in renal failure (contemplating not only retention of uremic toxins but also peptides and cytokines) but that later on also involves metabolic abnormalities not yet corrected by dialysis therapy. This paper reviews current knowledge about the clinical signs of uremic anorexia as well as mechanisms involved. Based on megestrol acetate interventions and the recent observation that sex may modulate uremic appetite behavior, the potential role of sex hormones in treating chronic kidney disease anorexia needs to be further explored.

### Rapid progression of advanced "hormone-resistant" prostate cancer during palliative treatment with progestins for cancer cachexia [^115iEk9k]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

We report three patients with advanced "hormone-resistant" prostate cancer, each of whom had rapid progression of the disease during treatment with megestrol acetate for cancer cachexia. All patients had been previously treated with total androgenic deprivation. With progression of the disease, megestrol acetate was given to palliate the cancer-related wasting syndrome. No other antineoplastic drugs were contemporaneously given, and no concomitant condition that could favor the progression of the disease was present. The worsening observed while receiving megestrol acetate, and the atypical withdrawal syndrome occurring after the treatment was stopped, seem to suggest a promoting role of megestrol acetate in advanced "hormone-resistant" prostate cancer. The risk of rapid disease progression overwhelming the anti-cachectic palliative effect should be kept in mind when progestins are administered as a palliative treatment of cancer cachexia in patients with advanced "hormone-resistant" prostate cancer.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^115Jbpx1]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypocalcaemia associated with the use of bisphosphonates and denosumab can be serious; however, it is both preventable and treatable. Given the reduction in skeletal morbidity and the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with cancer and bone metastases, potential barriers to their use should be properly understood and addressed. With appropriate patient monitoring and preventative measures, patients with advanced prostate cancer, including those with additional risk factors for hypocalcaemia, should be able to continue to benefit from treatment with these agents.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^114Cgs4K]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Mild hypocalcaemia

Patients with mild hypocalcaemia (asymptomatic grade 1) should be treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplements: calcium (1 g) and vitamin D (cholecalciferol at least 800 IU) should be given twice daily. Patients who are vitamin D deficient and who do not respond to this therapy can be given higher doses of vitamin D: at least 25,000 IU orally once a week for 8 weeks or, where available and if needed, 7 mg intramuscularly every 3 months. It is important to check whether a patient is hypomagnesaemic, which induces functional hypoparathyroidism leading to low serum calcium levels. If a patient is hypomagnesaemic, precipitating drugs should not be administered. To normalise magnesium concentration, intravenous magnesium at a dose of 24 mmol should be administered over 24 h. We recommend that treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption be continued in patients who experience grade 1 hypocalcaemia.

SOLTAMOX can cause serious side effects, including:

See " What is the most important information I should know about SOLTAMOX? "
Liver problems, including liver cancer. SOLTAMOX can cause changes in liver function blood tests, and sometimes can cause liver cancer and other serious liver problems that can lead to death. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check you for these problems during treatment with SOLTAMOX.
Other cancers.
High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). People with breast cancer that has spread to their bones may develop hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can happen within a few weeks after you start taking SOLTAMOX. Your healthcare provider should check you for this problem. If it is severe, your healthcare provider may tell you to stop taking SOLTAMOX.
Decreased blood cell counts. SOLTAMOX can cause a decrease in platelet counts, red blood cell counts, and white blood cell counts that can be severe. Your healthcare provider should check your blood counts during treatment with SOLTAMOX.
Eye problems. SOLTAMOX can increase your chance of developing cataracts and other eye problems. Tell your healthcare provider about any changes in your vision or other eye symptoms during treatment with SOLTAMOX.

### Megestrol acetate for treatment of anorexia-cachexia syndrome [^111CXS3D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of a previously published review in The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 2) on 'Megestrol acetate for the treatment of anorexia-cachexia syndrome'. Megestrol acetate (MA) is currently used to improve appetite and to increase weight in cancer-associated anorexia. In 1993, MA was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia or unexplained weight loss in patients with AIDS. The mechanism by which MA increases appetite is unknown and its effectiveness for anorexia and cachexia in neoplastic and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients is under investigation.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of MA in palliating anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with cancer, AIDS and other underlying pathologies.

Search Methods

We sought studies through an extensive search of electronic databases, journals, reference lists, contact with investigators and other search strategies outlined in the methods. The most recent search for this update was carried out in May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included in the review if they assessed MA compared to placebo or other drug treatments in randomised controlled trials of patients with a clinical diagnosis of anorexia-cachexia syndrome related to cancer, AIDS or any other underlying pathology.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors conducted data extraction and evaluated methodological quality. We performed quantitative analyses using appetite and quality of life as a dichotomous variable, and analysed weight gain as continuous and dichotomous variables.

Main Results

We included 35 trials in this update, the same number but not the same trials as in the previous version of the review. The trials comprised 3963 patients for effectiveness and 3180 for safety. Sixteen trials compared MA at different doses with placebo, seven trials compared different doses of MA with other drug treatments and 10 trials compared different doses of MA. Meta-analysis showed a benefit of MA compared with placebo, particularly with regard to appetite improvement and weight gain in cancer, AIDS and other underlying conditions, and lack of benefit in the same patients when MA was compared to other drugs. There was insufficient information to define the optimal dose of MA, but higher doses were more related to weight improvement than lower doses. Quality of life improvement in patients was seen only when comparing MA versus placebo but not other drugs in both subcategories: cancer and AIDS. Oedema, thromboembolic phenomena and deaths were more frequent in the patients treated with MA. More than 40 side effects were studied.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that MA improves appetite and is associated with slight weight gain in cancer, AIDS and in patients with other underlying pathology. Despite the fact that these patients are receiving palliative care they should be informed of the risks involved in taking MA.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^112WBYfC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within 4 h of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be given at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 h; duration of dosing is, however, limited to 48 h owing to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy is rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. In addition, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease of high serum calcium levels.

### Management of cancer cachexia: ASCO guideline [^115meTDf]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical interventions: appetite stimulants — Megestrol acetate improves appetite and body weight in cancer cachexia, with weight gain primarily adipose tissue and toxicities including thromboembolic events, edema, and adrenal suppression. Corticosteroids also improve appetite, but their role as an appetite stimulant is often limited to patients with a life expectancy of weeks to a couple months. For olanzapine, evidence is limited and further evaluation is recommended; in a 2019 symposium trial that compared olanzapine with placebo in 30 patients with baseline appetite scores of 1–2 (on a scale of 0–10 points; 0 = poor and 10 = excellent), placebo scores were unchanged over a 1-week period while olanzapine recipients improved to 6–8 with P < .001, and the Expert Panel's final recommendation was not to recommend it at this time.

Calcitonin adjunct and evidence-to-decision considerations for severe HCM — The panel conducted a systematic review and did not identify any evidence for acceptability, equity, resources, or feasibility, judged "don't know" for the balance of effects, and noted that calcitonin is extremely expensive in the United States. The panel discussed that, in patients with severe HCM and possibly in those with renal dysfunction, calcitonin in addition to IV fluids to temper hypercalcemia (while awaiting the effects of more potent agents with bisphosphonates or denosumab), may be appropriate. A case series reported on 4 patients with HCM due to multiple myeloma and renal dysfunction treated with Dmab, of whom 3 also received calcitonin and SCa normalized in 2. Research priorities include RCTs with BPs and/or Dmab in HCM, head to head RCTs assessing clinically important outcomes, potential global collaboration due to the relative rarity of HCM, addressing gaps in complementary evidence including health services delivery, costs/cost-effectiveness, patients' values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility, and evidence regarding the pathophysiology and management of rebound HCM following Dmab discontinuation.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Hypercalcemia is discussed elsewhere [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In clinical studies, calcium acetate has been generally well tolerated.

Calcium acetate was studied in a 3-month, open-label, non-randomized study of 98 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients and an alternate liquid formulation of calcium acetate was studied in a two-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with 69 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients. Adverse reactions (> 2% on treatment) from these trials are presented in Table 1.

Mild hypercalcemia may be asymptomatic or manifest itself as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. More severe hypercalcemia is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor, and coma. Decreasing dialysate calcium concentration could reduce the incidence and severity of calcium acetate-induced hypercalcemia. Isolated cases pruritus have been reported, which may represent allergic reactions.

6.2 Post marketing Experience

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval of calcium acetate: dizziness, edema, and weakness.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The drug interaction of calcium acetate is characterized by the potential of calcium to bind to drugs with anionic functions (e.g., carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups). Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism.

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between calcium acetate or calcium acetate capsules and most concomitant drugs. When administering an oral medication with calcium acetate where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, administer the drug one hour before or three hours after calcium acetate capsules or calcium acetate. Monitor blood levels of the concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from the clinical trials with all forms of calcium acetate.

7.1 Ciprofloxacin

In a study of 15 healthy subjects, a co-administered single dose of 4 calcium acetate tablets, approximately 2.7g, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50%.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^112PTujH]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

A large, randomised, double-blind trial has compared exemestane (25 mg o.d.) with megestrol acetate (40 mg q.d.). There was significant improvement in TTP for exemestane compared with megestrol acetate (Table 1), while OR rate was not significantly different between groups. Exemestane also showed significant improvement in overall survival compared with megestrol acetate (Table 1), although this was after a shorter median follow-up (11.4 months) compared with the anastrozole and letrozole studies.

Overall, although there have been some differences in outcome and the end points at which significant benefits have been observed, the newer-generation AIs have all proven more effective and better tolerated than the progestogen megestrol acetate, and letrozole has demonstrated superior efficacy to aminoglutethimide, for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer failing on tamoxifen. As a result, third-generation AIs are now established as the standard treatment in this patient population. In contrast, the second-generation AIs formestane and fadrozole have shown no significant efficacy benefits over megestrol acetate in patients progressing on tamoxifen.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^112taDcv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

Osteoclast formation, activity, and pharmacologic inhibition — receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK) ligand (RANKL), produced by osteoblasts, binds the receptor RANK on pre-osteoclasts as multinucleated osteoclasts adhere to bone and differentiate into mature activated osteoclasts which resorb bone; denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL to block RANK-RANKL binding, resulting in inhibition of osteoclast formation, function, and survival; bisphosphonates adhere to the mineral component of bone and are endocytosed by mature osteoclasts during the resorptive process, resulting in osteoclast inactivation and apoptosis; CFU-GM refers to colony forming unit granulocyte–macrophage.

### Megesterol acetate (megace ES) [^111o6V32]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Several investigators have reported on the appetite enhancing property of megestrol acetate and its possible use in cachexia. The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time.

Absorption and Distribution

Mean plasma concentrations of megestrol acetate after administration of 625 mg (125 mg/mL) of Megace ES oral suspension are equivalent under fed conditions to 800 mg (40 mg/mL) of megestrol acetate oral suspension in healthy volunteers.®
In order to characterize the dose proportionality of Megace ES, pharmacokinetic studies across a range of doses were conducted when administered under fasting and fed conditions. Pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate was linear in the dosing range between 150 mg and 675 mg after Megace ES administration regardless of meal condition. The mean peak plasma concentration (C) and the mean area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) after a high fat meal were increased by 48% and 36%, respectively, compared to those under the fasting condition after 625 mg Megace ES administration. This food effect is less than that seen for the original formulation, megestrol acetate 800 mg/20 mL, where a high fat meal significantly increased AUC and C of megestrol acetate to 2-fold and 7-fold, respectively, compared to those under the fasting condition. There was no difference in safety following administration in the fed state, therefore Megace ES could be taken without regard to meals.®®max®max®
Plasma steady state pharmacokinetics of megestrol acetate was evaluated in 10 adult, cachectic male adult patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and an involuntary weight loss greater than 10% of baseline who received single oral doses of 800 mg/day of megestrol acetate oral suspension for 21 days.

### Letrozole (Femara) [^112RCiVv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer

Study discontinuations in the megestrol acetate comparison study (AR/BC2) for adverse reactions other than progression of tumor were 5/188 (2.7%) on Femara 0.5 mg, in 4/174 (2.3%) on Femara 2.5 mg, and in 15/190 (7.9%) on megestrol acetate. There were fewer thromboembolic events at both Femara doses than on the megestrol acetate arm (0.6% vs 4.7%). There was also less vaginal bleeding (0.3% vs 3.2%) on Femara than on megestrol acetate. In the aminoglutethimide comparison study (AR/BC3), discontinuations for reasons other than progression occurred in 6/193 (3.1%) on 0.5 mg Femara, 7/185 (3.8%) on 2.5 mg Femara, and 7/178 (3.9%) of patients on aminoglutethimide.

Comparisons of the incidence of adverse reactions revealed no significant differences between the high and low dose Femara groups in either study. Most of the adverse reactions observed in all treatment groups were mild to moderate in severity and it was generally not possible to distinguish adverse reactions due to treatment from the consequences of the patient's metastatic breast cancer, the effects of estrogen deprivation, or intercurrent illness.

### Drug-related hypercalcemia [^114tLW5R]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on the commonly prescribed medicaments that can be responsible for hypercalcemia, considering the prevalence, the predominant pathophysiological mechanisms, and the optimal medical management of each drug-induced hypercalcemia. Vitamin D supplements and 1α-hydroxylated vitamin D analogues increase intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium reabsorption as well as bone resorption. In patients with hypoparathyroidism receiving recombinant human PTH, transient hypercalcemia can occur because of overtreatment, usually during acute illness. Thiazide-induced hypercalcemia is mainly explained by enhanced renal proximal calcium reabsorption, changing preexistent asymptomatic normocalcemic or intermittently hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism into the classic hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism. Lithium causes hypercalcemia mainly by drug-induced hyperparathyroidism.

### Megestrol acetate for the treatment of anorexia-cachexia syndrome [^111ev4L1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Megestrol acetate (MA) is currently used to improve appetite and to increase weight in cancer-associated anorexia. In 1993 MA was approved by the United States's Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or unexplained weight loss in patients with AIDS. The mechanism by which MA increases appetite is unknown, and its effectiveness for anorexia and cachexia in neoplastic and AIDS patients is under investigation.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of MA in palliating anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with cancer, AIDS and other underlying pathologies.

Search Strategy

Studies were sought thorough an extensive search of the electronic databases, journals, reference lists, contact with investigators and other search strategies outlined in the methods. The most recent search was carried out on October 2002.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included in the review if they assessed megestrol acetate compared to placebo or other drug treatments in randomized controlled trials of patients with a clinical diagnosis of anorexia-cachexia related to cancer, AIDS or another underlying pathology.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was conducted by two independent authors, and methodological quality evaluated. Quantitative analyses were performed using appetite and quality of life as a dichotomous variable, and weight gain was analysed as continuous and dichotomous variables. Studies with more than 50% of patients lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis.

Main Results

Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria (4123 patients). Twenty-one trials compared MA at different doses with placebo; four compared different doses of MA versus other drugs; two compared MA with other drugs and placebo; and three compared different doses of MA. For all patient conditions, meta-analysis showed a benefit of MA compared with placebo, particularly with regard to appetite improvement and weight gain in cancer patients. Analysing quality of life, clinical and statistical heterogeneity was found and discussed. There was insufficient information to define the optimal dose of MA.

Authors' Conclusions

This review demonstrates that MA improves appetite and weight gain in patients with cancer. No overall conclusion about quality of life (QOL) could be drawn due to heterogeneity. The small number of patients, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting have not allowed us to recommend megestrol acetate in AIDS patients or with other underlying pathologies.

### Approach to diagnosis and treatment of hypercalcemia in a patient with malignancy [^111wsekJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy and portends a worse prognosis. It causes a variety of symptoms in patients, which can range from confusion and polyuria to coma and death. There are 4 broad mechanistic categories to classify hypercalcemia of malignancy: local osteolysis secondary to metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma, excess parathyroid-related hormone, excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, and ectopic parathyroid hormone production. Volume expansion with normal saline solution and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates to decrease osteoclast-mediated bone destruction are effective initial therapies. Calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids can serve as adjunctive therapies. Denosumab is an attractive therapeutic option for refractory cases of hypercalcemia, although more data are required before this therapy can be recommended.

### Anti-cancer therapy and clinical trial considerations for gynecologic oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis [^116K4vKM]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Recurrent disease therapy options and supportive care — non-cytotoxic alternatives and when to avoid further treatment — are noted as "In certain patients, oral therapies may be a preferred alternative to chemotherapy", with examples that "oral regimens such as megestrol acetate or alternating megestrol acetate/tamoxifen can be considered", along with "PARPi can be used as treatment for BRCA associated or platinum-sensitive HRD ovarian cancers" and "Oral chemotherapies (etoposide or cyclophosphamide) are other options for patients with ovarian cancer"; the text adds that "Best supportive care may provide better outcomes for patients in whom the likelihood of benefit from further therapy is low (e.g., platinum-refractory ovarian cancer)" and cautions that "One should be cognizant of the risks and benefits of further therapy, considering the risk for potential COVID-19 complications".

### American Geriatrics Society identifies another five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^117RZKwC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society Choosing Wisely — pharmacologic and supplement approaches for unintentional weight loss in older adults note that megestrol acetate results in small appetite/weight gains without improvement in quality of life or survival and increases risks, with specific event frequencies: "One in four individuals who take megestrol acetate will experience an increase in appetite, one in 12 will have an increase in weight, and one in 23 will die", and "The AGS 2012 Beers Criteria lists megestrol acetate among potentially inappropriate medications for older adults". For cannabinoids, "Dronabinol has been studied to only a limited extent in geriatric care, and its pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in older adults. Its therapeutic benefit has not been clearly demonstrated in this population, and it consequently cannot be considered for routine treatment of unintentional weight loss in elderly adults". "Cyproheptadine has strong anticholinergic properties, can produce delirium, and is listed as a potentially inappropriate medication for use in older adults in the 2012 Beers Criteria". High-quality reviews report that "dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), thalidomide, and anabolic steroids have not found clear evidence of the efficacy or safety of these agents for weight gain in late life or advanced progressive illness", and nutrition support evidence shows that oral supplements "consistently produce small weight gains and may reduce mortality in undernourished older people", although "most of the studies of nutritional supplements have been considered to be of poor quality" and "There appear to be no clear improvements in other clinical outcomes, such as hospital length of stay, functional status, and mood".

### Anamorelin (ONO-7643) in Japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer and cachexia: results of a randomized phase 2 trial [^1145LifP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cachexia is frequently associated with a variety of clinically relevant features, including anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and muscle protein breakdown, and these features are driven by muscle wasting. However, pre-cachexia may occur in the absence of weight loss, and obesity or prior weight loss may mask its symptoms in some patients. Cachexia is a frequent disorder in cancer patients and is cited as the cause of death in about 20% of cancer patients. Furthermore, cancer cachexia may also be accompanied by increased chemotherapy-related toxicity, as well as poor prognosis and poor quality of life (QOL).

There are several treatment options available for the management of patients with cachexia. For example, megestrol acetate is available for first-line therapy in AIDS-related cachexia in some countries (but not Japan). In a clinical trial of cancer cachexia, megestrol acetate significantly improved appetite and weight gain compared with placebo. However, megestrol acetate tends to increase fat mass rather than muscle mass, and in a clinical trial, it did not improve QOL and was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events compared with placebo.
