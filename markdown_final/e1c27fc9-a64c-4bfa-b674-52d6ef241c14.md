## Question

What is the recommended breast cancer surveillance after a mastectomy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about breast cancer surveillance after mastectomy, including how to handle reconstruction, contralateral breast surveillance, high-risk scenarios, and special populations, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching surveillance goals and principles after mastectomy. Then, I should verify the clinical examination schedule and its evidence base. Next, I will examine ipsilateral imaging after mastectomy, including the role of mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, and I should double-check the ACR's stance on autologous reconstructions. After that, I need to review contralateral breast surveillance and the timing of mammography. I will then consider high-risk patients, including BRCA carriers and those with dense breasts. I should also address special populations such as men, older adults, and those with invasive lobular carcinoma. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and highlight controversies and evidence gaps that warrant shared decision-making and ongoing research.

> Let me first confirm the overarching surveillance goals after mastectomy: detect locoregional recurrence early, identify contralateral breast cancer, and avoid unnecessary testing that does not improve survival or quality of life. Routine imaging for distant metastases in asymptomatic patients is not recommended, and I should be careful not to over-order tests that won't change management [^114zffAt] [^1125hjTH] [^115W92xA].

> I need to check the clinical examination schedule and its rationale. NCCN recommends history and physical every 3–6 months for the first 5 years, then annually, while ESMO suggests every 3 months for the first 3 years, every 6 months in years 4–5, then annually, and ACS/ASCO aligns with a similar cadence. The rationale is that most recurrences occur within 5 years, and careful examination of the chest wall, incisions, and nodal basins detects most local recurrences, so I should not skip these visits [^116CHvew] [^114sRmci] [^11731fTa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ipsilateral imaging. I should verify whether routine imaging of the mastectomy site improves outcomes. The highest-quality evidence shows very low yields for clinically occult cancers on surveillance imaging after mastectomy, with pooled detection rates around 1.86–5.17 per 1000 depending on modality and high interval cancer rates, indicating limited benefit; NCCN and ASCO recommend against routine ipsilateral imaging, and a large meta-analysis concludes imaging surveillance is unnecessary in this context until proven otherwise [^113b9Rar] [^112hG6oM] [^114zffAt] [^1125hjTH].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance for autologous tissue reconstruction. The ACR suggests digital mammography or tomosynthesis may be appropriate in autologous flaps, but I should confirm whether this translates into improved outcomes. Evidence remains limited, with no demonstrated survival benefit from routine imaging of reconstructed breasts, and most recurrences are superficial and detectable on exam; thus, even where imaging is technically feasible, it should be reserved for clinical suspicion rather than routine use [^116CHvew] [^113Hrbsa] [^1161XEXb].

> I will now examine the role of ultrasound and MRI on the ipsilateral side. Ultrasound is first-line for any new palpable lump or focal pain, and MRI has higher sensitivity but lacks supportive evidence for routine surveillance after mastectomy. I should confirm that MRI is not recommended for routine surveillance unless there is a compelling high-risk indication, which aligns with guideline positions [^116CHvew] [^112hG6oM] [^114zffAt].

> Next, I should review contralateral breast surveillance. All major guidelines recommend annual mammography of the contralateral breast because the risk of a new primary is approximately 0.5–1% per year, and early detection improves outcomes. Timing should start about 6–12 months after completion of radiotherapy, with annual imaging thereafter, and I need to ensure I don't conflate this with ipsilateral imaging, which remains unnecessary in the absence of symptoms [^114zffAt] [^112eFGG9] [^115WLX58].

> Let me consider high-risk patients, especially BRCA1/2 carriers. If they retain breast tissue, annual mammography plus MRI is recommended, whereas after bilateral mastectomy, surveillance focuses on clinical examination of the chest wall and nodal basins without routine imaging. I should double-check that this applies to moderate-penetrance carriers as well, where MRI is generally added when breast tissue remains, and I must remember that CRRM reduces CBC risk but has uncertain survival impact, so counseling should be nuanced [^117MdNe8] [^1136oTgh] [^115viRVb].

> But wait, what if the patient has dense breasts or was diagnosed young? I need to check whether supplemental MRI is justified in personal-history survivors without a genetic mutation. The ACR suggests annual MRI for women with dense breasts or diagnosis before age 50, acknowledging growing but still limited evidence; I should frame this as individualized, balancing potential yield against false positives and resource use, and avoid implying a universal recommendation [^1158Yt7L] [^116iaR3m].

> I should confirm special populations. For men with breast cancer, surveillance mirrors women's principles with counseling on recurrence symptoms and avoidance of routine MRI, and ipsilateral mammography is reasonable after lumpectomy if technically feasible, while contralateral mammography is considered when a genetic predisposition exists. For older adults, I need to individualize imaging intensity based on life expectancy and comorbidity, and consider cessation when life expectancy is limited, aligning with geriatric oncology principles [^112MQmZC] [^116Swjs7] [^1161D484].

> Let me reconsider invasive lobular carcinoma. Mammography has lower sensitivity for ILC, and emerging data suggest higher interval cancer rates with mammographic surveillance after BCS, with MRI detecting more recurrences. However, these data pertain to BCS, not mastectomy, so after mastectomy the principle remains that imaging is symptom-driven, but if residual breast tissue exists and density or age raises concern, selective MRI may be reasonable in shared decision-making [^11455VTR] [^115RQbYM] [^116BATs5].

> I should double-check the practical, risk-stratified algorithm I'm proposing: for average-risk patients after mastectomy, rely on scheduled clinical examinations with patient education on signs of recurrence and annual contralateral mammography. For autologous reconstruction, consider that some centers obtain a baseline mammogram at 1 year, but routine annual imaging is not mandated by major guidelines and should be individualized. For any new palpable abnormality or persistent pain, obtain targeted ultrasound and escalate to diagnostic mammography or MRI as indicated. For high-risk patients with residual breast tissue, add annual MRI. And avoid routine labs or metastatic imaging in asymptomatic patients [^114zffAt] [^116CHvew] [^1125hjTH].

> Hold on, I should verify the controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. There is persistent variability in practice patterns with overuse of imaging after mastectomy, and recent meta-analyses emphasize low yields and interval cancers, arguing against routine surveillance imaging. Patient-centered models like open-access or on-demand follow-up are being explored, and the Mammo-50 trial suggests less frequent mammography may be non-inferior in older survivors, though that study addressed frequency rather than mastectomy-specific ipsilateral imaging. Shared decision-making should explicitly discuss uncertainty, potential harms of false positives, and patient preferences [^114wHCN5] [^112hG6oM] [^117HjTJL] [^113XFTB4].

> In summary, I need to ensure my final recommendation is precise: after mastectomy, surveillance should center on regular clinical examinations and annual contralateral mammography. Routine ipsilateral imaging is not recommended in the absence of symptoms, including after reconstruction, though the ACR notes mammography may be considered in autologous flaps. Reserve ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, or MRI for clinical suspicion, and tailor intensity for high-risk patients with residual breast tissue, men, older adults, and those with ILC, all within a shared decision-making framework that acknowledges current evidence limitations [^114zffAt] [^112eFGG9] [^116CHvew] [^112hG6oM].

After mastectomy, surveillance centers on **annual clinical exams** [^11731fTa] and **patient-reported symptoms** [^1129kXif]; routine imaging of the mastectomy site is not recommended [^114zffAt] unless there are clinical concerns [^116CHvew]. If reconstruction was performed, **imaging is only indicated for new symptoms or abnormal findings** [^116CHvew] [^113Hrbsa]. For patients with an intact contralateral breast, **annual mammography** [^115WLX58] is recommended [^112eFGG9]. MRI is not routine [^111BVnP8] but may be considered for high-risk patients (e.g. BRCA carriers) [^117MdNe8] or when clinical suspicion persists despite negative mammography and ultrasound [^1158Yt7L]. Routine laboratory tests or imaging for asymptomatic patients are not recommended [^1125hjTH] [^115W92xA].

## Clinical examination and patient education

Regular clinical examinations are essential for detecting recurrence [^114T9ufp]. The **recommended schedule** is every 3–6 months for the first 3 years, every 6–12 months for years 4–5, and annually thereafter [^11731fTa]. Patient education should emphasize **self-examination** [^112utZbM] and prompt reporting of new lumps, skin changes, or other concerning symptoms.

## Imaging surveillance

### Ipsilateral breast (mastectomy site)

Routine imaging of the mastectomy site is **not recommended** [^114zffAt] in asymptomatic patients [^1125hjTH]. Imaging is reserved for **clinical suspicion** — such as a palpable mass, skin changes, or patient-reported symptoms [^116CHvew] [^113Hrbsa].

---

### Contralateral breast

Annual **mammography** [^115WLX58] is recommended for patients with an intact contralateral breast [^112eFGG9]. MRI is **not routine** [^111BVnP8] but may be considered for high-risk patients (e.g. BRCA mutation carriers) [^117MdNe8] or when clinical suspicion persists despite negative mammography and ultrasound [^notfound].

---

## Role of MRI in surveillance

MRI is **not routinely recommended** for surveillance after mastectomy [^114zffAt] [^111BVnP8]. It may be considered for **high-risk patients** — such as BRCA mutation carriers [^117MdNe8] or when clinical suspicion persists despite negative mammography and ultrasound [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory tests and biomarkers

Routine laboratory tests or biomarkers are **not recommended** for asymptomatic patients [^1125hjTH] [^115W92xA]. They should only be performed when clinically indicated by symptoms or abnormal findings [^114zffAt].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Surveillance method** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Clinical examination | Every 3–6 months for 3 years, then every 6–12 months for 2 years, then annually [^11731fTa] |
| Patient education | Emphasize self-examination and symptom reporting [^1129kXif] |
| Ipsilateral imaging | Not recommended unless clinically indicated [^114zffAt] [^115ZJAwJ] |
| Contralateral mammography | Annually [^115WLX58] [^112eFGG9] |
| MRI | Not routine; consider for high-risk patients or persistent suspicion [^111BVnP8] [^117MdNe8] |
| Laboratory tests | Not recommended unless clinically indicated [^1125hjTH] [^115W92xA] |

---

## Conclusion

Surveillance after mastectomy should focus on **regular clinical examinations** [^11731fTa], **patient education** [^1129kXif], and **annual mammography of the contralateral breast** [^115WLX58] when applicable. Routine imaging of the mastectomy site or laboratory tests is not recommended unless clinically indicated [^114zffAt] [^1125hjTH]. MRI may be considered for high-risk patients or when clinical suspicion persists [^115x3CWr].

### Yield of surveillance imaging after mastectomy with or without reconstruction for patients with prior breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZJAwJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients with early breast cancer, 2 general surgical approaches are available as local treatment: breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy, the latter of which may be followed with immediate, delayed, or no reconstruction. Although BCS is the most frequently used treatment, many patients undergo mastectomy.

Conflicting results exist about the trend of mastectomy rates over time, with population-based studies showing increased, decreased, or even unchangedtrends. Such discrepancies might reflect the need to consider several factors in the decision-making process for surgery, such as clinicopathologic characteristics, physician- and patient-related factors, and personal preferences. Irrespective of the temporal trend in mastectomy rates, implant- or tissue-based reconstruction rates among patients with breast cancer treated with mastectomy have steadily increased over time.

The follow-up surveillance strategy for patients with breast cancer with curative intention aims to detect locoregional recurrences or systemic relapses as well as contralateral breast cancer at an early stage. Although intensive follow-up strategies, such as laboratory testing and whole-body imaging at regular intervals, have not been found to improve patients' prognosis or quality of life, physical examination at regular intervals and annual mammography, with ultrasonography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when needed, after BCS are recognized as cost-effective surveillance approaches and are recommended in current international guidelines.

However, the imaging surveillance strategy for patients with prior breast cancer treated with mastectomy with or without reconstruction is more controversial. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends against routine imaging for patients with breast cancer who have undergone mastectomy with or without reconstruction. However, the American College of Radiology categorized the use of mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis as potentially appropriate for patients with breast cancer treated with mastectomy and tissue-based reconstruction, but not after mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction or without reconstruction. These discrepancies in current guidelines reflect the lack of adequate evidence for or against surveillance imaging after mastectomy and might explain why breast imaging seems to be a common practice in contemporary clinical settings. Accordingly, there is a need to assess the clinical value of breast imaging in this setting by identifying the detection rate of clinically occult, nonpalpable recurrences that would have been missed through a physical examination.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the yield of surveillance imaging for patients with breast cancer who have undergone mastectomy with or without reconstruction in terms of overall cancer detection rate, clinically occult cancer detection rate, and interval cancer rate.

### Surveillance mammography in older patients with breast cancer-can we ever stop? a review [^1161D484]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Approximately 4% to 5% of breast cancer survivors will develop a new ipsilateral or contralateral cancer (in-breast event) over the 5 years following diagnosis, and annual surveillance mammography is recommended for those with residual breast tissue. The risk for such in-breast events persists over time, though increasing age at cancer diagnosis and treatment with hormonal therapy are associated with lower risk, and most older survivors of breast cancer will ultimately die from nonbreast cancer-related causes. Specific guidelines for surveillance strategies in older patients are limited. Prospective data on the benefits and harms of surveillance mammography in this population are lacking, and most of the evidence is derived from observational, retrospective data, often in the general population.

Observations

We review the current recommendations for breast cancer screening and surveillance for older patients, the current evidence for ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer risks in older survivors of breast cancer, and suggested approaches for discussions about surveillance mammography with older patients. We recommend individualized decision making for surveillance breast imaging in older survivors of breast cancer, with consideration of the following strategy for women 70 years or older: 1-time imaging 6 to 12 months after completion of local therapy followed by annual or biennial surveillance mammography for healthy women and cessation of mammography in patients whose life expectancy is less than 5 years to 10 years, regardless of age. Decisions on mammographic surveillance should also incorporate whether hormonal therapy is being administered, whether a patient's anticipated life expectancy is extraordinary, and whether a patient's individual risk for in-breast events is higher (or lower) than average risk for breast cancer survivors.

Conclusions and Relevance

We propose reframing discussions around surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors and to consider cessation while taking into account life expectancy, the estimated risk for subsequent in-breast events, and patient preferences.

### Surveillance mammography for detecting ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence and metachronous contralateral breast cancer: a systematic review [^11715jMA]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our findings should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on only nine studies involving a total of 3724 participants. Furthermore, the study conducted by Boné and colleagues included only mastectomy patients who underwent breast reconstruction using implants. Surveillance of the chest wall and/or the reconstructed breast in patients receiving either mastectomy alone, or mastectomy with breast reconstruction and implants, varies according to different health care systems and local protocols. These comprise an increasingly relevant sub-group of women, because of increasing rates of breast reconstruction procedures, who might receive routine surveillance mammography in the future. Results from this study should be treated as distinct from the others owing to the highly selected patient population who, whilst representing a subset of our considered population, differ greatly from the wider spectrum of women who receive surveillance in practice.

Systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy are highly complex and methodology in this area continues to evolve. In terms of strengths, we believe that the methods adopted for this review are scientifically rigorous and compatible with current guidance in this area. A limitation was that non-English language studies were excluded, potentially limiting the evidence base. Of the studies included here, few evaluated the performance of the considered tests for similar purposes. Furthermore, even where data were available it was not clinically appropriate to combine them, for example, because of differences between a "treated" and an "untreated" breast. Similarly, it was inappropriate to combine data from routine and non-routine surveillance patients. Furthermore, no data were reported by the included studies on other aspects such as adverse effects or acceptability of the tests.

Results for the index and comparator tests evaluated in this review were ascertained by subjective operator interpretation, either by visual inspection of an image of the breast (surveillance mammography, ultrasound and MRI) or by clinical examination of the breast. Data on the level of operator expertise or intra/inter-rater reliability were not reported. It is therefore unclear whether these factors had any influence on reported test accuracy within, and between, studies and therefore whether any potential test operator bias exists.

None of the studies met all of our criteria specified for higher quality studies, although they were judged to have reasonable internal validity. All but one study were considered to include a representative sample and therefore have good external validity.

### ACR appropriateness criteria stage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^116MpEys]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Women newly diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer have an early-stage disease that can be effectively treated. Evidence provides little justification for performing imaging to exclude metastasis in asymptomatic women with stage I breast cancer. No differences have been found in survival or quality of life in women regardless of whether they underwent initial workup for metastatic disease. These women generally prefer intensive follow-up to detect an early recurrence. However, survival rates do not differ between women who obtain intensive screening and surveillance, with imaging and laboratory studies, and women who undergo testing only as a result of development of symptoms or findings on clinical examinations. In addition, quality of life is similar for women who undergo intensive surveillance compared with those who do not. American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that annual mammography is the only imaging examination that should be performed to detect a localized breast recurrence in asymptomatic patients. Additional imaging may be needed if the patient has locoregional symptoms. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review by the panel include extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. When evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Managing hereditary breast cancer risk in women with and without ovarian cancer [^113G6JJn]. Gynecologic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that all women with ovarian cancer undergo germline genetic testing for BRCA1/2. Increasingly, genetic testing is being performed via panels that include other genes that confer a high or moderate risk of breast cancer. In addition, many women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer are not found to have a mutation, but may have increased risk of breast cancer for which surveillance and risk reduction strategies are indicated. This review discusses how to assess and manage an increased risk of breast cancer through surveillance, preventive medications, and risk-reducing surgery. Assessing and managing the increased risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers after a diagnosis of ovarian cancer can be challenging. For the first few years after an ovarian cancer diagnosis, BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have a relatively low risk of breast cancer, and their prognosis is largely determined by the ovarian cancer. However, if these women remain in remission after two years, the risk of breast cancer becomes comparable with, and in some cases exceeds, their risk of ovarian cancer recurrence. For these women, breast cancer surveillance and risk reduction becomes important to their overall health. Specifically, for BRCA1/2 carriers who are diagnosed with early-stage ovarian cancer, we recommend regular breast cancer surveillance and consideration of risk reduction with medication and/or prophylactic mastectomy. For women with advanced ovarian cancer who do not achieve remission, breast cancer surveillance or prophylaxis is not of value. However, among carriers with more favorable advanced disease, it is reasonable to initiate breast cancer surveillance. Patients with less favorable advanced stage disease who achieve sustained remission (> 2–5years) should also consider more aggressive strategies for breast cancer screening and prevention. For mutation carriers who remain in remission after five years, prophylactic mastectomy can be considered.

### ESR essentials: post-treatment breast cancer surveillance from mammography to a more personalised approach-practice recommendations by the European society of breast imaging [^116X7uUX]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The breast cancer long-term survival rate has improved; early detection of local recurrence and second primary cancers has been crucial to this success. Mammography is the standard imaging technique for follow-up, but its sensitivity is affected by breast density and post-treatment changes. This article discusses the role of mammography in the follow-up of women after breast cancer treatment, and the use of additional imaging techniques. For patients with genetic mutations or a risk of breast cancer above 20%, high-risk screening protocols are necessary. Non-genetic mutation carriers may require supplemental imaging. Contrast imaging should be offered to women with dense breasts and a young age at diagnosis. While MRI remains the most sensitive tool, it has limitations, and contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) emerges as a more affordable alternative. Current standards dictate the use of post-operative mammography annual surveillance for at least 5 years. As surveillance strategies evolve, the importance of personalised follow-up based on individual risk factors is emphasised. In fact, there is a need to optimise surveillance protocols and ensure equitable access to appropriate imaging methods for all breast cancer survivors. These recommendations can be implemented into practice by evaluating individual risk factors and engaging patients in shared decision-making. KEY POINTS: Adequate knowledge of normal post-surgical changes of the breast is crucial for avoiding unnecessary work-up. Five-year annual two-view mammography is the standard test for surveillance follow-up. Surveillance follow-up should move beyond a "one size fits all" to a more personalised approach.

### Variability of postsurgical imaging surveillance of breast cancer patients: a nationwide survey study [^114wHCN5]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Because of observed clinical variance and the discretion of referring physicians and radiologists in patient follow-up, the purpose of this study was to conduct a survey to explore whether broad discrepancy exists in imaging protocols used for postsurgical surveillance.

Subjects and Methods

An online survey was created to assess radiologists' use of diagnostic versus screening mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer and determine whether the choice of protocol was associated with practice characteristics (setting, region, and reader type).

Results

Of 8170 surveys sent, 849 (10%) completed responses were returned. Seventy-nine percent of respondents recommended initial diagnostic mammography after lumpectomy (65% at 6 months, 14% at 12 months); 49% recommended diagnostic surveillance for up to 2 years before a return to screening mammography; and 33% continued diagnostic surveillance for 2–5 years before returning to screening. For imaging after mastectomy, 57% of respondents recommended diagnostic mammography of the unaffected breast. Among the 57%, however, 37% recommended diagnostic screening for only the first postmastectomy follow-up evaluation, and the other 20% permanently designated patients for diagnostic mammography after mastectomy.

Conclusion

The optimal surveillance mammography regimen must be better defined. This preliminary study showed variability in diagnostic versus screening surveillance mammography for women with a history of breast cancer. Future studies should evaluate why these variations occur and how to standardize recommendations to tailor personalized imaging.

### Use of breast imaging after treatment for locoregional breast cancer (AFT-01) [^116n3u6x]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Annual mammography is recommended after breast cancer treatment. However, studies suggest its under-utilization for Medicare patients. Utilization in the broader population is unknown, as is the role of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Understanding factors associated with imaging use is critical to improvement of adherence to recommendations.

Methods

A random sample of 9835 eligible patients receiving surgery for stages 2 and 3 breast cancer from 2006 to 2007 was selected from the National Cancer Database for primary data collection. Imaging and recurrence data were abstracted from patients 90 days after surgery to 5 years after diagnosis. Factors associated with lack of imaging were assessed using multivariable repeated measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Patients were censored for death, bilateral mastectomy, new cancer, and recurrence.

Results

Of 9835 patients, 9622, 8702, 8021, and 7457 patients were eligible for imaging at surveillance years 1 through 4 respectively. Annual receipt of breast imaging declined from year 1 (69.5%) to year 4 (61.0%), and breast MRI rates decreased from 12.5 to 5.8%. Lack of imaging was associated with age 80 years or older and age younger than 50 years, black race, public or no insurance versus private insurance, greater comorbidity, larger node-positive hormone receptor-negative tumor, excision alone or mastectomy, and no chemotherapy (p < 0.005). Receipt of breast MRI was associated with age younger than 50 years, white race, higher education, private insurance, mastectomy, chemotherapy, care at a teaching/research facility, and MRI 12 months before diagnosis (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Under-utilization of mammography after breast cancer treatment is associated with sociodemographic and clinical factors, not institutional characteristics. Effective interventions are needed to increase surveillance mammography for at-risk populations. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02171078.

### Surveillance strategies after primary treatment for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: method of local recurrence detection after breast-conserving surgery [^116BATs5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study examining surveillance strategies and local recurrence detection methods in patients undergoing BCS for ILC. There are several notable findings from the analysis. First, although mammography is known to have poor sensitivity for patients with ILC, only a minority of patients had supplemental breast MRI as part of their surveillance strategy. The only factor associated with undergoing breast MRI was younger age at primary ILC diagnosis; while breast density was not available in this cohort, the association between younger age and higher breast density raises the possibility that density impacted surveillance imaging recommendations. Indeed, current guidelines from the American College of Radiology suggest adding breast MRI for surveillance in those with a prior history of breast cancer and dense breasts. Additionally, breast MRI may be utilized for patients who were previously diagnosed with mammographically occult breast cancer. ILC has a higher rate of mammographically occult cancers, as well as a higher rate of understaging on mammography compared with IDC. Because this study lacks an IDC cohort, we cannot compare rates of MRI surveillance by histologic subtype. However, we hypothesize that breast MRI may have been utilized more often in patients with mammographically occult ILC, or in cases with large discrepancies between clinical tumor size and pathologic tumor size.

Interestingly, among those having mammographic surveillance, most local recurrences presented as interval cancers (61.9%). This finding suggests that although ILC is thought to be less likely to form a palpable mass, physical examination (either self-examination or clinical breast examination) did result in the detection of most recurrences in this subset of cases. It is important to note that a lack of adherence to recommended screening guidelines may bias the results against the utility of mammography, as not all patients underwent mammograms yearly. This is reflected in the length of time between the last mammogram and diagnosis of recurrence in several of the interval cancer cases. However, in the group that had supplemental surveillance with MRI, the majority of recurrences were detected by MRI and none were detected by mammography. Together, these findings suggest that routine mammographic screening may have limited utility for surveillance in patients treated for ILC. This finding is somewhat consistent with data showing that in the setting of screening patients without prior breast cancer, mammography has lower sensitivity for detecting ILC. Because of the poor sensitivity for detection, those with ILC are diagnosed at later stages than those with IDC.

### Assessing the utility of post-mastectomy imaging after breast reconstruction [^1161XEXb]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Few guidelines exist regarding surveillance and diagnostic imaging after breast reconstruction. This study investigated the influence of breast reconstruction on the frequency of post-mastectomy imaging, the relative utility of imaging, and its effect on overall and locoregional recurrence-free survival.

Study Design

A retrospective review identified breast cancer patients (n = 1,216) who underwent mastectomy with or without reconstruction. Logistic regression identified surgical and oncologic predictors of post-reconstruction imaging. Kaplan-Meier method determined the impact of post-reconstruction imaging on overall and locoregional recurrence-free survival.

Results

Overall, 662 (54.4%) patients underwent mastectomy only and 554 (45.6%) underwent breast reconstruction. Patients undergoing reconstruction were more likely to receive imaging compared with patients undergoing mastectomy only (n = 205, 37.0% vs n = 168, 25.4%; p < 0.0001); however, this difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for age and follow-up time (p = 0.16). Most radiographic studies were Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 1 (n = 58, 30%) or 2 (n = 95, 49%) and were ordered by nonsurgical providers (n = 128, 63%). Post-reconstruction imaging did not influence overall or locoregional recurrence-free survival. The 5-year survival probabilities for breast reconstruction patients who underwent imaging for a palpable mass, surveillance, or who did not undergo imaging were 100%, 95% (95% CI 89% to 100%), and 96% (95% CI 94% to 99%), respectively. Post-reconstruction imaging was not a significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.46; p = 0.30).

Conclusions

The limited utility of routine post-reconstruction imaging should be reinforced when evaluating breast reconstruction patients. Multidisciplinary collaboration should be emphasized when attempting to distinguish benign postoperative findings from a malignant process to reduce unnecessary imaging and biopsy after breast reconstruction.

### Surveillance strategies after primary treatment for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: method of local recurrence detection after breast-conserving surgery [^11455VTR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Guidelines for screening surveillance after BCS are not histology specific and may not be optimized for the histological growth pattern and presentation of recurrences in ILC. Our study suggests that supplemental imaging for surveillance should be considered specifically for those after BCS for ILC, and questions the utility of routine mammography.

### Adherence to guidelines for breast surveillance in breast cancer survivors [^117MUYKM]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Background: Guidelines recommend annual mammography after curative-intent treatment for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to assess contemporary patterns of breast imaging after breast cancer treatment. Methods: Administrative claims data were used to identify privately insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with nonmetastatic breast cancer who had residual breast tissue (not bilateral mastectomy) after breast surgery between January 2005 and May 2015. We calculated the proportion of patients who had a mammogram, MRI, both, or neither during each of 5 subsequent 13-month periods. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess associations between patient characteristics, healthcare use, and breast imaging in the first and fifth years after surgery. Results: A total of 27,212 patients were followed for a median of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 1.8–4.6) after definitive breast cancer surgery. In year 1, 78% were screened using mammography alone, 1% using MRI alone, and 8% using both tests; 13% did not undergo either. By year 5, the proportion of the remaining cohort (n = 4,790) who had no breast imaging was 19%. Older age was associated with an increased likelihood of mammography and a decreased likelihood of MRI during the first and fifth years. Black race, mastectomy, chemotherapy, and no MRI at baseline were all associated with a decreased likelihood of both types of imaging. Conclusions: Even in an insured cohort, a substantial proportion of breast cancer survivors do not undergo annual surveillance breast imaging, particularly as time passes. Understanding factors associated with imaging in cancer survivors may help improve adherence to survivorship care guidelines.

Factors to consider when assessing CBC risk and the role of risk-reducing mastectomy include age at diagnosis, family history, overall prognosis from this or other cancers (eg, ovarian), ability to undergo appropriate breast surveillance (MRI), comorbidities, and life expectancy. For patients interested in risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy, physicians should discuss nipple-sparing mastectomy as a reasonable oncologic option. BRCA1/2 carriers who do not undergo bilateral mastectomy should have high-risk breast screening of remaining breast tissue with annual mammogram and MRI.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaStage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^115x3CWr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Women and health care professionals generally prefer intensive follow-up after a diagnosis of breast cancer. However, there are no survival differences between women who obtain intensive surveillance with imaging and laboratory studies compared with women who only undergo testing because of the development of symptoms or findings on clinical examinations. American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that annual mammography is the only imaging examination that should be performed to detect a localized breast recurrence in asymptomatic patients; more imaging may be needed if the patient has locoregional symptoms (eg, palpable abnormality). Women with other risk factors that increase their lifetime risk for breast cancer may warrant evaluation with breast MRI. Furthermore, the quality of life is similar for women who undergo intensive surveillance compared with those who do not. There is little justification for imaging to detect or rule out metastasis in asymptomatic women with newly diagnosed stage I breast cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Imaging modalities

Following breast-conservative surgery, bilateral mammography was advised by all 18/18 (100%) publishing bodies. If the patient received mastectomy surgery, 13/18 (72.2%) recommended only contralateral mammography follow-up. One exception was made by the RCR, for autologous reconstructions with a high risk for recurrence. Follow-up after mastectomy was not specified by 5/18 (27.8%) publishing bodies.

Routine ultrasound surveillance was not recommended by 8/18 (44.4%) publishing bodies. Furthermore, 4/18 (22.2%) publishing bodies did not recommend routine use, but recognised breast ultrasound as an appropriate screening tool for patients with additional risk factors, such as young age or dense breasts. The only 2/18 (11.1%) publishing bodies that recommended routine use of breast ultrasound, were ESMO and DKG-DGGG, the latter specifically including the axilla. Breast ultrasound surveillance was not discussed by 4/18 (22.2%) publishing bodies.

Routine breast MRI surveillance, with or without intravenous contrast, was not recommended by 10/18 (55.6%) publishing bodies. In the presence of inconclusive findings or additional individual risk factors, 6/18 (27.8%) publishing bodies recognised breast MRI surveillance as a supplemental imaging tool. The ACR recommended systematic use of annual contrast-enhanced MRI in two subgroups of female breast cancer survivors: women with dense breasts and women diagnosed before the age of 50. For these women, MRI should not replace mammography or DBT, but should be used as an adjunct examination. Breast MRI surveillance was not specified by 2/18 (11.1%) publishing bodies.

Only the ACR recognised DBT as a surveillance tool for breast cancer survivors. The ACR considered DBT, with accompanying planar or synthesised 2-D imaging, an equal modality to diagnostic digital mammography. A brief mention of DBT as supplemental imaging modality was provided by the GISMa-ICBR/SIRM guideline, however without further elaboration or recommendation. Use of DBT or other breast imaging modalities was not recommended by 14/18 (83.3%) publishing bodies and not discussed by 2/18 (11.1%) publishing bodies.

### Intensity of follow-up after breast cancer surgery: low versus high? [^114fNzko]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of breast cancer has been on the rise in the United States over the past several decades. The advanced longevity of the population during this same time period, specifically of elderly women, translates to increases in the absolute number of women diagnosed with breast cancer yearly. This, in combination with decreasing mortality rates, has now led to an increase in the number of breast cancer survivors who need long-term follow-up. There has been significant debate over what tests should be obtained, how often they should be obtained, how long surveillance should be continued, and by whom this should be performed. We review the published guidelines for surveillance, available data regarding low- versus high-intensity surveillance plans, current practice patterns, and recommendations for future strategies.

### A systematic review comparing surveillance recommendations for the detection of recurrence following surgery across 16 common cancer types [^114cqVph]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Several guidelines discuss the link between surveillance, earlier diagnosis of recurrence and survival outcomes (box 2). Four guidelines for colorectal cancer state that surveillance improves early detection, while guidelines for melanoma and gastric cancers state that this improvement is expected. Guidelines for breast and lung cancer refer to evidence that early detection and early treatment of recurrence are associated with improved survival. However, guidelines for seven cancers (brain, colorectal, gastric, melanoma, oesophagus, ovarian and prostate) said that there is not any evidence that earlier detection of recurrence improves survival, and guidelines for three cancer types (kidney, ovarian and pancreatic) similarly claim that the earlier treatment of advanced disease does not improve survival (box 3). One guideline for ovarian cancer went further, citing evidence that treating recurrences early is associated with a decrease in quality of life.

Box 3

### Yield of surveillance imaging after mastectomy with or without reconstruction for patients with prior breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163odGH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy, Data Extraction, and Quality Assessment

Two investigators (S.S. and A.V.) independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment using predefined criteria (eMethods in the Supplement). Consensus was reached between the investigators in case of discrepancies. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline checklist has been used for reporting this study.

Study Selection Process

The primary objective was structured using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) model: population: patients with previous breast cancer who underwent mastectomy with or without reconstruction (implant or autologous) and BRCA (BRCA1: OMIM; BRCA2: OMIM) variant carriers who have had mastectomy with or without reconstruction (implant or autologous); intervention: imaging diagnostic methods, including mammography, ultrasonography, tomosynthesis, or MRI as surveillance; comparison: patients who were not followed up with imaging surveillance; and outcome: rate of overall cancer, clinically occult cancer, and interval cancer.

We excluded studies with a nonrelevant population (a population other than patients with prior breast cancer after mastectomy or BRCA variant carriers after mastectomy), a nonrelevant intervention (surveillance methods other than mammography, ultrasonography, tomosynthesis, and MRI), a nonrelevant outcome (studies that did not present their results on detection rates for each surveillance imaging separately), or studies published in languages other than English.

Outcomes and Definitions

To make our results comparable, we calculated the cancer detection rates per 1000 examinations. The primary outcome was the pooled cancer detection rate, defined as ipsilateral breast cancer detected with any method and at any period during follow-up. The secondary outcome was the pooled interval cancer rate, defined as ipsilateral cancer detected after a normal imaging procedure but before any subsequent imaging.

An additional analysis of the primary outcome was performed by excluding lesions detected with imaging methods that were clearly described as palpable even without imaging. This outcome was defined as nonpalpable ipsilateral breast cancer detected only with imaging method.

Summary of recommendations issued by different professional organizations regarding clinical examination findings and imaging for cancer recurrence in women with implant-based or autologous reconstruction

Data derived from,

ASCO American Society of Clinical Oncology, NCCN National Comprehensive Cancer Network, LOE level of evidence, NA not available

For patients who elect to undergo breast reconstruction with autologous tissue, there remains inconsistency regarding surveillance of reconstructed breast.– Evidence suggests that surveillance mammography of reconstructed breasts has limited utility in detecting cancer recurrence. – The ACR released screening guidelines in 2020 for imaging after mastectomy and breast reconstruction suggesting that digital breast tomosynthesis or digital mammography for patients with tissue flaps may be appropriate, but MRI, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography are usually not appropriate. Ultrasound or other diagnostic imaging is only appropriate for patients experiencing palpable lumps or clinically significant pain on the side of the mastectomy, either with or without reconstruction.

At our institution, MLO single-view mammography is utilized for surveillance imaging in patients who have undergone autologous breast reconstruction. Single-view mammography is more cost effective, less time-consuming, and decreases radiation exposure as compared with traditional mammography. Recent studies have suggested that single-view digital mammography is comparable with two-view mammography in detecting malignancy, particularly in low-density breast tissue. There have been no studies directly comparing single-view mammography with other imaging for patients who have undergone autologous breast reconstruction, although studies suggest limited sensitivity due to surgical and radiation changes. – Postsurgical changes can include architectural distortion, macrocalcifications, masses, or other asymmetries, which can make it challenging to accurately identify local recurrences. At the National Cancer Centre in Singapore, patients undergo surveillance mammography 1 year after autologous breast reconstruction, with either a latissimus dorsi flap or fasciocutaneous flap with a chest wall perforator; imaging is recommended 1 year after surgery and annually thereafter for at least 5 years. Surveillance mammography after autologous reconstruction has been shown to be both accurate and effective, with characteristic imaging findings that differ from those in patients who underwent standard breast-conserving surgery. In patients with findings that were indeterminate or suspicious for malignancy, spot compression/magnification view mammography and ultrasound were used for further evaluation, with no use for MRI.

Management of patients with recurrent disease

Management of local recurrence after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancer

Local recurrence should be treated with surgery. Radiotherapy should not be considered except in specific cases (standard). The standard treatment is a simple total mastectomy (standard). Immediate reconstruction can be considered (option). If oestrogen receptors are present, additional hormone therapy is recommended (recommendation).

Breast-conserving surgery can only be considered if the patient refuses mastectomy or if mastectomy is technically impossible. In this case, the patient should be informed of the high risk of recurrent disease (recommendation). As the efficacy of additional chemotherapy is unknown, this should only be considered in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (recommendation, expert agreement).

Management of uncontrolled, isolated local recurrence (inflammatory or locally advanced tumour)

There is no standard (standard). Chemotherapy can be considered, followed if possible, by local treatment that may or may not be curative (options). Local treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy) for symptom control can also be considered (option).

Chemotherapy is appropriate for an inflammatory recurrence. Radiotherapy can be considered if there are contraindications for chemotherapy (option). When possible, mastectomy should be performed for a locally advanced recurrence (option). If this is not possible, chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be given with the aim of making the lesion operable (option). Irrespective of the treatments administered, the indications for additional medical treatment will be the same as those for potentially curable isolated recurrences (recommendation, expert agreement).

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^116CHvew]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast Reconstruction

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women worldwide, accounting for nearly 25% of cancers diagnosed in women. Although increased screening, improved public awareness, and advances in the surgical and medical management of breast cancer have improved survival in breast cancer patients, it is important to be vigilant for locoregional recurrence, which has been estimated to have a 5-year incidence of 3–8%. An increasing number of patients are electing to undergo breast reconstruction following mastectomy, either via implant-based reconstruction or autologous tissue-based reconstruction. Providers caring for these patients must become adept at identifying possible recurrences given postoperative changes. Current screening guidelines following mastectomy and breast reconstruction are controversial, with conflicting evidence supporting imaging or physical examination alone. –

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from varying professional organizations conflict in their recommendations for surveillance after breast reconstruction. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends clinical examinations every 3–6 months for the first 3 years after surgery, every 6–12 months in the fourth and fifth years, and then annually thereafter. The NCCN advises clinical examinations every 3–6 months for the first 5 years and then annually. Neither organization, nor the ASPS, suggests performing routine screening mammograms or other imaging of reconstructed breasts after mastectomies unless there is clinical concern for recurrence. Evidence suggests that physical examination is sufficient to detect local cancer recurrence. Any abnormal examination findings that are concerning for recurrence should be investigated with imaging (often focused breast ultrasound) in patients who have undergone post-mastectomy implant-based reconstruction or autologous reconstruction. However, the ACR, while in agreement with avoiding screening mammography in patients with implant-based reconstruction, released new guidelines in 2020 for imaging after mastectomy. They recommended digital breast tomosynthesis or mammography for patients who underwent autologous tissue flap reconstruction and found no evidence to support routine surveillance imaging in patients with a history of implant-based reconstruction. They state that ultrasound may be appropriate only in instances of palpable lumps or clinically significant pain. Table 3 summarizes the various recommendations from the different organizations for clinical examinations, surveillance imaging, and symptomatic imaging.

### Society of Surgical Oncology breast disease site working group statement on contralateral mastectomy: indications, outcomes, and risks [^1115P4xX]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Society of Surgical Oncology Breast Disease Site Working Group statement — contralateral mastectomy (CM) guidance emphasizes that rates are rising and clarifies benefits, imaging, and nodal management: Rates of contralateral mastectomy (CM) among patients with unilateral breast cancer have been increasing in the United States. For patients with a high risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), CM reduces the risk of new breast cancer. It is not known to convey an overall survival benefit. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with CM and reconstruction have yielded mixed results. Imaging with mammography within 12 months before CM is recommended, but routine preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging is not; there is also no evidence to support routine postmastectomy imaging surveillance. Because the likelihood of identifying an occult malignancy during CM is low, routine sentinel lymph node surgery is not recommended. Data on the rates of postoperative complications are conflicting, and such complications may not be directly related to CM. Adjuvant therapy delays due to complications have not been reported. Surgeons can reduce CM rates by encouraging shared decision making and informed discussions incorporating patient preferences.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^113Hrbsa]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations for breast surveillance following breast plastic surgery are frequently changing. Establishing guidelines for long-term monitoring protocols may help identify treatable conditions and prevent untoward sequelae. We sought to evaluate the current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for patients following breast augmentation, reduction, and breast reconstruction.

Methods

Official guidelines from various American societies and international societies were analyzed for alignment in evidence-based recommendations regarding breast surveillance.

Results

The most recent US FDA update recommends magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound starting 5–6 years after surgery and every 2–3 years thereafter. Discrepancies exist among professional societies: the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) aligns with the FDA, while the American Society of Breast Surgeons and American College of Radiology (ACR) find no role for imaging for asymptomatic cases. Ultrasound is first-line for any implant concerns, with MRI if necessary. European societies oppose routine breast implant imaging. Breast reduction patients lack unique screening protocols; monitoring aligns with age and cancer risk factors. Following mastectomy and breast reconstruction, most organizations advocate for annual clinical examinations, with more frequent examinations initially. Evidence suggests that physical examination is sufficient to detect local cancer recurrence, with imaging only indicated if there is concern for recurrence. No surveillance imaging is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or ASPS; however, ACR recommends mammography for autologous reconstruction only.

Conclusion

Multispecialty and regulatory body alignment may promote provider and patient adherence. Ongoing studies of long-term outcomes are needed to strengthen the level of evidence for monitoring guidelines.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® stage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^114CxG2b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

As the proportion of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer increases, the role of imaging for staging and surveillance purposes is considered. National and international guidelines discourage the use of staging imaging for asymptomatic patients newly diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast cancer, even if there is nodal involvement, as unnecessary imaging can delay care and affect outcomes. In asymptomatic patients with a history of stage I breast cancer that received treatment for curative intent, there is no role for imaging to screen for distant recurrences. However, routine surveillance with an annual mammogram is the only imaging test that should be performed to detect an in-breast recurrence or a new primary breast cancer in women with a history of stage I breast cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

Contralateral Prophylactic Mastectomy

For women who elect or require mastectomy for management of their index breast cancer, the option of removing the contralateral breast is often discussed. Multiple factors should be considered including family history, patient age, comorbidities, and tumor prognosis, as well as the initial plan for surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy. The surgical consultation should include a detailed discussion of local treatment options, the risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and distant cancer recurrence, the options for managing a CBC, and a clear recommendation for or against CPM. CPM is never an emergency and is never mandatory; even for patients at the highest risk of CBC, in the absence of disease, close surveillance is always a reasonable alternative to surgery.

### Clinical outcomes for BRCA pathogenic variant carriers with breast cancer undergoing breast conservation [^111L34Rp]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients with pathogenic BRCA1/2 (BRCA1, OMIM; BRCA2, OMIM) variants, bilateral mastectomy is often used to reduce the risk of future breast cancers. Among patients who develop breast cancer in the context of a pathogenic BRCA1/2 variant, bilateral mastectomy is very effective at reducing the risk of future contralateral breast cancers. In this setting, many patients elect to undergo bilateral mastectomy after diagnosis of breast cancer. But a smaller proportion of patients choose breast-conserving therapy (BCT), keeping their breasts and minimizing surgical morbiditywhile accepting a potentially higher future risk of ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer events. Their choice is supported by existing guidelines that recommend, with moderate strength, that "germline BRCA status should not preclude a patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer otherwise eligible for BCT from receiving BCT". This existing recommendation is based on evidence from observational studies, which have reported similar survival rates for BCT compared with mastectomy despite a higher risk of local cancer relapses (new primary cancers or recurrences) with BCT.,

More patients with breast cancer are undergoing germline BRCA1/2 variant testing. Indications for testing have been expanded in recent guidelines, which now support testing in all patients with a new diagnosis of or with a personal history of breast cancer and for whom a poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor may be of benefit in decision-making about adjuvant systemic therapy. Among other benefits, identification of a BRCA1/ 2 variant supports enhanced surveillance imagingand allows patients to make informed decisions about treatment options, including emerging targeted therapies using PARP inhibitors, which have been shown to reduce recurrence among patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline variant–associated early breast cancer. It is estimated that 5% to 10% of patients with breast cancer have a hereditary susceptibility and that pathogenic germline variants in BRCA1/ 2 account for one-third of these patients. Expanded testing will uncover many new cases.

Because a subset of patients with breast cancer and a pathogenic variant in BRCA1/2 will choose BCT, continuing to study and report their long-term outcomes is important for ensuring that adequate evidence is available to inform patients. To that end, the objective of this study was to report the long-term clinical outcomes in a large, single-institution cohort of patients with pathogenic BRCA1/ 2 variants who chose BCT after initial diagnosis of breast cancer, with stratification of outcomes by BRCA variant type to help inform patients with a variant in either gene.

### Mammography surveillance and mortality in older breast cancer survivors [^114qowrm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

There are more than 2,000,000 breast cancer survivors in the United States today. While surveillance for asymptomatic recurrence and second primary is included in consensus recommendations, the effectiveness of this surveillance has not been well characterized. Our purpose is to estimate the effectiveness of surveillance mammography in a cohort of breast cancer survivors with complete ascertainment of surveillance mammograms and negligible losses to follow-up.

Patients and Methods

We enrolled 1,846 stage I and II breast cancer patients who were at least 65 years old at six integrated health care delivery systems. We used medical record review and existing databases to ascertain patient, tumor, and therapy characteristics, as well as receipt of surveillance mammograms. We linked personal identifiers to the National Death Index to ascertain date and cause of death. We matched four controls to each breast cancer decedent to estimate the association between receipt of surveillance mammogram and breast cancer mortality.

Results

One hundred seventy-eight women died of breast cancer during 5 years of follow-up. Each additional surveillance mammogram was associated with a 0.69-fold decrease in the odds of breast cancer mortality (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.92). The protective association was strongest among women with stage I disease, those who received mastectomy, and those in the oldest age group.

Conclusion

Given existing recommendations for post-therapy surveillance, trials to compare surveillance with no surveillance are unlikely. This large observational study provides support for the recommendations, suggesting that receipt of surveillance mammograms reduces the rate of breast cancer mortality in older patients diagnosed with early-stage disease.

### Recommended breast cancer surveillance guidelines. American Society of Clinical Oncology… [^112utZbM]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Objective To determine an effective, evidence-based postoperative surveillance strategy for the detection and treatment of recurrent breast cancer. Tests are recommended only if they have an impact on the outcomes specified by the American Society of Clinical Oncology for clinical practice guidelines. POTENTIAL INTERVENTION: All tests described in the literature for postoperative monitoring were considered. In addition, the data were critically evaluated to determine the optimal frequency of monitoring. Outcome Outcomes of interest include overall and disease-free survival, quality of life, toxicity reduction, and secondarily cost-effectiveness. Evidence A search was performed to determine all relevant articles published over the past 20 years on the efficacy of surveillance testing for breast cancer recurrence. These publications comprised both retrospective and prospective studies.

Values Levels of evidence and guideline grades were rated by a standard process. More weight was given to studies that tested a hypothesis that directly related testing to one of the primary outcomes in a randomized design. BENEFITS/HARMS/COSTS: The possible consequences of false-positive and negative tests were considered in evaluating a preference for one of two tests that provided similar information. Cost alone was not a determining factor. Recommendations The attached guidelines summarize the recommendations of the ASCO breast cancer expert panel. Data are sufficient to recommend monthly breast self-examination, annual mammography of the preserved and contralateral breast, and a careful history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, then every 6 to 12 months for 2 years, then annually.

Data are not sufficient to recommend routine bone scans, chest radiographs, hematologic blood counts, tumor markers, liver ultrasonograms, or computed axial tomographic scans. Validation The recommendations of the breast cancer expert panel were evaluated by the ASCO Health Services Research Committee reviewers and by the ASCO Board of Directors.

ASCO male breast cancer guideline — post-treatment follow-up recommends that physicians should counsel patients about the symptoms of recurrence, including new lumps, bone pain, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, or persistent headaches, and notes that the risk of breast cancer recurrence continues through 15 years after primary treatment and beyond; continuity of care for patients with breast cancer is recommended and should be performed by a physician experienced in the surveillance of patients with cancer and in breast examination, including the examination of irradiated breasts (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Recommendation 7 is adapted from the guideline for women, and there is no evidence from clinical trials in men with breast cancer to inform clinical questions regarding the optimal post-treatment surveillance and management after primary treatment; follow-up care for men who are treated for breast cancer should generally be similar to care provided for women with breast cancer. However, men who are receiving a GnRH analog and an AI are at increased risk of bone loss; thus, monitoring bone mineral density in this group is warranted.

### Screening and follow-up of the patient at high risk for breast cancer [^113RHUUD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Accurately defining a patient's risk of developing breast cancer is a challenging endeavor. Many factors have been implicated in the causation of breast cancer and quantifying them is difficult. Risk stratification is performed using population models, such as the Gail model, as well as the patient's personal and family history and genetic testing. The clinician who is facile with these components will not only be able to identify those patients at highest risk for whom heightened surveillance is recommended, but also to allay the fears of the average-risk patient and provide them reassurance. Patients who are at very high risk of developing breast cancer are BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carriers, those with a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ with associated family history, those who have undergone therapeutic or similarly significant radiation exposure, and those with a history of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in the family of an untested individual. Patients with an elevated risk, but not in the very high risk category, are those with a family history of breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, significantly dense breast tissue, hormone replacement therapy longer than 10 years, and a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ without family history of breast cancer. Risk-reducing strategies include chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene and surgical prophylaxis with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. A high-risk surveillance regimen includes annual mammography, annual magnetic resonance imaging in selected individuals, and semiannual clinical breast exams.

### Follow-up strategies for women treated for early breast cancer [^115W92xA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Follow-up examinations are commonly performed after primary treatment for women with breast cancer. They are used to detect recurrences at an early (asymptomatic) stage. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up for distant metastases on mortality, morbidity and quality of life in women treated for stage I, II or III breast cancer.

Search Methods

For this 2014 review update, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (4 July 2014), MEDLINE (4 July 2014), Embase (4 July 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (4 July 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov (4 July 2014). References from retrieved articles were also checked.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up after primary treatment were reviewed for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility for inclusion in the review and risk of bias. Data were pooled in an individual patient data meta-analysis for the two RCTs testing the effectiveness of different follow-up schemes. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, tumour size and lymph node status.

Main Results

Since 2000, one new trial has been published; the updated review now includes five RCTs involving 4023 women with breast cancer (clinical stage I, II or III). Two trials involving 2563 women compared follow-up based on clinical visits and mammography with a more intensive scheme including radiological and laboratory tests. After pooling the data, no significant differences in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15, two studies, 2563 participants, high-quality evidence), or disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00, two studies, 2563 participants, low-quality evidence) emerged. No differences in overall survival and disease-free survival emerged in subgroup analyses according to patient age, tumour size and lymph node status before primary treatment. In 1999, 10-year follow-up data became available for one trial of these trials, and no significant differences in overall survival were found. No difference was noted in quality of life measures (one study, 639 participants, high-quality evidence). The new included trial, together with a previously included trial involving 1264 women compared follow-up performed by a hospital-based specialist versus follow-up performed by general practitioners. No significant differences were noted in overall survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.78, one study, 968 participants, moderate-quality evidence), time to detection of recurrence (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.47, two studies, 1264 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and quality of life (one study, 356 participants, high-quality evidence). Patient satisfaction was greater among patients treated by general practitioners. One RCT involving 196 women compared regularly scheduled follow-up visits versus less frequent visits restricted to the time of mammography. No significant differences emerged in interim use of telephone and frequency of general practitioners's consultations.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review of RCTs conducted almost 20 years ago suggests that follow-up programs based on regular physical examinations and yearly mammography alone are as effective as more intensive approaches based on regular performance of laboratory and instrumental tests in terms of timeliness of recurrence detection, overall survival and quality of life. In two RCTs, follow-up care performed by trained and not trained general practitioners working in an organised practice setting had comparable effectiveness to that delivered by hospital-based specialists in terms of overall survival, recurrence detection, and quality of life.

### Surveillance strategies after primary treatment for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast: method of local recurrence detection after breast-conserving surgery [^115RQbYM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common subtype of breast cancer. Although mammography is known to have low sensitivity for ILC, there are no data to guide the optimal surveillance after treatment. We explored surveillance strategies after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for ILC and determined the proportion of imaging-detected recurrences versus interval cancers.

Methods

From an institutional database of 813 women, we retrospectively identified patients who underwent BCS for stage I-III ILC and subsequently had a recurrence. We categorized patients by surveillance strategy and determined the modality of recurrence detection. Interval cancer rates for local recurrences were compared across surveillance strategies using the Chi-square test. We evaluated overall survival with the log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

We included 58 patients with ILC who had a recurrence after BCS. Of these, 22 (37.9%) had local recurrence, 27 (46.6%) had distant recurrence, and 9 (15.5%) had both local and distant recurrence. Most patients underwent routine mammographic surveillance (65.2%), with 19.6% having supplemental breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 15.2% having no surveillance. The interval cancer rate was significantly higher in the mammographic surveillance group compared with the MRI surveillance group (61.9% vs. 16.7%; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

In this study of patients with recurrence after BCS for primary treatment of stage I-III ILC, we found that most local recurrences were not detected by surveillance mammography. These data support further investigation of supplemental imaging beyond mammography specifically for patients with ILC who undergo BCS.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^112Vyraw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Contralateral risk reduction counseling — The Panel recommends that patients with breast cancer who are ≤ 35 years or premenopausal and carriers of a known BRCA1/2 mutation consider additional risk reduction strategies following appropriate risk assessment and counseling, with multidisciplinary consultations prior to surgery and discussion of contralateral breast cancer risk versus recurrent disease risk. Except as specifically outlined in the NCCN Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment guidelines, risk reduction mastectomy of the contralateral breast to a known unilateral breast cancer treated with mastectomy or BCT is discouraged by the Panel, and the NCCN Panel recommends referring to the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology for special considerations for this population.

### American cancer society / American Society of Clinical Oncology breast cancer survivorship care guideline [^116h1Txb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of the American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline is to provide recommendations to assist primary care and other clinicians in the care of female adult survivors of breast cancer. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A total of 1,073 articles met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical examination, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for post-treatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment, health promotion, and care coordination/practice implications are made. This guideline was developed through a collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Journal of Clinical Oncology.

### Adherence to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines for surveillance in breast cancer survivors: real-world data from a pooled multicenter analysis [^113Yoau1]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Another reason for the observed underutilization of imaging might be that some of the patients switched to the national screening program. In the Netherlands, women aged between 50 and 74 years old are invited biannually for a screening mammography. A previous study revealed that only 4% of the patients went to both the follow-up and the screening program within 5 years of their treatment. Besides, we do not know whether patients developed a recurrence during the follow-up time. Taking into account the average risk of LRR of 2.6% in the Netherlands within 5 years, approximately 250 patients in the study group ought to have developed an LRR and consequently dropped out of the follow-up program. The lower chance of receiving an annual imaging procedure in UICC stage III might be influenced by the higher risk of developing metachronous distant metastases in comparison to lower stages. Data from our study seems to reveal that patients with a mastectomy also received less follow-up imaging than patients with a breast conserving therapy. Although this association was not significant, at first glance this is a plausible observation, since a mammography without remaining breast tissue is not possible. However, even patients with a mastectomy are still at risk of developing a second primary tumor in the contralateral breast, which could be detected by a mammography. Moreover, they can also suffer from an ipsilateral recurrence in the chest wall, which could be detected by sonography. Therefore, more in-depth research on this topic is warranted.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^1124zywa]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of locoregional recurrence is usually achieved with surgical excision of the area of recurrence and reassessment of the axilla with either repeat sentinel node biopsy or complete axillary dissection. In most cases of recurrence following flap reconstruction, the autologous tissue flap is able to be preserved. Wide local excision with negative margins is an oncologically safe approach in this instance and enables tissue preservation. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment planning is paramount when recurrent cancer is detected. Surgery is often followed by local chest wall irradiation, and chemotherapy or hormone therapy may be indicated.

### Society of Surgical Oncology breast disease site working group statement on contralateral mastectomy: indications, outcomes, and risks [^111poq9M]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

After contralateral mastectomy (CM) — postmastectomy imaging and surveillance: One systematic review of national guidelines found no recommendations for routine imaging surveillance of the CM side. About 10–15% of mastectomy patients undergo postoperative diagnostic imaging, which reveals about 1% of these patients to have malignancies, the vast majority of which are on the therapeutic mastectomy side. Imaging with mammography or breast MRI after autologous reconstructive surgery is of little benefit, and post-reconstruction imaging is not associated with reduced locoregional recurrence or improved OS. There is no evidence supporting routine imaging surveillance after CM, even in patients who underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy. Imaging should be considered for patients with new palpable abnormalities and may be considered on a case-by-case basis for patients with significant residual breast tissue after CM.

### Society of Surgical Oncology breast disease site working group statement on contralateral mastectomy: indications, outcomes, and risks [^116pQphA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rates of contralateral mastectomy (CM) among patients with unilateral breast cancer have been increasing in the United States. In this Society of Surgical Oncology position statement, we review the literature addressing the indications, risks, and benefits of CM since the society's 2017 statement. We held a virtual meeting to outline key topics and then conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant articles. We reviewed the articles and made recommendations based on group consensus. Patients consider CM for many reasons, including concerns regarding the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), desire for improved cosmesis and symmetry, and preferences to avoid ongoing screening, whereas surgeons primarily consider CBC risk when making a recommendation for CM. For patients with a high risk of CBC, CM reduces the risk of new breast cancer, however it is not known to convey an overall survival benefit. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with CM and reconstruction have yielded mixed results. Imaging with mammography within 12 months before CM is recommended, but routine preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging is not; there is also no evidence to support routine postmastectomy imaging surveillance. Because the likelihood of identifying an occult malignancy during CM is low, routine sentinel lymph node surgery is not recommended. Data on the rates of postoperative complications are conflicting, and such complications may not be directly related to CM. Adjuvant therapy delays due to complications have not been reported. Surgeons can reduce CM rates by encouraging shared decision making and informed discussions incorporating patient preferences.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology 2006 update of the breast cancer follow-up and management guidelines in the adjuvant setting [^114T9ufp]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 1999 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline on breast cancer follow-up and management in the adjuvant setting.

Methods

An ASCO Expert Panel reviewed pertinent information from the literature through March 2006. More weight was given to studies that tested a hypothesis directly relating testing to one of the primary outcomes in a randomized design.

Results

The evidence supports regular history, physical examination, and mammography as the cornerstone of appropriate breast cancer follow-up. All patients should have a careful history and physical examination performed by a physician experienced in the surveillance of cancer patients and in breast examination. Examinations should be performed every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years, every 6 to 12 months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter. For those who have undergone breast-conserving surgery, a post-treatment mammogram should be obtained 1 year after the initial mammogram and at least 6 months after completion of radiation therapy. Thereafter, unless otherwise indicated, a yearly mammographic evaluation should be performed. Patients at high risk for familial breast cancer syndromes should be referred for genetic counseling. The use of CBCs, chemistry panels, bone scans, chest radiographs, liver ultrasounds, computed tomography scans, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 15–3, and CA 27.29) is not recommended for routine breast cancer follow-up in an otherwise asymptomatic patient with no specific findings on clinical examination.

Conclusion

Careful history taking, physical examination, and regular mammography are recommended for appropriate detection of breast cancer recurrence.

Management of impalpable tumours

The therapeutic strategy for ductal carcinomas in situ is not covered in this document. The therapeutic management of impalpable tumours is often a stepwise process guided by the histological results of the previous intervention. The patient should be informed right from the start about the risks associated with repeated interventions.
First decisional step (Figure 3): This first step is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic and consists of a radiologically proven complete excision and histological analysis of the lesion (standard). In the absence of a palpable macroscopic lesion, a frozen section and primary axillary dissection should not be performed (recommendation, expert agreement). If microcalcifications are present, a mammogram should be performed 2 months after surgery (recommendation, expert agreement).
Second decisional step: This step depends on the status of the surgical margins and the extent of the microcalcification before and/or after surgery. ○ Microinvasive cancer (infiltrating component ≤ 2 mm): There is no specific data concerning the risk of progression of microinvasive cancers. The recommendations are the same as those proposed for invasive cancers (Figure 4). – Extensive microcalcifications at diagnosis (breast-conserving surgery inappropriate): Modified radical mastectomy followed by immediate breast reconstruction should be offered (standard). – Clear margins and no residual microcalcifications: The breast should be irradiated (standard). Modified radical mastectomy can be considered if the patient refuses conservative treatment (option). Axillary dissection or axillary radiotherapy may also be performed (option). In the absence of known risk factors for metastatic recurrence, adjuvant systemic treatment should not be given (recommendation, level of evidence: B). – Involved margins and/or residual microcalcifications: Mastectomy is the standard treatment (standard). Re-excision and breast radiotherapy, or axillary dissection and radiotherapy can be performed (option). If re-excision does not provide clear margins, mastectomy should be performed (standard). ○ Invasive cancer (Figure 5): – Extensive micro-calcifications at diagnosis: Modified radical mastectomy is indicated (standard). In the event of lymph node invasion, radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) should be performed (standard). – Clear margins and/or absence of residual microcalcifications: The standard procedure is axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy (standard). If the patient presents with lymph node involvement, this should be followed by lymph node irradiation (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) (standard). It is also possible to irradiate the lymph nodes without axillary surgery (option). – Invaded margins and/or presence of residual microcalcifications: Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). In the event of lymph node involvement, this should be followed by the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) irradiation (standard). Re-excision combined with axillary dissection, followed by breast radiotherapy can be undertaken. Breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can also be considered (option).

### Annual versus less frequent mammographic surveillance in people with breast cancer aged 50 years and older in the UK (mammo-50): a multicentre, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^117HjTJL]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The frequency of mammographic surveillance for women after diagnosis of breast cancer varies globally. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether less than annual mammography was non-inferior in terms of breast cancer-specific survival in women aged 50 years or older.

Methods

Mammo-50 was a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial of annual versus less frequent mammography (2-yearly after conservation surgery; 3-yearly after a mastectomy) for women aged 50 years or older at initial diagnosis of invasive or non-invasive breast cancer and who were recurrence free 3 years post curative surgery. The trial was conducted at 114 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to annual or less frequent mammograms at 3 years post curative surgery and were followed up for 6 years. The co-primary outcomes were breast cancer-specific survival and cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be reported elsewhere. Breast cancer-specific survival was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free interval, overall survival, and referrals back to the hospital system. 5000 women provided 90% power to detect a 3% absolute non-inferiority margin for breast cancer-specific survival with 2.5% one-sided significance. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN48534559; recruitment is complete but longer-term follow-up is ongoing.

Findings

Between April 22, 2014, and Sept 28, 2018, 5235 women were randomly assigned to annual mammography (n = 2618) or less frequent mammography (n = 2617). 3858 (73.6%) women were aged 60 years or older, 4202 (80.3%) had undergone conservation surgery, 4576 (87.4%) had invasive disease, 1159 (22.1%) had node positive disease, and 4330 (82.7%) had oestrogen receptor-positive tumours. With a median of 5.7 years follow-up (IQR 5.0–6.0; 8.7 years post curative surgery), 343 women died, including 116 who died of breast cancer (61 in the annual mammography group and 55 in the less frequent mammography group). 5-year breast cancer-specific survival was 98.1% (95% CI 97.5–98.6) in the annual mammography group and 98.3% (97.8–98.8) in the less frequent mammography group (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.64–1.32), demonstrating non-inferiority of less frequent mammography at the pre-specified 3% margin (non-inferiority p < 0.0001). 5-year recurrence-free interval was 94.1% (95% CI 93.1–94.9) in the annual mammography group and 94.5% (93.5–95.3) in the less frequent mammography group. Overall survival at 5 years was 94.7% (95% CI 93.8–95.5%) and 94.5% (93.5–95.3), respectively. 224 (64.9%) of 345 breast cancer events were detected from emergency admissions or symptomatic referrals back to the hospital system, including 108 (61.7%) of 175 in the annual mammography group and 116 (68.2%) of 170 in the less frequent mammography group.

Interpretation

For patients aged 50 years or older and at 3 years post diagnosis, less frequent mammograms were non-inferior compared with annual mammograms for breast cancer-specific survival, recurrence-free interval, and overall survival, and should be considered for this population.

### Adherence to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines for surveillance in breast cancer survivors: real-world data from a pooled multicenter analysis [^1131K126]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy among women in the Netherlands and worldwide. During the last decades, the overall survival rates after diagnosis have been increasing considerably due to early detection and improved treatment strategies. In the Netherlands, 85% of the women diagnosed with breast cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis and 76% survive at least 10 years on average. After finalizing primary treatment, breast cancer patients receive follow-up care which focusses on the detection of locoregional recurrences (LRR) and second primary contralateral breast cancer to improve survival. According to the current Dutch breast cancer guidelines, every woman who has undergone curative treatment for breast cancer is eligible for follow-up, which consists of annual follow-up visits and imaging procedures like mammographies or MRIs for patients without a genetic predisposition. The Dutch breast cancer guidelines were introduced in 2002 and updated to Version 2.0 in 2012. In the course of this update, some changes concerning follow-up recommendations were made. During the last revision in 2020, follow-up recommendations remained unchanged.

Only a limited number of studies examined the actual usage of mammographies and other diagnostic procedures in breast cancer survivors. An earlier but considerably smaller study on guidelines adherence in the Netherlands revealed that the number of consultations exceeded the recommended number in a case where radiation therapy as part of the primary treatment. On the other hand, it has been shown that less follow-up mammographies than recommended were performed. Studies from other countries likewise found the actual surveillance care patterns to differ from guidelines and showed a general underutilization of mammographies in breast cancer follow-up. Moreover, some studies observed a steady decline in the number of performed mammographies as the time after diagnosis increased. Different patient and primary treatment characteristics like age or adjuvant radiation therapy seem to influence the utilization of subsequent mammographies. Apart from that, there are also women who do not receive any follow-up at all.

### Mode of detection of second breast cancers in patients undergoing surveillance after treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ [^1131cdEf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients undergoing posttreatment surveillance after ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer recommend annual breast imaging and physical examination every 6 to 12 months for 5 years, and then annually. The aim of our study was to evaluate the modes of detection (imaging, patient reported, or physical examination) of second cancers in a cohort of patients undergoing surveillance after primary DCIS treatment to better inform surveillance recommendations.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with DCIS treated between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011, within a large integrated health care system. Information on patient demographics, index DCIS treatment, tumor characteristics, and mode of detection of second breast cancer was obtained from the electronic health record or chart review.

Results

Our study cohort consisted of 1,550 women, with a median age of 59 years at diagnosis. Surgical treatment of DCIS included lumpectomy (75.0%; n = 1,162), unilateral mastectomy (21.1%; n = 327), or bilateral mastectomy (3.9%; n = 61), with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy. Additionally, 44.4% (n = 688) and 28.3% (n = 438) received radiation and endocrine therapies, respectively. Median follow-up was 10 years, during which 179 (11.5%) women were diagnosed with a second breast cancer. Of the second cancers, 43.0% (n = 77) were ipsilateral and 54.8% (n = 98) contralateral, and 2.2% (n = 4) presented with distant metastases; 61.5% (n = 110) were invasive, 36.3% (n = 65) were DCIS, and 2.2% (n = 4) were Paget's disease. Second breast cancers were imaging-detected in 74.3% (n = 133) of cases, patient-detected in 20.1% (n = 36), physician-detected in 2.2% (n = 4), and detected incidentally on imaging or pathology from procedures unrelated to oncologic care in 3.4% (n = 6).

Conclusions

In our cohort of patients undergoing surveillance following diagnosis and treatment of DCIS, 2% of second breast cancers were detected by a clinical breast examination. This suggests that survivorship care should prioritize mammography and patient education regarding breast self-examination and symptoms that warrant evaluation to detect second breast cancers.

### MR-contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) for follow-up of breast cancer patients: a "pros and cons" debate [^1158eQ8B]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC) are at an increased risk of either a local recurrence or a new primary breast cancer. Thus, surveillance is essential for the detection of recurrent disease at the earliest possible stage, allowing for prompt treatment, and potentially improving overall survival. Nowadays, mammography follow-up is the only surveillance imaging technique recommended by international guidelines. Nevertheless, sensitivity of mammography is lower after breast cancer treatment, particularly during the first 5 years, due to increased density or post-treatment changes. Contrast-enhanced breast imaging techniques, such as MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), are very sensitive to detect malignant enhancement, especially in dense breasts. This Special Report will provide arguments in favor of and against breast cancer follow-up with MRI or CEM, in a debate style between experts in Breast Imaging. Finally, the scientific points of pros and cons arguments will be summarized to help objectively decide the best follow-up strategy for women with a personal history of breast cancer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: A personalized approach to follow-up imaging after conservative breast cancer treatment could optimize patient outcomes, using mammography as a baseline for most patients, and MRI or CEM selectively in patients with higher risks for a recurrence. KEY POINTS:
- Women with a personal history of breast cancer are at an increased risk of either a local recurrence or a new primary breast cancer.
- Breast cancer survivors may benefit from additional imaging with MRI/CEM, in case of increased risk of a second breast cancer, with dense breasts or a cancer diagnosis before age 50 years.
- As survival after local recurrence seems to depend on the initial stage at diagnosis, imaging should be more focused on detecting tumors in the earliest stages.

### Surveillance mammography following the treatment of primary breast cancer with breast reconstruction: a systematic review [^114fMNfz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Both the prevalence of breast cancer and the number of breast cancer patients seeking breast reconstruction are increasing, highlighting the importance for evidence to direct the clinician in the follow-up of these patients. Current practice guidelines recommend surveillance mammography of the contralateral breast in all breast cancer patients, and of the ipsilateral breast in women treated with breast-conserving surgery. However, there are no guidelines specifically addressing the role of surveillance mammography for women who have undergone mastectomy and breast reconstruction.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to identify studies specifically addressing the issue of surveillance mammography among women with breast reconstruction following treatment for primary breast cancer.

Results

This systematic review identified eight articles, consisting of case reports and case series, that address the issue of surveillance mammography of the ipsilateral breast in women with breast reconstruction. The articles demonstrated that certain local recurrences are able to be detected by surveillance mammography.

Conclusion

This study has demonstrated the paucity of evidence and highlighted the need for further research to evaluate this issue.

Termination of imaging surveillance

As the RCR guideline stated, no evidence-based recommendation on the timing of surveillance termination can currently be made. The limited number of recommendations identified, therefore vary widely (Table 2).

Mammography after breast-conserving therapy (BCT)

All included practice guidelines recommended bilateral mammography surveillance after BCT. Nonetheless, supporting evidence is limited to observational and retrospective findings. Sensitivity ranges between 63.5 and 67%, which is significantly lower than for matched screenings without a personal history of breast cancer, ranging between 73.5 and 76.5%. There is no significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral sensitivity, while specificity ranges 98.2–98.4%. A survival benefit from surveillance mammography in asymptomatic breast cancer survivors has been suggested by multiple observational studies. However, estimated hazard ratio for asymptomatic relative to symptomatic/clinical detection varies widely, ranging between 0.10 and 0.86. In a single-centre retrospective analysis of 1,044 patients, detection of asymptomatic recurrence improved relative survival between 27 and 47%.

Mammography after mastectomy

None of the included guidelines recommended routine ipsilateral imaging follow-up after mastectomy surgery, with or without reconstruction. This included both implant as well as autologous reconstructive procedures. The RCR was the only body to make an additional recommendation for ipsilateral surveillance in case of an autologous reconstruction with a high risk for recurrence (Table 3). Following a non-reconstructive mastectomy, recurrence should theoretically be limited to the (sub)cutaneous tissue, allowing simple detection from rigorous clinical examination. For implant-based reconstructions, silicone pockets are generally placed behind the pectoralis major muscle, displacing the entire mastectomy site anteriorly. Recurrence should therefore present as superficial and be easily appreciable on clinical examination. In case of an autologous reconstruction, the reconstructed breast comes on top of the major pectoral muscle and is covered by transplanted skin. The true resection margin therefore remains deep to the reconstructed breast. Nonetheless, Lee et al. concluded from a retrospective cohort of 554 mammograms in 265 women who underwent TRAM flap reconstruction that routine mammographic surveillance of all autologous reconstructed breasts was not likely to be beneficial.

Patients and Methods

Patient Inclusion

A retrospective review of a prospectively held database from a symptomatic breast cancer service in a tertiary referral academic teaching hospital was performed. All patients who were diagnosed between the years 2010 and 2020 with a local breast cancer recurrence or a second primary breast cancer were included. All patients were over the age of 18 and recurrence was defined as histologically proven disease in the same breast, ipsilateral chest wall, local skin region, or in regional lymph nodes. Early recurrence was defined as recurrence within 12 months of original diagnosis with late recurrences being defined as those occurring beyond 12 months of initial diagnosis. A second primary was defined as being distant to the original site in the ipsilateral breast or in the contralateral breast and confirmed histologically. This was considered to be equivalent to a locoregional recurrence as it was often not possible to distinguish between the two diagnoses and the presentation was similar. Patients were excluded where their data was incomplete or where they had evidence of distant metastatic disease. The study was approved by the local hospital audit committee and was performed in accordance with STROBE guidelines.

Surveillance Process after a Cancer Diagnosis

Following a diagnosis of a primary breast cancer, the following follow-up protocol is employed in our institution as per national guidelines:
Annual mammogram for a minimum of 5 years (or until age 70, whichever is later – NCCP guidelines). Patients who required breast conserving surgery underwent standard mammography, whilst those requiring mastectomy underwent contralateral mammography.
Years 0–2 post diagnosis, 6-monthly appointments for clinical review (history and examination)
Years 3–5 post diagnosis, annual appointments for clinical review (history and examination)

Chest wall imaging on the affected side in those who had undergone mastectomy was only performed when a clinical symptom/sign was detected by the patient or clinician.

Data Collected

Patients within the database were added after multidisciplinary team discussion and coding. Patient notes, in-hospital digital records and the hospital's histopathological database were accessed to collect clinicopathological data (including tumour subtype/grade/receptor subtype and size). The national integrated medical imaging system NIMIS was also used to ensure all radiological data was complete. Date of diagnosis, time since original cancer diagnosis and treatment types, including surgical intervention and adjuvant therapies, were also recorded for each patient. Radiological abnormalities were classified using the BI–RADS classification and the reason for imaging (planned surveillance versus investigation of new symptom/sign) was also recorded.

### Breast imaging surveillance after curative treatment for primary non-metastasised breast cancer in non-high-risk women: a systematic review [^117GZRhd]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The article summarises the available guidelines on breast imaging surveillance after curative treatment for locoregional breast cancer.

Methods

A systematic review of practice guidelines published from 1 January 2007 to 1 January 2017 was performed according to PRISMA methodology. The search was conducted for the EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases. On 8 July 2018, all included guidelines were updated to the most recent version.

Results

Twenty-one guidelines originating from 18 publishing bodies matched criteria. Publishing bodies consisted of seven governmental institutions, nine medical societies and two mixed collaborations. Publishing boards consisted of six radiological, four oncological, and 11 multidisciplinary teams. Annual bilateral mammography surveillance after breast-conserving therapy was recommended by 17/18 (94.4%) publishing bodies. Annual contralateral mammography surveillance after mastectomy was recommended by 13/18 (72.2%) publishing bodies. Routine use of digital breast tomosynthesis was recommended by 1/18 (5.6%) publishing bodies. Routine breast ultrasound surveillance was recommended by 2/18 (11.1%), deemed optional by 4/18 (22.2%) and not supported by 8/18 (44.4%) publishing bodies. Routine breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance was not recommended by 16/18 (88.9%) publishing bodies, although 6/18 (33.3%) specified subgroups for systematic MRI surveillance.

Conclusions

Annual mammography is currently the 'gold standard' for breast imaging surveillance. The role of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) remains to be further investigated. Most guidelines do not recommend routine breast ultrasound or MRI surveillance, unless indicated by additional risk factors.

### Assessing mode of recurrence in breast cancer to identify an optimised follow-up pathway: 10-year institutional review [^116azd1D]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although routine annual clinical surveillance is recommended in Europeand the USA, there remains little evidence to support its function with regard to the detection of local recurrence or distant metastatic disease. While overall survival and recurrence rates in breast cancer have improved over the last decade, largely due to improving adjuvant therapies and a stronger focus on obtaining negative margins intra-operatively, there remains debate as to the duration of surveillance for patients with breast cancer. Previous studies have suggested that patients who have undergone breast-conserving surgery (BCS) experience local recurrences most frequently 4 years after surgery, compared with patients who have undergone mastectomy, in which recurrences are seen most commonly at 2 years. Equally, for patients with ER+ disease, the risk of local recurrence can persist beyond 10 years after surgery. Few patients will experience a true recurrence within the first 12 months after surgery. Our study adds to those findings, demonstrating that such recurrences were most common more than 5 years after surgical treatment in those undergoing BCS. For patients who had undergone mastectomy, recurrences were seen within 2–3 years. The use of mammography as the primary surveillance tool as opposed to annual clinical exam is particularly pertinent to BCS patients, as 75% of recurrences are within the ipsilateral remnant breast (which mammogram assesses) with only 5–15% presenting with distant metastatic disease. In addition, the current study demonstrates that the median time at which recurrence occurs in those who have undergone BCS is beyond 5 years, outside the window of scheduled clinical surveillance. In contrast, 30% of patients who have undergone mastectomy and subsequently develop a recurrence will present with distant metastatic disease. Whilst the benefits of radiological surveillance in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery are clear, there remains debate over the optimal manner in which mastectomy patients should be monitored. A recent meta-analysis by Smith et al. has indicated that there is no benefit to radiological surveillance in mastectomy patients, but that the evidence is limited in this regard. The diagnosis of recurrent distant metastatic disease is associated with a poor prognosis, and it appears that surveillance either by imaging or annual clinical review has little effect on overall survival.

### Application of screening principles to the reconstructed breast [^115AWrpv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

A significant number of women choose mastectomy for the treatment of early and locally advanced breast cancer. Advances in reconstruction techniques and greater awareness of options have led to an increased use of immediate breast reconstruction, which has resulted in uncertainty for the management of surveillance for local recurrence. In this article, we review mastectomy and reconstruction trends and how these techniques affect the frequency and location of local recurrence. The data on surveillance imaging of the reconstructed breast are extremely limited. However, by assessing the potential role for imaging in this setting and applying the principles of screening, we have identified that there is a potential theoretic advantage of surveillance imaging in a very small subset of women: those with autologous tissue reconstructions and moderate to high risk of recurrence. A prospective registry study of surveillance imaging in this target population would be the appropriate way to determine its benefit and its impact on survival outcomes. In this review article, we will detail the reasons that should allow clinicians to forego routine surveillance imaging in the majority of women who undergo mastectomy and reconstruction.

### The role of MRI in the follow-up of women undergoing breast-conserving therapy [^111njhcx]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) represents a standard of care in the management of breast cancer. However, unlike mastectomy, women treated with BCT require follow-up imaging of the treated breast as well as the contralateral breast as part of posttreatment surveillance. Traditionally, surveillance has consisted of clinical exams and mammograms. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a breast imaging technique utilized as part of high-risk screening programs as well as part of the initial diagnosis and workup of women considered for BCT. At this time, the role of MRI as part of follow-up for women treated with BCT remains unclear.

Methods

A systematic review was performed to evaluate the role of MRI following BCT.

Results

Although there is no randomized evidence supporting the routine use of MRI in surveillance post-BCT, a review of the literature demonstrates that MRI (1) has increased sensitivity as compared with mammography to detect recurrences, and (2) can help evaluate mammographic abnormalities before biopsy and/or surgery.

Conclusions

In patients with higher risk of local recurrence, surveillance with MRI may represent an effective surveillance strategy though subgroups benefiting have not been identified nor has the impact on quality of life and cost been evaluated.

### Yield of surveillance imaging after mastectomy with or without reconstruction for patients with prior breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hG6oM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Although routine imaging surveillance after mastectomy is generally not recommended in international guidelines, this approach is still relatively common in daily clinical practice, mainly because of the lack of adequate evidence on the potential role of imaging surveillance after mastectomy. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to gather the current evidence in this regard to aid future reviews of these international guidelines

The evidence has been summarized in 2 clinical scenarios: patients who underwent mastectomy without reconstruction and those who underwent mastectomy with reconstruction. We used a clinically relevant definition for the clinically occult cancer detection rate per 1000 examinations (ie, only nonpalpable lesions detected by imaging modalities) that better reflects the real clinical association of imaging surveillance after mastectomy with patients' prognosis. In fact, a palpable lesion is easier to detect by the patient or the clinician, and any imaging surveillance will probably not affect the lead time and, consequently, the prognosis. However, a nonpalpable lesion that will be detected by imaging surveillance before it becomes palpable might shorten the lead time and have a potential effect on prognosis.

According to the current evidence, the type of imaging modality does not seem to be associated with cancer detection rates in any of the clinical scenarios examined. Despite the higher mean cancer detection rate with MRI, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis that differences between imaging modalities were due to chance variation. However, in such circumstances of nonsignificance, this does not imply absence of a true effect, so caution is warranted. A potential difference in the underlying cancer risk among the different patient cohorts that were followed up by different imaging modalities cannot be ruled out as a source of selection bias either. A recent meta-analysis investigating the performance of breast MRI as a surveillance method for patients with a personal history of breast cancer concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of MRI in this setting. That meta-analysis included mostly patients treated with BCS and analyzed the detection rates using the sum of ipsilateral and contralateral cancers, resulting in a higher pooled cancer detection rate compared with our results of 5.17 per 1000 examinations by using breast MRI.

### Surveillance imaging: minimal evidence and forgotten harms [^113XFTB4]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Surprisingly few studies have explored patient perspectives on surveillance imaging. Understanding what patients expect to gain from routine radiographic surveillance and their perceptions of the potential harms must be a research priority. In one sarcoma study, patients expressed concern about the costs of routine surveillance and the associated radiation exposure from more frequent imaging. In a qualitative study, women with breast cancer felt less intensive surveillance offered fewer distressing moments, the opportunity to leave the patient role behind and a lower burden. However, patients also identified several disadvantages including fewer moments for reassurance, fear of missing recurrences, and a higher threshold for aftercare for side effects. While monitoring for disease recurrence is of importance, planning survivorship care around surveillance may lead to unmet needs in other aspects, such as residual side effects or the psychosocial consequences of cancer. Patient-initiated follow-up, where patients are given information on signs and symptoms of recurrence and can self‐refer, has been proposed as an alternative strategy. While this approach appears acceptable to patients with breast and endometrial cancer, robust evidence regarding its efficacy is needed.

Patients and clinicians reasonably expect that recommendations in guidelines are based on strong scientific evidence. This important paper by Harrison et al highlighting the lack of data supporting surveillance imaging recommendations should serve as impetus for investment and research into surveillance imaging practices in order to improve survivorship care. Guidelines should more transparently acknowledge the potential harms from routine radiographic surveillance and should encourage clinicians to discuss the uncertainty regarding benefit with patients, empowering them to make choices that align with their values and preferences.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^116c2K8r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current state of long-term monitoring protocols for patients following breast plastic surgery is complex and lacks consensus. For patients undergoing cosmetic breast augmentation with implants, there are varying guidelines regarding the timing and modality of screening imaging for implant rupture detection. While MRI is considered the gold standard, its cost may limit its accessibility, leading to further exploration of alterative imaging options such as ultrasound and mammography. Recommendations from regulatory and professional associations largely agree on the lack of necessity for routine imaging of asymptomatic patients with breast implants who have undergone mastectomy, (Table 2). Of note, the increasing awareness of breast-implant associated lymphomas and other breast implant-related malignancies has highlighted the importance of clinical and sonographic evaluation as well as a possible role for histopathological evaluation in the event of implant-related symptoms or capsulectomy.

There are special mammographic considerations in patients undergoing breast augmentation, reduction, and mastopexy. Preoperative screening imaging is warranted for women aged ≥ 40 years. High-risk women should undergo screening at the age appropriate for their risk level. Postoperatively, mammographic findings post-reduction or mastopexy may be challenging to interpret due to changes in tissue distribution, retained suture, scarring, and fat necrosis. Nevertheless, mammography remains the most cost effective screening tool for breast cancer, and in patients with breast augmentation, is performed with and without implant displacement. Considerations for supplemental screening imaging is given to those with dense breast tissue.

Following breast cancer surgery and reconstruction, surveillance guidelines vary among professional organizations, (Table 3). Most agree that clinical examinations play an integral role in potentially detecting cancer recurrence, but the routine use of imaging is debated. Physical examination alone may be sufficient for detecting local cancer recurrence, with diagnostic imaging and ultrasound of most utilities for symptomatic cases. Recommendations for surveillance of autologous reconstruction are inconsistent, with limited evidence supporting the utility of screening mammography in detecting recurrence. Ultrasound is typically first line for imaging of any suspicious clinical findings, along with diagnostic mammography or tomosynthesis as indicated.

Overall, further research and consensus are needed to establish standardized, evidence-based monitoring protocols for patients undergoing breast plastic surgery. Guidelines that balance the need for effective surveillance with cost and accessibility will be crucial in reducing unnecessary procedures and optimizing patient outcomes.

### BRCA genetic testing and counseling in breast cancer: how do we meet our patients' needs? [^116kHuBs]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical decision-making

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS)

BCS aims to remove the breast tumor, with clear margins, in a manner that is cosmetically acceptable to the patient. Although BCS is recommended for most patients with early-stage operable breast cancer, the best approach for patients harboring gBRCAm is unclear. Practice guidelines recommend that gBRCAm status should not preclude the use of BCS as a surgical option for breast cancer. However, these patients should be counseled regarding the risk of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence, new primary breast cancer in the treated breast, and contralateral breast cancer, noting that intensified surveillance is a reasonable treatment strategy for breast cancer.

Contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy (CRRM)

Some women with a confirmed gBRCAm opt for CRRM over BCS, which is removal of the unaffected breast to reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer, with or without the option of breast reconstruction. A meta-analysis of outcomes in patients with gBRCAm found that CRRM reduced the relative risk of contralateral breast cancer by 93% versus surveillance and significantly increased overall survival (OS) versus surveillance. It should be noted that benefit from CRRM was not maintained in all studies after adjusting for confounding factors, and the absolute survival benefits of mastectomy (both ipsilateral and contralateral) are heavily dependent on patient prognosis; patients with aggressive types of disease, and especially those with little response from neoadjuvant systemic therapy regimens, are at higher risk from distant metastasis than local recurrence or a new primary in the contralateral breast.

Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)

While RRSO is indicated in gBRCAm carriers, its effect on breast cancer risk reduction is not clear. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 21,022 patients demonstrated a 37 and 49% reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer following RRSO compared with no RRSO in patients with g BRCA1 m and g BRCA2 m, respectively, with the effect particularly pronounced in younger women with gBRCAm. A retrospective analysis in 676 women harboring gBRCAm showed that oophorectomy decreased mortality in patients with g BRCA1 m and decreased breast cancer-specific mortality in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative gBRCAm breast cancer. Other studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of RRSO on breast cancer risk.

### Surveillance mammography for detecting ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence and metachronous contralateral breast cancer: a systematic review [^114GSmZk]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

In women previously treated for breast cancer, surveillance mammography is useful for early detection of tumour recurrence, or for confirming the absence of recurrent cancer, and for the early detection of contralateral cancers. Although published figures vary, it has been estimated that approximately 50% of local recurrences in the breast following breast conservation surgery will be detected by mammography, with the remainder being detected by clinical examination or reported by the patient. Recurrent tumours detected by mammography are generally smaller and less invasive than those found on clinical examination. Lu and colleagues recently conducted a systematic review to determine the impact of early detection of isolated loco-regional and contralateral recurrence on survival. The authors reported better overall survival for recurrences detected by mammography or in asymptomatic patients, with an absolute reduction in mortality of 17–28% if all breast cancer recurrences are detected early.

While tumour recurrence displays similar mammographic features to the primary lesion, interpretation of the surveillance mammogram is made more difficult by surgical scarring and changes to breast density caused by primary treatment. For example, following surgery and/or radiotherapy, detectable abnormalities on mammography may include the presence of old haematoma, scar formation, fat necrosis, skin thickening, increased soft tissue density in the breast and microcalcifications. Approximately 10% of palpable tumours are not clearly visible on mammography and require additional imaging techniques for their demonstration. Surveillance mammography is therefore also associated with the possibility of false-positive results, which then require further investigations that are unnecessary and have a negative impact on a woman's quality of life.

We conducted a National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme funded project (NIHR HTA Project 07/47/01) to examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different surveillance mammography regimens after the treatment of primary breast cancer in the UK in primary and secondary care settings. The work comprised: a survey of UK breast surgeons and radiologists, a series of systematic reviews (test performance review presented here), and statistical and economic modelling to determine the effectiveness, cost consequences and cost utility of differing surveillance regimens.

The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine the test performance of surveillance mammography, alone or in combination with other tests, in detecting ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence and/or metachronous contralateral breast cancer in women undergoing routine surveillance. Our secondary objective was to compare surveillance mammography performance with alternative tests, alone or in combination, in women with a previous diagnostic test result indicating suspected ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence and/or metachronous contralateral breast cancer (referred to subsequently as non-routine surveillance).

### Management of hereditary breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and Society of Surgical Oncology guideline [^112NWJ4n]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Locoregional management of hereditary breast cancer — BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: Recommendations are based on Expert Panel consensus, and the Consensus Panel of > 50 experts reached or exceeded the 75% agreement threshold for all practice recommendations. Compared with nonmutation carriers, there is no significant increase in local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and radiation therapy (RT) for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, local control after BCT is similar to noncarriers, and there are no data to support increased local toxicity or contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk from breast irradiation. Therefore, for mutation carriers who desire breast conservation, BCT should be offered if clinically appropriate, although many BRCA1/2 mutation carriers elect bilateral mastectomy because of increased second primaries and increased CBC. Prophylactic mastectomy primarily prevents a future breast cancer and allows patients to avoid annual breast MRI and mammography, and it reduces the relative risk of breast cancer by 90% to 95%. When discussing contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, it is essential to provide absolute CBC risk; for BRCA2 carriers, at 25 years the absolute risk of CBC is 68% versus 20% if diagnosed at age > 50 years, and younger age at first diagnosis confers higher absolute risk. Expert Panel members underscore additional decision factors (prognosis of current and other cancers, ability and willingness for MRI surveillance, ability to tolerate treatment of a subsequent cancer, comorbidities, life expectancy), and consideration of interventions that may decrease CBC risk (eg, salpingo-oophorectomy) and decreased risk from systemic therapies should also be discussed. Currently, data are insufficient to conclude that there is a survival benefit with prophylactic mastectomy for BRCA carriers with breast cancer, though Expert Panel members support offering nipple-sparing mastectomy to BRCA mutation carriers with breast cancer.

### Clinical and imaging surveillance following breast cancer diagnosis… [^113r2uPa]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

LOCAL RECURRENCE, second ipsilateral breast cancer, and contralateral breast cancer may develop in women with a personal history of breast cancer. 1–3Lumpectomy followed by whole breast irradiation or BCT is the most common treatment following a diagnosis of breast cancer. BCT of clinical stage I and stage II breast cancer has become a standard of care, with long-term studies showing no significant difference in survival rates between those treated with BCT as opposed to mastectomy. Most published data compare mammographic surveillance and physical examination. This combination has been the standard of care and is most frequently used in discussion of follow-up protocols. In contrast, mammography of the treated breast for recurrence is seldom performed routinely for patients who have had a mastectomy and breast reconstruction, with physical examination being the primary tool to detect recurrence.

MRI has been shown to be a valuable tool in evaluating the reconstructed breast following mastectomy. MRI may also have an increasing role in the treatment of patients who have undergone BCT or women with an originally mammographically occult primary breast cancer. Recurrent tumors detected by surveillance mammography are in general smaller and less invasive than those found during clinical examination, as demonstrated by Lu and colleagues. 16This systematic review compared isolated locoregional recurrence or contralateral cancers on survival. The authors demonstrated better overall survival for mammographically detected recurrence, or in asymptomatic patients. They also demonstrated an absolute reduction in mortality of 17% to 28% in all patients with breast cancers found early.

A recent review in the United Kingdom for the Health Technology Assessment by Robertson and colleagues 17also demonstrated that for screening for local recurrence, surveillance mammography sensitivity ranged from 64% to 67% and specificity ranged from 85% to 97%. They also found that for MRI, sensitivity ranged from 86% to 100% and specificity was 93%. They concluded that mammography is associated with a high sensitivity and specificity but that MRI is the most accurate test for detecting local recurrence. Mastectomy without Reconstruction A patient who has been treated by mastectomy has a contralateral breast cancer risk of approximately 7%, and so surveillance of the treated breast is almost entirely covered by physical examination, with targeted US scan of any palpable area. The contralateral breast will continue to be monitored by a regular annual mammographic examination, with additional imaging being reserved for patients who are symptomatic or who have a palpable finding.

### Breast imaging surveillance after curative treatment for primary non-metastasised breast cancer in non-high-risk women: a systematic review [^116iaR3m]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

MRI

Breast MRI screening, without or with intravenous contrast, is generally limited to high-risk women. Estimated risk to include women in a high-risk screening programme varies widely among guidelines, ranging between 20 and 30%. Most women with a personal history of breast cancer, but without explicit familial/genetic/iatrogenic risk of recurrence, are currently considered an intermediate risk subgroup. Breast MRI screening has shown to be cost-effective for high-risk women, but is still debated for intermediate-risk women, although there is growing literature considering this topic.

Additional cancer yield for MRI recurrence surveillance varies between 9.9 to 28.8 cancers/1,000 examinations, but has been reaffirmed in multiple retrospective single-centre studies. In 2016, a retrospective single-centre study compared 915 primary MRI screenings of female breast cancer survivors without additional risk factors to MRI screenings of 606 non-affected women with high genetic or familial risk. The study concluded that specificity was significantly higher (94.0 vs 86.0%, p < 0.001) in the survivor compared to the genetic/familial risk group. Furthermore, the false-positive rate (12.3 vs 21.6%, p < 0.001) was significantly lower in the survivor subgroup. Sensitivity (80.0 vs 78.6%, p > 0.99) and cancer yield (1.7 vs 1.8%, p > 0.99) did not differ statistically.

MRI surveillance has been suggested to be more beneficial for young breast cancer survivors, particularly those younger than 50 years of age at diagnosis. Women with other recurrence risk factors, such as dense breasts or a first-degree family history, might also benefit more from MRI screening. In its most recent update, the ACR therefore recommended routine annual contrast-enhanced breast MRI surveillance for two subgroups of women with a personal history of breast cancer: women with dense breasts and women with a breast cancer diagnosis before the age of 50. According to the authors, this combination of risk factors is likely to exceed a life-time risk of 20%, justifying annual MRI surveillance as indicated by high-risk screening guidelines. Risk stratification according to patient, treatment and tumour characteristics, will likely transform the selection of imaging modalities and intensity in the near future.

### Promoting quality and evidence-based care in early-stage breast cancer follow-up [^111bFkZz]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for long-term follow-up of early-stage breast cancer patients developed by oncology societies in the United States and Europe recommend that breast cancer survivors undergo regular evaluation with history and physical examination, as well as annual mammography. Routine blood tests, circulating tumor markers, and/or surveillance imaging studies beyond mammography are not recommended in the absence of concerning symptoms or physical examination findings because of lack of supportive clinical evidence. Despite these guidelines, studies have shown that 20% to 40% of oncologists assess serum tumor markers as part of routine monitoring of early-stage breast cancer patients. As part of efforts to both address the financial challenges confronting the health-care system and optimize patient outcomes, the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Cost of Care Task Force identified adherence to breast cancer surveillance guidelines as an opportunity to improve care and reduce cost. However, these recommendations are based on trials done in an era of outdated technology and limited therapeutic options. It is possible that recent improvements in diagnostics and treatments could make earlier detection of recurrent disease important for improving both survival and quality of life outcomes. Research is necessary to further inform optimal breast cancer follow-up strategies, which could impact these recommendations. At this time, outside of well-conducted clinical trials, there is no role for ordering routine serial blood or imaging tests in monitoring for recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients.

ASCO/ASTRO/SSO hereditary breast cancer — surgical approach and surveillance in mutation carriers notes that the panel's review of the literature supports the use of nipple-sparing mastectomy as reasonable in BRCA1/2 and moderate-penetrance breast cancer gene carriers, while cautioning that many studies showing overall survival benefit with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy may be plagued by selection bias. For those not undergoing risk-reducing surgery, surveillance recommendations are the same for all genetic mutation carriers, and BRCA1/2 and moderate-penetrance gene carriers should undergo annual mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); with the exception of TP53 mutation carriers, a discussion with ATM carriers interested in breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is encouraged.

Surgical management of the index malignancy for women with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer who have a BRCA1/2 mutation — providers should discuss treatment options related to the index cancer and risks of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and new ipsilateral breast cancer. Germline BRCA status should not preclude a patient otherwise eligible for breast-conserving therapy (BCT) from receiving BCT (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Surgical management choices (BCT v ipsilateral therapeutic and CRRM) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers should be discussed, considering the increased risk of CBC and possible increased risk of an ipsilateral new primary breast cancer compared with noncarriers (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). For assessing CBC risk and the role of risk-reducing mastectomy, factors that should be considered include age at diagnosis, family history of breast cancer, overall prognosis from this or other cancers, ability to undergo appropriate breast surveillance (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), comorbidities, and life expectancy (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who do not have bilateral mastectomy should undergo high-risk breast screening of remaining breast tissue with annual mammogram and MRI (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Supporting evidence cited on this page reports that in a cohort study, BRCA1/2 carriers treated with BCT versus mastectomy had a higher risk of local recurrence as first recurrence, and there were no significant differences in death resulting from breast cancer, distant recurrence, or overall survival between the BCT and mastectomy groups.

### Surveillance and monitoring in breast cancer survivors: maximizing benefit and minimizing harm… [^111mQitq]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Guidelines Regarding Surveillance of Asymptomatic Breast Cancer Survivors Based on the results of the studies from two separate ASCO guidelines committees, as well as the Breast Committee of the National Cancer Center Network, these organizations have strongly recommended against any sort of routine surveillance for metastic. 10–12In summary, the only routine surveillance recommended by ASCO and NCCN is standard breast imaging for detection of a new primary or in-breast recurrence. Mammography is considered the standard of care in this regard. Breast MRI is only recommended in genetically high-risk women or women who had received mediastinal radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma who do not elect to have contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.

16 As noted above, although occasionally only a chest X-ray is performed for surveillance, advanced imaging surveillance for metastatic disease is often performed with either CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and bone scan or more recently PET/CT. Charges for a CT and bone scan can run up to $6, 000 and PET/CT is even more. Do Physicians Still Monitor Patients Who Are Asymptomatic to Detect Occult Metastases. Despite these data and guideline recommendations, many physicians continue to order either circulating tumor marker studies — which, if abnormal, lead to imaging studies — or imaging studies including chest radiographs; MRI; bone scans; CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and PET/CT scans, whereas mammography surveillance is performed less frequently than expected.

From a recent national survey of PCPs and oncologists — the Survey of Physician Attitudes Regarding the Care of Cancer Survivors — conducted in 2009, we learned that both physician groups recommended unnecessary tumor marker and imaging studies in response to a vignette-based case of a 4-year asymptomatic breast cancer survivor. Conclusion In summary, contrary to the perceptions held by many patients and their physicians, available data do not support routine surveillance for occult metastases asymptomatic patients with a prior history of breast cancer. It is important to continue breast imaging for a patient with intact breasts. Prospective randomized trials have failed to demonstrate improvement in any clinically meaningful endpoints for surveillance with routine blood tests, circulating tumor markers, or other imaging.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^115XwhdG]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current consensus‐based follow‐up recommendations after 5 years (annual for < 60 years after 5 years of follow‐up, biennial for 60–74, consider stopping > 74) use suboptimal age cutoffs leading to an imbalance between risk of LRR and SP and intensity of the follow‐up following the 5 years of clinical follow‐up. Patients aged 50–60 years have a lower risk for recurrence compared with patients < 50 and could have a less intensive schedule. The proposed alternative cutoffs (< 50, 50–69, > 69) will lead to a more balanced risk‐based follow‐up frequency taking into account the risk of both LRR and SP and will be a start toward more efficient allocation of resources. However, to get truly personalized follow‐up, more risk factors as well as the benefits and harms of follow‐up should be taken into account to provide accurate individualized risk estimates and follow‐up schedules.

Contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy (CRRM) for BRCA1/2 versus moderate-penetrance genes — for women with breast cancer who have a BRCA1/2 mutation and who have been treated or are being treated with unilateral mastectomy, CRRM should be offered, and CRRM is associated with a decreased risk of CBC; there is insufficient evidence for improved survival; factors to consider include age at diagnosis, family history, prognosis from this or other cancers (eg, ovarian), ability to undergo appropriate breast surveillance (MRI), comorbidities, and life expectancy (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate). For women with breast cancer who have a mutation in a moderate-penetrance breast cancer predisposition gene and who have been treated or are being treated with unilateral mastectomy, the decision regarding CRRM should not be based predominantly on mutation status, and additional factors such as age at diagnosis and family history should be considered; the impact of CRRM on decreasing risk of CBC is dependent on the risk of CBC for each individual gene, and data regarding the risk of CBC resulting from moderate-penetrance genes are limited (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

### Management of locoregional and systemic recurrence of breast cancer: to stage or not to stage and how [^111HUzdm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The surveillance of breast cancer patients after potentially curative treatment may result in the identification of locoregional or distant recurrence. While many patients expect frequent imaging studies to monitor for recurrence, there are no data supporting aggressive imaging surveillance beyond mammography. However, when recurrent disease is suspected, it is appropriate to undertake re-staging to develop a rational management plan. The rationale and methods for appropriate surveillance and re-staging are discussed.

### Assessing mode of recurrence in breast cancer to identify an optimised follow-up pathway: 10-year institutional review [^111CaQ52]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
National societal guidelines for breast cancer surveillance

As stated, the primary goal of surveillance programmes is to identify recurrence at the earliest stage, thereby enabling early intervention with a subsequent improvement in overall survival. However, trends in how breast cancer recurrences are diagnosed have changed over time. As demonstrated, clinical examination forms part of annual surveillance and previously was the principal method of detecting recurrence. However, more recent evidence has suggested that radiological surveillance is not only more effective in detecting recurrence, but unsurprisingly does so at an earlier stage, with a direct effect on survival in such patients. Conversely, recurrence diagnosed by clinical examination is associated with poorer longer term oncological outcomes. – Despite these results, clinical review is still recommended in many countries for at least 5 years, with 70% of in-breast recurrences presenting within 5 years of treatment. The role of routine clinical examination assessing asymptomatic patients with a history of breast cancer as part of a follow-up programme remains a topic of debate, as well as representing a significant financial burden and use of time for busy clinicians. It is likely that such programmes could be optimised.

The aim of this study was to assess how breast cancer recurrences are detected, with a particular focus on the role of routine clinical examination. The results of this study can have important implications on optimal follow-up strategies in women diagnosed with breast cancer to identify recurrent or a new breast cancer.

### Yield of surveillance imaging after mastectomy with or without reconstruction for patients with prior breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113b9Rar]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A discrepancy on current guidelines and clinical practice exists regarding routine imaging surveillance after mastectomy, mainly regarding the lack of adequate evidence for imaging in this setting.

Objective

To investigate the usefulness of imaging surveillance in terms of cancer detection and interval cancer rates after mastectomy with or without reconstruction for patients with prior breast cancer.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in 3 electronic databases-PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus-without year restriction. References from relevant reviews and eligible studies were also manually searched.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were defined as those conducting surveillance imaging (mammography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of patients with prior breast cancer after mastectomy with or without reconstruction that presented adequate data to calculate cancer detection rates for each surveillance method.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent data extraction by 2 investigators with consensus on discrepant results was performed. A quality assessment of studies was performed using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) template. The generalized linear mixed model framework with both fixed-effects and random-effects models was used to meta-analyze the proportion of cases across studies including 3 variables: surveillance method, reconstruction after mastectomy, and surveillance measure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Three outcome measures were calculated for each eligible study and each surveillance imaging method within studies: overall cancer detection (defined as ipsilateral cancer, both palpable and nonpalpable) rate per 1000 examinations, clinically occult (nonpalpable) cancer detection rate per 1000 examinations, and interval cancer rate per 1000 examinations.

Results

In total, 16 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled overall cancer detection rates per 1000 examinations were 1.86 (95% CI, 1.05–3.30) for mammography, 2.66 (95% CI, 1.48–4.76) for ultrasonography, and 5.17 (95% CI, 1.49–17.75) for MRI. For mastectomy without reconstruction, the rate of clinically occult (nonpalpable) cancer per 1000 examinations (2.96; 95% CI, 1.38–6.32) and the interval cancer rate per 1000 examinations (3.73; 95% CI, 0.84–3.98) were lower than the overall cancer detection rate (including both palpable and nonpalpable lesions) per 1000 examinations (6.41; 95% CI, 3.09–13.25) across all imaging modalities. The interval cancer rate per 1000 examinations for mastectomy with reconstruction (3.73; 95% CI, 0.41–2.73) was comparable to the pooled cancer detection rate per 1000 examinations (4.73; 95% CI, 2.32–9.63) across all imaging modalities. In all clinical scenarios and imaging modalities, lower rates of clinically occult cancer compared with cancer detection rates were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Lower detection rates of clinically occult-compared with overall-cancer across all 3 imaging modalities challenge the use of imaging surveillance after mastectomy, with or without reconstruction. Findings suggest that imaging surveillance in this context is unnecessary in clinical practice, at least until further studies demonstrate otherwise. Future studies should consider using the clinically occult cancer detection rate as a more clinically relevant measure in this setting.

### Assessing mode of recurrence in breast cancer to identify an optimised follow-up pathway: 10-year institutional review [^116ZnXjV]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer in 2020 was 142.8 cases per 100,000 population in the 27 European Union member states. Due to the increased use of better and more individualised adjuvant therapies, as well as multidisciplinary management, breast cancer survival has improved over the last decade, with lower rates of recurrence. – In addition, recurrences are detected earlier, due to better patient education and improved surveillance modalities. However, clinicopathological factors such as tumour size, nodal positivity and certain receptor subtypes (TNBC/HER2+ enriched) are still associated with increased rates of recurrence. Recurrent breast cancer or the development of a second primary breast cancer are associated with an increased risk of distant metastatic disease, as well as mortality. Therefore, diagnosis of recurrence at the earliest possible stage is critical to improving survival.

Guidelines from international societies regarding surveillance protocols following a diagnosis of breast cancer are broadly similar in Europe and the USA. Current protocols, involving history and clinical examination combined with interval mammography (MG), are the standard of care. The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in Ireland recommends annual clinical examination for 5 years in addition to annual mammography from diagnosis. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) advises history and clinical examination every 3–4 months in the first 2 years following diagnosis, then every 6 months for years 3–5, then annually, with an annual MG. Guidelines from American societies, including the American Society of Clinical oncology (ASCO) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), are similar and shown in Table 1. In the UK, some centres offer an open access follow up programme whereby patients undergo annual mammography for 5 years and do not receive routine annual clinical examination. However, patients have access to clinical review if they develop a new symptom or sign. This surveillance method has been shown to be non-inferior to standard follow-up in low-risk patients.
