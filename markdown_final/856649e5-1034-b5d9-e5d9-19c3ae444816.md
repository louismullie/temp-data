## Question

CK elevation time course in myocardial infarction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the time course of creatine kinase (CK) elevation in myocardial infarction, including CK-MB kinetics, how reperfusion modifies timing, and how this compares with troponin, culminating in practical sampling recommendations and caveats. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biomarker context and why CK/CK-MB behave the way they do. Then, I should verify the classic time course of CK and CK-MB rises, peaks, and returns to baseline. Next, I will examine how reperfusion shifts the timing and what that implies clinically. After that, I need to compare CK/CK-MB kinetics with troponin. Finally, I will translate this into practical sampling strategies and acknowledge limitations and confounders, making sure I anchor each point to data and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the biomarker context so I don't jump to conclusions: CK is a cytosolic enzyme present in heart and skeletal muscle, and CK-MB is the cardiac-predominant isoenzyme that rises with myocyte necrosis. Importantly, troponin has supplanted CK/CK-MB for diagnosis in contemporary practice, but CK/CK-MB still inform infarct sizing and procedural injury assessment, so I need to keep both diagnostic and prognostic roles in mind as I interpret kinetics [^1156S99x] [^116QagTE] [^1124EKbR].

> Now, I should verify the classic time course of total CK in MI without reperfusion. Total CK typically begins to rise within about 3–6 hours after symptom onset, peaks around 24 hours, and returns to baseline over roughly 3–4 days; this is the canonical teaching and aligns with older serial sampling studies and clinical practice descriptions, though I should note that exact timings vary with assay and patient factors [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify CK-MB kinetics because they are more cardiac-specific and often used for timing and sizing. CK-MB generally rises earlier than total CK, often detectable by 3–4 hours, peaks around 12–24 hours, and normalizes within about 2–3 days; this faster rise and fall is why CK-MB has historically been useful for detecting reinfarction and for early infarct sizing, though again, assay characteristics and reperfusion status modify this profile [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify how reperfusion alters this trajectory, because that's where misinterpretation happens. Successful reperfusion accelerates enzyme washout, causing earlier and higher peaks; in primary PCI cohorts, CK peaks frequently occur by 8–16 hours, and many patients reach peak CK within 8 hours, which would be atypical in non-reperfused infarction; this earlier peak has been used as a surrogate of reperfusion, though I need to be cautious because very early peaks can also reflect larger infarct burden rather than better salvage [^113NPwBS] [^117896KN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "early peak equals better salvage", but I should double-check that assumption. A study of anterior STEMI with successful reperfusion found that patients with late CK peaks (> 12 hours) had better LV function and less LV dysfunction than those with very early peaks (< 6 hours), suggesting that very early peaks may reflect more extensive necrosis and less salvage despite reperfusion; so I need to correct my earlier simplistic inference and emphasize that peak timing must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside infarct size and LV function rather than as a standalone marker of salvage [^1127hMDg].

> Next, I should review how CK/CK-MB kinetics compare with troponin, because this shapes modern algorithms. Troponin rises within about 3–6 hours, peaks around 12–24 hours, and remains elevated for 7–14 days, which is why serial change (rise/fall) is essential to distinguish acute injury from chronic elevation; high-sensitivity troponin assays detect smaller rises earlier, enabling 0/1–3 hour pathways, whereas CK-MB's shorter persistence makes it more useful for detecting reinfarction within the first few days, even though troponin is the diagnostic cornerstone today [^117UqqC9] [^1156S99x] [^1125VYuT].

> I will now examine practical sampling implications so I don't overgeneralize. In non-reperfused MI, sampling every 6–8 hours for the first 24–48 hours captures the rise and peak and supports infarct sizing; in reperfused MI, especially after PCI, more frequent early sampling (for example, at baseline, 2–4, 8, 12–16, and 24 hours) helps identify earlier peaks and supports both diagnostic and prognostic inference; for suspected reinfarction within 48–72 hours, CK-MB can be helpful because troponin may still be elevated from the index event, though troponin delta criteria can still be used if interpreted carefully [^112cZgZx] [^113NPwBS] [^116QagTE].

> But wait, what if baseline CK is already elevated from skeletal muscle disease or trauma; I need to ensure I interpret relative changes and CK-MB fractions correctly. In that scenario, CK-MB relative to total CK (often using a CK-MB index > 5%) helps specificity, and serial dynamics remain crucial; conversely, isolated CK-MB elevation with normal total CK still carries adverse prognostic implications in ACS and should not be dismissed, reinforcing the need to integrate clinical risk, ECG, and serial biomarker patterns rather than a single value [^111pt5wc] [^113xQ1oW].

> I should confirm the prognostic linkage so I don't understate the value of peak CK/CK-MB. Higher peak CK or CK-MB correlates with larger infarct size, lower LVEF, and worse short- and intermediate-term outcomes after STEMI, and both peak CK-MB and area under the curve independently predict mortality after primary PCI; this is why many trials and registries still report peak CK-MB as an efficacy endpoint despite troponin's diagnostic primacy [^112TWo56] [^112Hk6Uf] [^113X8376].

> Hold on, I should verify post-PCI contexts because thresholds and timing differ. Post-PCI MI definitions have historically favored CK-MB thresholds (commonly ≥ 10× ULN, or ≥ 5× ULN with new Q waves), acknowledging that troponin's greater sensitivity inflates event rates; moreover, peak CK-MB after PCI often occurs later than expected, so extending surveillance to 12–24 hours improves capture of clinically relevant elevations linked to adverse outcomes, which I need to remember when planning post-procedural sampling [^1124EKbR] [^1125B3sE] [^116VWrCX].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. CK and CK-MB rise after myocyte necrosis with CK-MB rising earlier and clearing faster than total CK; without reperfusion, CK typically peaks near 24 hours and normalizes by 3–4 days, whereas successful reperfusion accelerates peaks to 8–16 hours; troponin rises similarly but persists far longer, enabling sensitive diagnostic algorithms but complicating reinfarction detection, so CK-MB remains useful for early reinfarction and for infarct sizing when interpreted in clinical context and with appropriate serial sampling [^113NPwBS] [^117UqqC9] [^116QagTE].

---

Creatine kinase (CK) rises within **3–8 hours** after myocardial infarction (MI), peaks at **12–24 hours**, and returns to baseline in **3–4 days**. CK-MB rises similarly but **peaks earlier** and normalizes within 2–3 days, making it more specific for MI. Reperfusion accelerates and increases CK release, often peaking by 8–12 hours. Because CK lacks cardiac specificity and is less sensitive than troponin, **troponin is preferred** for diagnosis, while CK/CK-MB may still aid infarct sizing and reinfarction detection.

## Time course of CK elevation in MI

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Ck kinetics** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial rise | 3–8 hours after symptom onset | CK begins to rise as myocardial necrosis releases the enzyme into circulation [^notfound] |
| Peak levels | 12–24 hours | CK reaches its maximum concentration, correlating with infarct size [^112TWo56] |
| Return to baseline | 3–4 days | CK gradually declines and normalizes as clearance exceeds production [^notfound] |

---

## CK-MB isoform kinetics

CK-MB is more **cardiac-specific** than total CK and follows a similar but earlier timeline:

- **Initial rise**: 3–6 hours after onset
- **Peak**: 12–24 hours
- **Return to baseline**: 2–3 days

This faster clearance makes CK-MB useful for detecting **reinfarction** or assessing infarct size when serial measurements are available [^116QagTE].

---

## Influence of reperfusion on CK kinetics

Successful reperfusion (thrombolysis or PCI) accelerates CK release and increases peak levels, often shifting the peak to **8–12 hours**. Early peaking with high CK values is associated with larger infarcts but also with successful reperfusion and myocardial salvage [^113NPwBS].

---

## Clinical implications of CK kinetics

- **Diagnosis**: CK/CK-MB can support MI diagnosis, especially when troponin is unavailable or in combination with ECG and clinical context [^116QagTE].
- **Infarct size estimation**: Peak CK correlates with infarct size and prognosis, though troponin is now preferred for this purpose [^112TWo56].
- **Reinfarction detection**: CK-MB's faster normalization allows detection of recurrent MI within days of the initial event [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of CK in MI diagnosis

- **Lack of specificity**: CK is present in skeletal muscle, so elevations can occur with trauma, exercise, or muscle disease [^117YA2Uc].
- **Lower sensitivity**: CK may miss small or early infarcts, especially within the first 6 hours [^111pt5wc].
- **Supplanted by troponin**: High-sensitivity troponin assays are now the gold standard due to superior sensitivity and specificity [^1156S99x].

---

## Comparison with troponin

Troponin I/T rise within 3–6 hours, peak at 12–24 hours, and remain elevated for 7–14 days, enabling **early detection** and late confirmation of MI. Troponin is **more sensitive and specific** than CK/CK-MB, particularly for small infarcts and early presentation [^112ZhZLD].

---

CK rises within 3–8 hours, peaks at 12–24 hours, and normalizes in 3–4 days after MI; CK-MB follows a similar but earlier course. Reperfusion accelerates and increases CK release. Because of limited specificity and sensitivity, **troponin is preferred** for diagnosis, while CK/CK-MB may still assist with infarct sizing and reinfarction detection.

### Evaluation of creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB for diagnosing myocardial infarction… [^114bbb65]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We prospectively studied the performance of emergency room strategies using a single sampling of total creatine kinase only and total CK with, if total CK levels were elevated, CK-MB levels in 639 patients with acute chest pain, including 386 patients who were admitted and 253 patients who were discharged. Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 104 patients and excluded in 535. An elevated total CK level had a sensitivity of only 38% and specificity of only 80%, whereas a CK-MB level over 5% of an elevated total CK level had a sensitivity of only 34% and specificity of 88%. The sensitivities of both CK and CK-MB were higher in patients who arrived more than four hours after the onset of symptoms, and, in this population, the strategy using CK-MB performed significantly better than the strategy using total CK alone.

Since a very positive CK-MB in a low-risk patient can greatly raise the probability of myocardial infarction, future strategies using CK-MB may have a role in selected subsets in determining which patients should not be sent home. However, the sensitivity of a single sampling of CK and CK-MB is too low for these assays to be used to exclude myocardial infarction in the emergency room or to be used as the rationale for deciding not to admit a patient.

### Prognostic implications of creatine kinase-MB measurements in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^112Hk6Uf]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Peak creatine kinase (CK)-MB concentration is related to reperfusion success and clinical outcomes after fibrinolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. However, prognostic implications of CK-MB measurements after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which provides more predictable and consistent reperfusion, are unknown.

Methods

We pooled 2,042 primary PCI-treated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients from 3 trials with serial core laboratory-determined CK-MB measurements; 1,799 patients (88.1%) who survived to 36 hours and had ≥ 4 CK-MB measurements were studied. Cox regression modeling was performed to quantify the association between peak CK-MB concentration (and area under the time-concentration curve [AUC]) and mortality at 6 months, and death or congestive heart failure at 90 days.

Results

The median (25th-75th percentiles) peak CK-MB concentration and AUC measurement through 36 hours were 239 (109–429) ng/mL and 4,263 (2,081–7,124) ng/(mL h), respectively. By multivariable analysis, peak CK-MB concentration and AUC measurement were independently associated with 6-month mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.05–1.25, per 100-ng/mL increase, P = 0.002; and adjusted HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.14, per 1,000-ng/[mL h] increase, P < .001, respectively) and 90-day death or congestive heart failure (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.18–1.34, P < .001; and adjusted HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.11–1.19, P < .001, respectively).

Conclusions

Peak CK-MB concentration and AUC measurement are independent predictors of 3- to 6-month cardiovascular outcomes in primary PCI-treated STEMI patients. Our findings guide application of these measurements as efficacy end points in early-phase studies evaluating new therapies for STEMI.

### Prognostic implications of creatine kinase elevation after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction [^113NPwBS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined the prognostic implications of the absolute level and rate of increase of creatine kinase (CK) elevation after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

Peak creatine kinase (CK(peak)) and the rate of CK increase are related to reperfusion success and clinical outcomes after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The utility of routine serial CK monitoring after primary PCI, in which normal antegrade blood flow is restored in most patients, is unknown.

Methods

In the Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty Complications (CADILLAC) trial, 1,529 patients with AMI randomized to either stenting or balloon angioplasty, each with or without abciximab, had CK levels determined at baseline and at 8 ± 1 h, 16 ± 1 h, and 24 ± 1 h after PCI.

Results

The CK(peak) occurred at baseline in 3.9% of patients, at 8 ± 1 h in 69.6%, at 16 ± 1 h in 20.0%, and at 24 ± 1 h in 6.5%. The CK levels at all post-procedural time points were significantly higher in patients who died compared with the one-year survivors, as was CK(peak) (mean, 2,865 U/l vs. 1,885 U/l, respectively, p ≤ 0.001). By multivariate analysis, CK(peak) was a significant predictor of one-year mortality (hazard ratio = 2.15, p = 0.0002), independent from post-PCI Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow. Both the improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to seven months and its absolute level were inversely correlated with CK(peak) (p < 0.001 for both). In contrast, the time to CK(peak) was not an independent predictor of mortality or myocardial recovery.

Conclusions

The CK(peak) after primary PCI is a powerful predictor of one-year mortality independent of other clinical and angiographic measures.

### Biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction [^112ZhZLD]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction

Some of these newer biomarkers and their relationship to various pathophysiological processes are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Biomarkers associated with various pathophysiological processes associated with acute myocardial infarction.

Diagnostic biomarkers

Two well known biomarkers in use for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction are Creatine-Kinase-MB isoform and Cardiac Troponin. In 2000, Cardiac Troponin replaced CK-MB as the biomarker of choice for diagnosing a myocardial infarction. Troponin is a protein released from myocytes when irreversible myocardial damage occurs. It is highly specific to cardiac tissue and accurately diagnoses myocardial infarction with a history of ischaemic pain or ECG changes reflecting ischaemia.

Cardiac troponin level is dependent on infarct size, thus giving clinicians an idea of the prognosis following an infarct. However, following reperfusion therapy, the actual troponin level can be misleading due to the washout phenomenon. Troponin levels peak at 12 hours, and stay elevated for 10 days or more. Whilst the use of Troponin for diagnosing AMI and risk stratification to aid decision making has revolutionised the management of patients presenting with chest pain, the 12-hour wait for the levels to peak remains the Achilles heel of this biomarker. Newer, more sensitive troponin assays have been introduced to rectify this weakness. A positive Troponin is associated with increased risk of an adverse outcome at 30 days (HR 1.96, P = 0.003). In addition, the following two biomarkers may help facilitate early diagnosis of AMI, although neither has been compared with the newer high sensitivity troponin assays.

### Interleukin-1 blockade inhibits the acute inflammatory response in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^111BFjhQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Analysis and Biomarkers

Blood samples were used for a complete blood cell count with differential, comprehensive metabolic profile, and plasma levels of hsCRP (high sensitivity C‐reactive protein) (True Health Diagnostics, Richmond, VA). All study personnel were kept blinded to hsCRP levels.

Creatine kinase myocardial band (CK‐MB) levels were determined by direct chemiluminescent technology every 6 hours starting immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention until peak, according to the local clinical standard. We estimated infarct size on the basis of the time‐concentration area under the curve (AUC) of CK‐MB. 16, 17 CK‐MB peak value was defined as the maximal CK‐MB level measured during hospitalization. For patients with < 6 recorded CK‐MB measurements, we estimated AUC for CK‐MB by a validated log‐normal model incorporating the admission CK‐MB level, the CK‐MB peak level, and the time to CK‐MB peak to reconstruct the typical time course of CK‐MB curve. 16, 17 The time to CK‐MB peak, as a measure of duration of myocardial injury, was considered as the time between the initial onset of symptoms (chest pain per patient report) and the CK‐MB peak level.

Doppler Echocardiography

Subjects underwent a transthoracic Doppler echocardiogram within 24 hours of enrollment and at 1‐year follow‐up, as part of their clinical care and as previously described. 10, 11, 15 Paired measurements of LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic volumes and calculation of LV ejection fraction occurred off‐line at the end of the study by a core laboratory with 2 separate operators blinded to group allocations. The average of the 2 measurements was used for measures differing ≤ 10%, whereas those with > 10% difference were rereviewed by a third operator and discussed to achieve consensus.

### Reducing redundant creatine kinase testing in cardiac injury [^112TUwUD]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac disease is a widespread cause of morbidity and mortality in Canada affecting 1 in 12 adults and accounting for about 1 in 5 of all deaths. Common mechanisms of injury include myocardial infarction, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, disorders of aorta and pericarditis. Rapid and reliable diagnosis of cardiac injury, particularly acute coronary syndromes, is essential for effective management. Serum biomarkers can provide valuable early clues to diagnosis and prognosis. Historical examples of biomarkers include aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB isozyme (CK-MB). Since its introduction in the 2000s, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (henceforth troponin) has been shown to be the superior biomarker for rapid diagnosis of cardiac injury. Contrary to evidence, CK and CK-MB testing remains widespread even when troponin testing is available, leading to extraneous blood draws, diagnostic confusion and unnecessary healthcare expenditure.

Troponin testing has been compared with CK-MB in several head-to-head trials examining diagnostic performance across a range of indications. Compared with CK-MB, troponin is more sensitive, specific and an earlier marker of myocardial injury. The diagnostic superiority of troponin extends to patients with renal failure, those with remote infarcts and those who experience cardiac reinfarction. Both CK-MB and troponin rise similarly in cardiac injury yet peak troponin levels provide equivalent estimates of infarct size evaluated post hoc using cardiac imaging. Uncertainty remains regarding the role of biomarker testing after cardiac procedures including percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafts. Data are lacking for conclusive recommendations favouring either troponin or CK-MB, yet this subgroup represents a minority of indications for cardiac biomarker testing.

Reflecting this body of evidence, Choosing Wisely (national body with a focus on healthcare resource stewardship) now solely recommends troponin as the biomarker of choice for myocardial injury where available. This recommendation is echoed in the American Heart Association and European Cardiology Association guidelines, and CK testing has been omitted from the global consensus definition of myocardial infarction. Notwithstanding contemporary guidelines, CK testing for cardiac injury remains widespread in Canadian hospitals.

### Diagnostic markers for detection of myocardial infarction… [^111ZNVF4]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Only 10 to 15 percent of patients who present with acute chest pain have a myocardial infarction. Symptoms cannot be used to differentiate those who have had an MI from those who have not. Further, the electrocardiogram is diagnostic for myocardial ischemia in only 40 percent of patients. Cardiac enzyme assays have formed the basis for making this critical determination. Unfortunately, the standard creatine kinase-MB assay is not reliable in excluding infarction until 10 to 12 hours after the onset of chest pain. Earlier diagnosis would have very specific advantages with regard to fibrinolytic therapy and triage. Studies have been undertaken to assess the utility of newer markers, such as troponin I, troponin T, creatine kinase-MB "subforms" and myoglobin. Zimmerman and associates present the results of the Diagnostic Marker Cooperative Study, which was used to assess each of these enzyme assays.

The DMCT was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind study of 955 consecutively enrolled patients who presented to an emergency department with chest pain. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for conventional CK-MB, CK-MB "subforms, " myoglobin, troponin T and troponin I. Patients underwent each test at hours 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22. The results are shown in. the accompanying table. The most reliable marker for early diagnosis was the CK-MB subform, with a sensitivity of 91. 5 percent. This was followed by myoglobin, conventional CK-MB, troponin T and troponin I. The most reliable marker for late diagnosis was the conventional CK-MB, with a sensitivity of 95. 7 percent. This was followed by troponin I, troponin T, CK-MB subforms and myoglobin. Based on the results of this study, physicans can better discern the reliability of tests in ruling out myocardial ischemia.

The authors found that CK-MB subforms were the most reliable marker for myocardial damage in the first six hours of symptom onset, a conclusion reached by Puleo and colleagues in an earlier article.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^115UvVMq]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bleeding contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality associated with thrombolytic and antithrombotic drug therapy for ischaemic events. With the incidence of major bleeding in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) estimated around 4%, it is well recognised that thrombolytic and antithrombotic therapy involves a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischaemic risk and increasing bleeding risk. Clinical assessment of bleeding risk is therefore of vital importance.

Highly elevated creatine kinase (CK) after myocardial infarction (MI) might reduce ADP-dependent platelet activation in vivo (figure 1). During myocardial ischaemia and infarction, CK and other cell constituents such as myoglobin and troponin enter plasma along with smaller molecules including phosphocreatine. Evidence indicates that this highly elevated CK reduces plasma ADP through its scavenging action on ADP, or through conversion into ATP, catalysing the reaction:

### The prognostic value of creatine kinase elevations extends across the whole spectrum of acute coronary syndromes [^112y2XMo]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study investigated the relationship among creatine kinase (CK) elevations, clinical characteristics and cardiac events across the whole spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Background

Elevated serum levels of cardiac enzymes have been shown to be a major prognostic determinant in acute myocardial ischemia. Yet prior to this report, the relation between cardiac enzyme levels and other prognostic determinants across the entire spectrum of ACS has not been explored by a large clinical study.

Methods

We evaluated the relation between the maximum CK ratio (CK level/upper limit of normal) in the early hours following admission and cardiac events at six months in 11,725 patients enrolled in a large trial of ACS.

Results

Patients with higher risk characteristics, such as older age, female gender, hypertension, diabetes, prior coronary events or heart failure, more frequently presented without ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram and tended to develop lesser enzyme elevations. After adjusting for significant baseline predictors of cardiac events, a continuous correlation was observed between the CK ratio and death (chi-square 63.04, p < 0.0001) and (re)infarction or death (chi-square 55.48, p < 0.0001). This correlation was similar for patients with and without ST-segment elevation. The adjusted incidence of cardiac events at follow-up began to rise even for CK levels within the normal range, the steepest part of the curve residing between one and three times the upper limit of normal. In patients with a CK ratio of > 1 to 2 compared with those within the normal range, the adjusted odds ratio for death was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 1.63), and 1.59 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.90) for (re)infarction and death. For all CK levels, the event rate was higher among patients without ST-segment elevation.

Conclusions

Although high-risk patients with ACS often develop lesser CK elevations, this study demonstrated that even minor enzyme elevations appear to have important and independent prognostic implications.

Table 1
Patients' characteristics

The main findings of the TIMI trial, including recurrent infarction, cardiac function and survival have been reported previously.PTCA after rt-PA was attempted in respectively 54.0% versus 13.3% of the patients assigned to the invasive strategy versus the conservative strategy. There was no significant difference between treatment arms in the trial's main outcome of non-fatal MI or death within 6 weeks after study entry, which occurred in 10.9% of the invasive strategy group versus 9.7% in the conservative strategy group. In addition, there was no difference in mortality between the immediate versus the deferred beta-blocker therapy groups.

CK was estimated at 19 different time points, in total 46 523 times in 3327 patients during the hospital stay, from admission (T = 0 hour) to day 10 (T = 240 hour). Plasma CK ranged from < 10 to 55 890 IU/L. Mean CK (SE) per patient was 900 IU/L (SE 14). CKmax ranged between 16 and 55 890 IU/L (mean 2389, SE 41), a mean of 13.5 times the URL (SE 0.2, figure 3, Panel A and B). Most patients (51.5%) had a peak in CK activity within 8 hours (figure 3, Panel C).

### Trends in use of biomarker protocols for the evaluation of possible myocardial infarction [^1145NGQu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) relies on the history, ECG, and cardiac biomarkers. Because clinical history and physical examination alone have limited utility, 1 and a 12‐lead ECG is diagnostic in a minority of cases, cardiac biomarkers are the cornerstone for diagnosis of non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction. 2

Over the past 20 years, cardiac troponin (cTn), creatine kinase (CK)‐MB, and myoglobin have been the most commonly used cardiac biomarkers to identify myocardial necrosis in the evaluation of patients with suspected AMI. Several strategies have been evaluated, including the use of biomarker combinations, sampling at various time intervals, and use of variable cut points. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury, cTn is the gold‐standard biomarker for risk stratification and diagnosis of AMI. Since the initial use of cTn, the sensitivity and precision of cTn assays have significantly improved, such that use of other markers is no longer recommended. 2

The second universal definition of myocardial infarction consensus document, 3 published in 2007, recommended specific criteria for diagnosis of AMI, in which cTnI or cTnT was the preferred cardiac biomarker with sample measurement at time 0 (presentation), followed by repeat sampling 6 to 9 hours later, and included a rise or fall of cTn with at least 1 value exceeding the 99th percentile reference range cut point for AMI diagnosis, using a recommended optimal assay precision at the 99th percentile of < 10% coefficient of variation. 3 Importantly, use of the 99th percentile as the cut‐off value increases the frequency of AMI diagnosis, has been associated with improved outcomes, and is championed as a Laboratory Medicine Best Practice. 4, 5, 6 Guidelines were updated in 2012, shortening the marker sampling interval to 3 to 6 hours, reflecting the improved cTn assay sensitivity. 3 In this analysis, we assessed biomarker strategies used by US hospitals to evaluate suspected AMI patients, identified changes in strategy over time, and compared findings with the current guidelines.

### Early peak creatine kinase activity is not always a marker of successful reperfusion with myocardial salvage in patients with reperfused anterior acute myocardial infarction [^1127hMDg]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although early peak creatine kinase activity (peak CK) is considered a reliable marker of coronary reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), whether early peak CK indicates good myocardial salvage is unclear. Moreover, some patients have late peak CK despite successful reperfusion, and its clinical implication remains to be elucidated.

Methods and Results

We examined the association of the time to peak CK with predischarge left ventricular function in 124 patients with a first AMI who had successful reperfusion within 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were classified according to the time from reperfusion to peak CK: group A, 61 patients with peak CK < 6 hours; group B, 42 with peak CK from 6 to 12 hours; and group C, 21 with peak CK > 12 hours. There were no differences among the 3 groups in age, sex, method of reperfusion, time from symptom onset to reperfusion, collateral circulation, or the extent of risk area estimated by number of leads with ST-segment elevation. Left ventricular ejection fraction measured by predischarge left ventriculography was lowest in group A, followed by group B, and highest in group C (median values, 43%, 52%, and 60%, P < .01). Left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) occurred in 26 (43%) patients in group A, 8 (19%) in group B, and none in group C (P < .01).

Conclusions

We conclude that compared with early peak CK, late peak CK consistently reflects good myocardial salvage in patients with anterior AMI who had successful reperfusion within 6 hours from symptom onset.

### Troponins in acute coronary syndromes [^115zAaqw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins have replaced creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Expert recommendations set the diagnostic decision-limit for each assay at the 99th percentile of troponin levels in an apparently healthy reference population, which due to a lack of standardization, will vary depending upon the manufacturer. Among patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), even low-level elevations of cardiac troponin T or I correlate with higher risk of death and recurrent ischemic events compared to patients with levels of troponin below the decision limit. Renal failure does not appear to diminish the prognostic value of troponins among patients with a high clinical probability of ACS. Moreover, patients with elevated levels of troponin derive the most benefit from more intense medical therapy with antithrombin and antiplatelet medications, as well as an early invasive management strategy. Whereas cardiac troponins are extremely specific for myocardial necrosis, they do not discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies of myocardial injury. Clinicians must, therefore, determine whether a patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with ACS. Combining troponin with other cardiac biomarkers may offer complimentary information on the underlying pathobiology and prognosis in an individual patient. Future generations of troponin assays may detect specific posttranslational modifications of troponins that may increase the analytic sensitivity for myocardial damage and offer insight into the timing and mechanism of myocardial injury.

### Serum markers in the emergency department diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^111pt5wc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

No currently used cardiac-specific serum marker meets all the criteria for an "ideal" marker of AMI. No test is both highly sensitive and highly specific for acute infarction within 6 hours following the onset of chest pain, the timeframe of interest to most emergency physicians in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia therefore cannot make a diagnosis of AMI excluded on the basis of a single cardiac marker value obtained within a few hours after symptom onset. The total CK level is far too insensitive and nonspecific a test to be used to diagnose AMI. It retains its value, however, as a screening test, and serum of patients with abnormal total CK values should undergo a CK-MBmass assay. Elevation in CK-MB is a vital component of ultimate diagnosis of AMI, but levels of this marker are normal in one fourth to one half of patients with AMI at the time of ED presentation. The test is highly specific, however, and an abnormal value (particularly when it exceeds 5% of the total CK value) at any time in a patient with chest pain is highly suggestive of an AMI. There have been several improvements of CK-MB assay timing and subform quantification that appear highly useful for emergency physicians. Rapid serial CK-MB assessment greatly increases the diagnostic value of the assay in a timeframe suitable for ED purposes but unfortunately still misses about 10% of patients ultimately diagnosed with acute MI. Assays of CK-MB subforms have very high sensitivity, and, although unreliable within 4 hours of symptom onset, have excellent diagnostic value at 6 or more hours after chest pain begins. Automated test assays recently have become available and could prove applicable to ED settings. The cardiac troponins are highly useful as markers of acute coronary syndromes, rather than specifically of AMI, and abnormal values at any time following chest pain onset are highly predictive of an adverse cardiac event. The ED applicability of the troponins is severely limited, however, because values remain normal in most patients with acute cardiac events as long as 6 hours following symptom onset. Myoglobin appeared promising as a marker of early cardiac ischemia but appears to be only marginally more sensitive than CK-MB assays early after symptom onset and less sensitive than CK-MB at 8 hours or more after chest pain starts. Rapid serial myoglobin assessment, however, appears highly useful as an early marker of AMI. The marker has a very narrow diagnostic window. The clinician is left with several tests that are highly effective in correctly identifying patients with AMI (or at high risk for AMI), but none that can dependably exclude patients with acute coronary syndromes soon after chest pain onset. A prudent strategy when assessing ED patients with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECGs is to order CK-MB and troponin values on presentation in the hope of making an early diagnosis of AMI or unstable coronary syndrome. Although it is recognized that normal values obtained within 6 hours of symptom onset do not exclude an acute coronary syndrome, patients at low clinical risk and having normal cardiac marker tests could be provisionally admitted to low-acuity hospital settings or ED observation. After 6 to 8 hours of symptom duration has elapsed, the cardiac-specific markers are highly effective in diagnosing AMI, and such values obtained can be used more appropriately to make final disposition decisions. At no time should results of serum marker tests outweigh ECG findings or clinical assessment of the patient's risk and stability.

Results

Baseline characteristics and assigned treatment

TIMI 3B patients (N = 1473) were predominantly men (66.3%) and white (79.7%), with a mean age of 58.8 (0.3) years (table 1). Patients were randomised to rt-PA (49.4%) or placebo (50.6%) and to the invasive strategy (49.8%) versus the conservative strategy (50.2%). Median duration of hospitalisation was 11 days (IQR 7–14 days). During the first 5 days of hospitalisation, nearly all patients were given heparin (99.7%) and aspirin (99.5%), with a median total daily dose (IQR) of 17 519 U USP (IQR 13 600–21 320) for heparin and 260 mg (195–284) for aspirin.

Table 1
Patients' characteristics

Trial outcomes

TIMI 3 trial endpoints by treatment arm have been reported previously. In summary, in TIMI 3A, of all culprit lesions, 25% with rt-PA versus 19% with placebo achieved the primary endpoint of measurable improvement. A thrombus was present in the culprit lesion in 107 patients (35%), and in these patients, substantial improvement occurred in 36% of the patients with rt-PA versus 15% with placebo. However, in the TIMI 3B study, the incidence of death or non-fatal infarction did not differ after 1 year by strategy assignment, although fewer patients in the early invasive strategy group underwent repeat hospital admission.

Creatine kinase

CK was estimated at 18 different time points, in total 9215 times in 1470 patients during the hospital stay, from the day of admission to day 17. Plasma CK, missing in four patients, ranged between < 10 and 19 045 IU/L. Mean CK per patient was 221(9) IU/L, with a mean URL of 212 IU/L. CKmax ranged between 15 and 19 045 IU/L (mean 450 (24); median 152, IQR 82–433), a mean of 2.2 (0.1) times the URL (figure 2A and B). Most patients (58%) had a peak CK level below the URL, and only 25% of the patients had a CK greater than twice normal, with the highest CK activity on the first day in most patients (figure 2C).

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^116TWmvG]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The ADP-scavenging enzyme creatine kinase (CK) is reported to reduce ADP-dependent platelet activation. Therefore, we studied whether highly elevated CK after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with bleeding.

Methods

Data of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study Group phase II trial on the efficacy of angioplasty, following intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), are used to assess whether peak plasma CK (CKmax) is independently associated with adjudicated fatal or non-fatal bleeding (primary) and combined bleeding/all-cause mortality (secondary) in multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis, adjusting for baseline and treatment allocation covariates.

Results

The included patients (n = 3339, 82% men, 88% white, mean age 57 years, SE 0.2) had a history of angina pectoris (55%), hypertension (38%) and/or diabetes mellitus (13%). CKmax ranged from 16 to 55 890 IU/L (mean 2389 IU/L, SE 41), reached within 8 hours in 51% of the patients (93% within 24 hours). Adjudicated fatal/non-fatal bleeding occurred in 30% of the patients (respectively 26% in the low vs 34% in the high CK tertile), and bleeding/all-cause mortality in 35% (29% in the low vs 40% in the high CK tertile). In multivariable regression analysis, the adjusted OR for fatal/non-fatal bleeding (vs not bleeding and survival) was 2.6 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7)/log CKmax increase, and 3.1 (2.2 to 4.4) for bleeding/all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Highly elevated plasma CK after myocardial infarction might be an independent predictor of bleeding and haemorrhagic death. This biologically plausible association warrants further prospective study of the potential role of extracellular CK in ADP-dependent platelet activation and bleeding.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^112E1MgP]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The presented data indicate, to our knowledge for the first time, that plasma CK after MI is independently associated with a greater than 100% increase in the odds of fatal or non-fatal bleeding per log CKmax increase (compared with non-bleeding), when conjunctive therapy with antithrombotic and thrombolytic drugs is given. With ample experimental evidence present, the biological plausibility of the association is lined out in figure 1, suggesting that a massive leak of CK towards the extracellular space and circulation reduces ADP-dependent platelet activation through its binding capacity for ADP, or through conversion into ATP. The data further suggest a temporal and a dose–effect relationship, depicted in figure 3. The association is potentially clinically relevant.

Inferences from the presented data are limited. First, an association does not prove causation. Second, there is a lack of diversity in the patients, who were mainly older, white, men, with one specific condition, MI. Patients with severe hypertension, a condition known to be associated with high CK as well as with cerebral bleeding, were excluded from this trial. Thus, the strength of the association might be overestimated or underestimated in this analysis. Also, the data need to be considered with caution, as bleeding was typically multifactorial. Patients with higher CK levels probably had larger infarct sizes, and were more likely to be in a poor clinical condition, which might have affected their bleeding risk and survival. Finally, the TIMI 2 data were collected between 1986 and 1990, and it is unclear how the results might translate into contemporary clinical practice. The association reported here between CK and bleeding was not a primary objective of the TIMI 2 study, and the presented results should be considered to be hypothesis generating. The potential role of CK in haemostasis after tissue injury should be further studied and substantiated.

### Identification of lipid metabolism-related genes in myocardial infarction: implications for diagnosis and therapy [^1128Xa8U]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MI, commonly known as a heart attack, refers to damage to or the death of heart muscle cells due to interruption of the blood supply. This condition arises when one of the coronary arteries, which are responsible for delivering blood to the heart, becomes obstructed by a buildup of plaques, which are composed of cholesterol, fat, and cellular debris. Such a blockage can lead to ischaemia, or oxygen deprivation, in the heart muscle. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a severe form of MI in which the blood flow is abruptly cut off, often due to a blood clot. Symptoms of MI can include intense chest pain that may radiate to the left arm or the left side of the neck, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting, an irregular heartbeat, anxiety, fatigue, and a feeling of impending doom. These symptoms are indicative of the body's distress signal as it struggles to receive the oxygen and nutrients it requires. Immediate medical attention is crucial in treating MI and preventing further damage to the heart. MI is a severe consequence of coronary artery disease (CAD), and it is a critical and life-threatening event. Globally, it is the leading cause of mortality attributed to noncommunicable diseases. Wu Y et al. revealed a concerning trend: the global incidence of MI is increasing annually. According to Li M et al. the average mortality rate for MI is approximately 27%. Although electrocardiography (ECG) is the primary diagnostic tool for MI, only 55–57% of patients with AMI receive accurate diagnoses. Circulating levels of troponin and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) typically increase 2–4 h and 4–6 h after AMI onset, respectively. The delay in CK-MB and cardiac troponin elevation after disease onset can impede the early detection of AMI. Restoring circulation to ischaemic cardiac tissue in MI patients is a widely accepted therapeutic approach. Common clinical strategies for AMI include thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). These interventions are designed to improve patient outcomes by reestablishing blood flow to the impacted regions of the heart, thus mitigating the risk of further damage and complications associated with MI. While these methods significantly curtail patient mortality the emergence of unforeseen complications such as bleeding, ischaemia‒reperfusion injury, and coronary restenosis remains a challenge. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover innovative and more potent diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for MI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Patients with elevated baseline cardiac biomarkers — post‑PCI MI diagnosis requires serial measurements and depends on biomarker trends; when cTn or CK‑MB levels are stable or falling, there should be a new CK‑MB elevation by an absolute increment of ≥ 10× ULN or ≥ 70× ULN for cTn I or T from the previous nadir level, and when biomarker levels have not been shown to be stable or falling, there should be a further rise beyond the most recently measured value by an absolute increment of ≥ 10× ULN in CK‑MB or ≥ 70× ULN in cTn plus new ST‑segment elevation or other signs or symptoms consistent with a clinically relevant MI, such as new onset or worsening heart failure or sustained hypotension; chest pain alone is not specific enough for substantial myonecrosis to be used as a criterion.

The TIMI 3 trial

Data of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia 3 (TIMI 3) trial where CK was routinely estimated during admission in all patients were used. As reported previously, the TIMI 3 study consisted of two separate multicentre, randomised controlled double-blind clinical trials designed to assess the effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) versus placebo added to conventional therapy (including intravenous heparin and oral aspirin) on the coronary culprit lesion (TIMI 3A, N = 391) and on clinical outcomes (TIMI 3B, N = 1 473) in comparably selected and treated patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. TIMI 3B further compared management with early cardiac catheterisation (and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, if appropriate) at 18–48 hours after presentation (invasive strategy) versus angiography with revascularisation only if the patient had spontaneous or provokable ischaemia (conservative strategy). The TIMI 3A study recruited participants aged 21–76 years, and TIMI 3B aged 21–79 years, in, respectively, 15 and 25 participating centres across the USA and Canada. All patients had given written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients were required to have chest discomfort at rest suggestive of myocardial ischaemia, lasting greater than 5 min but less than 6 hours, which occurred within 12 hours (24 hours for TIMI 3B) of the time of enrolment. Exclusion criteria were patients who underwent bypass surgery; had experienced myocardial infarction within the preceding 21 days (excluding within 12 hours before enrolment); had new, persistent ST-segment elevation; had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the past 6 months; had contraindication for thrombolytic therapy; used oral anticoagulant therapy; had any history of cerebrovascular disease or transient ischaemic attack, or advanced illness including malignancies, hepatic, renal disorders, among other criteria. Standard clinical care included heparin given as a bolus of 5000 IU intravenously followed by an infusion of 1000 IU/h to reach activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 1.5–2.0 times normal, and anti-ischaemic therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker, a calcium channel blocker and a nitrate preparation. Aspirin was not given routinely in TIMI 3A and 325 mg daily from day 2 in TIMI 3B. The primary comparison was rt-PA versus placebo (blinded), with a primary endpoint of improvement in perfusion or stenosis in TIMI 3A. In TIMI 3B, the secondary comparison was invasive versus conservative strategy (unblinded), with a combined primary endpoint of reduction in death, (subsequent) myocardial infarction or either spontaneous or provokable ischaemia within or at 6 weeks after study drug infusion. The main secondary evaluation was at day 21 after submission.

### Diagnostic value of cardiac troponin in acute chest pain… [^1161gh4M]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The relative lack of sensitivity and specificity of electrocardiography and the serum creatine kinase-MB level in acute coronary syndromes results in a large number of unnecessary admissions to coronary care units. Conversely, developing myocardial infarction is undetected in some patients, and these patients may be discharged from the emergency department. Hamm and colleagues studied the diagnostic value of the cardiac-specific contractile proteins troponin T and troponin I for the early triage of patients who visited an emergency department for evaluation of acute chest pain. Patients included in the study presented to the emergency department because of acute anterior, precordial or left-sided chest pain of less than 12 hours' duration. The pain could not be explained by obvious trauma or by abnormalities on a chest radiograph.

Patients were excluded if ST-segment elevation was apparent on ECG or if they had had an acute myocardial infarction within the previous two weeks. A total of 773 patients were enrolled in the study, and 47 were diagnosed as having a myocardial infarction on the basis of routine measurements of CK-MB within 24 hours of presentation. Of these 47 patients, 24 had positive results on the troponin T test at the time of arrival in the emergency department and 44 had positive results four hours later. The troponin I results were positive in 31 of these patients on arrival, and all of the 47 patients had positive test results four hours later. Measurements of CK-MB were elevated in 25 of these patients on arrival in the emergency department and in 43 of these patients four hours later.

The authors conclude that troponin T and troponin I levels are highly sensitive for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, the diagnostic specificity for myocardial infarction was low: 22 percent of the patients with unstable angina had positive results for troponin T, and 36 percent had positive results for troponin I. For patients with two negative troponin values at least four hours apart, the likelihood of an acute coronary event was very low. Troponin T and troponin I tests result in more accurate diagnoses than previous, more time-comsuming methods.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^114RT5Ut]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In keeping with this reasoning, interventional cardiologists have opted to use the less sensitive CK-MB to define MI post-PCI. They define an MI as a complication of PCI when CK-MB increases three or more times normal. The task force has recommended (by arbitrary convention) that PCI-related MI (TYPE 4a) be defined by a biomarker elevation greater than three times its 99th URL, assuming a normal baseline value going into the procedure. They do not say which biomarker need be used to meet these criteria.

In either the case of PCI or CABG, the important differentiation is to distinguish an event severe enough to be considered as a complication, from relatively minor (expected) injury related to the procedure. If criteria appropriate for the clinical setting do not qualify for diagnosing MI, small abnormalities in cardiac biomarkers can be ignored. However, if criteria for MI are exceeded it could simply be termed 'PCI complicated by MI, or 'CABG complicated by MI' without the need for using specific subtype letters or numbers. If the problems of diagnosing patients who have suffered sudden death are considered a separate issue, this would greatly simplify incorporation of the new diagnostic scheme into ICD-9 codes.

The preferred terminology may require further debate, but the new scheme for the definition of MI provides an improved framework for assessing and documenting coronary ischaemia/infarct. No matter how the ICD-9 codes evolve, it makes clinical sense to clearly differentiate between troponin elevations that are chronic, vs. transient elevations associated with acute coronary events, vs. transient elevations associated with other myocardial stresses.

Making these distinctions clear may also help in our quest for ever improving therapy. Troponin elevations are quite common in intensive care unit patients such as the one presented above. –, The in-hospital complication rates for patients hospitalized for ACS are high, and patients who suffer acute MI during hospitalization for other problems differ substantially in their clinical course and outcomes compared with those who present initially with an acute coronary syndrome. The ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation MIpromote an aggressive approach for treatment of non-ST elevation MI, but no recommendations are made for assessment and treatment of TYPE2 MI. This leaves the optimal treatment strategy for such patients quite uncertain. By providing a specific new diagnosis, it may be possible to encourage further research on how best to manage these patients, and perhaps help determine whether a troponin level should be measured in the first place.

### Normal CK, elevated MB predicts complications in acute coronary syndromes [^113KT8qa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The implications of an elevated Creatine kinase (CK)-MB isoenzyme (MB) in suspected acute coronary syndromes, with a normal total CK, is not well established. Despite many guidelines on managing patients with acute coronary ischemia, none indicates strategies for patients with elevated MB and with a normal CK. The outcome consequence of this result is not firmly established. Our objective was to prospectively evaluate outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, normal initial total CK, and increased MB. All Emergency Department patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes and creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL were eligible for study entry. Serial CK and MB fractions were measured on arrival in the Emergency Department, then 8 and 16 h postpresentation. A composite outcome of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or revascularization was defined at the index visit and 6 months later. Outcomes were determined by blinded record review and by telephone contact. In the 698 patients entered, the acute composite outcome rate was 25% (175) and 6.3% (44) at 6 months. Acute and 6 month adverse outcome rates were statistically the same for all patients with an elevated MB fraction, regardless of the total CK level. An elevated MB conferred a higher event rate than did a normal MB. We conclude that the adverse event rate for patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes and an elevated MB is the same whether or not the total CK is elevated. These patients should be considered as having had an acute coronary syndrome.

### Improved outcomes in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction during the last 20 years are related to implementation of evidence-based treatments: experiences from the SWEDEHEART registry 1995–2014 [^111GXKFD]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome definitions: re-infarction, stroke, heart failure, and mortality

In-hospital re-infarction was obtained from the SWEDEHEART registry. Re-infarction within 30-days was defined as a new myocardial infarction recorded in SWEDEHEART registry if occurring more than 2 days after discharge. Re-infarction after 30 days was defined as readmission of a new myocardial infarction in the National Patient registry (see Supplementary material online). The definition of myocardial infarction has changed over time. Between 1996 and 2001, myocardial infarction was based on the World Health Organization definitionfrom 1994 requiring a doubling of biomarkers (creatinine-kinase_MB, CK-MB) compared with the upper level of normal, in addition to typical electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and symptoms. From 2001 onwards, the definition for myocardial infarction has been based on the European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiologists/American Heart Association consensus document, consisting of troponin T/I or two CK-MB level above the 99th percentile, in addition to typical ECG changes and symptoms.

Hospitalization for stroke or heart failure (main diagnosis) was obtained from the National Patient registry. For re-infarction, stroke, and heart failure, the latest available follow-up was on the 31 December 2013. In-hospital, 30-day, 1-year mortality was obtained from the Swedish Population register with last follow-up on 11 November 2014, with no loss to follow-up. Only patients with complete 1-year follow-up in 2013 were included in the 1-year mortality analyses. Cardiovascular death was obtained from the National Cause of Death registry (see Supplementary material online).

### Atherothrombotic risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction: the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction risk score for secondary prevention in the light of the French registry of acute ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction registries [^114WRMn7]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patient population

Three nationwide French registries were conducted 5 years apart over a 10‐year period (2005‐2015): FAST‐MI 2005 (NCT00673036), 13 FAST‐MI 2010 (NCT01237418), 14 and FAST‐MI 2015 (NCT02566200) 15 (Supporting Information Methods S1). The methods used for these registries have been detailed previously. 13, 14, 15 Briefly, their primary objectives were to evaluate the characteristics, management, and outcomes of AMI patients, as seen in routine clinical practice, on a country‐wide scale.

All registries consecutively included patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) admitted to cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) within 48 hours of symptom onset, during a specified 1‐month period (October‐December 2005, 2010, and 2015). AMI was defined by increased levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponins, creatine kinase (CK), or creatine kinase‐MB (CK‐MB)) together with either compatible symptoms or electrocardiography (ECG) changes. Patients who died soon after admission and for whom cardiac markers were not measured were included if they had signs or symptoms associated with typical ST‐segment changes. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) refusal to participate, (b) iatrogenic MIs, defined as occurring within 48 hours of any therapeutic procedure, and (c) AMI diagnosis invalidated in favor of another diagnosis. STEMI was diagnosed when ST‐elevation ≥ 1 mm was seen in at least two contiguous leads in any location on the index or qualifying ECG, or when presumed new left bundle branch block or documented new Q waves were observed. In the absence of ST‐segment elevation, patients meeting the inclusion criteria were considered to have NSTEMI. A total of 13 130 patients (52% STEMI) were included in the three surveys.

Time Intervals for Evaluation of Suspected Acute Coronary Syndromes

The most common interval was > 10 hours (50%), followed by 4 to 6 hours (30%; Figure 3). The ≤ 3‐hour interval was used by only 5% of institutions, of which 62% used a triple biomarker strategy (cTn, CK‐MB, and myoglobin). When myoglobin was incorporated into a protocol, evaluation intervals were ≤ 3 hours (25%), 4 to 6 hours (32%), 7 to 9 hours (13%), and > 10 hours (30%). There was no statistically significant temporal change in any of the time intervals during the study period.

### Optimal timing of invasive angiography in stable non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the leipzig immediate versus early and late percutaneouS coronary intervention triAl in NSTEMI (LIPSIA-NSTEMI trial) [^115F4esQ]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The optimal timing of intervention in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) remains uncertain. The aim of this multicentre trial was to assess whether an immediate invasive approach is superior to an early invasive or a selective invasive approach with respect to reduction of large infarction.

Methods and Results

Patients with NSTEMI were randomized to either an immediate (< 2 h after randomization; n = 201), an early (10–48 h after randomization; n = 200), or a selective invasive approach with high invasive percentage (n = 201). The primary outcome was the peak creatine kinase (CK)-myocardial band (MB) activity during index hospitalization; key secondary clinical endpoints were the composite of (i) death and non-fatal infarction; (ii) death, non-fatal infarction, and refractory ischaemia; (iii) death, non-fatal infarction, refractory ischaemia, and rehospitalization for unstable angina within 6 months. The median time from randomization to angiography was 1.1 h in the immediate vs. 18.6 h in the early and 67.2 h in the selective invasive group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the peak CK-MB activity between groups. The key secondary clinical endpoints were similar between groups at 6-month follow-up: death and infarction: 21.0 vs. 16.0 vs. 14.5%; P = 0.17; death, infarction, refractory ischaemia: 20.9 vs. 21.5 vs. 22.0%; P = 0.98; death, infarction, refractory ischaemia, rehospitalization: 26.0 vs. 26.5 vs. 24.5%; P = 0.91, respectively.

Conclusions

In NSTEMI patients, an immediate invasive approach does not offer an advantage over an early or a selective invasive approach with respect to large myocardial infarctions as defined by peak CK-MB levels, which is supported by similar clinical outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00402675.

### Elevated creatine kinase-MB with normal creatine kinase predicts worse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes: results from 4 large clinical trials [^113xQ1oW]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The degree to which elevated creatine kinase (CK)-MB in the presence of normal CK is predictive of outcome is not well understood despite having been studied for decades. This analysis examined whether normal CK with elevated CK-MB in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) is an independent predictor of worse outcomes. A concomitant goal was to contribute insight to the debate over how patients with NSTE ACS should be managed.

Methods

Data for 25,960 patients from the GUSTO IIb, PARAGON A and B, and PURSUIT trials were analyzed. Of these patients, 6402 were excluded from primary analysis because of missing (unmeasured) biomarkers. Patients with complete laboratory data (n = 19,558) were grouped by CK and CK-MB results. To confirm the primary analysis results, data from patients with missing biomarkers were used in an imputation model.

Results

Patients were categorized in 1 of 4 groups: normal CK + normal CK-MB; normal CK + elevated CK-MB; elevated CK + normal CK-MB; or elevated CK + elevated CK-MB. For the primary outcome, 180-day death, or myocardial infarction, Kaplan-Meier estimates were 14.9%, 20.8%, 14.5%, and 18.2%, respectively. Regardless of total CK, elevated CK-MB was associated with a 25% to 49% increased relative risk of worse outcomes. Findings from the analyses were verified by the multivariable model.

Conclusions

CK-MB remains a reliable marker for myocardial necrosis and a strong predictor of worse prognosis. All patients with ACS should have CK-MB measurement to search for cardiac ischemia. Patients with elevated CK-MB should receive aggressive management commensurate with their increased risks.

### Comparison of the prognostic value of peak creatine kinase-MB and troponin levels among patients with acute myocardial infarction: a report from the acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network registry-get with the guidelines [^112MbtVh]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin levels have been correlated with mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the independent prognostic implications of these markers have not been compared.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that in patients with AMI, peak troponin levels (as compared to peak CK-MB levels) would have greater prognostic value.

Methods

We examined AMI patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines) with CK-MB and troponin I levels recorded, excluding patients who were transferred in or out. Peak marker levels, standardized by the local laboratory upper limit of normal and assay standard deviation, were fitted into the previously validated ACTION Registry-GWTG mortality model to compare prognostic value.

Results

Between January 2007 and March 2009, 16 009 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 26854 non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients were identified. Peak marker ratios were directly associated with in-hospital mortality in both STEMI and NSTEMI patients. Peak CK-MB had slightly greater discrimination compared with peak troponin I in predicting mortality in both STEMI (model C-statistic 0.881 vs 0.877, P = 0.011) and NSTEMI (C-statistic 0.831 vs 0.824, P = 0.001) patients.

Conclusions

Both peak CK-MB and peak troponin I levels are independently associated with in-hospital mortality in this large contemporary database of AMI patients treated in routine practice. Peak marker values slightly improved model performance in prognosticating in-hospital mortality; the incremental value was higher with CK-MB than with troponin I. These findings may help to guide future risk stratification algorithms and contribute to more efficient use of serial cardiac marker measurements in clinical practice.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^111Rueof]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and sample size calculations

The main outcomes of this analysis are the independent association between peak CK activity (CKmax) with adjudicated fatal or non-fatal bleeding during hospitalisation (primary), and with adjudicated combined non-fatal bleeding and all-cause mortality (ACM, secondary). The tertiary outcome was the association of CK with all investigator reported bleeding. The probability p of events at the mean value of the CK (and other variables) was conservatively estimated to be 0.25. Sample size was estimated for two levels of the OR of disease, corresponding to an increase of 1 SD from the mean value of CK, given the mean values of the remaining variables; at OR 1.2, with at least 1138 participants needed; or at OR 2.0, with at least 95 needed for this analysis with a one-tailed α of 5% and 1 − β of 80.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1131k1h6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome

The primary role for the troponin assay since its inception has been to diagnose patients with acute MI (AMI). While the improved sensitivity and specificity of troponin (over creatine kinase–MB) may have improved diagnostic accuracy for AMI in the emergency department and hospital, its shortcoming may be that, depending on the time between symptom onset and presentations, there is a delay of several hours in elevation of the biomarker. – This delay causes a delay in diagnosis and, thus, longer emergency department and observation stays both for patients with and those without AMI. New high‐sensitivity assays have overcome this weakness with their improved sensitivity, making the first low‐level elevations of troponin detectable within 90 to 180 minutes of the event. Two large prospective studies performed in the emergency department setting showed that the high‐sensitivity troponin assays are more accurate than previous assays in the successful diagnosis of AMI within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. – The increase in accuracy and speed could be beneficial in multiple ways. Patients are diagnosed more quickly and, as a result, may be treated more rapidly, including earlier invasive therapy. For the majority of patients, the improved assays will lead to a quicker rule‐out of MI. This may allow for more prompt subsequent evaluation and perhaps to earlier discharge of appropriate patients, decreasing further costs. However, there has not been adequate prospective evaluation of the use of these new assays in a diagnostic algorithm, and these assays may perform in a less‐specific manner in the general chest pain population outside of the strict criteria required to enter a randomized clinical trial. Also, the cost‐effectiveness of these new algorithms and strategies has not yet been established.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain additional testing after 3 hours if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.

### Aborted myocardial infarction: is it real in the troponin era? [^116PWFZw]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponins are the markers of choice for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of "aborted myocardial infarction" (no detectable myocardial injury) determined by measurement of troponin versus that determined by creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-muscle brain (CK-MB) measurement criteria among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who received reperfusion therapy.

Methods

Since 2004, the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) has had a standard reperfusion protocol for the treatment of patients with STEMI. During the study period, 767 patients presented with new or presumed new ST elevation or left bundle block.

Results

The diagnosis of STEMI was confirmed in 765 (99.7%) patients. Using the 99th percentile cutoff value, troponin T elevations occurred in 765 (100%) of 765 patients when serial samples were available. Creatine kinase-MB levels of twice or more the upper limit of normal occurred in 681 (90.1%) of 749 patients with serial samples for CK-MB, and CK equal or greater than twice the gender-specific upper limits of normal occurred in 521 (78.8%) of 661 patients with serial samples for CK available.

Conclusion

The frequency of aborted myocardial infarction is 0% when using troponin at the 99th percentile cutoff as recommended by contemporary guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (Nice, France) and American College of Cardiology (Washington, DC).

### Prognostic significance of an elevated creatine kinase in the absence of an elevated troponin I during an acute coronary syndrome [^115XoDjG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

In patients with troponin-negative acute coronary syndromes, creatine kinase (CK)-MB elevation predicts a significantly higher risk of death and major acute cardiac events compared with CK-MB negative patients. This risk is accentuated in troponin-negative, CK-MB positive patients who do not demonstrate ST elevation by electrocardiogram.

### The contemporary value of peak creatine kinase-MB after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction above other clinical and angiographic characteristics in predicting infarct size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and mortality [^112TWo56]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Complex multimarker approaches to predict outcome after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have only considered a single baseline sample, while neglecting easily obtainable peak creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) values during hospitalization.

Methods

We studied 476 patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) at 4–6 months after STEMI. We determined the association with cardiac biomarkers (peak CK-MB, peak troponin T, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), clinical and angiographic characteristics with infarct size, and LVEF, followed by association with mortality in 1120 STEMI patients.

Results

Peak CK-MB was the strongest predictor for infarct size (P < 0.001, R² = 0.60) and LVEF (P < 0.001, R² = 0.40). The additional value of clinical and angiographic characteristics was limited. The optimal peak CK-MB cutpoints, for differentiation among small (< 10% of the left ventricle), moderate (≥ 10%- < 30%), and large infarct size (≥ 30%), were 210 U/L and 380 U/L, respectively. These cutpoints were associated with 90-day mortality; the hazard ratio for moderate infarct was 2.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51–5.93, P = 0.002) and for large infarct 6.53 (95% CI: 3.63–11.76, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Classical peak CK-MB measured during hospitalization for STEMI was superior to other clinical and angiographic characteristics in predicting CMRI-defined infarct size and LVEF, and should be included and validated in future multimarker studies. Peak CK-MB cutpoints differentiated among infarct size categories and were associated with increased 90-day mortality risk.

### Impact of the troponin standard on the prevalence of acute myocardial infarction [^11727bw3]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recent recommendations are that troponin should replace creatine kinase (CK)-MB as the diagnostic standard for myocardial infarction (MI). The impact of this change has not been well described. Our objective was to determine the impact of a troponin standard on the prevalence of acute non-ST-elevation MI.

Methods

The current study was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients without ST-segment elevation admitted for exclusion of myocardial ischemia to an inner city urban tertiary care center. All patients underwent serial marker sampling (CK, CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I [cTnI]). Patients with ST elevation consistent with acute MI (n = 130) or who did not have an 8 hour cTnI (n = 124) were excluded. The impact of 3 different cTnI diagnostic values were examined in 2181 patients: the lower limit of detectability (LLD); an optimal diagnostic value (OPT), chosen using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis; and the manufacturer's suggested upper reference level (URL), when compared to a gold standard CK-MB MI definition. In addition, MI prevalence was assessed using different CK-MB MI definitions and evaluated in patients with ischemic changes only.

Results

The prevalence CK-MB MI was 7.8%. Using the various cTnI diagnostic values, the incidence of MI increased the prevalence by 28% to 195%. Using the optimal diagnostic value for cTnI, patients with cTnI elevations not meeting CK-MB MI criteria had an intermediate 30-day mortality (5.4%) compared to those with CK-MB MI (7.1%). Grouping the cTnI positive, CK-MB MI negative patients with the CK-MB MI patients rather than the non-CK-MB MI patients reduced mortality for both the MI (to 5.9%) and non-MI groups (from 1.9% to 1.6%).

Conclusions

Changing to a troponin standard will have a substantial impact on the number of patients diagnosed with MI. The revised definition for MI will have important clinical and health care implications.

### Comparison of site-reported and core laboratory-reported creatine kinase-MB values in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (from the international trial SYNERGY) [^113q4UCH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The effect of nonstandardized creatine kinase (CK)-MB assays on the assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) end points in multicenter international trials has not been evaluated. We compared the site-reported and corresponding core laboratory CK-MB measures from 5 countries participating in the Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization, and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors (SYNERGY) trial. Samples for CK-MB were collected locally, with corresponding samples sent to a core laboratory at enrollment and after recurrent ischemic events, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass grafting. The measured values were compared to the reported assay upper limits of normal (ULN) used at the site (or core laboratory for the core laboratory samples). The CK-MB results were available locally and from the core laboratory for 913 patients, constituting 4,693 time-matched laboratory values. The agreement between the core and site laboratory CK-MB/ULN ratio was moderate (concordance correlation coefficient 0.45) and varied considerably by geographic location and site. The CK-MB values were elevated (≥ 2 times the ULN) by the core laboratory but normal (< 2 times the ULN) by local standards in 708 instances (15%). There were 162 MI end points according to the core laboratory values versus 91 MI end points using the site-reported CK-MB data (kappa statistic 0.48). Compared with patients with no MI by the core or site laboratory values, patients with MI, as determined by both the core and the site laboratories, had significantly lower unadjusted 1-year survival rates (80.6% vs 93.5%, p < 0.0001). Patients with MI, as determined by the core laboratory but not by the site laboratory, showed a trend toward a lower 1-year survival rate (89.8% vs 93.5%, p = 0.20). In conclusion, a substantial variation in CK-MB ratios and MI outcomes between the site and core laboratory data was observed in the SYNERGY trial. More MI outcomes were identified by the core laboratory, and patients with MI as defined by core laboratory data had lower 1-year survival, making these events potentially clinically important.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^115BpCAn]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

CK by clinical bleeding categories is depicted in figure 3, Panels F and G. The proportion of patients with bleeding events in the low versus the high CK tertile was respectively 26% vs 34% for adjudicated fatal or non-fatal bleeding, 29% vs 40% for combined adjudicated bleeding and ACM, and 51% vs 63% for all investigator reported bleeding (figure 3, Panel G). Finally, multivariable binary logistic regression analysis suggested an independent association between CK and bleeding outcomes (figure 3, Panel H), with a twofold to fourfold increase in odds for bleeding (and ACM) compared with non-bleeding (and survival) per log CKmax increase, when holding the other variables constant. Heparin and aspirin dose, actively managed in patients with bleeding, did not significantly contribute to the model, with OR≈1. The C-index of the regression models was 0.69 [0.66 to 0.73] for the primary outcome (with 0.74 [0.70 to 0.78] for major bleeding); and 0.70 [0.67 to 0.74] for the secondary outcome. Building of the logistic regression models, model fit, handling missing data (including of fibrin(ogen) degradation product at 8 hours, having the highest correlation with bleeding of the haemostasis variables), and ORs of other variables included in the model are shown in the online supplementary data.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116QagTE]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) serial change criteria and assay precision — In most studies, conjoint analytical and biological variation is in the range of 50% to 60%, and this percentage has been suggested for use when initial baseline values are less than or equal to the 99th percentile URL. For individuals with an initial value greater than the 99th percentile URL, an expert consensus group has recommended serial changes > 20% be used in this situation; absolute changes are assay dependent but appear superior to relative percent changes with high-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) assays. An imprecision of ≤ 10% coefficient of variation (CV) at the 99th percentile URL is also mandatory for hs-cTn assays; assays with CVs between 10% and 20% are acceptable for clinical use, whereas assays with CVs > 20% at the 99th percentile URL should not be used. If a cTn assay is not available, the best alternative is CK-MB measured by a mass assay, and as with cTn, an increased CK-MB value is defined as a measurement above the 99th percentile URL, which is designated as the decision level for the diagnosis of MI; sex-specific CK-MB values should be employed.

### Prognostic importance of creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^113X8376]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although the prognostic significance of creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) after myocardial infarction has been established after thrombolysis or no reperfusion therapy, there is limited evidence of the prognostic importance after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

In this prospective, observational study, individual data from all patients who survived at least 2 days after primary PCI between 1991 and 2004 in our hospital were recorded. The association between enzymatic infarct size (examined by peak CK and peak CK-MB levels, each divided into tertiles) and both left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and 1-year mortality was evaluated.

Results

In the study group of 4670 patients, mean peak CK was 2327 U/L (SD 2008) and mean peak CK-MB was 244 U/L (SD 208). Both increased CK and CK-MB were associated with a lower LVEF. A total of 252 patients (5.4%) died between 2 days and 1 year after admission. Both peak CK and peak CK-MB were higher in those who died. Particularly, patients in the highest tertile of either peak CK or peak CK-MB had increased mortality, whereas the differences between the lower tertiles were not significant. In 2738 patients, after multivariable analysis including LVEF, the hazard ratio for 1-year mortality in patients in the highest CK tertile was 2.28 (95% CI 1.32–3.91) and for CK-MB, 1.91 (95% CI 1.11–3.26), compared to those in the other tertiles.

Conclusions

According to this large-scale study, peak CK and peak CK-MB are comparable independent predictors of LV function and 1-year mortality in patients after primary PCI.

### Creatine kinase during non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes is associated with major bleeding [^1173b5pA]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory studies

Total CK activity was estimated at the study centres, collected at baseline (pretreatment), during the first 3 days, at 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours, and thereafter when indicated. The upper reference limit (URL) as defined by the local laboratory was recorded. CK twice the URL was considered evidence of myocardial infarction. Platelet count was also determined at the participating centres. Fibrinogen levels and fibrin(ogen) degradation products, collected at baseline (pretreatment), and at 50 min, and at 12, 24, 48, 96 hours after rt-PA infusion, were determined in a central Coagulation Core Laboratory using standardised methods as described previously.

Main outcomes

The main outcomes of this analysis are the independent association of peak CK activity with adjudicated major bleeding (primary) and with combined adjudicated major bleeding, stroke and all-cause mortality during hospitalisation (secondary).

Sample size considerations

The probability p of events at the mean value of the CK (and other variables) was conservatively estimated to be 0.10. Based on the previous report, sample size was estimated for two levels of the OR of disease, corresponding to an increase of one SD from the mean value of CK, given the mean values of the remaining variables; at OR 1.2, with at least 634 participants needed or at OR 2.0, with at least 226 needed for this analysis with a one-tailed α of 5% and 1 − β of 90. A second consideration was to include a minimum of 10 events of the least frequent outcome per parameter to fit the model to avoid overestimated or underestimated variances.

### Elevated troponin and myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit: a prospective study [^116Mg5B6]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Interpretation of results

Analysis of troponin levels

In accordance with the US National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry draft guidelines on biomarkers of the acute coronary syndrome and heart failure, a single cutpoint at the lowest analytical value with 10% coefficient of variation was used. Using these guidelines, cardiac troponin T values above 0.04 μg/l were considered evidence of myocardial necrosis and levels of 0.04 μg/l or less were considered to represent no evidence of myocardial necrosis.

Classification of myocardial infarction

The definition of MI in the ICU was adapted from the joint ESC/ACC redefinition of acute MI. The consensus document defines MI through pathologic findings, or the presence of a typical rise and gradual fall in troponin or a more rapid rise and fall in creatine kinase-MB with one of the following: ischemic symptoms, development of pathologic Q waves on ECG, ischemic ECG changes (ST-segment elevation or depression), or a coronary artery intervention.

We made two adaptations to the proposed criteria. First, we adapted the biomarker criterion because the troponin rise can be missed in the absence of patient communication, and an elevated troponin can be discovered following the peak level and after an event has occurred. In addition, troponin can remain elevated for up to 14 days and in practice is not always remeasured to ensure that it is decreasing. Consequently, we accepted either a typical rise or a typical fall in troponin to satisfy this criterion. Second, although the summary section of the consensus document did not include imaging techniques as a criterion for diagnosing MI, it is included in the text. We introduced the presence of new or presumed new cardiac wall motion abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiography or radionuclide imaging, in combination with elevated biomarkers, to diagnose MI in the ICU. Without this additional echocardiogram criterion, physicians might miss the diagnosis of MI in patients who have suffered an MI. This may occur because ICU patients with an elevated troponin are invariably unable to communicate ischemic symptoms, and some may have an uninterpretable ECG, a chronic left bundle branch block, or infarction in a territory of the ECG that has low sensitivity for MI.

Using these a priori criteria, two investigators (IQ, DJC) were provided with all available 12-lead ECGs and troponin measurements for each patient, and echocardiogram results. With the investigators blinded to each other's assessments, patients were then independently classified as having MI or no MI during their ICU stay.

### Rapid detection of myocardial infarction with a sensitive troponin test [^112YySND]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid identification and treatment of patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) is mandatory. We studied the diagnostic capacities of a sensitive troponin assay for detection of MI in emergency department patients within 2 hours after arrival. The study included 157 patients suspected of having non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. Blood was drawn on arrival (T0) and 2 (T2), 6, and 12 hours later. At T2, a troponin concentration above the MI cutoff is 87% sensitive and 100% specific for MI detection (positive predictive value [PPV], 100%; negative predictive value [NPV], 96%). If a difference of more than 30% between the troponin measurements at T0 and T2 in the absence of an absolute troponin increase above the 99th percentile of a reference population is also considered indicative of MI, the sensitivity increases to 100% and specificity decreases to 87% (PPV, 70%; NPV, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity of creatine kinase-MB and myoglobin are lower than those of troponin. By using a sensitive troponin assay and simple algorithms, the diagnosis of MI can be determined within 2 hours after arrival at the emergency department. Measurement of myoglobin and creatine kinase-MB has no added value.

### The diagnostic and prognostic impact of the redefinition of acute myocardial infarction: lessons from the global registry of acute coronary events (GRACE) [^111xe7kW]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The impact and prognostic value of the redefinition of myocardial infarction (MI) with more sensitive markers have not been evaluated prospectively in a large, less selected population with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

We evaluated the attack and case-fatality rates of MI based on initial and/or peak creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin (the upper limit of normal [ULN] was defined according to the local hospital's standard) in a prospective observational registry of 26,267 patients with ACS admitted to 106 hospitals in 14 countries.

Results

The addition of cardiac troponin-positive status to CK status as a criterion for the diagnosis of MI resulted in as many as 1 in 4 additional patients meeting the redefined criteria. Compared with patients without elevated levels of CK and cardiac troponin, the crude odds for dying during hospitalization were significantly higher for patients with elevated troponin but not CK levels of greater than or equal to the ULN (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.6–2.9), those without CK levels > 2 times the ULN (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.2–3.5), and those with nonelevated levels of CK-MB (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4–3.2). The addition of cardiac troponin-positive status significantly increased the multivariable-adjusted odds for hospital death in patients with CK ≤ 2 times the ULN (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.1) but not for patients without elevated levels of CK or CK-MB.

Conclusions

The prognostic value of cardiac troponin, beyond that supplied by CK status or important baseline characteristics, assists in the identification of patients with ACS who are at increased risk for death.

### Macrophage migration inhibitory factor for the early prediction of infarct size [^114zGj5M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of plasma biomarkers has become central to the diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndromes and exclusion of myocardial necrosis. Specifically, the diagnostic value of troponin I or T (TnI or TnT) elevation among patients with myocardial infarction (MI) is well established. – Long‐term mortality and morbidity following MI are largely determined by infarct size, and the extent of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. – Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now the established standard of treatment for patients with ST‐elevation MI (STEMI) – to limit infarct size and mortality. Improvement in the early diagnosis of MI has the potential to critically affect global health‐service delivery. Moreover, given its prognostic impact, early accurate prediction of infarct size, currently only possible after 36 to 48 hours of STEMI with either peak or cumulative release of troponins or creatine kinase (CK) or with imaging, in patients with MI would be advantageous in tailoring prompt treatment, particularly in complex patients, or where local healthcare resources are limited.

In addition to the electrocardiogram, measurement of circulating levels of cardiac biomarkers is routinely used for the early detection of myocardial necrosis. Several biomarkers are known to increase within the first 12 hours after acute MI, including CK, troponins, and myoglobin. – Current routine laboratory troponin assay cannot definitively exclude acute MI on the basis of normal levels until at least 6 to 12 hours after symptom onset as the rise in plasma troponin can be delayed. CK and myoglobin levels have been claimed to rise earlier after the onset of MI than troponins, albeit neither are cardiac‐specific. High‐sensitive assays of troponins (hsTn) have significantly improved the sensitivity for early diagnosis of acute MI.– However, information on infarct size still requires serial measurements of biomarkers over the first 36 to 48 hours or with myocardial imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance during the first week post‐STEMI.

### The impact of glucose-insulin-potassium infusion in acute myocardial infarction on infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction [^113zBdUb]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Measurements

Enzymatic infarct size was estimated by serial measurements of the CK-MB fraction. The first measurement was taken as soon as possible after admission. Thereafter frequent CK-determinations were performed according to a schedule that called for 4 to 8 measurements in the first 96 hours. To accommodate the problem that exact predefined times for blood sampling were not always followed in practice, the actual times of sampling were recorded, expressed as minutes after the moment of randomization. To allow optimal comparison of the time courses of CK-MB levels and to best approximate the area under the CK-MB curves, we developed an algorithm. This algorithm estimated the time-course of CK-MB for each patient before calculating the patient group means. According to the known kinetics of CK-MB – a rapid rise and a much slower decrease – the following characteristic time points with accompanying time intervals were defined: 0 h (interval from 60 min before to 45 min after randomisation); 2 h (45 min to 3 h); 4 h (3 h to 5 h); 6 h (5 h to 12 h); 24 h (12 h to 36 h); 48 h (36 h to 60 h); 72 h (60 h to 84 h) and 96 h (84 h to 108 h). The algorithm interpolated the CK-MB level for each patient based on the precise times at which the measurements were performed. Next, it determined for each of the predefined intervals whether an actual measurement had been performed in that interval. If no measurement was available for a particular interval, a "not available" value was generated. This avoided inappropriately interpolated values. If one or more measurements were available for an interval, the CK-MB value for the time point with the corresponding interval was calculated from the area under the interpolated curve divided by the interval duration. CK-MB was determined enzymatically using a Hitachi 717 automatic analyzer at 30 degrees Celsius according to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommendation. High enzyme release was defined as a peak CK-MB above the 75% percentile (i.e. the highest quartile). Time to peak CK-MB was determined.

### The influence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation without defibrillation on serum levels of cardiac enzymes: a time course study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors [^112wHmeM]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The serum concentration of cardiac enzymes may be influenced by mechanical and electrical trauma due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts. This could complicate the determination of whether an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had occurred. In this study, only patients without any of the known confounding factors affecting cardiac enzyme release were included, and the specific time course and patterns of serum cardiac enzyme levels after resuscitation were evaluated. The purpose is to help clinicians distinguish between spontaneous myocardial damage and that induced by CPR.

Methods and Results

This prospective, observational study was performed in the emergency department on eight patients surviving cardiac arrest. They were selected for not having heart disease, chest trauma or septic shock; and not receiving defibrillation. The median (range) duration of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was 13 min (5–30 min). Cardiac enzyme measurements were taken immediately after ROSC and every 6h thereafter. Although cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level reached as high as 62.6 ng/ml at 24 h in one patient, five of the eight (62.5%) patients had their cTnI level fall below the normal reference range (i.e. 2 ng/ml) by 30 h. The time to maximum and peak concentration of cTnI was 16.50 ± 10.99 h and 16.85 ± 21.50 ng/ml, respectively. Both MB creatine kinase (CKMB) and total creatine kinase (CK) levels were above their normal reference ranges. In addition, the CKMB/CK ratio exceeded 5% in all patients at any time point during this study.

Conclusion

In this study, the influence of resuscitative procedures - defibrillation excluded - on the release of cardiac enzymes were examined. During 30 h after ROSC cTnI level exhibited a bell-shaped configuration, which is distinct from that after AMI; whereas the enzymatic activities of CKMB and CK, as well as CKMB/CK ratio, were constantly higher than normal. This chronological pattern of cardiac enzyme levels may help physicians differentiate primary cardiac disease from other aetiologies in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

### Comparison of troponin T to creatine kinase and to radionuclide cardiac imaging infarct size in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty [^116UBKa9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Troponin is used mainly for detection of minor myocardial damage, whereas repeated measurements of creatine kinase (CK) and myocardial band (CK-MB) are used for assessing infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to correlate peak level and area under the curve (AUC) of troponin T to that of CK and CK-MB and with single-photon emission computed tomographic infarct size and left ventricular function in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction. In this multicenter study (29 centers, 5 countries), we included 267 patients who underwent primary coronary intervention within 6 hours of onset of symptoms. All had repeated measurements of troponin T, CK, and CK-MB. Infarct size and left ventricular function were assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography performed on days 7 and 30. Mean infarct sizes were 14% on day 7 and 10% on day 30, and mean ejection fractions were 42% on day 7 and 45% on day 30 after the acute infarct. Very high correlation (r > 0.85, Spearman correlation) was found between peak level and AUC of troponin T, CK, and CK-MB. Similar high correlation was found between peak level and AUC of troponin, CK, and CK-MB with single-photon emission computed tomographic infarct size (r > 0.70). In conclusion, based on the results of this multicenter study, we suggest that peak levels and AUC of troponin are as accurate as CK and CK-MB in estimating myocardial infarct size.

### Utility of cardiac biomarkers in predicting infarct size, left ventricular function, and clinical outcome after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112Qhfpd]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the best cardiac biomarker to predict infarct size, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and clinical outcome in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

The cardiac biomarkers, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponins T and I are routinely measured after myocardial infarction. However, their correlation with functional and clinical outcomes after PCI for STEMI is not well established.

Methods

In the EVOLVE (EValuation Of MCC-135 for Left VEntricular Salvage in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, patients were randomized to receive intracellular calcium modulator as adjunct to primary PCI for first large STEMI. Cardiac biomarker levels were determined in 378 patients before PCI and serially up to 72 h. Single-photon emission computed tomography was performed after 5 and 30 days, and patients were monitored up to 180 days.

Results

All single time-point, peak, and area under time-concentration curve of CK, CK-MB, and troponins T and I after PCI significantly correlated with infarct size and LVEF. In particular, 72-h troponin I (TnI72h) correlated strongly with 5-day and 30-day infarct size (r > 0.70; p < 0.001). A TnI72h threshold > 55 ng/ml was 90% sensitive for large infarct size (≥ 10%) and low LVEF (≤ 40%) with specificities of 70% and 52%, respectively (c = 0.88, 0.81; p < 0.001). The highest TnI72h tertile was associated with increased 180-day composite clinical events (23% vs. 23% vs. 42%; p = 0.001) and independently predicted adverse events (hazard ratio = 2.3; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Assessing TnI72h after primary PCI is a simple, effective method to estimate infarct size, LVEF, and potentially useful for risk stratification.

### The introduction and clinical use of cardiac-specific troponin assays [^112GXMxZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The earliest biomarkers introduced to diagnose myocardial infarction (MI) such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) lacked cardiac specificity and were replaced by creatine kinase (CK), the CK-MB isoenzyme, and ultimately the cardiac-specific troponins (cTnT and cTnI). This has opened up the possibilities of ruling out MI more rapidly and also identifying patients with a chronic elevation of cTn and a poor prognosis in a range of cardiac conditions.

### Association between engagement in exercise training and peak cardiac biomarker concentrations following ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^116K3hJU]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relation between exercise engagement prior to MI and peak cardiac biomarker concentrations following STEMI. To evaluate infarct size, we assessed post-MI peak high-sensitive cardiac Troponin-T (hs-cTnT) and creatine kinase (CK) concentrations, which represent commonly used cardiac biomarkers as surrogate measures of infarct size in STEMI patients. Second, we explored potential differences in duration of hospitalisation and assessed in-hospital, 30-day and 6-month event rate between STEMI patients who have engaged in regular exercise training versus their non-exercise controls. We hypothesised that exercise engagement is associated with lower post-MI peak concentrations of cardiac biomarkers compared with their non-exercising peers following STEMI, which may contribute to a more beneficial clinical course, with shorter length of hospital stay and/or better clinical outcomes.

### Creatine kinase-MB elevation after percutaneous coronary intervention predicts adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^116BXr1f]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To study the relationship between outcomes and peak creatine kinase (CK)-MB levels after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS).

Methods and Results

Peak CK-MB ratios (peak CK-MB level/upper limit of normal [ULN]) after PCI were analysed in 6164 patients with NSTE ACS from four randomized trials who underwent in-hospital PCI. We excluded 696 patients with elevated CK or CK-MB levels < 24h before PCI; the primary analysis included 2384 of the remaining 5468 patients (43.6%) with CK-MB levels measured ≤ = 24h after PCI. The incidence of in-hospital heart failure (0.1%, 0.8%, 3.4%, 4.1%, and 6.1%; P < 0.001), arrhythmias (0.8%, 1.9%, 6.9%, 4.1%, and 7.9%; P < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (0.1%, 1.3%, 2.0%, 2.3%, and 2.6%; P = 0.004), and mortality through 6 months (2.1%, 2.4%, 4.9%, 4.1%, and 5.7%, P = 0.005) was increased with peak CK-MB ratios of 0–1, 1–3, 3–5, 5–10, and > 10xULN, respectively. The continuous peak CK-MB ratio after PCI significantly predicted adjusted 6-month mortality (risk ratio, 1.06 per unit increase above ULN; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.11; P = 0.017).

Conclusions

Greater CK-MB elevation after PCI is independently associated with adverse outcomes in NSTE ACS. These results underscore the adverse implications of elevated CK-MB levels after PCI in this high-risk population.

### Circadian variations of infarct size in acute myocardial infarction [^1165EfWa]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The circadian clock influences a number of cardiovascular (patho)physiological processes including the incidence of acute myocardial infarction. A circadian variation in infarct size has recently been shown in rodents, but there is no clinical evidence of this finding.

Objective

To determine the impact of time-of-day onset of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on infarct size.

Methods

A retrospective single-centre analysis of 811 patients with STEMI admitted between 2003 and 2009 was performed. Infarct size was estimated by peak enzyme release. The relationship between peak enzyme concentrations and time-of-day were characterised using multivariate regression splines. Time of STEMI onset was divided into four 6-hour periods in phase with circadian rhythms.

Results

Model comparisons based on likelihood ratio tests showed a circadian variation in infarct size across time-of-day as evaluated by peak creatine kinase (CK) and troponin-I (TnI) concentrations (p = 0.015 and p = 0.012, respectively). CK and TnI curves described similar patterns across time, with a global maximum in the 6:00-noon period and a local minimum in the noon-18:00 period. Infarct size was largest in patients with STEMI onset in the dark-to-light transition period (6:00-noon), with an increase in peak CK and TnI concentrations of 18.3% (p = 0.031) and 24.6% (p = 0.033), respectively, compared with onset of STEMI in the 18:00-midnight period. Patients with anterior wall STEMI also had significantly larger infarcts than those with STEMI in other locations.

Conclusions

Significant circadian oscillations in infarct size were found in patients according to time-of-day of STEMI onset. The infarct size was found to be significantly larger with STEMI onset in the dark-to-light transition period (6:00-noon). If confirmed, these results may have a significant impact on the interpretation of clinical trials of cardioprotective strategies in STEMI.

### Minor myocardial damage and prognosis: are spontaneous and percutaneous coronary intervention-related events different? [^112p7oiM]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The relevance of the adverse prognostic implications of CK-MB elevation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains controversial. Therefore, we compared the relationship between the level of postprocedural CK-MB elevation and 6-month mortality in patients undergoing PCI with the relationship between the level of spontaneous, non-PCI-related CK-MB elevation and 6-month mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) treated medically.

Methods and Results

In the PURSUIT trial, 5583 of 9461 patients who presented with a non-ST-elevation ACS did not undergo PCI or CABG and had at least 1 CK-MB sample collected during index-hospitalization. There was a gradual increase in 6-month mortality with higher CK-MB levels: 4.1%, 8.6%, 9.0%, 14.3%, 15.5% for CK-MB ratios 0 to 1, > 1 to 3, > 3 to 5, > 5 to 10, and > 10 times the upper limit of normal. A combined analysis in 8838 patients undergoing PCI in 5 large, clinical trials revealed a proportional relationship between postprocedural CK-MB levels (≤ 48 hours after PCI) and 6-month mortality. In patients with CK-MB ratios 0 to 1, > 1 to 3, > 3 to 5, > 5 to 10, and > 10, the risk of death was 1.3%, 2.0%, 2.3%, 4.3%, and 7.4%, respectively. The absolute mortality rates were lower after procedure-related infarcts compared with spontaneous infarcts. Yet, the relative increase in 6-month mortality with each increase in peak CK-MB level was similar for PCI-related myocardial necrosis and spontaneous myocardial necrosis, as all tests for heterogeneity of the odds ratios were nonsignificant.

Conclusions

The present analysis indicates that the adverse prognostic implications of periprocedural myocardial necrosis should be considered similar to the adverse consequences of spontaneous myocardial necrosis.

### Does creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme elevation following percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents impact late clinical outcome? [^1138BvVd]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of postprocedural creatine kinase (CK)-MB elevation to > 3x the upper limit of normal after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been reported at rates of up to 18% in the bare metal stent era and is correlated with higher adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This study examined the incidence and prognostic significance of CK-MB elevations after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation.

Methods

The records of 2,537 patients who underwent DES implantation and completed ≥ 6 months' follow-up were evaluated. Patients with acute myocardial infarction and those who presented in cardiogenic shock and had elevated cardiac enzymes at baseline were excluded from the analysis. Of these, 179 patients (7.1%) had ≥ 3x postprocedural CK-MB and 2,358 patients had < 3x CK-MB elevation. The composite end point of target vessel revascularization-major adverse cardiac events (TVR-MACE) at 6 months was compared between groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of adverse cardiac outcomes.

Results

The patients with CK-MB ≥ 3x elevation had a higher number of diseased vessels (2.15 ± 0.86 vs. 1.81 ± 0.87; P < 0.001), higher prevalence of type C lesions (29.9% vs. 17.7%; P < 0.001), received a higher average number of stents, and total stented length (1.72 ± 0.89 vs. 1.49 ± 0.83; P < 0.001 and 37.4 ± 23.0 mm vs. 30.8 ± 20.7 mm; P = 0.0003, respectively), and had lower rates of clinical success (91.9% vs. 99.2%; P < 0.001). The 6-month and 1-year TVR-MACE rates were higher for the elevated CK-MB group (11.9% vs. 7.0%; P = 0.02 and 16.1% vs. 26.6%, respectively; P = 0.005). The rates of subacute thrombosis were also significantly higher in the group with elevated CK-MB (0.4% vs. 3.2%, P < 0.001). Though significant CK-MB release was a predictor of TVR-MACE after univariate analysis, multivessel PCI, subacute stent thrombosis, total stented length, and history of prior PCI were the only predictors after multivariate regression analysis.

Conclusions

Postprocedural CK-MB ≥ 3x elevation following PCI with DES continues to be a marker for the complexity of coronary disease and lack of clinical success; and correlates with higher rates of subacute thrombosis as well as late adverse events at 6-months and 1-year postprocedure.

### Circadian variations of ischemic burden among patients with myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^114xnVEa]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Several parameters of cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology exhibit circadian rhythms. Recently, a relation between infarct size and the time of day at which it occurs has been suggested in experimental models of myocardial infarction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether circadian rhythms could cause differences in ischemic burden in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).

Methods

In 353 consecutive patients with STEMI treated by PPCI, time of symptom onset, peak creatine kinase (CK), and follow-up at 30 days were obtained. We divided 24 hours into 4 time groups based on time of symptom onset (00:00–05:59, 06:00–11:59, 12:00–17:59, and 18:00–23:59).

Results

There was no difference between the groups regarding baseline patients and management's characteristics. At multivariable analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between peak CK levels among patients with symptom onset between 00:00 and 05:59 when compared with peak CK levels of patients with symptom onset in any other time group (mean increase 38.4%, P < .05). Thirty-day mortality for STEMI patients with symptom onset occurring between 00:00 and 05:59 was significantly higher than any other time group (P < .05).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates an independent correlation between the infarct size of STEMI patients treated by PPCI and the time of the day at which symptoms occurred. These results suggest that time of the day should be a critical issue to look at when assessing prognosis of patients with myocardial infarction.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^117JB7vv]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Data source

TIMI 2 was a multicentre trial conducted in 24 clinical centres across the USA. The design and results of this trial, which had been completed in 1990, have been described previously. In brief, the study included 3534 patients, all treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, California, USA) within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain, thought to be caused by ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Included patients were randomised to either an invasive strategy of cardiac catheterisation, and when anatomically appropriate, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); versus a conservative strategy, where these procedures were only performed in response to spontaneous recurrent or exercise-induced ischaemia. The TIMI 2 trial consisted of two major substudies combined into a main study (figure 2). The TIMI 2A study was designed to compare immediate and delayed invasive strategies, and TIMI 2B to compare immediate versus delayed beta-blocker therapy. The main study (n = 3339) compared the invasive (n = 1681) versus the conservative strategy (n = 1658). The primary outcome was non-fatal MI (as defined by CK increase and/or ECG abnormalities) or death within 6 weeks after study entry. Major inclusion criteria were age < 76 years, symptoms of ischaemic chest pain of > 30 min duration and treatment possible within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. Exclusion criteria included past or present bleeding disorder, significant intestinal bleeding, any recording of blood pressure exceeding 180 mm Hg systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic during the presenting illness prior to randomisation, any history of cerebrovascular disease or transient ischaemic attack, oral anticoagulation therapy, advanced illness including malignancies, hepatic or renal disorders, or use of thrombolytic therapy for MI in 2 weeks before admission. During the trial, the initial dose of rt-PA of 150 mg was lowered to 100 mg after the first 520 patients, because of a relatively high number of intracerebral haemorrhages (2.1%), as judged by the Hemorrhagic Event Review Committee (HERC). Also, the exclusion criteria, such as history of hypertension and history of neurologic disease, were made more stringent. Adjunctive therapy included intravenous heparin and aspirin in all patients. Heparin was given as a 5000-unit United States Pharmacopeia bolus within 1 hour of the start of the rt-PA infusion, followed by an infusion of 1000 units per hour during 4 days guided by the activated partial thromboplastin time. Heparin was given subcutaneously, 10 000 units every 12 hours, from day 5 until hospital discharge. Aspirin dose was initially 80 mg/day starting on the same day as thrombolytic therapy, but in response to the unexpected number of intracranial haemorrhages aspirin therapy was started the day after initiation of thrombolytic therapy. The aspirin dose was increased to 325 mg/day on day 6.

### Don't test for myoglobin or creatine kinase MB in… [^111PHGW3]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Unlike creatine kinase MB and myoglobin, the release of troponin I or T is specific to cardiac injury. Troponin is released before creatine kinase MB and appears in the blood as early as, if not earlier than, myoglobin after acute myocardial infarction. Approximately 30% of patients experiencing chest discomfort at rest with a normal creatine kinase MB will be diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction when evaluated using troponins. Single-point troponin measurements equate to infarct size for the determination of the acute myocardial infarction severity. Accordingly, there is much support for relying solely on troponin and discontinuing the use of creatine kinase MB and other markers.

### Cardiac enzyme elevation after coronary revascularization [^115265S6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

CK-MB elevation post-PCI correlates with procedural complications, diffuse atherosclerosis, and adverse long-term prognosis. Troponin elevation has an earlier pattern of rise than CK-MB and can be used as a surrogate. High sensitivity troponin can enable ruling out enzymatic elevation very early after PCI and facilitate discharge timing.

### Comparison between strategies using creatine kinase-MB (mass), myoglobin, and troponin T in the early detection or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction in patients with chest pain and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram [^114degPG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Different strategies using creatine kinase-MB(mass), myoglobin, and troponin T were compared in 738 patients admitted because of chest pain and an electrocardiogram not diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction. We conclude that a combination of creatine kinase-MB and troponin T during the first 6 hours enables early detection or exclusion of acute myocardial infarction in this population.

### Troponin T concentrations 72 hours after myocardial infarction as a serological estimate of infarct size [^1124HRPp]. Heart (2002). Low credibility.

Background

After acute myocardial infarction, the structural protein T is released considerably longer than cytosolic creatine kinase (CK), CK MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and late troponin T release (> 48 hours after onset of chest pain) appears to be less affected by early coronary reperfusion.

Objective

To investigate the precision of a single measurement of circulating troponin T concentrations 72 hours after onset of chest pain compared with standard scintigraphic and enzymatic estimates of myocardial infarct size.

Methods

Quantitative single photon emission computed tomography thallium-201 scintigraphy at rest was performed in 37 patients 2–3 weeks after myocardial infarction (group 1: 14 patients without early coronary reperfusion; group 2: 23 patients with early reperfusion achieved by thrombolytic therapy, by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or by both).

Results

In both groups, the number of myocardial segments with abnormal thallium-201 uptake indicating the individual extent of irreversible myocardial damage correlated significantly with the troponin T concentrations 72 hours after infarction as well as with peak concentrations of CK, CK-MB, and LDH.

Conclusion

The data show that a single measurement of circulating troponin T 72 hours after onset of chest pain — independent of reperfusion — is superior for the estimation of myocardial infarct size to measurement of peak CK, CK-MB, or LDH, which require serial determinations and depend on coronary reperfusion.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116apXZp]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) interpretation — acute versus chronic myocardial injury requires dynamic changes; the "clinical specificity and positive predictive value of such 1–2 hour sampling approaches for ruling in MI are limited", and "the demonstration of a rising and/or falling pattern is needed to distinguish acute injury from chronic conditions" that can cause chronically elevated cTn. Chronic structural heart disease states such as renal failure or left ventricular hypertrophy can show elevations that "can be marked but do not change acutely during serial sampling", and late presenters may show a slow downslope in which "detecting a changing pattern over short periods of time may be difficult". Persistently elevated values can last, since "cTn values may remain above the 99th percentile URL for a longer period of time", and "an increased cTn value above the 99th percentile URL, with or without a dynamic change of values, or in the absence of clinical evidence of ischemia, should prompt a search for other diagnoses associated with myocardial injury".

Isolated elevations in creatine kinase-MB fraction and mortality post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery

A large number of early studies have assessed the prognostic significance of isolated elevations in CK-MB following CABG surgery in the absence of ECG/angiographic or other imaging evidence of MI (Table 3 and Figure 1). These studies have demonstrated a graded increase in short, medium, and long-term mortality beginning with an isolated CK-MB elevation ≥ 3× URL within 24 h of CABG surgery. Above isolated 10× URL elevations, there appears to be a progressive increase in short-term (30 days) and longer-term mortality (1 year and over), which is independent of other evidence of MI. In most centres, CK-MB has now been replaced by the use of cardiac troponins, as the latter are more sensitive and specific for detecting PMI and Type 5 MI following CABG surgery. Hence, we have elected to not use isolated CK-MB elevations post-surgery to define prognostically significant PMI.

### Delta creatine kinase-MB outperforms myoglobin at two hours during the emergency department identification and exclusion of troponin positive non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112fpkHj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Limited information is available about the diagnostic performance of creatine kinase (CK)-MB and myoglobin levels during the early evaluation of chest pain patients using cardiac troponins as the criterion standard for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. In this study, we compare the sensitivity and specificity of the baseline, 2-hour absolute, and 2-hour delta values of myoglobin and CK-MB mass assay for detection of acute myocardial infarction using cardiac troponin I (troponin) as the sole marker of myocardial necrosis.

Methods

A prospective observational study was conducted of 975 chest pain patients with a baseline troponin level of 1.0 ng/mL or less (Abbott Axsym Assay) and an initial ECG nondiagnostic for injury. CK-MB, myoglobin, and troponin levels were all measured on the Abbott Axsym immunoassay. Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed if there was at least 20 minutes of chest pain and any one of the following criteria within 24 hours of ED presentation: a serial increase in troponin to more than 1.0 ng/mL, new Q-wave formation in 2 contiguous leads, or patient death by cardiac or unknown cause. The optimal values of CK-MB and myoglobin were chosen at the most accurate value on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (ie, value with lowest false-negative and false-positive rate) of the 2-hour absolute and 2-hour delta value for predicting acute myocardial infarction.

Results

Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 44 (4.5%) of the 975 study patients. ROC curve analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in areas for myoglobin and CK-MB values at baseline and 2 hours for determination of acute myocardial infarction. However, the ROC curve area of the delta CK-MB level significantly outperformed the ROC curve area of the delta myoglobin level for early identification of acute myocardial infarction (0.97 versus 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference between areas 0.09 to 0.24). At the most accurate cutoff value, a 2-hour delta CK-MB level more than 0.7 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 93.2% (95% CI 81.3% to 98.5%), a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 92.7% to 95.8%), a positive likelihood ratio of 16.7, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07.

Conclusion

A 2-hour delta CK-MB level outperforms myoglobin level in the early identification and exclusion of acute myocardial infarction in non-ST-segment elevation chest pain patients. This finding suggests that myoglobin may no longer be the optimal early marker of acute myocardial infarction when troponins are used as the criterion standard.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cardiac troponin, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain additional testing after 3 hours if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.

Post‑PCI biomarker elevations and mortality associations — Among 7,147 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at Washington Hospital Center, 37.3% had a post‑PCI creatine kinase‑MB (CK‑MB) > ULN, but only Q‑wave MI or non‑Q‑wave MI with a peak CK‑MB > 8x ULN correlated with increased 2‑year mortality; among 3,478 patients undergoing stent implantation at the Cleveland Clinic, post‑PCI CK‑MB > ULN was seen in 24% and only CK‑MB > 10x ULN was significantly associated with increased 1‑year mortality; in the EVENT registry (n = 6,347), only CK‑MB > 50 mg/ml (~10x ULN) was associated with increased 30‑day and 1‑year mortality after nonemergent PCI; in the 3,687 patient SPIRIT IV trial, CK‑MB > 3x ULN and cardiac troponin (cTn) > 3x ULN were present in 5.4% and 19.7% of stented patients, respectively, with no relationship between any level of either biomarker and 2‑year mortality, even > 10x ULN; and among 5,647 patients with acute coronary syndromes in whom PCI was performed from three randomized trials, there was no relationship between protocol‑defined MI and 5‑year mortality.

Biochemical approach for diagnosing myocardial injury and infarction — Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are the preferred biomarkers recommended to both rule-in and rule-out myocardial injury, and thus to define MI and each specific subtype of MI. Detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values is essential and a key early component along with other clinical elements to establish the diagnosis of acute MI. Criteria for determining a pathological rise between 2 serial cTn values are assay-dependent and continue to evolve.

SCAI consensus — harmonized biomarker thresholds for clinically relevant myocardial infarction (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are outlined as follows: "The rationale for requiring a ≥ 10x increase in cardiac biomarkers for CABG versus ≥ 5x increase for PCI as recommended in the 2012 universal definition is not clearly substantiated", yet "as a working definition we support this threshold to diagnose a clinically relevant MI post CABG". The document states that "CK-MB is the preferred biomarker, and a cTn threshold must be used; > 20x is reasonable", and that thresholds after PCI and CABG are "harmonized (Table I)", while the use of post-CABG ECGs and imaging "is not currently recommended as part of this definition" but "have been suggested to complement biomarker elevations post-CABG to improve specificity".

### Serum creatine kinase in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction… [^112cZgZx]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To document optimal sampling frequency, we reviewed creatine kinase myocardial specific isoenzyme results in 314 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. In 127 patients with elevated CK/CKMB, peak CK observed using all samples was compared with results that would have been obtained had samples been taken on admission and either twice daily or once daily. Although average peak CK was statistically different, major underestimation of peak CK was uncommon using the Q12hr method, suggesting that Q12hr sampling is a practical, cost-effective approach for patients with suspected acute MI.

### Creatine kinase-MB elevation after stroke is not cardiac in origin: comparison with troponin T levels [^117YA2Uc]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) increases in some patients with stroke, with no clear evidence of an acute coronary syndrome. Its elevations have been suggested to represent a biological marker for stroke-related myocardial injury. Troponin T has superior sensitivity and specificity to CK-MB in revealing minor myocardial injury. Therefore, we studied troponin T levels after stroke to determine whether troponin T increases in parallel to CK-MB.

Methods

We made daily measurements of CK-MB, myoglobin, total creatine kinase (total CK), and troponin T levels up to day 5 in 32 patients with large hemispheric infarction and with no history of coronary heart disease. The daily enzyme levels were compared with those of a control group of 22 patients with neurological diseases other than stroke.

Results

Serum CK-MB, myoglobin, and total CK levels were elevated above the cutoff value in 11, 26, and 20 patients with stroke, respectively. These enzyme levels gradually increased within the first 3 days and declined afterward. Troponin T did not exceed the reference range in any patients. One patient had elevated myoglobin and 3 had elevated total CK in the control group. The difference between groups was significant for CK-MB, myoglobin, and total CK at various time points.

Conclusions

Troponin T, a more specific biochemical marker of myocardial injury, does not increase after stroke. Normal troponin T along with elevated CK-MB signifies that CK-MB is not the biological marker for myocytolysis. CK-MB elevations in stroke patients are likely to be noncardiac in origin.

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^115wSy3Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Pre-procedure cardiac troponin (cTn) before PCI — prognostic implications and baseline assessment: Prior studies reported that only pre-procedure cTn elevations are correlated with subsequent mortality. In an analysis of 5,487 patients undergoing nonemergent PCI, an abnormal pre-PCI cTnI level independently predicted death (median follow-up of 28 months), but PCI-related myonecrosis did not whether defined by > 3x elevation in cTn or creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). In a separate study, baseline cTn was > ULN in 6.0% of 2,382 patients undergoing elective PCI and was an independent predictor of in-hospital death or myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, interpretation of post-PCI biomarker elevations may be erroneous if baseline levels are not assessed, and the accurate diagnosis of post-PCI MI is challenging among patients with baseline biomarker elevations. The 2012 task force suggests that "If the baseline cTn values are elevated and are stable or falling, then a rise of > 20% is required for the diagnosis of a type 4a MI, as with re-infarction". These recommendations were based on recent data from TRITON-TIMI 38, and the prognostic relevance of post-PCI biomarker markers in the patient with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been sufficiently validated to be applied clinically.

### Creatine kinase during non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes is associated with major bleeding [^113wUcWR]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

It was recently reported that highly elevated plasma activity of the ADP-scavenging enzyme creatine kinase (CK), to > 10 times the upper reference limit (URL), is independently associated with fatal or non-fatal bleeding during treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR 2.6 (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.7)/log CK increase). Evidence indicates that CK attenuates ADP-dependent platelet aggregation. This study investigates whether moderately elevated CK in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is associated with major bleeding.

Methods

The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) 3B trial compared recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (35–80 mg) with placebo and early catheterisation with conservative management in patients with NSTE-ACS. Main outcomes of the current study are the independent association of peak plasma CK (CKmax) with adjudicated fatal or non-fatal major bleeding (primary) and with combined major bleeding, stroke and hospital death (secondary), with covariables including age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, creatinine and assignment to add-on rt-PA versus placebo. Discrimination was assessed with C-statistics.

Results

The study included 1473 patients (66% men, 80% white, mean age 59 years, SE 0.3). CKmax ranged between 15 and 19 045 IU/L (mean (SE), 450 (24) IU/L; two times URL). Major bleeding occurred in 2.0% (mean age 65 (1.3) years; mean CKmax 1015 (319) IU/L; six times URL), and the combined outcome in 4.3% of the patients, adjusted OR per log CK increase, respectively, 3.1 (1.6 to 5.9) for major bleeding and 3.9 (2.5 to 6.1) for the combined outcome; C-index 0.8 for both outcomes. The association between CK and bleeding was independent of the use of thrombolytic therapy.

Discussion

The presented data add to the existing evidence that proportionate to its plasma activity, the ADP-binding enzyme CK is strongly and independently associated with non-fatal and fatal major bleeding during treatment for NSTE-ACS. CK might increase the accuracy of prediction models for major bleeding in patients with NSTE-ACS.

### Two-year outcome after early or late intervention in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^1132mCtb]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

The design and the results at 30-day follow-up of the ELISA-3 trial have been published previously. In short, patients were eligible if they were hospitalised with ischaemic chest pain or dyspnoea at rest and had at least 2 out of 3 of the following high-risk characteristics: (1) evidence of extensive myocardial ischaemia on ECG (shown by new cumulative ST depression > 5 mm or temporary ST segment elevation in two contiguous leads < 30 min), (2) elevated biomarkers (troponin T > 0.10 µg/L or myoglobin > 150 µg/L) or elevated creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB) fraction (> 6% of total creatine kinase (CK)) and (3) age above 65 years. Randomisation had to take place within 24 hours of the last episode of ischaemic symptoms. Exclusion criteria were persistent ST segment elevation, symptoms of ongoing myocardial ischaemia despite optimal medical therapy, contraindication for diagnostic angiography, active bleeding, cardiogenic shock, acute posterior infarction and life expectancy less than 1 year. Patients were 1:1 randomly assigned by a web-based randomisation system to an early treatment strategy (angiography and subsequent revascularisation as soon as possible but within 12 hours of randomisation) or a delayed treatment strategy (no sooner than 48 hours after randomisation). The primary endpoint was the combined incidence of death, reinfarction and/or recurrent ischaemia at 30-day follow-up. Follow-up for 2 years after the index event for incidence of mortality or reinfarction was pre-specified in the protocol. Patients were contacted by telephone to collect information about vital status and potential endpoints. If patients could not be contacted by telephone, their relatives or general practitioner was contacted to obtain information. In case of re-hospitalisation, hospital records were reviewed.

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^1124EKbR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Clinically relevant myocardial infarction (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with normal baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) and without an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is diagnosed by a new biomarker elevation of creatine kinase‑MB (CK‑MB) to ≥ 10× ULN or cTn (I or T) to ≥ 70× ULN, or by CK‑MB to ≥ 5× ULN or cTn to ≥ 35× ULN plus the development of new pathologic Q‑waves in ≥ 2 contiguous leads or LBBB. A clinically relevant MI occurring in the post‑PCI period should be defined as CK‑MB ≥ 10× ULN, a lower threshold (≥ 5× ULN) may be accepted when new pathologic Q‑waves in ≥ 2 contiguous leads or new persistent LBBB develop, and a threshold post‑PCI cTn level that affects long‑term prognosis has not been established; thus CK‑MB is strongly preferred. If CK‑MB levels are unavailable, a reasonable cTn (I or T) value to substitute to diagnose a type 4a MI would be cTn ≥ 70× ULN based on a 7:1 troponin:CK‑MB ratio.

### Infarct size, shock, and heart failure: does reperfusion strategy matter in early presenting patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction? [^113495Ak]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Infarct Size Estimation

Cardiac biomarkers were collected at baseline, 8 to 12 and 24 ± 4 hours after randomization. Using peak biomarkers (selected in the following order: creatinine kinase-MB isoenzyme, creatinine kinase if CK-MB was not available), we recategorized patients into 3 groups according to IS: small infarct (≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal), medium infarct (> 2 and ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal), and large infarct (> 5 times the upper limit of normal). Small infarcts also conformed to the biomarker definition of an aborted myocardial infarction (MI; a prespecified endpoint in STREAM).

Patients with minimal or no rise in cardiac biomarkers and without evolutionary changes between their qualifying and discharge ECGs were classified as infarct masquerade and excluded from the analysis (n = 45), as reported previously.

The Sylvester 54-criteria/32-point QRS scoring system, a validated ECG estimate of IS, was also measured at the time of hospital discharge. All ECGs were evaluated at the Canadian VIGOUR Centre ECG core laboratory in Edmonton, Canada, and each discharge ECG was manually scored according to the QRS scoring system. Each point in this system represents ≈3% of the left ventricle, and patients were categorized in 3 groups as QRS score ≤ 3 (small infarct, < 10% myocardium), 4 to 7 (medium infarct, 10% to 20% myocardium), and ≥ 8 (large infarct, > 20% myocardium), as described previously. Data on QRS infarct score and outcome were available for 1273 of 1701 (74.8%) patients.

TIMI 2 patients were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain thought to be caused by MI, before randomisation to an invasive strategy (cardiac catheterisation, and when anatomically appropriate, PTCA or CABG within 24 to 48 hours after infarction) or conservative strategy (with invasive procedures only in response to the occurrence of spontaneous or provoked ischaemia). The trial included 3534 patients in three subsets: (1) TIMI 2 main study (large square, n = 3339) in which patients were randomised between a delayed invasive strategy (n = 1681) and a conservative strategy groups (n = 1658); (2) TIMI 2A substudy n = 586), overlapping with the main study but also including an immediate invasive strategy treatment group; and (3) the beta-blocker substudy (n = 1434), a component of main study in which eligible patients were further randomised between immediate and delayed 3-blocker therapy;*excluding n = 195 immediate invasive treatment; †including participants with PTCA on day 7 (n = 197).

### Timing of peak troponin T and creatine kinase-MB elevations after percutaneous coronary intervention [^1125B3sE]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The prognostic significance of elevations in creatine kinase-MB and troponin T (cTnT), which have been conventionally measured 6 to 8 h after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), has been established. However, the time to peak biomarker appearance in the circulation has not been defined and is the purpose of this pilot study.

Design

Nonrandomized, nonconsecutive patient cohort.

Setting

Clinical practice, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Patients

Cohort (n = 57) undergoing elective PCI.

Interventions

cTnT and creatine kinase (CK)-MB measured at baseline, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and ≥ 2 h (mean ± SEM, 18 ± 5 h) after PCI.

Measurements and Results

Postprocedure cTnT elevations were detected in 30 of 57 patients (53%). Of these, 4 of 30 patients (13%) had peak cTnT at 4 h (0.80 ± 0.40 ng/mL), 5 of 30 patients (17%) had peak cTnT at 8 h (1.07 ± 0.48 ng/mL), and 21 of 30 patients (70%) had peak cTnT at ≥ 12 h (0.21 ± 0.06 ng/mL); 22 of 30 patients received abciximab. Elevations in CK-MB occurred in 14 of 57 patients (25%). Of these, 3 of 14 patients (21%) demonstrated peak CK-MB at 2 h (18.5 ± 7.9 ng/mL) and the remainder (11 of 14 patients, 79%) during the 12- to 20-h interval (20.2 ± 4.4 ng/mL); 12 of 14 patients received abciximab.

Conclusion

More cTnT than CK-MB elevations occur after PCI; however, both biomarkers demonstrate a longer time to peak value than anticipated in clinical practice. Early surveillance monitoring (< 12 h) does not detect peak biomarker levels, especially in patients with normal baseline values. If peak levels are to be used to determine prognosis, then longer time intervals should be used for post-PCI surveillance. The timing of peak elevations appears to be influenced by baselines values as well. Early elevations may reflect the conjoint effects of injury associated with the disease process and the intervention itself. These data suggest that a re-evaluation of surveillance monitoring to account for the variability reported and the influence of baseline elevations of biomarkers may improve the prognostic power of the measurements.

### Association between engagement in exercise training and peak cardiac biomarker concentrations following ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^111BAhxQ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Regular exercise training is an important factor in prevention of myocardial infarction (MI). However, little is known whether exercise engagement prior to MI is related to the magnitude of post-MI cardiac biomarker concentrations and clinical outcomes.

Objectives

We tested the hypothesis that exercise engagement in the week prior MI is related to lower cardiac biomarker concentrations following ST-elevated MI (STEMI).

Methods

We recruited hospitalised STEMI patients and assessed the amount of exercise engagement in the 7 days preceding MI onset using a validated questionnaire. Patients were classified as 'exercise' if they performed any vigorous exercise in the week prior MI, or as 'control' if they did not. Post-MI peak concentrations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (peak-hs-cTnT) and creatine kinase (peak-CK) were examined. We also explored whether exercise engagement prior MI is related to the clinical course (duration of hospitalisation and incidence of in-hospital, 30-day and 6-month major adverse cardiac events (reinfarction, target vessel revascularisation, cardiogenic shock or death)).

Results

In total, 98 STEMI patients were included, of which 16% (n = 16) was classified as 'exercise', and 84% (n = 82) as 'control'. Post-MI peak-hs-cTnT and peak-CK concentrations were lower in the exercise group (941 (645–2925) ng/mL; 477 (346–1402) U/L, respectively) compared with controls (3136 (1553–4969) ng/mL, p = 0.010; 1055 (596–2019) U/L, p = 0.016, respectively). During follow-up, no significant differences were found between both groups.

Conclusion

Engagement in exercise is associated with lower cardiac biomarker peak concentrations following STEMI. These data could provide further support for the cardiovascular health benefits of exercise training.

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^112cZpdd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) expert consensus — For myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary revascularization, the universal definition designates post procedural biomarker thresholds for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-related MI (type 4a) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related MI (type 5), but these are described as of uncertain prognostic importance, and for both types troponin is recommended as the biomarker of choice though its prognostic significance is less well validated than CK-MB. The document cautions that widespread adoption of a MI definition not clearly related to subsequent adverse events may have serious consequences for device/therapy assessment, clinical care pathways, and interpretation of physician competence. Rather than employing a MI definition sensitive for small degrees of myonecrosis, it is instead recommended that a threshold level of biomarker elevation strongly linked to subsequent adverse events in clinical studies be used to define a "clinically relevant MI".

### The influence of system delay on 30-day and on long-term mortality in patients with anterior versus non-anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a cohort study [^115eTggP]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

First, the time of diagnosis was used together with the time of reperfusion therapy as a proxy for system delay. Information on the time of FMC was not available for all patients. However, a random sample of 94 cases revealed that in 83% of these patients, the difference between FMC (ie, EMS call) and diagnosis was ≤ 10 min. Second, since the project was not randomised and dispersed over several years, the risk of unknown confounders exists. Third, the level of peak CK within 24 h was used as surrogate parameter for infarct size.

### Cardiac ischemia in patients with septic shock randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine [^113uxErz]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Troponin, CK, and CK-MB levels

Troponin elevation was common, occurring in 26%, 36%, 32%, and 21% of patients at baseline, 6 hours, day 2, and day 4, respectively. No differences were seen in baseline characteristics, organ failures, or mortality between patients with normal, weakly positive, or highly positive troponin levels, except that patients with weakly or highly positive troponin had a higher incidence of underlying ischemic heart disease (Table 3, and Table 7, Additional file). In addition, the rates of acute myocardial infarction, diagnosed by local site investigators, were higher in the patients with elevated troponin (Table 3).

Table 3
Baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without elevations in serum troponin

Among 120 patients, the baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with or without elevated serum troponin. Age is presented as median and first and third quartiles. APACHE II is presented as mean and standard deviation. P value is based on the Fisher Exact test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. a One patient had no troponin data. b See Table 1 for definitions of weakly positive and highly positive troponin levels. Patients were categorized based on ever having highly positive or weakly positive troponin. c MI, myocardial infarction. At each site, the local investigator independently assessed in real time whether the patient met clinical criteria for myocardial infarction. d Outcome of one patient in the vasopressin group was unknown and excluded from the calculation.

Five patients (two in the vasopressin group, three in the norepinephrine group) had acute myocardial infarction diagnosed clinically, using symptoms, ECGs, and serum cardiac biomarkers. No significant differences were seen in troponin, CK, and CK-MB levels in patients randomized to vasopressin versus norepinephrine at any of the times (Table 4). Further, the percentages of patients with weakly positive troponin (27.6% versus 22.7%) and highly positive troponin (13.8% versus 15.2%) were similar between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups, respectively.

### The sensitivity of cardiac markers stratified by symptom duration [^112cBpgy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We compared the sensitivity of three commonly used cardiac markers between two subpopulations, those who came to the Emergency Department (ED) late (6–24 h) after their symptoms began, and those who arrived earlier (< 6 h), in a prospective comparative trial. Among all adult patients who presented to our ED with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (MI), we drew serum for myoglobin, CK-MB, and troponin I upon arrival (time 0) and 2 h later. Outcomes, including acute MI, were determined. Sensitivities for all three markers between the subpopulations who arrived fewer than 6 h from symptom onset were compared to those who arrived later (6–24 h). We enrolled 346 eligible subjects, 36% of whom described cardiac symptoms as beginning 6 or more hours earlier; 14% suffered acute MIs. For time 0, the sensitivity of all three markers for acute MI was significantly higher among those subjects with symptoms of 6 or more hours' duration as compared to those with less. For troponin I, the increase in sensitivity between these two subpopulations approached 300%. At the time of the 2-h sample, the differences in sensitivities were much less and were not statistically significant. We conclude that cardiac marker values obtained at time 0 among Emergency Department patients who arrive 6 or more hours after cardiac symptom onset provide significantly higher sensitivities as compared to those obtained in patients who arrive earlier. For troponin I, the increase in sensitivity approaches threefold.

### Reducing redundant creatine kinase testing in cardiac injury [^11613SSj]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated CK testing in the setting of cardiac injury and implemented quality improvement interventions to reduce unnecessary testing. Our initiative led to a statistically significant reduction in total and coupled CK tests, and a decrease in CK-to-troponin ratio from 0.91 to 0.49. Reductions were observed across all clinical units and sustained over additional months, reflecting a stable change in CK ordering at our institution. Our interventions did not target troponin testing and, as expected, it did not significantly change during our study period. A diverse change team and targeted outreach to departments with high-volume testing allowed us to achieve substantial reductions in areas with the greatest potential impact. The use of behavioural defaults, informational nudges and reference point changes were key influences in changing ordering behaviour without explicit prohibitions that may restrict clinical flexibility. To our knowledge, our study is the first of its kind in Canada targeting cardiac biomarker testing, the first to evaluate the CK in this context and could potentially layout a roadmap for similar improvements at other institutions.

Several major cardiac care centres elsewhere have reported similar quality improvement initiatives to eliminate routine CK-MB testing in cardiac injury. Larochelle et al. developed revised institutional guidelines and removed CK-MB from computerised order sets. They observed a 66% reduction in CK-MB testing, US$1.25 million in cost savings and no change in incidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at 1 year follow-up. Ducatman et al. used time-sequenced interventions to reduce CK-MB testing which lead to improved guideline compliance from 32% to 58%. They additionally found that CK-MB testing failed to detect additional myocardial infarctions and lead to 42 preventable admissions later found not to be myocardial infarctions. Other authors have implemented similar protocols to reduce CK-MB testing to achieve sustained reductions of 80%–95% and considerable cost savings. Our study adapted several practices from these protocols for our institution.

### Trends in incidence, severity, and outcome of hospitalized myocardial infarction [^115L9isq]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In 2000, the definition of myocardial infarction (MI) changed to rely on troponin rather than creatine kinase (CK) and its MB fraction (CK-MB). The implications of this change on trends in MI incidence and outcome are not defined.

Methods and Results

This was a community study of 2816 patients hospitalized with incident MI from 1987 to 2006 in Olmsted County, Minnesota, with prospective measurements of troponin and CK-MB from August 2000 forward. Outcomes were MI incidence, severity, and survival. After troponin was introduced, 278 (25%) of 1127 incident MIs met only troponin-based criteria. When cases meeting only troponin criteria were included, incidence did not change between 1987 and 2006. When restricted to cases defined by CK/CK-MB, the incidence of MI declined by 20%. The incidence of non-ST-segment elevation MI increased markedly by relying on troponin, whereas that of ST-segment elevation MI declined regardless of troponin. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of death within 30 days for an infarction occurring in 2006 (compared with 1987) was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.64). Among 30-day survivors, survival did not improve, but causes of death shifted from cardiovascular to noncardiovascular (P = 0.001). Trends in long-term survival among 30-day survivors were similar regardless of troponin.

Conclusions

Over the last 2 decades, a substantial change in the epidemiology of MI occurred that was only partially mediated by the introduction of troponin. Non-ST-segment elevation MIs now constitute the majority of MIs. Although the 30-day case fatality improved markedly, long-term survival did not change, and the cause of death shifted from cardiovascular to noncardiovascular.

### Mortality based on the presenting electrocardiogram in patients with myocardial infarction in the troponin era [^111uHmHq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Studies reporting short-term mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) based on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) are often limited by requiring an ischemic ECG for inclusion. Because few patients with normal or nonspecific findings were included, outcomes in these patients are less clear, especially in the troponin era.

Methods

Consecutive patients diagnosed as having MI using troponin I (TnI) over a 6-year period were included and classified into 8 mutually exclusive groups based on the initial ECG using standard criteria. Patients were included in only 1 group. The MI size was estimated using multiples of peak creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and 30-day mortality rate was assessed.

Results

Among 1641 patients with MI, patients with ST elevation represented only 22% of all MIs. Patients with ST elevation had the largest MI size, with 2 of 3 having a peak CK-MB greater than 10 times normal. In contrast, most of the patients representing all the other ECG groups had a peak CK-MB less than 5 times normal, with approximately 1 of 3 having no CK-MB elevation and were diagnosed by TnI elevation alone. Patients could be separated into a high-risk group (ST elevation, ischemia, other, or left bundle-branch block), in which mortality rate exceeded 9% (mean, 14%), and a lower-risk group (prior MI, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific changes, and normal), in which the 30-day mortality rate averaged 6% (P < .001; range, 5.23%-7.1%).

Conclusions

Specific ECG findings other than ischemia portend poor outcomes in patients with MI. Once MI is diagnosed, patients are no longer low risk.

### Consideration of a new definition of clinically relevant myocardial infarction after coronary revascularization: an expert consensus document from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) [^116VWrCX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) versus creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) after coronary revascularization — sensitivity and event classification: cTn is a more sensitive and specific biomarker for myonecrosis than is CK-MB, and CK-MB is no longer measured at some institutions. Numerous studies have suggested a stronger association with post-PCI CK-MB and subsequent cardiovascular events than with cTn elevation. Furthermore, the greater sensitivity of cTn for myonecrosis markedly increases the rate of type 4a MI; among 4,930 patients undergoing elective coronary stenting, MI occurred in 7.2% using a CK-MB criteria of ≥ 3x ULN and in 24.3% using a cTn criteria of ≥ 3x ULN. Lastly, changes in myocyte membrane permeability resulting from prolonged myocardial ischemia and other causes is sufficient for the release of cTn from the reverse cytosol pool of myocytes without structural damage.

### Creatine kinase is associated with bleeding after myocardial infarction [^11124o9H]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Classification of haemorrhagic events and mortality

All bleeding incidents were registered by a local investigator. Furthermore, each patient with blood loss or a reduction in haemoglobin of more than 30 g/L (around 1.9 mmol/L) during hospitalisation was reviewed by the HERC. The time of onset and the bleeding site, if known, were registered. Bleeding was classified by the HERC as 'major' when a decrease in haemoglobin of more than 50 g/L (around 3.1 mmol/L), intracranial bleeding or cardiac tamponade was present. Bleeding was classified as 'minor' if a haemoglobin reduction > 30 and ≤ 50 g/L from an identified bleeding site was present, or if the patient had spontaneous macroscopic haematuria, haemoptysis or haematemesis. Finally, patients were classified as 'loss, no site' if the bleeding site was unknown, but haemoglobin reduction was > 40 g/L (around 2.5 mmol/L) and ≤ 50 g/L. Transfusion of 1 unit of packed cells or whole blood was counted as 10 g/L when assessing haemoglobin reductions. Bleeding events in trial patients who underwent surgery (mainly CABG) were considered separately. The Mortality and Morbidity Classification Committee classified all causes of death. Patients classified as having died from haemorrhage were included under 'major haemorrhagic events'.
Laboratory studies

Fibrinogen levels, fibrin(ogen) degradation products, rt-PA levels and plasminogen were collected from as many patients as possible at baseline, and at 50, 300 and 480 min after rt-PA infusion, and determined in a central Coagulation Core Laboratory, using standardised methods as described previously. Platelet count was determined locally at the participating centres. Total CK was estimated locally at the study centres, routinely over the first 10 days, at baseline and 4-hour intervals during the first day, at 6-hour intervals during the second day and daily at day 3 through 10. The upper reference limit (URL) of each centre was recorded.

### Concerning the mechanism of pexelizumab's benefit in acute myocardial infarction [^111kBMoM]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The COMplement inhibition in Myocardial infarction treated with Angioplasty (COMMA) trial previously demonstrated an unexpected dose-dependent reduction in 90-day mortality after bolus/infusion of pexelizumab despite no reduction in the primary end point of myocardial infarction (MI) size. We examined whether the mortality benefit was related to established modulators of clinical benefit such as baseline demographics, time to treatment from symptom onset, myocardial perfusion post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and extent of ST resolution.

Methods and Results

Eight hundred fourteen patients were randomized into 3 groups; (1) placebo, (2) pexelizumab bolus 2.0 mg/kg and placebo infusion for 20 hours, and (3) pexelizumab bolus 2.0 and 0.05 mg/kg per hour infusion for 20 hours commencing 4 hours after the bolus. Subjects presented with ST elevation MI within 6 hours of symptom onset and underwent PCI, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB measurements taken sequentially to define CK-MB area under the curve (AUC) and sequential ECG's defined ST resolution and QRS infarct size. Whereas mortality for both placebo and bolus pexelizumab groups rose during later time after presentation, it remained low and did not change appreciably during the 6-hour randomization window when patients received pexelizumab bolus infusion. Amplification of the mortality benefit was evident in patients with the highest quartile of hemodynamic compromise, that is, heart rate ≥ 90 beat/min and systolic blood pressure ≤ 118 mm Hg (3.2% vs 11.3% P = 0.004). A significant interaction between treatment assignment and hemodynamic status (P = 0.013) existed after adjusting for age, race, and MI location. Clinical benefit was not related to infarct size, extent of ST elevation, or evidence of angiographic or electrocardiographic reperfusion.

Conclusions

These data raise the possibility that the clinical benefit of pexelizumab is mediated through novel pathways such as reduction in apoptosis or other mechanisms.

### Creatine kinase-MB does not add additional benefit to a negative troponin in the evaluation of chest pain [^11246TJN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether current troponin assay alone can be used for initial screening for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and whether creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) can safely be eliminated from this evaluation in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of patients who had cardiac troponin T (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and CK-MB ordered at an urban academic level 1 trauma center with more than 55,000 annual visits. Patients with troponin testing in the ED were identified over a period of 12 months, and corresponding CK-MB indexes were examined identifying patients with negative troponins (< 0.01) and positive CK-MB indexes (> 6.0). In these patients, further cardiac markers, hospital course, and 30-day mortality were then evaluated. A 99% confidence interval around point estimate was used in data analysis.

Results

During the study period, there were 11,092 separate ED patient encounters where a patient had at least one troponin resulted. Most (97.9%) of the samples had an associated CK-MB ordered. There were 7545 initial negative troponins representing 68% of all initial samples. Seven of these had an associated positive MB index. When subsequent troponins were evaluated, an additional 4910 negative troponins were identified, with 4 patients having a positive MB. None of these 11 patients were judged to have ruled in for AMI by the treating physicians. The rate of true-positive CK-MB index with negative troponin was 0% (99% confidence interval, 0–0.04%).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that CK-MB is not necessary in the initial screening for AMI and may safely be omitted in patients with negative troponins.

### Reducing redundant creatine kinase testing in cardiac injury [^111bxsuf]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

In this quality improvement initiative, we sought to evaluate and reduce CK testing for suspected cardiac injury by 50% or greater from existing levels. Our institution no longer performs CK-MB isozyme testing (discontinued in April 2014) while non-specific CK for cardiac testing has persisted despite the availability of troponin. Healthcare institutions elsewhere have adopted similar targets for CK-MB reduction initiatives and achieved lower false positive diagnoses, unchanged mortality from myocardial infarction, fewer blood draws and substantial cost-savings. Strategies have included cost-analysis of unnecessary testing, revision and dissemination of institutional guidelines, targeted educational presentations, changes to common investigation bundles and use of plan-do-study-act cycles. We employed multimodal strategies with the goal of reducing unnecessary CK testing at a large Canadian academic cardiac centre.

### Prognostic value of isolated troponin elevation across the spectrum of chest pain syndromes [^112PBNRf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The risk of death or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with chest pain and baseline isolated troponin elevation is unclear. To determine the early and short-term risk of death or MI associated with isolated troponin elevation across a spectrum of chest pain syndromes, we used baseline creatine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin data from the Platelet IIb/IIIa Antagonism for the Reduction of Acute Coronary Syndrome Events in a Global Organization Network (PARAGON) B troponin substudy, the Global Utilization of Strategies To Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) IIa troponin substudy, and the Chest Pain Evaluation by Creatine Kinase-MB, Myoglobin, and Troponin I (CHECKMATE) study. Patients were grouped into 1 of 4 categories based on marker status (troponin-positive/CK-MB-positive, troponin-positive/CK-MB-negative, troponin-negative/CK-MB-positive, or troponin-negative/CK-MB-negative). The adjusted odds of death or MI occurring at 24 hours and 30 days was assessed by baseline marker status using multivariable logistic regression, with the group negative for both markers used as the reference. Patients who were positive for both markers had the highest odds of the 24-hour and 30-day end point. The adjusted odds of the 30-day end point for patients with isolated troponin elevation were 1.3 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.3) and 4.8 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 16.0) for high- and low-risk patients, respectively. The risk for 24-hour and 30-day death or MI with isolated positive CK-MB results was lower than with isolated positive troponin results, and it was not significantly greater than if the 2 markers were negative. For patients with high- and low-risk chest pain, baseline troponin elevation without CK-MB elevation was associated with increased risk for early and short-term adverse outcomes. This suggests that these patients should be admitted to the hospital and monitored in either an intensive care or step-down unit.

### Should creatine kinase-MB index be eliminated in patients with indeterminate troponins in the ED? [^112e7BDP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study is to determine whether creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) index (CK-MBi) is useful in the evaluation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with indeterminate troponin (Tn) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients at an urban academic ED with over 55 000 annual visits who underwent Tn T (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and CK-MB testing. One year of ED patients who had Tn testing were identified, and their corresponding CK-MBi was examined to find patients with indeterminate Tn (0.01–0.09) and positive CK-MBi (> 6.0). Subsequent cardiac enzymes and hospital course were reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with AMI. A 95% confidence interval around point estimates were used in data analysis.

Results

Over 1 year, 11 718 initial Tn were identified. Indeterminate Tn was seen in 2512 cases. Of these, 28 had positive CK-MBi. Of the 28, 5 were judged by treating physicians to be having AMI and underwent cardiac catheterization. Of the 5 patients, 4 had subsequent positive Tns on serial enzyme testing. One of the patients thought to be having AMI had no coronary artery disease on catheterization. The rate of true positive CK-MBi with indeterminate Tn was 0.16% (95% confidence interval, 0.04%-0.41%).

Conclusion

Initial results identify rare cases of AMI where CK-MBi is positive in the setting of indeterminate Tn. However, most patients with indeterminate Tn and positive CK-MBi were not judged to be having AMI. In most cases, CK-MBi is not positive with indeterminate Tn and when positive more commonly confuses the picture. This suggests CK-MBi could be eliminated in patients with indeterminate Tns.
