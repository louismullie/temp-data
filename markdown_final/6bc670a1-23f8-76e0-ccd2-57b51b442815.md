## Question

what to do for muscle atrophy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do for muscle atrophy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about identifying the etiology of atrophy because treatment hinges on cause. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of resistance exercise and how to dose it. Next, I will examine disease-specific strategies for sarcopenia, cachexia, denervation, and critical illness. After that, I need to check adjuncts like nutrition, neuromuscular stimulation, and pharmacologics. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety, and when to escalate care, and close with a concise, prioritized action plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame: muscle atrophy is not a single disease but a phenotype with multiple causes, including disuse, aging (sarcopenia), cachexia, denervation, endocrine or metabolic drivers, and genetic or inflammatory myopathies. Accurate classification guides therapy, so I need to ensure I anchor on etiology before prescribing interventions [^dd62829e] [^c34e96cb] [^c0276997].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the universal foundation: resistance exercise is first-line across most etiologies because it directly counters protein catabolism and restores function when appropriately dosed. The most reproducible regimen is two full-body sessions per week, 1–3 sets of 6–12 reps at a relatively high effort, with progression of load, reps, or sets every 1–2 weeks as tolerated, and this applies to sarcopenia, disuse atrophy, and many chronic diseases [^d8b3d134] [^ebf8815a] [^f9f3a323].

> Wait, let me verify the principle of specificity and progression. Training must target the impaired muscle groups and movement patterns, and progression should be individualized using RPE and symptom feedback to avoid under- or overloading. This is especially critical in older adults with low baseline function or multimorbidity [^fbfbd995].

> Next, I should review sarcopenia-specific management. I need to ensure adequate protein intake (about 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day) with attention to leucine content and vitamin D repletion when deficient, and I should confirm that pharmacologic agents are not first-line. Trials of testosterone, GH, or myostatin blockade have not shown consistent functional gains or have unacceptable risks, though bimagrumab increased lean mass without improving strength, underscoring that hypertrophy alone is insufficient [^1c9f74e8] [^21fe77d6].

> I will now examine cachexia and cancer-associated muscle wasting. Let me think about multimodal care: combine nutrition with exercise and address the underlying catabolic driver. ESMO recommends interventions to antagonize deterioration of body resources and symptoms when life expectancy exceeds 3–6 months, and in CKD, correcting acidosis, optimizing nutrition, and resistance training are key, though no pharmacologic agent reliably reverses established wasting [^0dc93e71] [^163551f7].

> But wait, what if the atrophy is denervation-related? I should confirm that exercise alone is limited when the motor unit is disrupted. Electrical stimulation can help preserve muscle mass and contractility while awaiting reinnervation, and emerging strategies targeting muscle stem cells or matrix biology are promising but not yet standard of care, so expectations must be tempered and individualized [^c0276997] [^f2929b40].

> For critical illness and ICU-acquired weakness, I need to check that early mobilization and rehabilitation are essential. Very early physical therapy during septic shock is feasible and may mitigate catabolism, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation can be layered when patients cannot participate in full training, aligning with the principle that prevention is the only proven "treatment" for ICUAW [^5da5659d] [^56fc1a22].

> Let me consider disease-specific neuromuscular conditions. In SMA, disease-modifying SMN-enhancing therapies (nusinersen, onasemnogene, risdiplam) are standard and should be paired with multidisciplinary rehabilitation. In muscular dystrophies, carefully supervised resistance training can be safe and beneficial, but protocols must be individualized to avoid overuse injury in regeneratively limited muscle [^18bdd3eb] [^227e2e86].

> Next, I should review adjunctive modalities. Blood flow restriction training achieves hypertrophy at low loads and is valuable post-injury or post-surgery when high-load training is contraindicated, with meta-analyses showing improved strength and reduced atrophy in knee surgery cohorts. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is useful in denervation, ICU, and postoperative settings to maintain mass and facilitate recovery [^cc4a191b] [^b18c9ec5] [^423ca338].

> I need to ensure I address pharmacologic options judiciously. Testosterone or other androgens can increase lean mass in hypogonadal or selected contexts but should not be routine for sarcopenia due to adverse effects. Myostatin/activin pathway inhibitors show promise preclinically but have failed to translate consistent functional gains in trials. And in cancer cachexia, SARMs like enobosarm have been tested with mixed results, so these remain investigational outside specific indications [^148d9db2] [^08f012be].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and safety. Baseline and serial assessments of strength (e.g., grip, chair stand, 6-minute walk), body composition (DXA or BIA), and function (SPPB, TUG) guide progression and detect nonresponse. In denervation or critical illness, imaging (ultrasound, MRI) can quantify muscle loss and inform expectations. I should also screen medications that impair muscle function and correct reversible contributors like vitamin D deficiency, metabolic acidosis, or endocrine disorders [^22c5e0aa] [^354e21a4] [^b18c9ec5].

> Let me reconsider the hierarchy to avoid overpromising. First, classify the cause of atrophy. Second, implement resistance exercise with specificity, overload, and progression. Third, layer nutrition optimization and disease-specific supportive care. Fourth, add adjuncts like BFR or NMES when indicated. Fifth, reserve pharmacologics for select scenarios or trials. And sixth, monitor objectively and adjust every 4–12 weeks based on response and tolerance [^d8b3d134] [^dd62829e].

> In summary, I should double-check that the most reliable, evidence-based action for muscle atrophy is appropriately dosed resistance training, individualized to the cause and function, with nutrition and adjuncts tailored to etiology. Pharmacologic muscle-building drugs are not first-line for sarcopenia, and disease-specific therapies (e.g. SMN upregulation in SMA) should be integrated with rehabilitation to maximize functional recovery [^d8b3d134] [^21fe77d6] [^18bdd3eb].

---

Muscle atrophy is best managed with **resistance exercise** as the cornerstone [^d8b3d134], tailored to the cause and severity, and progressed to 2–3 sessions/week at 70–85% 1-RM with 8–12 reps and 1–3 sets [^d8b3d134]. Nutrition should deliver **1.2–1.5 g/kg/day of protein** with adequate calories and vitamin D [^notfound]; leucine-rich sources and timing around exercise enhance anabolism. In disuse or postoperative states, **early mobilization** and **blood flow restriction** can mitigate atrophy when high-load training is not feasible [^cc4a191b]. Pharmacologic options (testosterone, SARMs, myostatin inhibitors) are reserved for select cases due to limited efficacy and safety concerns [^148d9db2] [^1c9f74e8]. Address the underlying cause, monitor progression with strength and functional tests, and adjust the plan to sustain gains [^22c5e0aa].

## Exercise interventions

### Resistance training

- **Principle**: Progressive overload with specificity to target affected muscles [^fbfbd995].
- **Prescription**: 2–3 sessions/week, 8–12 reps, 1–3 sets, 70–85% 1-RM, progressing load/reps every 1–2 weeks [^d8b3d134].
- **Adjuncts**: Blood flow restriction at 20–30% 1-RM can preserve mass/strength when high load is contraindicated [^cc4a191b].

---

### Aerobic and functional training

Aerobic training (walking, cycling, swimming) supports **cardiovascular health** and can be layered with resistance work [^653ee0a2]. Functional training that targets ADLs (sit-to-stand, stair climbing, balance) improves **real-world function** and should be incorporated [^fbfbd995].

---

## Nutritional strategies

### Protein intake

Aim for **1.2–1.5 g/kg/day** with ~25–30 g per meal and include leucine-rich sources (whey, dairy, lean meats, soy) to maximize MPS [^notfound]. Distribute protein evenly across meals to optimize **anabolism** [^notfound].

---

### Caloric intake

Ensure **adequate calories** to meet energy needs and prevent catabolism; adjust to activity and disease state [^c34e96cb].

---

### Micronutrients

Maintain **vitamin D** at ≥ 30 ng/mL to support muscle function and reduce falls; correct deficiencies promptly [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

| **Agent** | **Indication** | **Evidence** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Testosterone | Hypogonadism, androgen deficiency | Increases mass/strength in low T | Cardiovascular risks, not routine for sarcopenia [^notfound] |
| SARMs (e.g. enobosarm) | Cancer cachexia, sarcopenia | Phase 2 trials show LBM gains | Mixed functional outcomes, not approved [^notfound] |
| Myostatin inhibitors | Severe atrophy, sarcopenia | Preclinical promise | Clinical failures, safety concerns [^148d9db2] |
| Ghrelin analogs | Cachexia | Appetite/stimulation | Limited efficacy, safety data [^notfound] |

---

Pharmacotherapy is **reserved** for refractory cases or when exercise/nutrition are insufficient [^notfound].

---

## Management by etiology

- **Sarcopenia**: Resistance training + protein 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day + vitamin D; no approved drugs [^d8b3d134] [^1c9f74e8].
- **Cachexia**: Multimodal care (nutrition, exercise, anti-inflammatory strategies); address underlying disease [^0dc93e71].
- **Disuse atrophy**: Early mobilization, BFR, NMES as needed [^cc4a191b].
- **Neuromuscular disease**: Disease-specific therapy (e.g. SMA treatments) + structured rehab [^18bdd3eb].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **strength** with grip, chair stand, or 1-RM; assess **function** with TUG, SPPB, or 6-minute walk; and monitor **body composition** with DXA or BIA to guide therapy and detect relapse [^22c5e0aa].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Emphasize that **exercise is medicine** and set realistic, progressive goals to build confidence [^653ee0a2]. Provide supervised sessions initially, then transition to home programs with tracking to sustain adherence [^notfound].

---

Muscle atrophy management centers on **resistance exercise** and **protein nutrition**, with adjuncts like BFR and early mobilization as indicated. Pharmacologics are last-line, and care must be individualized to the cause and patient context [^d8b3d134] [^1c9f74e8].

Healthcare professionals should carefully evaluate the available evidence specific to the different patient cohorts in which they are intending to use the therapies; this should include an overall evaluation of the risks and burden of the treatment, and patients should always be informed about current evidence for their specific condition. It is therefore of paramount importance to design randomized clinical trials specifically to assess efficacy outcomes in the older population, as well as to determine international consensus guidance for the use of these innovative treatments in a population with such varied clinical phenotypes.

### Treatment for inclusion body myositis [^ac4a0057]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a late-onset inflammatory muscle disease (myopathy) associated with progressive proximal and distal limb muscle atrophy and weakness. Treatment options have attempted to target inflammatory and atrophic features of this condition (for example with immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs, anabolic steroids, and antioxidant treatments), although as yet there is no known effective treatment for reversing or minimising the progression of inclusion body myositis. In this review we have considered the benefits, adverse effects, and costs of treatment in targeting cardinal effects of the condition, namely muscle atrophy, weakness, and functional impairment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatment for IBM.

Search Methods

On 7 October 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Additionally in November 2014 we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing or completed but unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials, including cross-over trials, of treatment for IBM in adults compared to placebo or any other treatment for inclusion in the review. We specifically excluded people with familial IBM and hereditary inclusion body myopathy, but we included people who had connective tissue and autoimmune diseases associated with IBM, which may or may not be identified in trials. We did not include studies of exercise therapy or dysphagia management, which are topics of other Cochrane systematic reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

The review included 10 trials (249 participants) using different treatment regimens. Seven of the 10 trials assessed single agents, and 3 assessed combined agents. Many of the studies did not present adequate data for the reporting of the primary outcome of the review, which was the percentage change in muscle strength score at six months. Pooled data from two trials of interferon beta-1a (n = 58) identified no important difference in normalised manual muscle strength sum scores from baseline to six months (mean difference (MD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.03) between IFN beta-1a and placebo (moderate-quality evidence). A single trial of methotrexate (MTX) (n = 44) provided moderate-quality evidence that MTX did not arrest or slow disease progression, based on reported percentage change in manual muscle strength sum scores at 12 months. None of the fully published trials were adequately powered to detect a treatment effect. We assessed six of the nine fully published trials as providing very low-quality evidence in relation to the primary outcome measure. Three trials (n = 78) compared intravenous immunoglobulin (combined in one trial with prednisone) to a placebo, but we were unable to perform meta-analysis because of variations in study analysis and presentation of trial data, with no access to the primary data for re-analysis. Other comparisons were also reported in single trials. An open trial of anti-T lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) combined with MTX versus MTX provided very low-quality evidence in favour of the combined therapy, based on percentage change in quantitative muscle strength sum scores at 12 months (MD 12.50%, 95% CI 2.43 to 22.57). Data from trials of oxandrolone versus placebo, azathioprine (AZA) combined with MTX versus MTX, and arimoclomol versus placebo did not allow us to report either normalised or percentage change in muscle strength sum scores. A complete analysis of the effects of arimoclomol is pending data publication. Studies of simvastatin and bimagrumab (BYM338) are ongoing. All analysed trials reported adverse events. Only 1 of the 10 trials interpreted these for statistical significance. None of the trials included prespecified criteria for significant adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials of interferon beta-1a and MTX provided moderate-quality evidence of having no effect on the progression of IBM. Overall trial design limitations including risk of bias, low numbers of participants, and short duration make it difficult to say whether or not any of the drug treatments included in this review were effective. An open trial of ATG combined with MTX versus MTX provided very low-quality evidence in favour of the combined therapy based on the percentage change data given. We were unable to draw conclusions from trials of IVIg, oxandrolone, and AZA plus MTX versus MTX. We need more randomised controlled trials that are larger, of longer duration, and that use fully validated, standardised, and responsive outcome measures.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^423ca338]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) limb muscle dysfunction — major conclusions and management signals: Limb muscle dysfunction is prevalent in COPD and is a major systemic consequence, with muscle atrophy and weakness linked to difficulties in physical activity, exercise intolerance, poor quality of life, and premature mortality. Lower limb muscle function is further compromised during COPD exacerbations, and patients experiencing exacerbations may be targeted for rehabilitative interventions aiming at preserving limb muscle function. Assessment of limb muscle function should be encouraged. Although physical inactivity contributes to limb muscle dysfunction in COPD, other mechanisms including inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional imbalance, and hypoxemia likely play a role. The most potent currently available treatment option for limb muscle dysfunction in COPD is exercise training, a key component of integrated management of COPD, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation is emerging as a useful training modality in patients severely impaired by COPD and during exacerbations. Knowledge of the biochemical regulation of muscle mass will most likely lead to the development of specific therapy for muscle atrophy in COPD.

### Mechanisms of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy: implications in health and disease [^c28b83ab]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Concluding remarks

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate the loss of muscle mass in disease. The lack of any efficient drug that counteracts muscle loss suggests that our view of the mechanistic insights that control atrophying muscle is still limited and needs further exploration.

### Spinal muscular atrophy-insights and challenges in the treatment era [^ed010981]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by deletion or mutation of SMN1. Four subtypes exist, characterized by different clinical severities. New therapeutic approaches have become available in the past few years, dramatically changing the natural history of all SMA subtypes, including substantial clinical improvement with the severe and advanced SMA type 1 variant. Trials have now demonstrated that phenotypic rescue is even more dramatic when pre-symptomatic patients are treated, and emerging real-world data are demonstrating the benefits of intervention even in the chronic phase of the condition. Here, we critically review how the field is rapidly evolving in response to the new therapies and questions that the new treatments have posed, including the effects of treatment at different ages and stages of disease, new phenotypes and long-term outcomes in patients who would not have survived without treatment, and decisions of who to treat and when. We also discuss how the outcomes associated with different timing of therapeutic intervention are contributing to our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of SMA.

### Resistance training as treatment for sarcopenia: examining sex-related differences in physiology and response [^653ee0a2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia or muscle mass atrophy reportedly occurs in up to 50% of those aged > 80 years and is a significant risk factor for functional disability and poor physical performance. Over time, the deterioration in both skeletal muscle quality and composition may compromise functional independence and has been shown to independently increase the risk for falls, fractures, and overall poor health in the elderly population. These are seen most obviously in older women. Given these serious consequences, much effort has been directed toward promoting increased activity and resistance training for muscle maintenance or even muscle regeneration in older adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that for all adults ≥ 65 years of age, weekly aerobic and strength training are vital to healthy aging. Older patients who have not previously participated in strength training may be hesitant about starting a resistance training program and resort to simple and familiar aerobic exercise options such as walking, jogging, or cycling. However, the benefits of strength training are too important to miss: it can improve skeletal muscle metabolic capacity, mitigate effects of aging on functional capacity, maintain bone density, and, most importantly, help individuals maintain a higher quality of life and independence. Due to their increased risk of disability and injury, this opportunity for "exercise as medicine" is particularly important to women and must be encouraged by clinicians. As such, the purpose of this commentary was to highlight known sex-related differences in muscle metabolism and potential benefits of resistance training for elderly patients. A comprehensive understanding of the issues and prevention measures presented here may allow clinicians to better serve their patients, especially older female patients, and, ultimately, alleviate the burden placed on our society by our rapidly aging population.

### New and developing therapies in spinal muscular atrophy [^a8e35165]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Great progress has been made in the clinical translation of several therapeutic strategies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), including measures to selectively address Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein deficiency with SMN1 gene replacement or modulation of SMN2 encoded protein levels, as well as neuroprotective approaches and supporting muscle strength and function. This review highlights these novel therapies. This is particularly vital with the advent of the first disease modifying therapy, which has brought to the fore an array of questions surrounding who, how and when to treat, and stimulated challenges in resource limited healthcare systems to streamline access for those eligible for drug therapy. The overhaul of the landscape for all those involved in SMA extends to the design of further drug trials and the necessity of multidisciplinary supportive care to potentiate the effects of disease modifying medications. The impact of respiratory complications in SMA is central to management in the current era of emerging novel therapies. These fundamental changes in our knowledge and management approach to those with SMA are explored further in this review.

### Rehabilitation practices for childhood spinal muscular atrophy [^b85ef7e2]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular condition characterized by muscle weakness and impaired motor function. The introduction of disease modifying treatments, such as gene therapy, have significantly improved prognosis. Children with SMA now have the potential for active rehabilitation, but limited evidence exists to guide rehabilitation professionals and families. Our objective was to explore and describe how rehabilitation therapists are approaching this changing landscape, including the challenges and opportunities.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative study using a demographic survey and three focus groups with 10 occupational and physical therapists from across Canada. Participants shared their experiences navigating the changing landscape of SMA rehabilitation.

Results

Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcripts and generate four main themes: (1) Managing Expectations; (2) New Possibilities; (3) Centering the Child; (4) Navigating a Changing Landscape.

Conclusion

This study highlighted challenges and benefits in providing rehabilitation amidst the changing SMA landscape. Updated practice guidelines and effective knowledge dissemination are needed to guide therapists, alongside prioritization of psychosocial support for families and children coping with high expectations. What we learned about therapists' experiences may help inform others on how to adapt rehabilitation when disease modifying treatment options become available for other conditions.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^e351243c]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Indications

After a comprehensive history and focused neurologic and musculoskeletal physical examination, assessment of CLBP should include an individualized, phasic, comprehensive, and multi-modal treatment plan, avoiding surgery if not indicated. Initial options may include the use of adjuvant non-opioid medications to facilitate a rehabilitative paradigm focused on addressing impaired neuromuscular control from degeneration of the multifidus muscle to restore lumbar spine stability, decrease pain, and improve function. More advanced treatments such as PNS should be considered once more conservative options have failed and there is no indication for invasive surgery. Candidates for PNS therapy experience CLBP secondary to multifidus muscle dysfunction, which is often consistent with muscle atrophy. Atrophy can be confirmed via MRI and dysfunction via physical exam. The prone instability test and multifidus lift test are physical exam maneuvers used to assess weakness of the multifidi from atrophy. Currently, the literature and experience revolve around both short-term and permanently implanted techniques.

### Considerations in the development of drugs to treat sarcopenia [^ad9f3699]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Sarcopenia describes reduced skeletal muscle mass and impaired muscle function associated with aging and with a variety of chronic diseases prevalent in the aging population. With increasing understanding of the molecular pathways participating in the structural and functional changes affecting skeletal muscle in these conditions, a number of potential targets for pharmacological interventions to reverse sarcopenia have been identified. The clinical evaluation of therapeutic candidates directed at these targets will require that the efficacy and safety of the drug candidates be adequately evaluated to meet the regulatory standards of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Concerns unique to drug development may require different approaches to clinical study design than have been used in the epidemiological research that identified the clinical need for these programs and the intervention trials conducted to date. In addition to being responsive to clinical need as perceived by patients and physicians, clinical trial data must demonstrate to the FDA that the drug provides an objective and clinically meaningful advantage, and must demonstrate to all involved in healthcare decision-making that its benefits justify the associated costs and risks. Potential primary efficacy endpoints for trials of a drug for treatment of sarcopenia include physical performance, falls, fractures, and patient-reported outcomes assessing function and quality of life. Each potential endpoint has advantages and disadvantages from scientific, clinical, and regulatory perspectives that must be carefully considered in the design of trials for sarcopenia treatments.

### Sarcopenia definition, diagnosis and treatment: consensus is growing [^2f4391b6]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Sarcopenia is a disorder involving the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that commonly occurs with advancing age as well as with a number of long-term conditions.
Recognition in clinical practice is relatively recent but important because sarcopenia has a range of adverse effects on health.
Original definitions focused on muscle mass but emphasis is now on muscle function as illustrated in a number of international guidelines.
Progress in the decades ahead is likely to be seen with regard to use of routine health data, prescription of resistance exercise, translation of biology and epidemiology into first in man studies for new treatments and focus on sarcopenia in low- and middle-income countries.
Immediate next steps include an exciting Global Leadership Initiative on Sarcopenia (GLIS) to develop international consensus on definition and diagnosis.

### Emerging therapies and challenges in spinal muscular atrophy [^9fe0fed7]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

With the tantalizing prospect of novel therapies moving closer to clinical reality, more questions arise, compelling the formation of collaborative and linked future monitoring programs to determine the impact of these therapies. Longer‐term monitoring programs should also include assessments of cognition, growth, autonomic function, and adverse events and enable a comparison and evaluation of combined treatments. These will serve to understand how novel therapies may affect phenotype over the longer term and the duration of effect — will they reduce progression, as well as stabilize or improve function? How will they affect requirements for permanent ventilation or age of death? What is the potential variability of responsiveness of different motor neuron subpopulations attributed to drug distribution or inherent differences in reversibility? Furthermore, the possibility that reinnervation may stress remaining motor neurons, resulting in a post‐polio‐like condition with late deterioration, must be considered. It is likely that combined therapies increasing SMN levels while also enhancing and preserving neuromuscular function and preventing additional systemic pathology will provide the best approach. In the setting of a first‐in‐class approved therapy, continued progress in developing second‐generation and combination therapies will require innovative approaches in trial design. In addition, new challenges are arising with emerging therapies, including difficulties with access to treatment associated with the complexities, costs, and expertise required with intrathecal administration. Further efforts to ascertain optimal routes of drug delivery and distribution and defining the therapeutic window will be essential.

As the field looks toward a new treatment era, it is necessary to focus on timely access to novel, disease‐modifying therapy and endeavoring to develop therapies for patients with SMA of all ages and severities.

### Clinical perspectives: treating spinal muscular atrophy [^f6f45da8]. Molecular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare and progressive neuromuscular disease that, without treatment, leads to progressive weakness and often death. A plethora of studies have led to the approval of three high-cost and effective treatments since 2016. These treatments, nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam, have not been directly compared and have varying challenges in administration. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting the use of these medications, the process of treatment selection, monitoring after treatment, the limited data comparing treatments, as well as future directions for investigation and therapy.

### Clinical decision making around commercial use of gene and genetic therapies for spinal muscular atrophy [^811a2d6a]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic adults

This group encompasses adults who were diagnosed as children or adults but did not have access to therapies until symptomatic in adulthood. For these individuals, risdiplam may be the only option due to prior spinal fusion surgery. Nusinersen has been given via reservoirs or cervical access, but this approach has not been widely used, perhaps due to the availability and ease of use of risdiplam. Additional consideration is given to those with long-standing disease duration prior to treatment initiation since earlier treatment is known to result in best outcomes. However, even in later stage disease, treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam may provide benefit and thus should be offered as preservation of residual function can impact quality of life. For those diagnosed in adulthood with minimal disease progression prior to treatment initiation, risdiplam and nusinersen should be considered. The potential reproductive impact of risdiplam may lead to a preference for nusinersen in some individuals.

In each of the above categories, many questions remain unanswered (Table 4). In every group, highly reliable biomarkers would provide data to assist in decision making. At the moment, neurofilament and compound muscle action potentials are under investigation, but neither is used routinely in clinical practice and it is still not clear if these markers are sufficiently robust to inform clinical decisions. Patient reported outcomes may be another avenue to monitor for disease progression, treatment response, and treatment persistence.

Table 4
Remaining clinical questions in the treatment of SMA.

Clinical decision making regarding treatment selection in spinal muscular atrophy is currently a tiered process based on limited comparative evidence. Physicians and parents/caregivers should have discussions regarding the risks and benefits of the available options. Screening laboratories may reduce available options and then finally, insurance approval or denial may dictate which treatment(s) the individual will receive. Further work to harmonize clinical trial outcome assessments, long term outcomes and biomarker development will be important to provide more evidence based and fiscally responsible care.

### Mechanisms of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy: implications in health and disease [^9441e336]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Skeletal muscle is the protein reservoir of our body and an important regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis. Consequently, the growth or the loss of muscle mass can influence general metabolism, locomotion, eating and respiration. Therefore, it is not surprising that excessive muscle loss is a bad prognostic index of a variety of diseases ranging from cancer, organ failure, infections and unhealthy ageing. Muscle function is influenced by different quality systems that regulate the function of contractile proteins and organelles. These systems are controlled by transcriptional dependent programs that adapt muscle cells to environmental and nutritional clues. Mechanical, oxidative, nutritional and energy stresses, as well as growth factors or cytokines modulate signaling pathways that, ultimately, converge on protein and organelle turnover. Novel insights that control and orchestrate such complex network are continuously emerging and will be summarized in this review. Understanding the mechanisms that control muscle mass will provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of muscle loss in inherited and non-hereditary diseases and for the improvement of the quality of life during ageing.

### Epidemiology of sarcopenia and insight into possible therapeutic targets [^80dfe117]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal ageing is a major public health concern owing to demographic shifts in the population. Sarcopenia, generally defined as the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is associated with considerable risk of falls, loss of independence in older adults and hospitalization with poorer health outcomes. This condition is therefore associated with increased morbidity and health care costs. As with bone mass, muscle mass and strength increase during late adolescence and early adulthood, but begin to decline substantially from ∼50 years of age. Sarcopenia is characterized by many features, which include loss of muscle mass, altered muscle composition, infiltration with fat and fibrous tissue and alterations in innervation. A better understanding of these factors might help us to develop strategies that target these effects. To date, however, methodological challenges and controversies regarding how best to define the condition, in addition to uncertainty about what outcome measures to consider, have delayed research into possible therapeutic options. Most pharmacological agents investigated to date are hormonal, although new developments have seen the emergence of agents that target myostatin signalling to increase muscle mass. In this review we consider the current approaching for defining sarcopenia and discuss its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic opportunities.

### Consensus statement for standard of care in spinal muscular atrophy [^17370637]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that requires multidisciplinary medical care. Recent progress in the understanding of molecular pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy and advances in medical technology have not been matched by similar developments in the care for spinal muscular atrophy patients. Variations in medical practice coupled with differences in family resources and values have resulted in variable clinical outcomes that are likely to compromise valid measure of treatment effects during clinical trials. The International Standard of Care Committee for Spinal Muscular Atrophy was formed in 2005, with a goal of establishing practice guidelines for clinical care of these patients. The 12 core committee members worked with more than 60 spinal muscular atrophy experts in the field through conference calls, e-mail communications, a Delphi survey, and 2 in-person meetings to achieve consensus on 5 care areas: diagnostic/new interventions, pulmonary, gastrointestinal/nutrition, orthopedics/rehabilitation, and palliative care. Consensus was achieved on several topics related to common medical problems in spinal muscular atrophy, diagnostic strategies, recommendations for assessment and monitoring, and therapeutic interventions in each care area. A consensus statement was drafted to address the 5 care areas according to 3 functional levels of the patients: nonsitter, sitter, and walker. The committee also identified several medical practices lacking consensus and warranting further investigation. It is the authors' intention that this document be used as a guideline, not as a practice standard for their care. A practice standard for spinal muscular atrophy is urgently needed to help with the multidisciplinary care of these patients.

### Advances and limitations for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy [^aea8c9ca]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

SMA also has a substantial and multidimensional burden on affected adults. While advances in supportive care and the new transformative treatments are rapidly reshaping the therapeutic environment, understanding the natural history, care pathways, and patient-reported outcomes associated with SMA in adulthood are critical to advancing research and clinical care.

In studies including patient-reported outcomes to-date, subjective well-being has not improved. It has not been possible to identify a single treatment associated with statistically higher QoL; however, parents showed a trend toward the belief that their children with SMA have a greater QoL with current treatments compared to supportive care.

SMA remains a debilitating genetic disorder for many patients, despite the use of SMN upregulators; however, there are still unmet needs that demonstrate the importance of exploring SMN-independent mechanisms, specifically muscle-directed treatments that target the muscle component of the motor unit, used in combination with currently available treatments. Combining SMN restoration with SMN-independent treatment may address the varying degrees of muscle weakness, fatigue and immobility affecting SMA patients after receiving SMN upregulating treatment.

### Forkhead box O signaling pathway in skeletal muscle atrophy [^13f8aaa3]. The American Journal of Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Skeletal muscle atrophy is the consequence of protein degradation exceeding protein synthesis because of disease, aging, and physical inactivity. Patients with skeletal muscle atrophy have decreased muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area, and experience reduced survival quality and motor function. The forkhead box O (FOXO) signaling pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle atrophy by regulating E3 ubiquitin ligases and some autophagy factors. However, the mechanism of FOXO signaling pathway leading to skeletal muscle atrophy is still unclear. The development of treatment strategies for skeletal muscle atrophy has been a thorny clinical problem. FOXO-targeted therapy to treat skeletal muscle atrophy is a promising approach, and an increasing number of relevant studies have been reported. This article reviews the mechanism and therapeutic targets of the FOXO signaling pathway mediating skeletal muscle atrophy, and provides ideas for the clinical treatment of this condition.

### Biomarkers in 5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy-a narrative review [^8f5bca9f]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, resulting in a loss of functional SMN protein and consecutive degeneration of motor neurons in the ventral horn. The disease is clinically characterized by proximal paralysis and secondary skeletal muscle atrophy. New disease-modifying drugs driving SMN gene expression have been developed in the past decade and have revolutionized SMA treatment. The rise of treatment options led to a concomitant need of biomarkers for therapeutic guidance and an improved disease monitoring. Intensive efforts have been undertaken to develop suitable markers, and numerous candidate biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive values have been identified. The most promising markers include appliance-based measures such as electrophysiological and imaging-based indices as well as molecular markers including SMN-related proteins and markers of neurodegeneration and skeletal muscle integrity. However, none of the proposed biomarkers have been validated for the clinical routine yet. In this narrative review, we discuss the most promising candidate biomarkers for SMA and expand the discussion by addressing the largely unfolded potential of muscle integrity markers, especially in the context of upcoming muscle-targeting therapies. While the discussed candidate biomarkers hold potential as either diagnostic (e.g. SMN-related biomarkers), prognostic (e.g., markers of neurodegeneration, imaging-based markers), predictive (e.g., electrophysiological markers) or response markers (e.g., muscle integrity markers), no single measure seems to be suitable to cover all biomarker categories. Hence, a combination of different biomarkers and clinical assessments appears to be the most expedient solution at the time.

### Explore the optimal exercise intervention subtype for sarcopenia: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^c19a55a5]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by gradual and widespread degeneration of skeletal muscle mass and function, affects 5% to 13% of adults aged 60–70 years and 11% to 50% of those aged 80 years or older. The condition is an age-associated deterioration of skeletal muscle, and is chronic with a progressive natural history. Costs to the healthcare and social welfare systems are substantial, and the impact of symptoms on quality of life is significant, as it reduces patients' ability to perform daily tasks, impairs their mobility, increases the risk of falls and fractures, and consequently reduces patients' independence, leading to social isolation, depression, and reduced social participation. However, no medications have been approved for the treatment of sarcopenia, the effectiveness of most medications is modest, and side effects are significant. Even novel, more selective targeted therapies developed in the last decade have failed to demonstrate consistent efficacy in larger clinical trials. As a result, they are often withdrawn or restricted, pharmacological treatments are not widely available or accessible for sarcopenia patients.

Therefore, patients may turn to other approaches. Exercise therapy has emerged as a direct, effective and non-invasive approach for treating sarcopenia, and is mostly recommended by clinical practice guidelines as the primary treatment for sarcopenia, to improve muscle strength, function, and mass, as well as reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that although the exploration of exercise interventions for sarcopenia has become increasingly prevalent and researchers have proposed an array of exercise intervention methods for sarcopenia, including resistance training, aerobic exercise, combined resistance and comprehensive training, the optimal subtype of exercise for sarcopenia remains unclear. Hence, it is imperative to undertake systematic evaluations and comparisons of the effects of varying exercise intervention approaches on individuals affected by sarcopenia in order to furnish evidence-based guidance for clinical decision-making.

### Botulinum toxin and muscle atrophy: a wanted or unwanted effect [^92ee3951]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

While the facial rejuvenating effect of botulinum toxin type A is well known and widespread, its use in body and facial contouring is less common. We first describe its use for deliberate muscle volume reduction, and then document instances of unanticipated and undesirable muscle atrophy. Finally, we investigate the potential long-term adverse effects of botulinum toxin-induced muscle atrophy. Although the use of botulinum toxin type A in the cosmetic patient has been extensively studied, there are several questions yet to be addressed. Does prolonged botulinum toxin treatment increase its duration of action? What is the mechanism of muscle atrophy and what is the cause of its reversibility once treatment has stopped? We proceed to examine how prolonged chemodenervation with botulinum toxin can increase its duration of effect and potentially contribute to muscle atrophy. Instances of inadvertent botulinum toxin-induced atrophy are also described. These include the "hourglass deformity" secondary to botulinum toxin type A treatment for migraine headaches, and a patient with atrophy of multiple facial muscles from injections for hemifacial spasm. Numerous reports demonstrate that muscle atrophy after botulinum toxin type A treatment occurs and is both reversible and temporary, with current literature supporting the notion that repeated chemodenervation with botulinum toxin likely responsible for both therapeutic and incidental temporary muscle atrophy. Furthermore, duration of response may be increased with subsequent treatments, thus minimizing frequency of reinjection. Practitioners should be aware of the temporary and reversible effect of botulinum toxin-induced muscle atrophy and be prepared to reassure patients on this matter.

### Targeting muscle signaling pathways to minimize adverse effects of androgen deprivation [^de4e8c83]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a highly effective treatment used in ∼30% of men with prostate cancer. Adverse effects of ADT on muscle are significant with consistent losses in muscle mass. However, effects of ADT on muscle strength and physical function, of most relevance to the patient, are less well understood. This is in part due to the fact that muscle effects of ADT at the cellular, genetic and protein level, critical to the understanding of the pathophysiology of sarcopenia, have come into focus only recently. This review highlights the complexity of androgen-dependent signaling in muscle with an emphasis on recent findings in the regulation of muscle growth and muscle atrophy pathways. Furthermore, the effects of ADT and testosterone on skeletal muscle histology, gene expression and protein transcription are discussed. A better mechanistic understanding of the regulation of muscle mass and function by androgens should not only pave the way for developing targeted promyogenic interventions for men with prostate cancer receiving ADT but also may have wider implications for age-associated sarcopenia in the general population.

### Regulation of muscle atrophy: wasting away from the outside in: an introduction [^1e5b0dcc]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Whereas it is clear that periods of detraining, disuse, injury and aging are marked by losses in skeletal muscle mass and function, the emerging literature suggests that there are unique molecular signaling alterations depending on the perturbation. Understanding the phenotypical adaptations in skeletal muscle and factors that are thought to promote or inhibit genes involved in the atrophy program will elucidate how the muscular system responds to decreases in activity. Recent advances in the discipline have identified specific and innovative methods to promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy including gene therapy, pharmacological, and nutritional interventions. The same success has not been met concerning attenuating skeletal muscle atrophy. If novel approaches are to be implemented in humans to mitigate disuse- and age-related skeletal muscle loss, it is imperative that we evaluate critical regulators of skeletal muscle atrophy from a system to the cellular level. The symposium "Regulation of Muscle Atrophy: Wasting Away from the Outside In" was presented at the ACSM Annual Meeting in Indianapolis on May 29, 2008, to provide an overview of the skeletal muscle atrophy literature and our current understanding of the atrophy program from the whole system to the molecular level. In addition, this symposium addressed the feasibility of intervening with specific countermeasures to attenuate atrophy. This introduction identifies the scope of the symposium, which evaluates our current understanding of the atrophy program and how this information can facilitate the development of effective countermeasures.

### Sarcopenia definition, diagnosis and treatment: consensus is growing [^53684fb1]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sarcopenia is a skeletal muscle disorder that commonly occurs with advancing age as well as with a number of long-term conditions. Recognition in clinical practice is relatively recent but important because of the association between sarcopenia and a range of adverse effects on health including impaired mobility, increased morbidity and mortality. Originally characterised as loss of muscle mass, the definition has evolved to focus on loss of skeletal muscle function, particularly strength, through a number of international definitions such as that of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People most recently revised in 2019. Progress in the decades ahead is likely to be seen with regard to use of routine health data, prescription of resistance exercise, translation of biology and epidemiology into first in man studies for new treatments, and focus on sarcopenia in low and middle-income countries. Immediate next steps include the newly formed Global Leadership Initiative on Sarcopenia to develop international consensus on definition and diagnosis.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^3b01b79a]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Long-term non-operative management — physical therapy outcomes and recommendation strength: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) improve with physical therapy in symptomatic patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, but the rotator cuff tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration may progress over 5 to 10 years with non-operative management. Quality of evidence is High and the strength of recommendation is Strong. For patients treated non-operatively after a rotator cuff tear, surveillance with serial clinical evaluation and imaging may be considered if surgical repair remains a viable option.

### Spinal muscular atrophy [^18bdd3eb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in SMN1 (encoding survival motor neuron protein (SMN)). Reduced expression of SMN leads to loss of α-motor neurons, severe muscle weakness and often early death. Standard-of-care recommendations for multidisciplinary supportive care of SMA were established in the past few decades. However, improved understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of SMA has led to the development of different therapeutic approaches. Three treatments that increase SMN expression by distinct molecular mechanisms, administration routes and tissue biodistributions have received regulatory approval with others in clinical development. The advent of the new therapies is redefining standards of care as in many countries most patients are treated with one of the new therapies, leading to the identification of emerging new phenotypes of SMA and a renewed characterization of demographics owing to improved patient survival.

### Denervated muscle atrophy… [^c0276997]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

When a motor nerve is severed, the muscle which it supplies enters into a state of inaction, so far as its usual contractile function is concerned, and muscular atrophy gradually ensues. Ultimately the nerve may regenerate so that a functional connection with its muscles again becomes restored. Obviously it would be of enormous physiologic advantage if the intervening muscular atrophy could be wholly or in part averted. Attempts at a successful therapy to prevent the disaster that follows the nerve injury and may be termed denervated muscle atrophy have not been wanting. The earliest efforts were based on the disuse theory — the belief that the wasting of the denervated muscle is due to the lack of exercise. Three quarters of a century ago in an experimental study of the problem, John Reid undertook to supply the supposedly needed activity by inducing contraction in denervated muscle by means of electrical stimulation; likewise.

### Evolving approaches to prenatal genetic counseling for spinal muscular atrophy in the new treatment era [^5415d6e4]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). Medium credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy with usually typical cognition. The first disease-modifying therapy for SMA, nusinersen, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 and leads to improved outcomes, especially when administered presymptomatically. Population-wide carrier screening and newborn screening (NBS) are now recommended by several professional organizations to promote reproductive autonomy, early diagnosis, and treatment. Prenatal genetic counselors (GCs) are important providers of the SMA screening and diagnosis process, but the possible impact of nusinersen on their practice has not been explored. A survey of 182 prenatal GCs in the United States (US) assessed baseline knowledge of nusinersen and likelihood of discussing this option with prospective parents. The majority of GCs (94.5%) were aware of this drug, and almost all (87.3%) felt that this information would affect pregnancy management decisions. However, less than half of GCs (49.2%) felt confident discussing nusinersen, 45.1% were unaware if this treatment was available in their practice setting, and one in five (19.3%) did not know where to find information about SMA treatments. Participants were more confident and knowledgeable about NBS for SMA, and several indicated that NBS would reduce their emphasis on carrier screening and diagnostic testing, not recognizing that an early prenatal diagnosis can enable preparations for complex, time-sensitive treatment. Only 5.0% of participants felt that a prenatal GC should discuss nusinersen with prospective parents. However, encouragingly, nearly all GCs who felt confident discussing this treatment option (86.4%) reported using this information weekly in their real-world practice. These data highlight an opportunity to provide up-to-date education about SMA treatments, as well as the significant impacts of early diagnosis. Additionally, interdisciplinary communication and care may be appropriate to clarify healthcare resources available and support a variety of patient needs. Increasing awareness and confidence about available options can help prenatal GCs empower patient autonomy and shared decision-making in the new era of disease-modifying treatment for SMA.

### The role of muscle stem cells in regeneration and recovery after denervation: a review [^f2929b40]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle denervation is a complex clinical problem that still lacks a comprehensive solution. Previous studies have suggested that prolonged periods of denervation lead to a decline in the muscle stem cell population, negatively affecting the ability of muscle to regenerate following reinnervation. Recent advances in the understanding of muscle stem cell biology, along with new techniques that increase the ability to identify and manipulate these cells, provide an opportunity to definitively address the impact of muscle stem cells in recovery from denervation and their potential role in treatment.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature on the biology of muscle denervation, and the effect of denervation injury on muscle stem cell behavior, was performed.

Results

In this review, the authors discuss the current understanding of muscle stem cell biology in the setting of denervation atrophy, review barriers to successful reinnervation, and review options available to patients following denervation injury. The authors also discuss potential use of muscle stem cells in future therapies.

Conclusions

Although the clinical treatment of prolonged denervation injury has improved in recent years, regeneration of native muscle remains elusive. Muscle stem cells have been demonstrated to be of central importance in muscle regeneration following injury, and may be a powerful tool that provides effective new options for future treatments. Additional work clarifying the effect of denervation injury on satellite cells is needed to determine whether they are a limiting factor in recovery and to demonstrate whether their clinical use as a cell-based therapy in denervation injury can be efficacious.

### Muscle degeneration in rotator cuff tears [^49aa0e35]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are among the most common injuries seen by orthopedic surgeons. Although small- and medium-sized tears do well after arthroscopic and open repair, large and massive tears have been shown to develop marked muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration within the rotator cuff muscles. These pathologic changes have been found to be independent predictors of failed surgical repair with poor functional outcomes. To understand the pathophysiology of rotator cuff disease, we must first develop an understanding of the changes that occur within the cuff muscles themselves. The purpose of this review is to summarize the molecular pathways behind muscular degeneration and emphasize new findings related to the clinical relevance of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration seen with rotator cuff tears. Understanding these molecular pathways will help guide further research and treatment options that can aim to alter expression of these pathways and improve outcomes after surgical repair of massive rotator cuff tears.

### Myostatin / activin receptor ligands in muscle and the development status of attenuating drugs [^148d9db2]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Muscle wasting disease indications are among the most debilitating and often deadly noncommunicable disease states. As a comorbidity, muscle wasting is associated with different neuromuscular diseases and myopathies, cancer, heart failure, chronic pulmonary and renal diseases, peripheral neuropathies, inflammatory disorders, and, of course, musculoskeletal injuries. Current treatment strategies are relatively ineffective and can at best only limit the rate of muscle degeneration. This includes nutritional supplementation and appetite stimulants as well as immunosuppressants capable of exacerbating muscle loss. Arguably, the most promising treatments in development attempt to disrupt myostatin and activin receptor signaling because these circulating factors are potent inhibitors of muscle growth and regulators of muscle progenitor cell differentiation. Indeed, several studies demonstrated the clinical potential of "inhibiting the inhibitors," increasing muscle cell protein synthesis, decreasing degradation, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, and preserving muscle function. Such changes can prevent muscle wasting in various disease animal models yet many drugs targeting this pathway failed during clinical trials, some from serious treatment-related adverse events and off-target interactions. More often, however, failures resulted from the inability to improve muscle function despite preserving muscle mass. Drugs still in development include antibodies and gene therapeutics, all with different targets and thus, safety, efficacy, and proposed use profiles. Each is unique in design and, if successful, could revolutionize the treatment of both acute and chronic muscle wasting. They could also be used in combination with other developing therapeutics for related muscle pathologies or even metabolic diseases.

### New horizons in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of sarcopenia [^14dda209]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. It is now recognised as a major clinical problem for older people and research in the area is expanding exponentially. One of the most important recent developments has been convergence in the operational definition of sarcopenia combining measures of muscle mass and strength or physical performance. This has been accompanied by considerable progress in understanding of pathogenesis from animal models of sarcopenia. Well-described risk factors include age, gender and levels of physical activity and this knowledge is now being translated into effective management strategies including resistance exercise with recent interest in the additional role of nutritional intervention. Sarcopenia is currently a major focus for drug discovery and development although there remains debate about the best primary outcome measure for trials, and various promising avenues to date have proved unsatisfactory. The concept of 'new tricks for old drugs' is, however, promising, for example, there is some evidence that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may improve physical performance. Future directions will include a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sarcopenia and the application of a lifecourse approach to understanding aetiology as well as to informing the optimal timing of interventions.

### Update on exercise in persons with muscle disease [^227e2e86]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Myopathies are heterogeneous in their etiology, muscle group involvement, clinical manifestation, and progression. Deficits in myopathy may include muscle weakness, atrophy, stiffness, myalgia, and extra-muscular manifestations. Consequently, these deficits could lead to impaired musculoskeletal function, inadequate engagement in daily activities and reduced participation in social activities. Exercise has been viewed as a potentially efficacious intervention to halt the loss of muscle function and to improve secondary symptoms that result from muscle loss, such as pain and fatigue. The purpose of this review is to discuss research findings within the last 10years that examine effects of exercise interventions in many types of myopathies in humans. In general, most studies were small scale, and they varied with respect to exercise type, intensity, and outcome measures. Despite the different pathologies, various exercise subtypes of aerobic/endurance or strength/resistance training are generally beneficial and may improve muscle strength and functional outcomes. Exercise therapies are generally safe and well tolerated. Exercise prescription should be part of routine neuromuscular care for patients with myopathy, and ideally with input from a multidisciplinary team, with a focus on providing individualized exercise regimens. Further work is needed to define the optimal intensity and type of exercise to result in the best functional outcomes for persons with myopathy, as well as the effects of combining exercise and novel disease modifying therapies.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of spinal muscular atrophy [^8dbe571b]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons, with resulting progressive muscle weakness. The clinical phenotype and disease severity can be varied and occupy a wide spectrum. Although many advances have been made regarding our understanding of SMA, no cure is yet available. The care of patients who have SMA can often be complex, with many medical issues to consider. When possible, a multidisciplinary team approach is effective. The current understanding of SMA, and the clinical management and rehabilitative care of patients who have SMA, are discussed in this article.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^d8b3d134]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia is a generalised skeletal muscle disorder characterised by reduced muscle strength and mass and associated with a range of negative health outcomes. Currently, resistance exercise (RE) is recommended as the first-line treatment for counteracting the deleterious consequences of sarcopenia in older adults. However, whilst there is considerable evidence demonstrating that RE is an effective intervention for improving muscle strength and function in healthy older adults, much less is known about its benefits in older people living with sarcopenia. Furthermore, evidence for its optimal prescription and delivery is very limited and any potential benefits of RE are unlikely to be realised in the absence of an appropriate exercise dose. We provide a summary of the underlying principles of effective RE prescription (specificity, overload and progression) and discuss the main variables (training frequency, exercise selection, exercise intensity, exercise volume and rest periods) that can be manipulated when designing RE programmes. Following this, we propose that an RE programme that consists of two exercise sessions per week and involves a combination of upper- and lower-body exercises performed with a relatively high degree of effort for 1–3 sets of 6–12 repetitions is appropriate as a treatment for sarcopenia. The principles of RE prescription outlined here and the proposed RE programme presented in this paper provide a useful resource for clinicians and exercise practitioners treating older adults with sarcopenia and will also be of value to researchers for standardising approaches to RE interventions in future sarcopenia studies.

### A transcriptomics-based drug repositioning approach to identify drugs with similar activities for the treatment of muscle pathologies in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) models [^40ce528b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

For oxandrolone, our mouse data showed that 4 mg/kg/day treatment from P8 partially improved survival in Smn 2B/− SMA mice, although not to the same extent observed with prednisolone. In addition, we identified that the lower dose of 1 μM oxandrolone in vitro attenuated canonical atrophy in C2C12 myotubes, while in vivo oxandrolone attenuated neuromuscular dysfunction in severe SMA C. elegans model, suggesting that in both our SMA vertebrate and invertebrate species oxandrolone may be a beneficial SMN-independent treatment option.

An additional factor that could contribute to the different pharmacological response in observed in our mouse and C. elegans models is sex-specific differences. Indeed, emerging clinical evidence collected from 3838 SMA patients across 18 countries shows that severe neuromuscular pathologies are more frequent in SMA types 2 and 3b male patients compared to females. Furthermore, both metformin and oxandrolone have demonstrated sex-specific effects on muscle pathology. Indeed, metformin treatment significantly improved skeletal muscle function only in the female mouse model for CMDT1A. On the other hand, studies with Ar knock out (KO) rodent models have demonstrated that Ar absence does not have the same impact on female muscle size compared to males. In addition, it is suggested that intramuscular Ar content may have a stronger influence on hypertrophy than peripheral androgen levels, suggesting that oxandrolone may be more beneficial in males. Thus, future studies need to take into consideration the sex of the SMA models when evaluating drug efficacy.

### Sarcopenia [^7218e0c6]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Sarcopenia is the accelerated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function commonly, but not exclusively, associated with advancing age. It is observed across many species including humans in whom it can lead to decline in physical function and mobility as well as to increased risk of adverse outcomes including falls, fractures and premature mortality. Although prevalence estimates vary because sarcopenia has been defined in different ways, even using a conservative approach, the prevalence is between 5% and 10% in the general population. A life course framework has been proposed for understanding not only the occurrence of sarcopenia in later life but also influences operating at earlier life stages with potentially important implications for preventive strategies. Harnessing progress in understanding the hallmarks of ageing has been key to understanding sarcopenia pathophysiology. Considerable convergence in approaches to diagnosis of sarcopenia has occurred over the last 10 years, with a growing emphasis on the central importance of muscle strength. Resistance exercise is currently the mainstay of treatment; however, it is not suitable for all. Hence, adjunctive and alternative treatments to improve quality of life are needed. An internationally agreed approach to definition and diagnosis will enable a step change in the field and is likely to be available in the near future through the Global Leadership Initiative in Sarcopenia.

### Disuse atrophy of human skeletal muscle: cell signaling and potential interventions [^368443e1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

In response to atrophic stimuli, physical alterations include decreases in fiber diameter and contractile protein content. Despite the fact that these phenotypical alterations have been well characterized, the signaling pathways that mediate these adaptations are still under investigation. There have been significant advances in the past few years delineating signal transduction pathways that regulate protein turnover. In the process of evaluating the effect of various atrophy-inducing stimuli on signal transduction pathways in skeletal muscle, it is apparent that differences do exist concerning both transcriptional and translational adaptations. To this end, it is hypothesized that the processes responsible for invoking skeletal muscle atrophy are unique, despite similar upstream signals and downstream phenotypical adaptations. If this is the case, countermeasures to attenuate atrophy may be more effective if they are designed to accommodate molecular alterations specific to the atrophic stimulus. The aim of this review was to characterize the recent work in humans elucidating the molecular basis of skeletal muscle atrophy in response to immobilization, unloading, spinal cord injury, and detraining to highlight the possibility that all skeletal muscle atrophy is not the same. With an increased understanding of the unique signaling pathways that regulate skeletal muscle protein turnover in the face of various atrophy models, it is possible to exploit these pathways to develop countermeasures to prevent or attenuate atrophy. Eugenics, gene therapy, pharmacology, nutritional, and physical countermeasures are discussed concerning their potential to treat or mitigate atrophy.

Understanding the trajectory of skeletal muscle loss, evaluating its relationship to the subsequent functional impairment, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle wasting will provide goals for novel treatment strategies in the intensive care setting. A focused approach on the effect of critical illness on muscle morphology, muscle protein turnover, and the associated muscle-signaling pathways during the early and recovery stages of critical illness is required. This could potentially lead to targeted pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies to treat, or even prevent, peripheral muscle wasting and weakness.

### Emerging ideas: matrix metalloproteinase-2 in muscle atrophy [^37f6a821]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle atrophy impacts almost every patient seen for orthopaedic conditions. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is available to date. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, are involved in skeletal muscle atrophy. MMP-2 null mice reportedly have substantially reduced muscle atrophy after tendon transection compared with wild-type mice, suggesting MMP-2 plays an important role in muscle atrophy. Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, a newly-discovered intracellular form of MMP-2 suggests a possible novel mechanism of MMP-2 digesting muscle matrix during muscle atrophy. I propose a new pharmacologic treatment for muscle atrophy using selective MMP-2 inhibitors. QUESTIONS/HYPOTHESIS: I hypothesize: (1) intracellular MMP-2 plays an important role during muscle atrophy by digesting intramuscular matrix; (2) AP-1 and NFAT signal transduction pathways are responsible for expression and activation of the intracellular MMP-2 during muscle atrophy; and (3) specific MMP-2 inhibitors can serve as a novel pharmacologic strategy in treating disuse-induced muscle atrophy.

Method Of Study

Expression and activity of extracellular and intracellular MMP-2 will be determined in a mouse tendon transection model. The role of AP-1 and NFAT signal transduction pathways in MMP-2 transcriptional regulation in muscle atrophy will be determined using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). I also will test the feasibility of treating muscle atrophy using selective MMP-2 inhibitors.

Significance

Understanding the signaling transduction pathway of extracellular and intracellular MMP-2 expression during muscle atrophy may lead to novel treatments for muscle atrophy that preserve the normal physiologic function of MMP-2.

### Muscle atrophy in CKD: a historical perspective of advancements in its understanding [^40dcbba4]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This perspective reviews the seminal clinical and experimental observations that led to today's current mechanistic model of muscle protein loss (wasting) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Results and Conclusion

Early International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) meetings facilitated discussions and hypotheses about the causes of muscle wasting in CKD. It became widely recognized that wasting is common and correlated with increased risks of mortality and morbidity. Although anorexia and dietary restrictions contribute to muscle loss, several features of CKD-associated wasting cannot be explained by malnutrition alone. The protein catabolism-inducing actions of metabolic acidosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, endocrine disorders and uremic toxins were progressively identified. Continued research to understand the interactions of inflammation, anabolic resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, exercise, and nutrition on muscle protein turnover in patients with CKD will hopefully accelerate discoveries and treatments to ameliorate muscle wasting as well as the progression of CKD.

### Sarcopenia: European consensus on definition and diagnosis: report of the European working group on sarcopenia in older people [^3c3e784e]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

Challenges of managing sarcopenia

Depending on the literature definition used for sarcopenia, the prevalence in 60–70-year-olds is reported as 5–13%, while the prevalence ranges from 11 to 50% in people > 80 years. The number of people around the world aged ≥ 60 years was estimated at 600 million in the year 2000, a figure that is expected to rise to 1.2 billion by 2025 and 2 billion by 2050. Even with a conservative estimate of prevalence, sarcopenia affects > 50 million people today and will affect > 200 million in the next 40 years.

The impact of sarcopenia on older people is far reaching; its substantial tolls are measured in terms of morbidity, disability, high costs of health care and mortality. Because the consequences of sarcopenia in older people are serious and life-changing, health care professionals everywhere are challenged to work together to turn our growing body of knowledge into actions that will improve the health and wellbeing of millions of older people around the world.

Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment. To this end, the ESWGOP committee members and their allied organisations encourage health care professionals to seek answers to the following questions:
What is the role of nutrition in prevention and treatment of age-related sarcopenia? What amounts of macronutrients are needed for older people with or at risk for sarcopenia, especially protein and specific amino acids? What micronutrients, e.g. vitamin D, play important roles in protecting and building lean body mass? And does the timing for intake of meals and/or dietary supplements make a difference?
What is the role of physical activity in prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in older people? What exercises are best suited and most effective for older people? How can older people be enabled to take more habitual physical activity? For people who have marked physical limitations, are there alternatives to traditional exercise programmes? How can nutrition and exercise regimens be combined for prevention of treatment of sarcopenia?
Do any specific medications have sufficient evidence-based support for treatment of sarcopenia? If not, what are the current candidate drugs? What study designs and outcome measures will be acceptable for drug labelling?

### Does early exercise attenuate muscle atrophy or bone loss after spinal cord injury? [^6d38bc88]. Spinal Cord (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To systematically identify and assess the evidence on the efficacy of exercise initiated early after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Methods

A comprehensive search (Any-2014) of eleven databases identified studies evaluating exercise interventions initiated within 12 weeks after SCI on muscle and bone loss in paralyzed limbs and comparing with standard care or immobilization. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality. One reviewer extracted data and critiqued results according to the Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Evidence body of evidence framework.

Results

A total of 2811 titles were screened. Eleven studies were included: five randomized controlled trials, four cohort studies and two within-subject control studies. All provided level II evidence with a moderate risk of bias. Two studies found significant positive effects of high-load FES-resisted stance on physiological measures of muscle. Three reported positive effects of 3 months of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) on muscle size. Two studies found positive effects of 6-month body-weight supported treadmill training or FES on trabecular bone using pQCT.

Conclusion

We found consistent evidence of positive effects of early exercise on muscle, possibly related to load intensity of the protocol. However, the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes makes this determination speculative. Evidence for the effectiveness of early exercise on bone is scant and confined to measures of trabecular bone mineral density via pQCT. Transparent reporting of methods and variability of data, combined with standardization of valid and sensitive measures of muscle atrophy and bone loss, could facilitate future meta-analysis on this topic.

### New horizons in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of sarcopenia [^207e9e56]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Drug treatment

Sarcopenia is now a major focus for drug discovery and development. However, debate about the best primary outcome measure for trials is ongoing and various promising therapeutic avenues to date have proved unsatisfactory. Growth hormone has been used for some years to improve muscle mass, but the data supporting an associated increase in function have not been convincing. The therapeutic use of testosterone had a setback recently when a major trial had to be stopped early because of side effects. Perhaps a more promising area at present is the idea of 'new tricks for old drugs'. For example, there is some evidence for the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in improving physical function which may be mediated through a direct effect on muscle, and a number of studies are currently underway in this area. An important consideration that has previously often been overlooked is the potential for commonly used drugs to also have adverse effects on skeletal muscle function. For example, we have shown that many prescribed medications are associated with lower grip strength and this appears to be partly independent of co-morbidities.

### Muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease promulgates premature death: established, emerging and potential novel treatment strategies [^898f7587]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle mass loss and function in the future.

### Skeletal muscle loss: cachexia, sarcopenia, and inactivity [^c34e96cb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Loss of skeletal muscle mass occurs during aging (sarcopenia), disease (cachexia), or inactivity (atrophy). This article contrasts and compares the metabolic causes of loss of muscle resulting from these conditions. An understanding of the underlying causes of muscle loss is critical for the development of strategies and therapies to preserve muscle mass and function. Loss of skeletal muscle protein results from an imbalance between the rate of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Cachexia, sarcopenia, and atrophy due to inactivity are characterized by a loss of muscle mass. Each of these conditions results in a metabolic adaptation of increased protein degradation (cachexia), decreased rate of muscle protein synthesis (inactivity), or an alteration in both (sarcopenia). The clinical consequences of bedrest may mimic those of cachexia, including rapid loss of muscle, insulin resistance, and weakness. Prophylaxis against bedrest-induced atrophy includes nutrition support with an emphasis on high-quality protein. Nutritional supplementation alone may not prevent muscle loss secondary to cachexia, but, in combination with the use of an anabolic agent, it may slow or prevent muscle loss.

### The role of blood flow restriction therapy following knee surgery: expert opinion [^f4a5457c]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy is becoming increasingly popular in musculoskeletal injury rehabilitation. In particular, this form of therapy is being utilized more often in the postoperative setting following knee surgery, including anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. BFR therapy provides patients and clinicians an alternative treatment option to standard muscle strengthening and hypertrophy guidelines in the setting of postoperative pain, weakness, and postoperative activity restrictions that contribute to muscle atrophy. The ability to complete exercise in a low load environment and achieve similar physiological adaptations as high-intensity strength training makes this modality appealing. With poor patient-related outcomes associated with continued muscle atrophy, pain, and muscle weakness, some researchers have investigated BFR training postoperatively following arthroscopic knee surgery with promising results. However, owing to the current paucity of research studies, inconsistency among reported protocols, and mixed results, it may be some time before a mass adoption of BFR therapy is made into the world of orthopaedic rehabilitation. Although the current data is inconclusive, we choose to utilize BFR in postoperative knee patients, regardless of weight-bearing status, for whom maintenance of existing muscle mass or improvement of decreased postoperative strength levels is important. Therefore, the purpose of this expert opinion is to review the background of BFR, describe the clinical evidence of BFR following knee surgery, and report the authors' current recommendations for application of BFR postoperatively.

### Maintaining muscle function across the lifespan: the state of science [^6aee7c5f]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome currently defined as pathological loss of muscle mass and function. Sarcopenia is not only a major contributor to loss of physical function in older adults but is also associated with increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs. As a complex and multifactorial syndrome, sarcopenia has been associated with numerous degenerative changes during the aging process, but there is building evidence for significant contributions to the development of sarcopenia from neurodegenerative changes in the peripheral nervous system. A variety of interventions have been investigated for the treatment of sarcopenia, but current management is primarily focused on nutrition and therapeutic exercise interventions. Great strides have been made to improve screening procedures and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia, but continued optimization of diagnostic and screening strategies is needed to better identify individuals with sarcopenia or at risk of developing sarcopenia. Understanding and addressing the major drivers of sarcopenia pathogenesis will help develop therapeutics that can reduce the impact of sarcopenia on affected individuals and society.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^a29a6135]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) — treatment options for muscle protection and improvement: The guideline group recommends that women with POI should be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle (including healthy diet, physical activity, avoiding smoking, and maintaining normal body weight) to aid muscle health. HCPs may consider prescribing resistance exercise for women with POI and impaired muscle parameters as resistance exercise increases muscle mass, strength and performance in other populations, although specific evidence in women with POI is lacking. It is suggested that HCPs inform women with POI that HRT prescribed for other indications may also benefit muscle health. The effect of other interventions, including testosterone therapy, on muscle health in women with POI is uncertain and therefore they should not be offered.

### Sarcopenia [^dd62829e]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalised skeletal muscle disorder involving the accelerated loss of muscle mass and function that is associated with increased adverse outcomes including falls, functional decline, frailty, and mortality. It occurs commonly as an age-related process in older people, influenced not only by contemporaneous risk factors, but also by genetic and lifestyle factors operating across the life course. It can also occur in mid-life in association with a range of conditions. Sarcopenia has become the focus of intense research aiming to translate current knowledge about its pathophysiology into improved diagnosis and treatment, with particular interest in the development of biomarkers, nutritional interventions, and drugs to augment the beneficial effects of resistance exercise. Designing effective preventive strategies that people can apply during their lifetime is of primary concern. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of sarcopenia is likely to become part of routine clinical practice.

### Therapeutic advances in muscular dystrophy [^702e0bb5]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Unmet Needs

As with all diseases that are severely debilitating and incurable, the need for treatment options in the muscular dystrophy population is manifest. As new therapeutic options enter into development, both investigators and patient groups recognize the need to facilitate and expedite clinical trials. To further this goal, it will be important to characterize the current natural history of these diseases and to develop outcome measures specific to the muscular dystrophy population. The most appropriate outcome measures will likely include clinical measurements and patient-reported outcomes as well as more novel imaging and biochemical disease markers. The identification, organization, and stratification of patient groups through registries and the collection of clinical and genotype data will also be important aspects of clinical trial preparedness.–Further research on medical management and standards of care is also a significant unmet need in the muscular dystrophy population. There is considerable variability in the clinical management of these diseases, and studies are underway to help us better understand the risks and benefits of medical interventions (such as the various corticosteroid dosing regimens) and to make better-informed treatment recommendations.

The management of the muscular dystrophies relies heavily on nonpharmacologic interventions that span multiple disciplines. Of particular interest to this patient population is the role of physical therapy, exercise, and other muscle stimulation techniques that can utilize endogenous mechanisms of muscle growth.–This issue is controversial, as efforts to increase muscle strength through exercise may be countered by the risk of overuse and excessive breakdown of muscle that has limited regenerative capacity.–Numerous studies have examined a variety of exercise programs in small numbers of patients with various types of muscular dystrophy, and there is evidence that some of these programs can be performed safely and at least temporarily improve muscle function.–However, the lack of uniformity in exercise protocols and outcome measures has been a limiting factor in the development of widely applicable exercise guidelines.–Although there is a demand for guidance on the relative benefits and potential harms (both medical and financial) of the numerous physical therapy options that confront patients, many of these interventions cannot be easily studied and measured under the methodologies that produce the highest levels of evidence (adequately powered, randomized placebo-controlled trials). Greater ingenuity in study design and data analysis is needed to understand their contribution to muscle health and to formulate guidelines on their use.

### Restorative neurostimulation: a clinical guide for therapy adoption [^9174d8f9]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Future Landscape and Indication Expansion

Presently, there are limited therapeutic options to address this specific etiology of lower back pain. Therapeutic options for low back pain involve corticosteroid injections or ablation of nerves, which transmit nociceptive pain signals. These traditionally involve repeated procedures with temporary and palliative pain relief. Furthermore, the use of palliative treatments may often lead to further weakening of the multifidi muscles resulting in motor dysfunction and sagittal imbalance, and as a result, worsened functional instability. This not only worsens the debility of the patient but also strains the medical system. Multifidi stimulation dramatically changes the treatment paradigm, focusing on restoration of function and potentially ending the need for ongoing procedures.

With evidence supporting the use of restorative neurostimulation in the lumbosacral spine, application to address various other chronic pain etiologies is a natural evolution. For example, future studies in axial neck and thoracic spine pain may also demonstrate meaningful treatment effects.

In the original Reactiv8-A and B studies, patients with prior history of spine surgeries were excluded. The purpose of those original studies was to study the effectiveness of restorative therapy for low back pain without the addition of confounding variables. Post-laminectomy syndrome (also called failed back surgery syndrome, FBSS), used to describe patients that present with persistent or recurring low back pain, with or without referred pain to the lower extremities, is quite common. The incidence of FBSS, depending on the type of surgery performed, is estimated to be between 10% and 40%. The pathogenesis of FBSS is primarily structural. Myofascial pain can also be a pain generator, secondary to intraoperative insult to the muscles, and compounded by postural changes in the postoperative period. Clinically, multifidus atrophy as a result of underlying inhibition and functional instability may be observed in these patients at the unfused segmental levels. In patients where the innervation and musculature near the painful level remain intact, restorative neurostimulation may potentially provide clinical benefits. This may be another subject of a future clinical trial.

A common sequela of fusion is adjacent segment disease. This occurs secondary to the displacement of physiologic stresses placed above and below previously fused levels. The use of neurostimulation to improve functional stability may potentially deter or postpone the onset of this issue.

Restorative neurostimulation may be applied to non-spinal anatomical targets where there are radiographic or clinical findings of muscle atrophy and/or functional instability. Examples of targets include peripheral joints – where both radiofrequency ablation and peripheral nerve stimulation have been used with increased frequency.

### Sarcopenia: revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis [^22c5e0aa]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Filling the gaps for sarcopenia awareness, care and research design

Many aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of sarcopenia are better understood today than 10 years ago. Researchers have identified links between muscle pathology and adverse health outcomes, and studies have also provided evidence that certain treatment strategies can help prevent or delay adverse consequences.

Such new insights led EWGSOP2 to review, 'What is new?' and 'How can we use this knowledge to improve care for people with sarcopenia and to guide future research studies?' These insights include:
First, sarcopenia has long been associated with ageing and older people, but the development of sarcopenia is now recognised to begin earlier in life, and the sarcopenia phenotype has many contributing causes beyond ageing. These insights have implications for interventions that prevent or delay development of sarcopenia.
Second, sarcopenia is now considered a muscle disease (muscle failure), with low muscle strength overtaking the role of low muscle mass as a principal determinant. This change is expected to facilitate prompt identification of sarcopenia in practice.
Third, sarcopenia is associated with low muscle quantity and quality, but these parameters are now used mainly in research rather than in clinical practice. Muscle mass and muscle quality are technically difficult to measure accurately.
Fourth, sarcopenia has been overlooked and undertreated in mainstream practice, apparently due to the complexity of determining what variables to measure, how to measure them, what cut-off points best guide diagnosis and treatment, and how to best evaluate effects of therapeutic interventions. To this end, EWGSOP2 aims to provide clear rationale for selection of diagnostic measures and cut-off points relevant to clinical practice.

To enhance awareness and care for sarcopenia, the EWGSOP2 has updated its definition and diagnostic strategies in 2018. Specific goals for the updates were to: (1) build a sarcopenia definition that reflects recent advances in scientific, epidemiological, and clinical knowledge about skeletal muscle, (2) identify variables that best detect sarcopenia and predict outcomes, and determine best tools for measuring each variable, (3) advise cut-off points for measured variables and (4) recommend an updated screening and assessment pathway that is easy to use in clinical practice.

### Mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy [^9acdfadc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent clinical and mechanistic studies have shown that increased proteolysis is a major determinant of muscle wasting in numerous catabolic states and of alterations in myopathies or dystrophies. The implications of these observations for improving muscle mass and function are discussed.

Recent Findings

Several proteolytic systems (i.e. the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the lysosomal, the Ca-dependent, and the caspase systems) are responsible for muscle wasting. The Ca-dependent and caspase systems may initiate myofibrillar proteolysis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is believed to degrade actin and myosin heavy chain and, consequently, plays a major role in muscle wasting. Multiple steps in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ubiquitination, deubiquitination, proteasome activities) are upregulated in muscle wasting diseases. Few key components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that are strictly necessary for muscle wasting have been so far characterized. Recent studies have led to the elucidation of various signaling pathways of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that are activated in muscle wasting conditions.

Summary

Although the precise role of the different muscle proteolytic machineries is still largely unknown, current studies are leading to new pharmacologic approaches that can be useful in blocking or partially preventing muscle wasting or improving muscle function in human patients.

### Cachexia / protein energy wasting syndrome in CKD: causation and treatment [^163551f7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome defined by significant body weight loss, fat and muscle mass reduction, and increased protein catabolism. Protein energy wasting (PEW) is characterized as a syndrome of adverse changes in nutrition and body composition being highly prevalent in patients with CKD, especially in those undergoing dialysis, and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality in this population. Multiple mechanisms are involved in the genesis of these adverse nutritional changes in CKD patients. There is no obvious distinction between PEW and cachexia from a pathophysiologic standpoint and should be considered as part of the spectrum of the same nutritional disorder in CKD with similar management approaches for prevention and treatment based on current understanding. A plethora of factors can affect the nutritional status of CKD patients requiring a combination of therapeutic approaches to prevent or reverse protein and energy depletion. At present, there is no effective pharmacologic intervention that prevents or attenuates muscle atrophy in catabolic conditions like CKD. Prevention and treatment of uremic muscle wasting involve optimal nutritional support, correction of acidosis, and physical exercise. There has been emerging consistent evidence that active treatment, perhaps by combining nutritional interventions and resistance exercise, may be able to improve but not totally reverse or prevent the supervening muscle wasting and weakness. Active research into more direct pharmacological treatment based on basic mechanistic research is much needed for this unmet medical need in patients with CKD.

### Emerging therapies and challenges in spinal muscular atrophy [^95147a77]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Care

In parallel with preclinical advances, continued improvements in multidisciplinary care and technological advances have altered the natural history of SMA since the Consensus Statement for standards of care in SMA was published in 2007 (Table 2; Appendix 1) 16; however, even in areas of general consensus, marked variability in the implementation of the standards of care, particularly in the use of ventilation, nutritional support, and scoliosis surgery, have been observed. 17, 18 For patients participating in clinical trials, it is crucial to standardize the management of modifiable factors, particularly nutrition and respiratory support, given that differences in care practices may impact outcome. However, at the most severe end of the SMA phenotypic spectrum, in the setting of uncertain therapeutic efficacy, this remains a challenge. Advances in drug development are likely to impact the standards of care for SMA, particularly given that successful disease modification will inevitably alter natural history and necessitate new standards of supportive care and interventions.

### Study design and rationale for the phase 3 clinical development program of enobosarm, a selective androgen receptor modulator, for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in cancer patients (POWER trials) [^08f012be]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Muscle wasting in cancer is a common and often occult condition that can occur prior to overt signs of weight loss and before a clinical diagnosis of cachexia can be made. Muscle wasting in cancer is an important and independent predictor of progressive functional impairment, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Although several therapeutic agents are currently in development for the treatment of muscle wasting or cachexia in cancer, the majority of these agents do not directly inhibit muscle loss. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have the potential to increase lean body mass (LBM) and hence muscle mass, without the untoward side effects seen with traditional anabolic agents. Enobosarm, a nonsteroidal SARM, is an agent in clinical development for prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with cancer (POWER 1 and 2 trials). The POWER trials are two identically designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, and multinational phase 3 trials to assess the efficacy of enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in subjects initiating first-line chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To assess enobosarm's effect on both prevention and treatment of muscle wasting, no minimum weight loss is required. These pivotal trials have pioneered the methodological and regulatory fields exploring a therapeutic agent for cancer-associated muscle wasting, a process hereby described. In each POWER trial, subjects will receive placebo (n = 150) or enobosarm 3 mg (n = 150) orally once daily for 147 days. Physical function, assessed as stair climb power (SCP), and LBM, assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), are the co-primary efficacy endpoints in both trials assessed at day 84. Based on extensive feedback from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the co-primary endpoints will be analyzed as a responder analysis. To be considered a physical function responder, a subject must have ≥ 10% improvement in physical function compared to baseline. To meet the definition of response on LBM, a subject must have demonstrated no loss of LBM compared with baseline. Secondary endpoints include durability of response assessed at day 147 in those responding at day 84. A combined overall survival analysis for both studies is considered a key secondary safety endpoint. The POWER trials design was established with extensive clinical input and collaboration with regulatory agencies. The efficacy endpoints are a result of this feedback and discussion of the threshold for clinical benefit in patients at risk for muscle wasting. Full results from these studies will soon be published and will further guide the development of future anabolic trials. Clinical Trial ID: NCT01355484. NCT01355497.

### Consolidating concepts from recent international expert consensus on sarcopenia: implications for heart failure management [^a10d1987]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome associated with a range of pathophysiological disorders including secondary sarcopenia that reduces patients' quality of life, mobility, physical fitness and capacity to undergo rehabilitation and recovery from acute decompensation. Although international expert writing groups have convened and developed consensus documents for sarcopenia, the vast majority of the content has focused on the disorder from the aging perspective. Heart failure is rarely or not considered in the available consensus statements and recommendations. Moreover, there are differences in the sarcopenia diagnostic criteria pertaining to race/ethnicity (translating into differences in body composition and anthropometry), investigative methodologies, practice pattern, and variation in access to healthcare resources across nations that are not discussed in the current heart failure management guidelines. Here, we review the key contents from the recent major international consensus documents on sarcopenia published between 2019 and 2024; highlight the gaps in knowledge (e.g. sarcopenic obesity, cardiac atrophy/wasting) and recent developments in heart failure treatment (e.g. sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor) and intervention (e.g. rehabilitation, inspiratory muscle training) that may benefit sarcopenia; and reformulate the 4-step pathway of early screening, investigation, diagnosis, and severity determination ("Find-Assess-Confirm-Severity") for sarcopenia as a vital part of heart failure management under a multidisciplinary care team.

### New horizons in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of sarcopenia [^12063724]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Future directions

A deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sarcopenia, derived from both human and animal studies, has great potential to identify novel targets for drug and other treatment strategies as well as to develop better biomarkers to monitor the efficacy of various interventions. Another exciting new area is the application of a lifecourse approach to the understanding and management of sarcopenia. This approach recognises that muscle mass and function in later life reflect not only the rate of muscle loss, but also the peak attained earlier in life (Figure 3). Therefore, in addition to identifying the determinants of skeletal muscle loss, there needs to be focus on the factors associated with peak muscle mass and strength such as birth weight and early nutrition as well as the mechanisms underlying these associations. Importantly, the lifecourse approach suggests that there is potential for prevention and intervention at earlier stages of life rather than just when sarcopenia has become established although to date the evidence is scanty. This is a fertile area for future research.

### Disease-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and fatigue [^c92e7b64]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2016). Low credibility.

Numerous health problems, including acute critical illness, cancer, diseases associated with chronic inflammation, and neurological disorders, often result in skeletal muscle weakness and fatigue. Disease-related muscle atrophy and fatigue is an important clinical problem because acquired skeletal muscle weakness can increase the duration of hospitalization, result in exercise limitation, and contribute to a poor quality of life. Importantly, skeletal muscle atrophy is also associated with increased morbidity and mortality of patients. Therefore, improving our understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for skeletal muscle weakness and fatigue in patients is a required first step to develop clinical protocols to prevent these skeletal muscle problems. This review will highlight the consequences and potential mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle atrophy and fatigue in patients experiencing acute critical illness, cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, and neurological disorders.

### Effects of therapeutic interventions on long COVID: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0008c503]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory muscle training is a form of exercise designed to enhance respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Several factors contribute to its potential as an effective treatment option. First, the virus itself can damage respiratory muscles and lung tissue. Second, prolonged bed rest or mechanical ventilation may lead to muscle atrophy due to reduced usage. Third, compromised respiratory muscle and lung function can limit exercise capacity in the post-acute phase, complicating rehabilitation efforts. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of respiratory muscle training in improving respiratory muscle function. However, there was no beneficial effect of respiratory muscle training on lung function, with a previous meta-analysis on the effect of respiratory muscle training showing the same results as ours. This discrepancy underscores the need for additional studies to further validate its effectiveness.

tDCS is a non-invasive therapeutic technique that works by modulating cortical excitability and neuronal activity through the application of a direct current to targeted brain regions. Previous studies have suggested that anodal tDCS, when applied to the primary motor and/or sensory cortex (M1/S1) and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), may help alleviate fatigue from various causes. Our meta-analysis results indicated that tDCS had a positive effect on physical fatigue, although the change in the total MFIS score was not statistically significant. Due to its non-invasive nature and ease of use, tDCS may emerge as a promising treatment option in the future. However, further research is needed to firmly establish its efficacy before it can be widely implemented in clinical settings.

### Study design and rationale for the phase 3 clinical development program of enobosarm, a selective androgen receptor modulator, for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in cancer patients (POWER trials) [^5150108d]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical Methods

The two trials differ only in the choices of chemotherapy. Both trials will evaluate the same endpoints of lean body mass and stair climb power. After discussion with US and European regulatory authorities, it was decided that different methods of analysis of the SCP and LBM end points would be used in the two regions.

For the US authorities, a responder analysis will be performed for LBM and SCP as coprimary endpoints.

For European authorities, SCP will be the primary endpoint and LBM secondary. Both will be analyzed by longitudinal analysis of percent change from baseline through days 84 and 147. Both analyses have different strengths and weaknesses, but will be complementary to understanding the treatment outcomes for enobosarm in the population and are further described below.

The design proposed to US regulatory authorities is a responder analysis consisting of co-primary end points, one for physical function and one for LBM. Physical function response is defined as ≥ 10% improvement from baseline to day 84, and LBM response is defined as no loss of LBM from baseline to day 84. Non-response is a failure to meet the response definition or not having the day-84 assessment for any reason. Missing data is accounted for by this definition of non-response. The design assumes a proportion of response among treated subjects of 0.20 above the control response proportion for each of the physical function and LBM endpoints. Retrospective application of the response definitions to the subset of NSCLC subjects in the predecessor phase 2b trial showed the maximum control response was 25% for the LBM endpoint (19% for SCP); this was inflated to 30%, that the difference in the proportions responding to both end points was approximately 0.20, and with other parameters α = 0.05 and power = 90%, the sample size required was 124 subjects per arm. Built into the computation above was the assumption that 30% of subjects would be considered non-responders due to missing the day 84 primary endpoint assessment. FDA requested that the sample size be increased to 150 subjects per arm for the purposes of the safety data base. The 0.20 difference in proportion of response between the two arms covers a wide range of possible control response proportions so that for control, response proportions from 0.20 to 0.75 all have power > 90% to detect a 0.20 difference at α = 0.05 with 150 subjects per arm. Specifically, at the aforementioned 0.30 control, response power is 93.3%. Overall study success for US purposes is defined as rejecting the null hypothesis for both primary endpoints using a two-sided type I error probability of 0.05 for each. Considering the need for both co-primaries to be statistically significant, the power for each trial is at least 86.5% under the assumption of no correlation between endpoints.

### Bimagrumab vs optimized standard of care for treatment of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1c9f74e8]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Three key conclusions can be drawn from this randomized clinical trial with its well-characterized, international sample of older adults with sarcopenia after 24 weeks of treatment with bimagrumab. First, bimagrumab safely increases LBM within 4 to 8 weeks, and this is maintained with continuous exposure. Second, drugs that promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy exclusively without affecting other aspects of muscle function, such as neuromotor or metabolic activity, likely will not improve muscle strength or functional performance sufficiently as monotherapy to have a clinical impact. Third, adequate nutritional intake (including protein, calories, and vitamin D) and habitual light exercise can improve physical performance in men and women with sarcopenia to the extent that they no longer meet the disease criteria. These data, when combined with clearer diagnostic criteria, a new International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code, and the recent clinical practice treatment guidelines, support the consideration of sarcopenia as a treatable muscle disease with dietary and exercise prescription, and a reversible cause of disability in older adults. Physicians should be encouraged to evaluate older patients for the presence of sarcopenia and provide nutritional and physical therapy prescriptions and referrals to reliable, convenient exercise programs accordingly.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^f9f3a323]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Resistance exercise is a promising intervention for the treatment of sarcopenia. However, as with other therapeutic strategies, appropriate prescription of RE is essential to maximise its beneficial effects. The limited availability of relevant studies means that it is not currently possible to provide a fully evidence-based prescription of RE for sarcopenia and there remains a need for relevant intervention studies and trials involving older adults diagnosed with sarcopenia to provide this information. This review provides a pragmatic approach where RE programmes are developed based on the fundamental principles of exercise training including specificity, overload and progression and individualised to induce the desired adaptive response in each older adult. The proposed RE prescription outlined in this paper provides a useful resource for clinicians and exercise practitioners treating older adults with sarcopenia and may also be of value to researchers for standardising approaches to RE interventions in sarcopenia studies.

### Developing consensus criteria for sarcopenia: an update [^da2d9394]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, is a major cause of impaired physical function, which contributes to mobility disability, falls and hospitalizations in older adults. Lower muscle mass and strength are also associated with lower bone mineral density and greater risk for osteoporotic fractures. Thus, identification of sarcopenia could be important for fracture prevention as it may help improve fracture risk assessment, and muscle mass and strength can be improved with exercise, even among the frailest older adults. Unfortunately, there are no consensus diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. Consequently there is no guidance to help clinicians identify older adults with clinically meaningful low muscle mass or weakness. Further, development of novel sarcopenia therapies is hindered not only due to the difficulty in identifying participants for clinical trials, and but also because there are no validated, clinically appropriate endpoints for assessment of treatment efficacy. There is currently a major push to establish a consensus definition of sarcopenia, and recent work holds promise that this goal may be within reach. This article discusses the evolution of the definition of sarcopenia, and focuses on the latest recommended diagnostic criteria proposed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia Project. While these empirically-based cut-points for clinically important low muscle mass and weakness are a significant step forward for the sarcopenia field, important questions remain to be answered before consensus diagnostic criteria can be definitively established. Ongoing work to refine sarcopenia criteria will further advance the field and bring this important contributor to falls, fractures and disability into the mainstream of clinical care and ultimately lead to better quality of life with aging.

### Therapeutic advances in muscular dystrophy [^614e7ac9]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The muscular dystrophies comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that produce progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. There has been rapid growth and change in our understanding of these disorders in recent years, and advances in basic science are being translated into increasing numbers of clinical trials. This review will discuss therapeutic developments in 3 of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. Each of these disorders represents a different class of genetic disease (monogenic, epigenetic, and repeat expansion disorders), and the approach to therapy addresses the diverse and complex molecular mechanisms involved in these diseases. The large number of novel pharmacologic agents in development with good biologic rationale and strong proof of concept suggests there will be an improved quality of life for individuals with muscular dystrophy.

### Anabolic androgenic steroids in orthopaedic surgery: current concepts and clinical applications [^c97cf6ef]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic injury and accompanying surgery are almost always associated with the development of disuse muscle atrophy, which lengthens recovery and delays return to full strength. Disuse atrophy has been linked to negative outcomes in common orthopaedic procedures including but not limited to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and lower extremity fracture repair. Recent evidence suggests that the anabolic effects of AASs in muscle may be an effective method to improve postoperative recovery after such procedures. For example, the anabolic environment induced by AAS may also improve biological healing in specific clinical scenarios including muscle injury, fracture repair, and rotator cuff repair. Although the degree of direct muscle and bone healing from AAS administration remains inconclusive, a recent series of preclinical experiments demonstrated that AASs may halt fatty infiltration and improve healing of a repaired rotator cuff. This application highlights the potential of AASs to address the underlying pathophysiology in one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal pain and disability.

To our knowledge, the last review to focus on the therapeutic applications of AAS in orthopaedic surgery was published in 2004, which was before many recent studies on the short-term use of AAS. The purpose of this present review is to provide a summary of the current status of AAS applications in orthopaedic surgery, with an emphasis on preclinical data, clinical studies, and future directions.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^4016c090]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Testosterone and androgen analogs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are reported across small trials with mixed functional effects. In a study with resistance training, a weekly injection of 100 mg of testosterone enanthate for 10 weeks increased testosterone to the middle of the range seen in healthy young men, with improvements in leg muscle strength and lean mass. In 29 men given intramuscular testosterone every 4 weeks for 26 weeks, fat-free mass increased with concomitant reductions in fat mass. Nandrolone every 2 weeks for 8 weeks produced small increases in lean body mass and respiratory muscle strength, while stanozolol administration to 10 men increased body weight and lean body mass but showed no endurance exercise changes. Oxandrolone led to weight gain without 6-minute walking distance improvement in a 4-month observational cohort of Forty-nine patients with COPD, and a randomized multicenter trial of 142 underweight patients found increased lean mass, decreased fat mass, and unchanged 6-minute walking distance. In 33 men treated with nandrolone for 8 weeks, lean body mass increased but strength and endurance did not differ significantly from matched controls, although patients on maintenance low dose of systemic corticosteroids showed improvements in respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity. Another trial randomized 16 patients to biweekly nandrolone or placebo for 16 weeks and found no between-group differences in body composition, muscle function, or quality-of-life measures. Mechanistic sampling during resistance training showed a global increase in MHC, IGF, and myogenin mRNA, and increased endothelial and neuronal NOS proteins with testosterone supplementation. Benefits are likely to be maximized if combined with resistance training, and testosterone supplementation cannot be currently recommended as a routine treatment of muscle atrophy in COPD; available studies are only short term and the clinical impact on exercise tolerance, quality of life, and survival is unknown.

### Long noncoding RNA lncMUMA reverses established skeletal muscle atrophy following mechanical unloading [^a476cf26]. Molecular Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical unloading induces obvious skeletal muscle atrophy and functional deficit, especially under microgravity environment during spaceflight. Exposure to microgravity for 3–6 months induces skeletal muscle atrophy with more than 40% impairment of functional properties in astronauts during spaceflight. Decreased muscle differentiation and protein synthesis are largely responsible for the mechanical unloading-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. However, to date there are no effective countermeasures to combat the mechanical unloading-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Exercises are used to replace mechanical loads during spaceflight. Astronauts on the international space station spend 5 hr/week for aerobic exercise and 3–6 days/week for resistance exercise; the exercises are insufficient to prevent loss of muscle strength and endurance.

For the pharmaceutical approaches, intake of essential amino acids has been proven to increase muscle protein synthesis in astronauts; but, there is concern that increasing amino acid intake during spaceflight may increase bone resorption. Other anabolic agents, such as insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) treatmentand anabolic androgenic steroids, have some concerns on increased risks (drug resistance and cardiac events), limiting their therapeutic use for muscle atrophy. Thus, it is desirable to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the compromised muscle anabolism during unloading-induced skeletal muscle atrophy to develop a promising muscle anabolic strategy.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^fbfbd995]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The training process (adapted from Impellizzeri and colleagues).

In the context of exercise training, the principle of specificity refers to the idea that acute training responses and chronic training adaptations are tightly coupled to the stimulus derived from the exercise performed. As such, the exercise prescribed must be specifically targeted to induce improvements in the desired outcome. For example, if a goal of the RE programme is to improve the individual's ability to rise from a chair, then exercises that target the muscle groups and the specific movement patterns involved in this activity should be selected. Overload refers to the need for exercise to place a greater than habitual stress on the body in order for adaptation to occur. Over the course of a training programme, the body continually adapts to the exercise stimulus provided. As such, there is a need to systematically increase the stress placed upon the body during training to drive continued adaptation. This is done through progression of the training stimulus. Several approaches can be used to effectively guide RE progression and decisions about when and how to progress the training stimulus should be individualised and consider tolerance of the exercise (e.g. is the increase in training stress manageable for the individual), specific goals of the RE programme and enjoyment. A progressive increase in stress may be achieved by manipulating one or more of the RE variables outlined in the following section.

Table 1
Principles of exercise training

Monitoring and evaluating the acute training response to each exercise session enables the exercise practitioner to identify when the training stimulus should be progressed or regressed to ensure appropriate overload. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), where the individual is asked to provide a subjective evaluation of how strenuous the exercise was, can be a useful method to guide exercise prescription. This approach has the added benefit of encouraging individuals to recognise the sensations of effort associated with exercise of the desired intensity. Qualitative feedback from individuals can also provide useful information about the training programme. For example, is the individual experiencing significant post-exercise muscle soreness and is this having an impact on his or her ability to perform activities of daily living or quality of life? Discussing these issues can help older adults to better understand exercise training effects and support them to actively engage in the design and delivery of their exercise programme as opposed to being passive recipients.

Body composition and diagnosis of muscle atrophy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with obesity are highlighted by the observations that clinicians are now faced with many more obese patients with COPD than lean ones, that the diagnosis of muscle atrophy may become more difficult as clinicians are likely to be misled by the presence of a normal or increased BMI, believing that this implies normal muscle mass, and that although muscle atrophy is less prevalent when BMI is normal or increased, there is still a portion of patients in this category exhibiting muscle atrophy and weakness; accordingly, the incorporation of body composition analysis in the clinical arena will become even more relevant.

### Skeletal muscle adaptations with age, inactivity, and therapeutic exercise [^0c4a3c91]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

One of the remarkable features of skeletal muscle is its adaptability. Skeletal muscle adaptations are characterized by modifications of morphological, biochemical, and molecular variables that alter the functional attributes of specific skeletal muscle fiber types. Skeletal muscle adaptation is diverse and the magnitude of change is dependent on many factors, such as activity pattern, age, and muscle fiber type composition. The adaptation of skeletal muscle in the adult population is well described. In contrast, the adaptation of skeletal muscle in the older population is less documented, especially in the area of inactivity-induced alterations. Age-related changes in skeletal muscle may play a significant role in the magnitude of change with inactivity and influence the rehabilitation process for the older adult. A consistent feature of age and inactivity is limb muscle atrophy and the loss of peak force and power. Differences exist in the rate and mechanisms of muscle wasting and in the susceptibility of a given fiber type to atrophy. Most likely, the rapid muscle wasting might be in part due to a decrease in protein synthesis coupled with an increased degradation. Besides the quantitative change in muscle mass, age and inactivity induce important qualitative changes in the structure of key skeletal muscle proteins that are manifested in alterations in contractile properties. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to identify the major effects of age and inactivity on skeletal muscle structure and function, and discuss potential therapeutic interventions. Special emphasis will be placed on how alterations in muscle structure affect function and on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the age-related and inactivity-induced muscle changes.

### Impact of very early physical therapy during septic shock on skeletal muscle: a randomized controlled trial [^5da5659d]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Despite an improvement in outcome after critical illness, survivors frequently undergo long-term impairment in physical function, impacting their quality of life. Sepsis, systemic inflammation, hyperglycemia, inadequate nutritional delivery/absorption, prolonged/deep sedation, and immobilization are factors contributing to the development of ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW).

ICUAW is considered as an organ failure and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, higher length of stay, and mortality. It includes disturbances of peripheral nerves, membrane inexcitability, and accelerated skeletal muscle atrophy. During sepsis, electrophysiology abnormalities have been reported within the first days of ICU stay. In this population, the unbalanced protein turnover is primarily attributed to an increased protein breakdown rather than a decrease in protein synthesis. Muscle proteins regulation is regulated by several anabolic (Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]) and catabolic pathways, including autophagy along with proteolytic lysosomal pathways. Dysregulation of those processes may promote the wasting of proteins.

As no pharmacologic treatment exists to restrict skeletal muscle wasting and neuromuscular dysfunction, a preventive approach is the only current treatment. Interventions include a prompt treatment of sepsis and a reduction of immobilization as soon as possible. Considering the rapid progression of ICUAW, early mobilization/physical therapy should be initiated during the first days after ICU admission.

Providing early mobilization/physical therapy during critical illness has been demonstrated to be a safe approach limiting bed rest–induced morbidity. It could represent a potential treatment to counteract sepsis-induced catabolism. Since sepsis is consistently associated with inflammation leading to multiple organ failure, septic patients frequently experienced ICUAW. Nevertheless, such interventions are often delayed as no evidence supports their safety and benefits in this high-risk population.

We hypothesized that very early physical therapy at the onset of septic shock may preserve skeletal muscle mass, through catabolic/synthesis signaling modifications.

### Aging of human muscle: understanding sarcopenia at the single muscle cell level [^6ae99429]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The loss of muscle mass with age, also known as sarcopenia, is a major scientific and public health problem. Muscle atrophy is associated with the loss of functional capacity and poor health outcomes in elderly men and women. A detailed understanding of this problem in humans can be enhanced by the use of experiments with single muscle fibers. It is likely that both muscle atrophy and a decrease in muscle-fiber quality contribute to muscle dysfunction among the elderly. A better understanding of sarcopenia at the single-fiber level may lead to the design of more effective rehabilitative interventions.

### A clinical study to assess the effects of SRT2104 upon immobilization-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in healthy human volunteers… [^14638b69]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Study Overview The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of SRT2104 upon energy production in muscle, how much sugar and fat are stored in the muscle, and the size of the muscle after receiving 2. 0 g of SRT2104 or placebo given in capsule form once a day for 28 days including a 14 day knee and lower leg immobilisation period during the final 14 days of dosing. Imaging methods, muscle biopsies and exercise tests will be used in the study to see whether the following measurements change after taking SRT2104 for 28 days, including an immobilised knee and lower leg for the final 14 days of dosing. i) energy reaching the muscles ii) muscle strength iii) changes in the structure of the muscle. SRT2104 will be given to healthy subjects aged between 18 and 40 years old. Subjects will participate in this single centre study for approximately 79 days.

The study consists of 11 outpatient clinic visits and 4 telephone calls. Participants will take part in a prospective, single center, randomized, double-blind, clinical study of 2. 0 g/day of SRT2104 or placebo administered orally as
0. 25 g capsules. The study will evaluate the effect of 28 days of consecutive SRT2104 dosing upon muscle strength, metabolism and structure of the ankle muscle group following a 14 day leg immobilization period. Subjects will provide written informed consent and undergo screening assessments. If eligible and willing to participate, subjects will undergo baseline strength testing, muscle biopsy, MRI, and MRS evaluations on Day -1 to assess muscle strength, and metabolism. Participants will then commence a 28 day dosing period with test material. On the first day of dosing, pharmacokinetic and safety assessments will be performed.

On Day 15, after subjects have completed 14 days of dosing with test material, participants will repeat the muscle biopsy, strength testing, MRI evaluations, pharmacokinetic and safety assessments. Following the study assessments on Day 15, subjects will commence a 14 day immobilization period. The leg of the dominant leg will be immobilized with a temporary removable brace, and subjects will be instructed to ambulate using crutches for the duration of the immobilization period.

### The effects of blood flow restriction in patients undergoing knee surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cc4a191b]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrophy of the quadriceps femoris muscle (QF) is commonly found in patients with knee injuries awaiting surgery and postoperatively. Patients with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear can lose between 20% and 33% in QF muscle volume from the time of injury until 3 weeks after their ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Therefore, an important goal of the pre- and postoperative phase is to restore QF muscle function, as rehabilitation of this muscle has an overall positive effect on the outcome after lower extremity injury or surgical intervention. Additionally, persistent muscle weakness after surgery can result in functional deficits lasting up to 3 years postoperatively. This is because of the immobility before and after surgery, vascular ischemia caused by a tourniquet intraoperatively, and inability to perform high load strength training preoperatively and in the early postoperative period. A decrease in QF muscle strength can even result in excessive joint loading and be a contributing factor in the early onset of osteoarthritis of the knee. Thus, the reduction of QF atrophy for those undergoing knee surgery has large implications for the overall postoperative outcome and natural history of the knee joint.

To combat the challenges of muscle atrophy for patients undergoing knee surgery, blood flow restriction (BFR) training has been shown to have beneficial effects. The process of using BFR therapy involves the application of an extremity tourniquet to occlude venous outflow and restrict arterial inflow. Thus, an anaerobic environment is created to promote muscle hypertrophy by upregulating cell signaling, protein synthesis, and ultimately myogenic proliferation. The use of BFR with low load resistance training during lower extremity rehabilitation has shown similar hypertrophic effects compared with isolated high-load resistance training. This is ideal for patients who are initially unable to perform high intensity exercises shortly after knee surgery and injury, but are attempting to improve QF strength. However, current studies investigating the effectiveness of BFR vary in terms of the initial injury sustained, the type of surgery performed, the timing of BFR implementation, and the exercises performed.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of BFR training in patients undergoing knee surgery. Specifically, our goal was to (1) appraise study quality and reporting, (2) compare protocols with BFR application, and (3) evaluate outcome measures throughout the literature. We hypothesized that BFR, pre- or postoperatively, would improve clinical outcome as well as muscle strength and volume.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^12502ef8]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Exercise programme duration represents an important determinant of longer-term outcomes. For example, an effective exercise prescription for falls prevention needs to include at least 50 h of challenging balance and progressive strength training. It remains unknown how long RE programmes need to be to elicit meaningful and long-lasting benefits in the context of sarcopenia. However, it appears that at least 12 weeks of RE is necessary based on the evidence presented in this paper. Short-duration programmes are unlikely to allow older people to become familiar with the habit of exercising and don't enable sufficient progression of the exercise dose (e.g. from one RE session per week to two or from bodyweight exercises to free weights). While it seems reasonable to suggest that RE programmes of a longer duration would lead to greater improvements in relevant outcomes, this is only likely to be the case if the exercise is appropriately prescribed and delivered based on the fundamental principles of exercise prescription as discussed earlier.

### The effects of blood flow restriction in patients undergoing knee surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b18c9ec5]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To measure the success of BFR, various measures have been used to assess a patient's clinical outcome. Previously, muscle strength has been quantified, as it is known that QF function has a direct correlation with a patient's gait, biomechanics, and overall clinical outcome. While some studies demonstrated improved results using BFR when performing low resistance exercises, other studies, such as that of Curran et al, found no significant improvement in muscle strength when utilizing BFR in a high intensity setting. The variability that we encountered between studies is likely the result of the differing protocols and patient populations that exist in the literature. This further reiterates the need to standardize this type of treatment so that specific clinical recommendations can be implemented.

QF muscle atrophy is another quantifying measure that was commonly used to gauge the effectiveness of BFR training. Medical imaging (MRI, ultrasound) can provide a detailed morphological evaluation of any muscle changes that have occurred while awaiting surgery or in the postoperative period. Three of the studies used ultrasonography to evaluate QF muscle thickness and morphology. Ultrasound provides the benefit of being more economical and accessible, thereby allowing investigators to evaluate their patients on a more regular and frequent basis. However, this technique is prone to operator bias. Alternatively, MRI use for the quantification of QF muscle size has been shown to be a reliable unbiased option with shorter acquisition time than corresponding ultrasound techniques. Unfortunately, this type of imaging is less readily available in most clinical settings, with the added burden of increased financial costs. The 4 studies in this review that utilized MRI imaging had mixed results, with 2 studies showing reduced atrophy with BFR, and 2 studies, showing no significant changes. Regardless of which imaging modality is selected, the cross-sectional area of the QF muscle provides an objective method of quantifying atrophy in patients.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a disease model of sarcopenia [^54bbe6cc]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia, the progressive decline of muscle mass and function, has traditionally been viewed as an age-related process leading to a broad range of adverse outcomes. However, it has been widely reported that sarcopenia can occur earlier in life in association with various conditions (i.e. disease-related sarcopenia), including neuromuscular disorders. As early as 2010, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People included neurodegenerative diseases characterised by motor neuron loss among the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia. Despite some differences in pathogenetic mechanisms, both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and age-related sarcopenia share common characteristics, such as the loss of motor units and muscle fibre atrophy, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. The histology of older muscle shows fibre size heterogeneity, fibre grouping and a loss of satellite cells, similar to what is observed in ALS patients. Regrettably, the sarcopenic process in ALS patients has been largely overlooked, and literature on the condition in this patient group is very scarce. Some instruments used for the assessment of sarcopenia in older people could also be applied to ALS patients. At this time, there is no approved specific pharmacological treatment to reverse damage to motor neurons or cure ALS, just as there is none for sarcopenia. However, some agents targeting the muscle, like myostatin and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, are under investigation both in the sarcopenia and ALS context. The development of new therapeutic agents targeting the skeletal muscle may indeed be beneficial to both ALS patients and older people with sarcopenia.

### AR cooperates with SMAD4 to maintain skeletal muscle homeostasis [^60e3838e]. Acta Neuropathologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Skeletal muscle, which accounts for over 40% of the total mass in healthy individuals, plays a central role in maintenance of organismal homeostasis. Conversely, muscle atrophy upon acute and chronic conditions, ranging from genetic muscular dystrophy to critical illnesses, cachexia and sarcopenia, significantly correlates with levels of disability and is an important predictor of mortality. Despite the urgent medical need, treatments able to efficiently counteract muscle loss are lacking due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying intricate molecular mechanisms of regulation. Androgens exert potent anabolic and ergogenic effects on muscle: administration of testosterone or its synthetic analogue oxandrolone result in significant increase in muscle mass secondary to induced protein synthesis and higher testosterone levels are associated with reduced loss of lean body mass in older men. Nevertheless, clinical applications of androgenic therapies are severely limited by the potentially serious side effects associated with chronic administrations, including increased risks of developing cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarctions, and hypogonadism. Despite these concerns, androgens and anabolic androgenic steroids remain the most widely used doping agents in sport, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Effects of androgens in both reproductive and non-reproducing tissues, including muscle and brain, are largely mediated by binding to the Androgen Receptor (AR), a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Structurally, the AR comprises an N-terminal domain (NTD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a linker or hinge interdomain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Agonist interaction with the pockets of AR LBD triggers conformational changes, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding, followed by activation of a wide range of gene expression programmes. Notably, only 7% of AR binding sites display androgen-dependent activation and the AR cistrome is heavily influenced by direct or indirect interaction with other transcription factors, such as FOXA1, HOXB13, and GATA2, which at least partially accounts for the cell-specific effects of AR activation. Here we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms underpinning AR transcriptional regulation of muscle homeostasis in health and disease, which are currently unknown. As an ideal model of study, we employed spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA or Kennedy's disease, OMIM #313200), a monogenic, adult-onset, neuromuscular condition, caused by a CAG expansion in the AR gene. The encoded elongated polyQ stretch confers proteotoxic effects, which cause extensive transcriptional dysregulation, ultimately leading to cell dysfunction and death, primarily by a toxic gain-of-function. Recent evidence has shown that the severe and progressing muscle weakness and atrophy observed in affected individuals results from not only denervation secondary to lower motor neuron degeneration, but also a primary muscle pathology, by mechanisms which are poorly elucidated. Moreover, muscle-restricted genetic correction and treatments only targeting the peripheral tissues are sufficient to rescue the disease phenotype in preclinical models of SBMA and other diseases of the motor unit, further supporting skeletal muscle as a major contributor of the pathogenesis and a target for therapy for these conditions.

### Computed tomographic patterns of muscles in neuromuscular diseases… [^545bcf6b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Computed tomographic scans of muscle in 35 patients with neuromuscular diseases showed distinct patterns in nerve and muscle diseases. Neural diseases first showed as muscle atrophy, with decreased density in the muscles occurring later in the course of disease. Primary muscle diseases showed early decreased density in the muscles, with atrophy occurring later. The CT scan allows objective assessment of muscle mass and may be used to help select muscles for biopsy. Hawley RJ, Schellinger D, O'Doherty DS.

### MiR-29b contributes to multiple types of muscle atrophy [^01770f3f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Muscle atrophy is a debilitating systemic response to denervation, long-term inactivity, excessive fasting, ageing, and a variety of diseases including excessive glucocorticoids (as in Cushing syndrome) and cancers. Muscle atrophy can lead to poor functional status, reduced quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. The treatment of muscle atrophy remains an unresolved challenge. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for the development of novel therapies to combat loss of skeletal muscle mass.

Inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor 1-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT (IGF-1–PI3K–AKT) signalling pathway has been implicated in the induction of muscle atrophy. Inhibition of AKT leads to the activation of transcription factor Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3). FOXO3A induces increased expression of atrophy-linked ubiquitin ligases, including muscle-specific RING-finger 1 (MURF-1) and Atrogin-1 (MAFBX).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) constitute a class of highly conserved, small endogenous noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Individual miRNA can target several mRNAs, while a single mRNA can be regulated by a variety of miRNAs. Thus, miRNAs have been reported to play fundamental roles in diverse biological and pathological processes, including muscle development and regeneration. Different miRNAs, including miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206 have been shown to participate in myogenesis and muscle regeneration. In contrast, miRNAs have also been shown to play a role in different models of muscle atrophy, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-23a, miR-21, miR-27, miR-628, miR-431 and miR-206 (refs). However, a systematic study to examine the role of miRNAs using different models of muscle atrophy has not been performed.

In this study, using an miRNA array, we identify miR-29b induction and activity as a novel pathway contributing to muscle atrophy. miR-29b expression is significantly increased in multiple in vivo and in vitro models of muscle atrophy. We also confirm IGF-1 and PI3K(p85α) as two target genes of miR-29b. Finally, we demonstrate that miR-29b expression is necessary and sufficient to induce muscle atrophy in vivo. These data suggest that inhibition of miR-29b might represent a novel therapeutic approach for multiple types of muscle atrophy.
