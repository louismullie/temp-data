## Question

who should get a watchman

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who should get a WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and how it has evolved with newer device generations. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence from randomized trials versus real-world data. Next, I will examine patient selection criteria, including stroke risk, bleeding risk, and LAA anatomy. After that, I need to check post-procedural antithrombotic requirements and how they vary by device and patient risk. Finally, I will consider special populations, competing alternatives like DOACs, and synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory indication, because that anchors who "should" get WATCHMAN. The FDA approval for WATCHMAN and WATCHMAN FLX is for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at increased stroke risk by CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc, who are deemed suitable for anticoagulation, and who have an appropriate rationale to seek a nonpharmacologic alternative to anticoagulation, which is a Class IIb recommendation in contemporary guidelines and reflects shared decision-making rather than a blanket endorsement over oral anticoagulation [^bdbbb3a5] [^286b8942].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis before I overgeneralize. The pivotal data come from PROTECT AF and PREVAIL, which enrolled patients eligible for warfarin and showed noninferiority of WATCHMAN to warfarin for composite outcomes after a short post-implant warfarin course, with long-term pooled analyses demonstrating fewer hemorrhagic strokes and less nonprocedural bleeding, though ischemic stroke rates were similar overall and PREVAIL did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, underscoring that the benefit signal is driven more by bleeding reduction than ischemic stroke superiority [^59c407ea] [^a1cfd75f] [^ec6b41db].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about real-world applicability. I need to check how patients in practice differ from trials. Medicare and registry cohorts show older, more comorbid patients with high CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and many have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation, yet observed ischemic stroke rates are lower than predicted by CHA2DS2-VASc and bleeding is reduced, supporting feasibility and safety in appropriately selected patients, though these are observational and not head-to-head versus DOACs [^6c0e1289] [^d2fe04f9] [^4f415682].

> I should confirm the practical selection criteria. Candidates should have nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, indicating at least moderate stroke risk, and they should have a compelling reason to avoid long-term oral anticoagulation such as prior major bleeding, high fall risk, chronic kidney disease on dialysis, or persistent intolerance despite attempts with DOACs, while also being able to tolerate a short course of anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy post-implant and having LAA anatomy suitable for device implantation by CT or TEE assessment [^bfd8f93c] [^4f415682] [^3763dd7c].

> Let me think about post-procedural therapy, because this often determines candidacy. For WATCHMAN, the studied regimen is warfarin plus aspirin for about 45 days, then DAPT to 6 months, then aspirin monotherapy if there is no device-related thrombus and no significant peri-device leak, though contemporary practice increasingly individualizes antithrombotic choices based on bleeding risk, with some registries and studies supporting DAPT-only strategies in high bleeding risk patients, albeit with a trade-off in device-related thrombosis risk that must be balanced and surveilled with imaging at 45 days and 6 months [^480c8cb1] [^6df14588] [^aa2584e6].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot take any anticoagulation at all. I should double-check the evidence in OAC-ineligible patients. The ASAP study in warfarin-ineligible patients showed low ischemic stroke rates with WATCHMAN using antiplatelet therapy only, and EWOLUTION included many patients not on OAC with acceptable outcomes, yet there remains no completed randomized trial in absolutely OAC-contraindicated patients because ASAP-TOO terminated early, so use in this group is supported by observational data and guideline nuance rather than randomized evidence, and requires careful multidisciplinary selection and follow-up [^490b938d] [^aa2584e6] [^1d876fb6].

> Next, I should review special populations where WATCHMAN is often considered. In end-stage renal disease, recurrent GI bleeding, prior intracranial hemorrhage, or high fall risk, WATCHMAN can be a reasonable strategy to mitigate bleeding while maintaining stroke risk reduction, though comparative randomized data versus DOACs in these exact subgroups are limited and ongoing trials like CHAMPION-AF will clarify first-line LAAC versus DOACs in broader AF populations, so shared decision-making is essential here [^3763dd7c] [^1810c03a].

> Hold on, I should verify device-specific safety and performance, because device choice can influence candidacy. WATCHMAN FLX demonstrates high implant success and low 7-day major adverse event rates in PINNACLE FLX, and real-world comparisons show lower in-hospital complications versus the predicate WATCHMAN 2.5, while head-to-head data versus Amulet show similar ischemic outcomes but higher procedural complications with Amulet and different leak profiles, reinforcing that operator experience and anatomy matching drive outcomes as much as device selection [^90813c49] [^bdef7133] [^129ece26] [^e96bea2c].

> I need to ensure I address the DOAC question explicitly. The pivotal WATCHMAN trials were conducted in the warfarin era, and while pooled analyses show favorable bleeding outcomes versus warfarin, there are no completed randomized trials comparing WATCHMAN to DOACs, which are generally preferred over warfarin when not contraindicated; thus, WATCHMAN should not be positioned as a first-line alternative to DOACs in patients who can safely take them, pending CHAMPION-AF and similar studies [^bfd8f93c] [^1810c03a].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and synthesize. WATCHMAN is appropriate for carefully selected patients with nonvalvular AF at increased stroke risk who are suitable for a short course of antithrombotic therapy, have suitable LAA anatomy, and have a compelling rationale to avoid long-term oral anticoagulation, with the clearest role in those with prior major bleeding, high bleeding risk, or DOAC intolerance, while patients who can take DOACs should generally receive pharmacologic therapy first and WATCHMAN should be reserved for shared decision-making scenarios where the bleeding benefit is expected to outweigh procedural risks and the need for imaging surveillance [^bfd8f93c] [^480c8cb1] [^3763dd7c].

---

The WATCHMAN device is for patients with **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation** who are at **increased stroke risk** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women) and have a **contraindication to long-term oral anticoagulation** (e.g. major bleeding, high fall risk, or inability to adhere) [^bfd8f93c] [^bdbbb3a5]. It is also considered for those with a **high bleeding risk** (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage, recurrent GI bleeding) or who have had life-threatening bleeding on anticoagulation [^3763dd7c] [^d8cc0820]. Patients must have suitable LAA anatomy and be able to tolerate short-term antithrombotic therapy post-implant [^480c8cb1]. It is not recommended for patients who can safely take oral anticoagulants, especially DOACs, or for valvular AF [^bfd8f93c].

## Indications for WATCHMAN implantation

### Primary indications

- **Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)**: The device is indicated for patients with NVAF who are at increased risk of stroke and systemic embolism based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores [^bfd8f93c].

- **Contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC)**: Patients who have experienced major bleeding (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding) or have a high risk of bleeding (e.g. high HAS-BLED score) are prime candidates [^3763dd7c] [^d8cc0820].

- **High bleeding risk**: Patients with recurrent bleeding events, elderly patients with a high fall risk, or those with conditions that increase bleeding risk (e.g. thrombocytopenia, liver disease) may benefit from LAA closure [^3763dd7c].

---

### Secondary indications

Secondary indications include patients who are **unable to adhere to chronic OAC therapy** due to lifestyle, occupation, or personal preference, and those who experience significant side effects or complications from OACs, such as drug interactions or laboratory monitoring issues [^070faa74].

---

## Patient selection criteria

### Clinical criteria

- **CHA₂DS₂-VASc score**: Men with a score ≥ 2 or women with a score ≥ 3 are considered at increased stroke risk and may benefit from LAA closure [^bfd8f93c].

- **HAS-BLED score**: A high HAS-BLED score (≥ 3) indicates increased bleeding risk and supports the consideration of LAA closure over chronic OAC therapy [^notfound].

- **History of major bleeding**: Patients with prior major bleeding events, particularly intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, are strong candidates [^3763dd7c].

- **Inability to tolerate OACs**: Patients who have experienced significant side effects, drug interactions, or compliance issues with OACs may be considered for LAA closure [^070faa74].

---

### Anatomical criteria

Anatomical suitability requires a **left atrial appendage (LAA) anatomy** that is amenable to device implantation, as assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or cardiac computed tomography (CT) [^9d62cd6f]. Absence of LAA thrombus is essential, as thrombus increases the risk of embolization during the procedure [^21915cc7].

---

## Contraindications to WATCHMAN implantation

Absolute contraindications include **valvular atrial fibrillation** — for which the device is not indicated — and the presence of LAA thrombus, which significantly increases embolic risk [^21915cc7]. Relative contraindications include severe left atrial enlargement, complex LAA anatomy unsuitable for device implantation, and active infection or sepsis.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting WATCHMAN implantation

Several randomized controlled trials and registries have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the WATCHMAN device:

- **PROTECT AF trial**: Demonstrated non-inferiority of LAA closure to warfarin in preventing stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death, with significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and major bleeding [^59c407ea].

- **PREVAIL trial**: Confirmed non-inferiority for late ischemic events and showed improved procedural safety compared to earlier studies [^a1cfd75f].

- **EWOLUTION registry**: Showed high implant success rates (98.5%) and low ischemic stroke rates (1.1% per year) in real-world patients, many of whom were unsuitable for OAC therapy [^bfd8f93c].

## Comparison with alternative therapies

| **Attribute** | **Watchman device** | **Oral anticoagulation (OAC)** | **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Indication | Nonvalvular AF with contraindications to OAC | Nonvalvular AF with increased stroke risk | Nonvalvular AF with increased stroke risk |
| Efficacy | Non-inferior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism | Highly effective in reducing stroke risk | Superior to warfarin in reducing stroke and bleeding |
| Safety | Lower bleeding risk compared to warfarin; procedural risks include pericardial effusion and device-related thrombus | Higher bleeding risk, especially intracranial hemorrhage | Lower bleeding risk compared to warfarin |
| Patient preference | Non-pharmacologic alternative; no need for chronic OAC | Requires chronic OAC with regular monitoring | Requires chronic OAC with less monitoring |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) recommend LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device for patients with nonvalvular AF who are at increased stroke risk, have contraindications to long-term OAC therapy, and have suitable LAA anatomy [^bfd8f93c]. Shared decision-making is emphasized to weigh the risks and benefits of LAA closure versus alternative therapies [^3952c1c2].

---

## Summary of indications

The WATCHMAN device is indicated for patients with **nonvalvular atrial fibrillation** who are at increased risk of stroke and have contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. It is particularly beneficial for patients with a history of major bleeding, high bleeding risk, or inability to tolerate or adhere to OAC therapy. Patients must have suitable LAA anatomy and be able to tolerate short-term antithrombotic therapy post-implantation. The device is not recommended for patients who can safely take oral anticoagulants, particularly DOACs, or for patients with valvular atrial fibrillation.

### The assessment of the watchman device in patients unsuitable for oral anticoagulation (ASAP-TOO) trial [^478271f6]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); however, they are underused because of absolute or relative contraindications due to real or perceived risk of bleeding. Although left atrial appendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, this has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial.

Study Objectives

The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectiveness end point is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety end point includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention.

Study Design

This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2 and who are deemed by 2 study physicians to be unsuitable for OAC will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy at the discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigational sites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12months and then every 6months through 60 months.

Summary

This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of Watchman in this challenging population of high-stroke risk AF patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis [^cddcf405]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The Watchman device is the most recent addition to the "antiembolic armamentarium". Indirect unadjusted pair‐wise estimates obtained for the Watchman device in our study are consistent with a recent NMA. 15 We showed that the Watchman device is significantly more effective than placebo/control, but there was no evidence to prove that the Watchman device is more effective than aspirin. The fact that, after adjustment for RCT population characteristics, the effect of the Watchman device did not differ from any other comparator (including placebo/control) is likely an indicator of an insufficient statistical power of the knowledge base. Importantly, the Watchman device was ranked as the best life‐saving antiembolic intervention. Moreover, simultaneous clustered ranking for 2 of the most important outcomes (primary efficacy and all‐cause mortality) included the Watchman device together with 4 NOACs in the cluster of most effective and safe interventions. Clearly, further development of LAA occlusion devices and techniques is needed. The EWOLUTION registry recently showed that rate of periprocedural strokes and bleedings could be further decreased. 47 Future RCTs of LAA occlusion devices are needed to prove the effectiveness of the LAA occlusion approach given that it remains unclear whether LAA is a mechanistically essential structure for stroke development in AF.

### Rationale and design of a randomized study comparing the watchman FLX device to DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1810c03a]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LAAC) was developed as a nonpharmacologic alternative to oral anticoagulants (OACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at an increased risk for stroke or systemic embolism. The Watchman device permanently seals off the LAA to prevent thrombi from escaping into the circulation. Previous randomized trials have established the safety and efficacy of LAAC compared to warfarin. However, direct OACs (DOACs) have become the preferred pharmacologic strategy for stroke prevention in patients with AF, and there is limited data comparing Watchman FLX to DOACs in a broad AF patient population. CHAMPION-AF is designed to prospectively determine whether LAAC with Watchman FLX is a reasonable first-line alternative to DOACs in patients with AF who are indicated for OAC therapy.

Study Design

A total of 3,000 patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 (men) or ≥ 3 (women) were randomized to Watchman FLX or DOAC in a 1:1 allocation at 142 global clinical sites. Patients in the device arm were to be treated with DOAC and aspirin, DOAC alone, or DAPT for at least 3 months postimplant followed by aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor for 1-year. Control patients were required to take an approved DOAC for the duration of the trial. Clinical follow-up visits are scheduled at 3- and 12-months, and then annually through 5 years; LAA imaging is required at 4 months in the device group. Two primary end points will be evaluated at 3 years: (1) composite of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic), cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism compared for noninferiority, and (2) nonprocedural bleeding (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) tested for superiority in the device arm against DOACs. The third primary noninferiority end point is the composite of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism at 5 years. Secondary end points include 3- and 5-year rates of (1) ISTH-defined major bleeding and (2) the composite of cardiovascular death, all stroke, systemic embolism, and nonprocedural ISTH bleeding.

Conclusions

This study will prospectively evaluate whether LAAC with the Watchman FLX device is a reasonable alternative to DOACs in patients with AF.

### Interventional treatments for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation with emphasis upon the WATCHMAN device [^ff17fec3]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Many strokes occur in patients with atrial fibrillation. Current guidelines recommend an antithrombotic regimen with warfarin to prevent thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation; however, a substantial number of patients are not eligible for this therapy. The exclusion of the left atrial appendage from circulation seems to be an alternative strategy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The review focuses on the different devices for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Recent Findings

Recently, two devices developed for percutaneous transcatheter occlusion of the left atrial appendage have been studied: the PLAATO (Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Transcatheter Occlusion) device and the WATCHMAN device. Safety and feasibility data are available for both devices. About 200 patients have received a PLAATO device. These patients were at high risk for thrombembolic stroke and were not candidates for oral anticoagulation therapy. The WATCHMAN device was implanted in 75 patients that were eligible for long-term anticoagulation therapy with a moderate risk for thrombembolic stroke due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Summary

For both devices, a reduction in the risk of stroke was documented, and device implantation was shown to be safe and feasible. Provided the ongoing trials show noninferiority to oral anticoagulation, another therapeutic option will become available to prevent ischemic strokes.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^431d05df]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

This journey from clinical trial to clinical practice is emblematic of the typical path for a novel cardiovascular device. Premarket clinical trials must answer questions of feasibility first and then safety and effectiveness under controlled and ideal circumstances, and this approach has been shown to exclude patients with multiple comorbidities and advanced age, women, and other minoritized groups. Nonetheless, market authorization and coverage decisionsmust be made in the face of this lingering uncertainty, so subsequent application in clinical practice populations may be associated with unanticipated outcomes. Thus, questions of clinical or real-world performance must be addressed to identify factors that meaningfully change risk-benefit considerations.

A second key observation is that mortality was high among WATCHMAN recipients over the 5 years after implantation. Nearly 45% of WATCHMAN recipients were dead at 5 years with consistent yearly mortality rates of 8% to 9%. This mortality rate is higher than that seen in the clinical practice registry of WATCHMAN recipients in Europe (15% at 2 years) and nearly double that seen in long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in the continued access registries, which demonstrated a 5-year all-cause mortality rate of ≈20%. In the 5-year follow-up of subjects randomized to LAAO with WATCHMAN in Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation, combined all-cause mortality was 3.6% per 100 patient-years. However, the mortality seen in this population is slightly better than that seen in an all-comer population of Medicare beneficiaries with AF. Piccini et aldemonstrated that following incident AF in 2007, 3-year mortality among Medicare beneficiaries was > 40% and twice that seen in the general Medicare population standardized to age and sex. Of note, the 5-year mortality rate in the Medicare population far exceeds the 5-year rates of stroke (≈7%) and major bleeding (≈15%), which are like those seen in clinical trials. These findings highlight the high competing risks of death in this older and highly comorbid Medicare population.

### Left atrial appendage and closure: who, when, and how [^e626e262]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation have a 4- to 5-fold increase in strokes and that rhythm may be responsible for 15% to 20% of all strokes, particularly in the elderly. In this setting, thrombus in the left atrial appendage has been found to be the source of stroke in 90% of cases. Although oral anticoagulants have been found effective in reducing stroke rates, for a variety of issues, they may only be used in 40% to 50% of patients at increased risk for stroke. Given pathophysiology of stroke, site-specific therapy directed at left atrial appendage occlusion has been now studied for stroke prevention, and one device is FDA approved (Watchman). A meta-analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials and 2 registries with this device documented the following: (1) patients receiving the device had significantly fewer hemorrhagic strokes (hazard ratio 0.22, P = 0.004); (2) a significant reduction in cardiovascular or unexplained death (hazard ratio 0.48, P = 0.004); (3) more ischemic strokes in the device group; however, when periprocedural events were excluded, the difference was not significant; and (4) a significant reduction in nonprocedural bleeding with the device (hazard ratio 0.51, P = 0.006) versus control. At present, the only device approved in the United States is indicated in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with acceptable anatomy who are at increased risk for stroke and would be candidates for anticoagulation in whom there is concern about the risk/benefit ratio for chronic anticoagulation. Unresolved issues include optimal patient selection criteria, the role of devices in patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, and the relative role of novel oral anticoagulants versus the device which has not been tested in randomized trials.

### Surgical strategies for a failed watchman device [^d945c218]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative photographs of Watchman device explant and associated thrombi.

Central Message

Surgical extraction or exclusion of a failed Watchman device is a feasible alternative in patients who are not candidates for medical management.

See Commentaries on pages 165 and 167.

Transcatheter closure of the left atrial appendage (LAA) using a Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Plymouth, Minn) is an approved alternative to oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation that are considered at high risk for bleeding complications. Device malposition and/or incomplete LAA seal are known inherent modes of device failure. These events may be underreported, because most of these nonfatal complications can be managed by continued antithrombotic therapy. These scenarios may exacerbate thrombus formation, however, with the reported incidence of device-related thrombus as high as 3.9%. The PREVAIL trial, a landmark Watchman device study, failed to demonstrate that LAA occlusion was noninferior to warfarin at preventing adverse events at 18 months. Although another landmark trial, the PROTECT-AF trial, demonstrated noninferiority of Watchman LAA occlusion versus warfarin alone, its substudy revealed that a peri-device flow rate at 12 months as high as 32%. Moreover, none of those studies reported the number of patients requiring a surgical intervention and associated outcomes.

Surgical device removal or exclusion is rarely considered except in situations with devastating device-related complications. There are limited data regarding the optimal approach and the feasibility of surgical device explant. We present a case series of Watchman device failures and discuss strategies for extraction or alternative approaches to LAA occlusion.

### Watchman FLX's sophomore year report card [^b376e150]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral anticoagulation is a highly effective and generally well‐tolerated therapy for the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF)‐associated stroke. Select patients, however, do not or cannot receive this treatment, either because of prior bleeding events or comorbidities that confer an unacceptably high bleeding risk. The familiarity of this clinical scenario, coupled with the observation that the left atrial appendage (LAA) frequently serves as the anatomic source of AF‐associated thrombus, resulted in the development of mechanical devices capable of closing the LAA via a percutaneous approach. The Watchman LAA closure device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) is now an approved therapy for AF‐associated stroke prevention among individuals who are poor candidates for long‐term anticoagulant therapy.

Fortunately, the yearly risk of AF‐associated stroke is low for most individuals. Because the aim of LAA occlusion is to prevent these relatively uncommon thromboembolic events, an occlusion device must have an excellent performance profile, with minimal device‐related complications; for the device to result in net clinical benefit, acute complications must be offset by a reduction in stroke and bleeding events during follow‐up. The invasive nature of LAA occlusion unfortunately guarantees at least some individuals will experience an implant‐related complication. Concerns have been raised regarding the risk of periprocedural complications observed with the first‐generation Watchman device, especially in the hands of less experienced physicians and centers. After successful LAA occlusion, patients are vulnerable to device‐related thrombus, presumably until an endothelial layer has formed over the exposed face of the implant. Protection from device‐related thrombus typically involves treatment with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications for 6 months, then antiplatelet monotherapy thereafter. Exposing a patient with an elevated bleeding risk to this antithrombotic regimen can be problematic for obvious reasons, and successfully navigating these competing risks of thrombus and hemorrhage is a frequent source of concern for both patients and physicians.

### Overview of the food and drug administration circulatory system devices panel meetings on WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure therapy [^5c3fadec]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) technology is a percutaneously delivered permanent cardiac implant placed in the LAA. This device is designed to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in warfarin-eligible patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The first circulatory system device panel reviewed the Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study in 2009, and a "not approvable" letter was issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on safety concerns. Subsequently, the FDA, collaboratively with the sponsor, designed a new Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAAC Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long-Term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) trial to address the earlier study limitations. A second panel was convened in December 2013 to review the results of PREVAIL and additional long-term follow-up data from PROTECT AF. The second panel voted favorably 13 to 1 that the benefits of the WATCHMAN LAAC therapy do outweigh the risks for use in patients who meet the criteria specified in the proposed indication. Subsequently, and during the premarket approval review, updated data from the PREVIAL study revealed more ischemic strokes in the WATCHMAN group, corresponding to a total of 13 ischemic strokes in the WATCHMAN group versus 1 in the control group. As a result of these strokes, the FDA called for a third panel to assess the benefit-risk profile of the WATCHMAN device. This summary aims to describe the discussions and recommendations made during the panel meetings.

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^6238802e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial appendage closure — WATCHMAN device outcomes and FDA indication in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) are summarized as follows: in a single case series of 150 patients with CHADS2 scores ≥ 1 deemed unsuitable for anticoagulation, mean follow-up was 14.4 months, procedure- or device-related safety events occurred in 13 patients (8.7%), and stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 4 (2.3%), which was lower than the expected 7.3% given CHADS2; on March 13, 2015, the FDA issued an approval specifying indications for use in patients with nonvalvular AF who are at increased risk of stroke and systemic embolism on the basis of CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores, deemed suitable for warfarin therapy, and who have an appropriate rationale to seek a nonpharmacological alternative to warfarin.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^286b8942]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are few reports of long-term outcomes following WATCHMAN implantation in general clinical practice. – To address this evidence gap, our claims-based analysis complements data collected from long-term follow-up of clinical trials and registries and offers several important and clinically relevant observations.

The first important observation from this analysis is that Medicare beneficiaries undergoing WATCHMAN implantation tended to be of more advanced age with a higher burden of comorbidity than patients included in clinical trials of WATCHMAN. The distribution of this cohort was skewed toward older age with > 35% being older than 80 years of age. This cohort had more female representation than the clinical trial cohorts (40% versus ≈30%), which has consequential implications for clinical outcomes. On the one hand, female sex has been associated with more frequent adverse events following LAAOin clinical practice. On the other hand, these unadjusted data suggest a lower risk of mortality for the female cohort compared with the male cohort (Figure 1 C) following LAAO, although no formal comparisons were performed based on this nonmodifiable risk factor. This all-comer Medicare cohort had more women and a greater burden of comorbidity, than would be typical in a clinical trial cohort. For example, the mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score in this cohort was 4.3, which was slightly lower than reported from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry- Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registrybut higher than that seen in premarket randomized trials (3.5–4.0), which reflects, in part, a greater proportion of women who are granted an additional point for female sex. These differences in demographics and comorbidity in general practice, as informally compared with the premarket trials, likely relate to the CMS national coverage decision stipulating that WATCHMAN candidates must be deemed unable to take long-term oral anticoagulation and should have CHADS₂ score ≥ 2 or CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 3.

### Left atrial appendage closure with the watchman device in patients with a contraindication for oral anticoagulation: the ASAP study (ASA plavix feasibility study with watchman left atrial appendage closure technology) [^490b938d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage (LAA) closure in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) patients ineligible for warfarin therapy.

Background

The PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial demonstrated that LAA closure with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) was noninferior to warfarin therapy. However, the PROTECT AF trial only included patients who were candidates for warfarin, and even patients randomly assigned to the LAA closure arm received concomitant warfarin for 6 weeks after Watchman implantation.

Methods

A multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted of LAA closure with the Watchman device in 150 patients with nonvalvular AF and CHADS₂ (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) score ≥ 1, who were considered ineligible for warfarin. The primary efficacy endpoint was the combined events of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular/unexplained death.

Results

The mean CHADS₂ score and CHA₂DS₂-VASc (CHADS₂ score plus 2 points for age ≥ 75 years and 1 point for vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, or female sex) score were 2.8 ± 1.2 and 4.4 ± 1.7, respectively. History of hemorrhagic/bleeding tendencies (93%) was the most common reason for warfarin ineligibility. Mean duration of follow-up was 14.4 ± 8.6 months. Serious procedure- or device-related safety events occurred in 8.7% of patients (13 of 150 patients). All-cause stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 4 patients (2.3% per year): ischemic stroke in 3 patients (1.7% per year) and hemorrhagic stroke in 1 patient (0.6% per year). This ischemic stroke rate was less than that expected (7.3% per year) based on the CHADS₂ scores of the patient cohort.

Conclusions

LAA closure with the Watchman device can be safely performed without a warfarin transition, and is a reasonable alternative to consider for patients at high risk for stroke but with contraindications to systemic oral anticoagulation.

### Surgical strategies for a failed watchman device [^0d34cf15]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have described a series of Watchman device-related complications requiring surgical intervention. The first point to consider is when to treat a failed device. Intolerance of anticoagulation, such as bleeding in the presence of a peri-device leak or residual stump, warrants intervention. This scenario may exacerbate additional thromboembolic risk in addition to atrial fibrillation, given the presence of a thrombogenic foreign body in the LAA. It is likely that only a small subset of these patients are referred to surgery; most patients are managed by continued antithrombotic therapy, which, ironically, contradicts the original concept of the Watchman device.

The second point to consider is how to treat a failed device. We strongly advocate device removal when technically possible. O'Hara and colleaguespresented the first reported surgical Watchman extraction due to recurrent device-related thrombus in which the LAA was resected with the device. In contrast, in our series, 3 different surgical strategies — Watchman explant, thoracoscopic Watchman exclusion with external clipping, and bovine pericardial patch exclusion — were used based on the need for other simultaneous procedures. A thoracoscopic approach is used in patients who are not undergoing reoperation, do not require a concomitant procedure, have no atrial thrombus present, and have no protrusion of the device (ie, must have a neck on which to place a clip). Despite late-stage extraction with complete endothelialization, most devices can be safely removed, providing high-risk patients with an alternative treatment to lifelong anticoagulation.

### Anticoagulation in cancer patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: are there gaps in care? [^893df80a]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

When examining choice of anticoagulant, 54% of patients received direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the current study. In a recent review of anticoagulation for cardiovascular conditions in cancer patients, DOACs, specifically apixaban and edoxaban, were felt to be safe in cancer patients with AF or AFL, demonstrating fewer bleeding complications and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin. Although cancer patients were excluded or underrepresented in the large randomized trials that compared DOACs with warfarin, a comparative effectiveness study that examined 16,000 patients with active cancer and oral anticoagulation therapy for nonvalvular AF showed that the incidence of ischemic stroke was similar between DOAC and warfarin users. The rate of severe bleeding was significantly lower among apixaban compared with warfarin and rivaroxaban users, whereas the rate was similar in dabigatran and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin users. Potential drug-drug interactions between cancer therapies and oral anticoagulants should also be considered prior to selection of specific agents in individual patients, in addition to the standard consideration of other factors that can impact on anticoagulant selection and dosing, such as renal function.

In patients who are not considered long-term candidates for anticoagulation, left atrial appendage devices are now available to reduce thromboembolic risks in patients with AF. The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines state that "percutaneous LAA occlusion may be considered in patients with AF at increased risk of stroke who have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation", with a Class IIb recommendation. In studies that led to approval of the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts), oral anticoagulation with warfarin was utilized for a period of time following device insertion (typically warfarin and aspirin for 45 days with subsequent use of antiplatelet agents depending on transesophageal echocardiography findings). Although trials that led to device approval actually studied patients who were candidates for warfarin, additional study is underway to evaluate patients who are not currently candidates for oral anticoagulation.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^d2fe04f9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This report represents an unfiltered view of long-term outcomes following WATCHMAN implantation among Medicare beneficiaries. These descriptive data help define how this novel technology has been applied after it became commercially available. Consistent with previous studies, Medicare beneficiaries undergoing WATCHMAN implantation tended to be older and more comorbid than the typical clinical trial participant, and the proportion of women receiving WATCHMAN in clinical practice was numerically greater than that seen in clinical trials. Patients undergoing WATCHMAN placement in clinical practice have high mortality at 5 years that cannot be directly attributed to AF (eg, stroke) or treatment thereof (eg, major bleeding), suggesting significant competing risks of death. Future investigations should seek to better untangle comparative risks and benefits of WATCHMAN and alternative treatment strategies, as well as to better understand and address racial differences in WATCHMAN utilization and general AF-related outcomes.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure: procedural techniques and outcomes [^908f5ab0]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure technology for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation has significantly advanced in the past 2 decades. Several devices are under clinical investigation, and a few have already received Conformité Européene (CE)-mark approval and are available in many countries. The WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) has the most supportive data and is under evaluation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for warfarin-eligible patients. The Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (St. Jude Medical, Plymouth, Minnesota) has a large real-world experience over the past 5 years, and a randomized trial comparing Amplatzer Cardiac Plug with the WATCHMAN device is anticipated in the near future. The Lariat procedure (SentreHEART Inc, Redwood City, California) has also gained interest lately, but early studies were concerning for high rates of serious pericardial effusion and major bleeding. The current real-world experience predominantly involves patients who are not long-term anticoagulation candidates or who are perceived to have high bleeding risks. This pattern of practice is expected to change when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves the WATCHMAN device for warfarin-eligible patients. This paper reviews in depth the procedural techniques, safety, and outcomes of the current leading devices.

### Left atrial appendage closure compared with oral anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b0b3e70a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, Watertown, MA) consists of a nitinol cage partially covered by a polyethylene terephthalate membrane, with lateral small barbs that anchor the device to left atrial appendage, minimizing the risk of dislodgment. This device was initially tested in 2 pivotal randomized clinical trials conducted during the warfarin era. The PROTECT AF trial included 707 patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 CHADS risk factor, who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to LAAC with the use of the WATCHMAN device or warfarin. PROTECT AF showed noninferiority of LAAC to VKAs for the composite clinical end point of stroke, SE, or cardiovascular death after 2 years. Superiority criteria were met after 4 years of follow‐up. Conversely, the subsequent PREVAIL trial, which included 407 patients, failed to achieve the prespecified criteria for noninferiority, mainly because of lower‐than‐expected rates of ischemic stroke (0.7%) in the VKA arm. An important caveat about these 2 trials is that, to guarantee clinical equipoise of randomization, patients enrolled had no formal contraindication to VKAs, and the LAAC arm received a 6‐week course of VKA following the procedure to facilitate device endothelization, a practice that is no longer used with more contemporary devices. A patient‐level meta‐analysis combining the 5‐year outcomes of the PREVAIL and PROTECT AF trials showed similar rates of any stroke, with reductions in hemorrhagic stroke, nonprocedural bleeding, and death associated with LAAC. Two US Food and Drug Administration–driven registries (CAP [Continued Access to PROTECT AF] and CAP2 [Continued Access to PREVAIL]) accompanied these 2 trials and provided long‐term data on the safety and efficacy of LAAC with the WATCHMAN device. Among 1144 patients followed for an average of 50 months, the observed incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was remarkably low, and rates of ischemic stroke were below those predicted by the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score. Currently, the WATCHMAN device has been replaced by the new‐generation WATCHMAN FLX, which features several design improvements, and has been tested in the single‐arm regulatory PINNACLE FLX US IDE (PINNACLE FLX: The US Investigational Device Exemption Trial Designed to Evaluate the Procedural Safety and Closure Efficacy With the WATCHMAN FLX Device) study. The WATCHMAN FLX is currently being tested against DOACs in the CHAMPION‐AF trial (NCT04394546).

### Rationale and design for AMPLATZER amulet left atrial appendage occluder IDE randomized controlled trial (amulet IDE trial) [^dae23fb4]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The Amulet IDE Trial is an ongoing, prospective, randomized, multi-national trial, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the AMPLATZER Amulet Left Atrial Appendage Occluder for stroke prevention in comparison to the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. METHODS: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients at high risk of stroke (CHADS 2 score ≥ 2 or a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of ≥ 3) who are suitable candidates for left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) will be fully informed and requested to participate in the trial. A total of 1878 patients at up to 150 sites worldwide will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the AMPLATZER Amulet device (investigational) and the Boston Scientific WATCHMAN device (control). Each patient will be followed for 5 years, with follow-up assessments at discharge, 45 days, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and then annually. The trial has three primary endpoints: A composite of procedure-related complications, or all-cause death, or major bleeding through 12 months (safety); a composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism through 18 months (effectiveness); and effective device LAAO, defined as residual jet around the device ≤ 5 mm at the 45-day visit (mechanism of action). SUMMARY: The Amulet IDE Trial is the first randomized head-to-head LAAO device trial and will provide data for the AMPLATZER Amulet occluder in a population with a high risk of stroke and bleeding.

### Comparison of anticoagulation with left atrial appendage closure after atrial fibrillation ablation: rationale and design of the OPTION randomized trial [^47271dd2]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), physicians typically offer AF ablation for symptom relief; however, patients often anticipate/expect a life free from anticoagulation. This belief puts patients at increased risk of stroke due to the potential for asymptomatic AF postablation if anticoagulation is ceased contrary to clinical guidelines. Although the WATCHMAN device has been FDA-approved to decrease the risk of thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with an appropriate rationale to avoid oral anticoagulation, it has not been well-studied following AF ablation. Additionally, there are limited data comparing the WATCHMAN device to direct oral anticoagulants. The OPTION study will investigate whether LAA closure with the WATCHMAN FLX device is a reasonable alternative to oral anticoagulation following percutaneous catheter ablation for nonvalvular AF.

Trial Design

OPTION is a multinational, multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc of ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women and who underwent a AF catheter ablation procedure between 90 and 180 days prior to randomization (sequential) or are planning to have catheter ablation within 10 days of randomization (concomitant) will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation of WATCHMAN FLX vs control. Control patients will start or continue market-approved oral anticoagulation for the duration of the trial. A total of 1600 patients were randomized from 130 global investigational sites. Follow-up for both device and control patients will occur at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months. The primary effectiveness noninferiority endpoint is stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), all-cause death, or systemic embolism at 36 months. The primary safety superiority endpoint is nonprocedural bleeding through 36 months (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding). The secondary noninferiority endpoint is ISTH major bleeding through 36 months (including procedural bleeding).

Conclusions

This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of WATCHMAN FLX in a postablation contemporary clinical AF patient population at risk of stroke.

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^e068d2f9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

PROTECT AF interim procedural outcomes report that the WATCHMAN was successfully implanted in 88% (408 of 463), 86% (349 of 408) met criteria to discontinue warfarin at 45 days, and by 6 months 92% (355 of 385) met criteria to discontinue warfarin; in the control group, international normalized ratio values were within therapeutic range (2.0 to 3.0) 66% of the time; the device met the prespecified criteria for noninferiority to warfarin with the primary efficacy endpoint reached for 3.0% of device implant patients and 4.9% of control subjects; adverse safety events occurred in 4.4% (22 patients), were primarily periprocedural, and there were no deaths attributed to device implantation; a learning curve was noted with serious pericardial effusions requiring drainage in 7.1% (11 of 154) of the first 3 implant patients at each site compared with 4.4% (17 of 388) of subsequent patients.

### Potential applicability and utilization of left atrial appendage occlusion devices in patients with atrial fibrillation [^16fa697f]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occluder device (Atritech, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) is currently being tested in a Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial, the PROTECT AF trial, for patients who are diagnosed with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, rigorous screening and the study design have resulted in the exclusion of a large number of patients. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the potential utility of this device among those who were eligible but excluded for trial criteria and the reasons for exclusion.

Methods

Screening logs from the respective sites participating in the PROTECT AF trial were collected and analyzed for potential utilization outside of a research trial. Only 31 patients were enrolled into the research trail from the screening of 1798 total patients.

Results

Information from the excluded patients was examined and it was determined that 79% of these patients would be eligible for the device outside the research trial. Twenty-one percent of patients were not able to receive the device because of long-term warfarin need, contraindications to warfarin, unsuitable anatomy as determined by echocardiography, or the inability to take short-term aspirin and clopidogrel for protocol requirements.

Conclusions

Should a device like the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage occluder be approved, approximately 79% of all patients with atrial fibrillation would be eligible for device placement.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^6c0e1289]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

The observed ischemic stroke rate in this population (≈1.4% per year) was similar to the predicted rate with warfarin treatment and less than would be predicted without any treatment based on the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score alone (median, 4), which would estimate an annual stroke risk of 4.8%. This finding mirrors findings from long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in the WATCHMAN clinical trials, a European real-world registry, and continued access registries. For example, in the latter case, the expected ischemic stroke rate based on the CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score was 5.8% to 7.1% per 100 patient-years compared with the observed rate of 1.3% to 2.2%. While comparisons of stroke risk between LAAO and no treatment or warfarin were historically relevant, contemporary practice includes the widespread availability of direct-acting oral anticoagulants for which randomized comparison data are lacking but forthcoming. No such comparative analyses were performed in this analysis, but prior observational investigations have attempted to address this gap in knowledge.

Third, there were substantial demographic, clinical, and outcome similarities between subgroups with prior major bleeding and prior stroke. As such, it is not surprising that both of these key subgroups experienced particularly high rates of post-WATCHMAN bleeding, stroke, and death. These relationships were particularly pronounced among beneficiaries with prior history of bleeding among whom 22% had a subsequent major bleeding event compared with only 10% among WATCHMAN recipients without a history of bleeding. It is noteworthy that > 40% of our study cohort had a history of major bleeding — a finding that is consistent with our personal observations that a history of bleeding is a common reason for referral for WATCHMAN among patients with AF. In this analysis, no comparison was made between WATCHMAN and long-term oral anticoagulation, but comparative outcomes between these 2 strategies for AF-related stroke risk reduction are needed to better inform decision-making for a population that may have complex and competing relative contraindications to both strategies. Future randomized trials will be critical to untangle comparative outcomes in this complex space.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion: a review of current devices, clinical evidence, patient selection, and post procedural antithrombotic management [^070faa74]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a major driver of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). While systemic oral anticoagulation (OAC) continues to be the mainstay for stroke reduction therapy in patients with NVAF, several barriers prevent the sustained long-term use of OAC, including increased risk of bleeding, non-compliance, cost, drug-drug interactions, and the need for ongoing laboratory testing. Given the need for continued stroke reduction therapies in patients who are intolerant of or non-compliant with OAC, percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion (LAAO) has emerged as a nonpharmacologic alternative to OAC. The development of percutaneous LAAO techniques is based on data suggesting that more than 90% of thrombi in patients with NVAF originate in the LAA. Two percutaneous LAAO devices are currently in widespread clinical use: Watchman (United States and Europe) and the Amplatzer type of devices (Europe); randomized trial data exist only for the Watchman device. Multiple randomized and nonrandomized trials and registries have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of LAAO in patients who are suitable for short-term anticoagulation using a variety of post-procedural antithrombotic strategies. Ongoing randomized clinical trials on LAAO are focused on OAC-ineligible patients to compare efficacy of LAAO devices against a multitude of antithrombotic options. This review aims to discuss the rationale and evidence for LAAO and post procedural antithrombotic strategies and opportunities for research examination. In addition, we discuss the need for continued investigation of LAAO in populations not well represented in clinical trials or registries, including women, older patients, and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.

Central Message

A failed WATCHMAN device can be managed by either excision or exclusion, depending upon the surgical scenario.

See Article page.

The development of less-invasive, nonsurgical alternatives to treat cardiovascular disease has long been a focus of cardiologists and a desire of patients. Efforts along these lines have created a variety of competing procedures, including coronary artery bypass grafting/percutaneous coronary intervention, surgical aortic valve replacement/transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and maze/catheter ablation. In each case, the advent of a percutaneous approach has created the need for surgeons to develop new strategies to employ when the percutaneous interventions fail. Dissemination of surgeons' experience managing complications and failures associated with percutaneous therapies is a much-needed service to our patients and to our specialty. With their insightful report of surgical strategies for a failed WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, Plymouth, Minn), Palmer and colleaguesadd to our knowledge and inform our management of the left atrial appendage.

The WATCHMAN is a percutaneously deployed device that occludes the left atrial appendage (LAA) and thereby obviates the need for anticoagulation in selected patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The device is contraindicated in patients with LAA anatomy not amenable to device implantation, LAA thrombus, and patients with a pre-existing atrial septal defect closure device present. Even after "successful" placement, peri-device flow has been noted in nearly one-third of patients. Minor leaks around the device do not constitute a surgical indication. However, large leaks and/or thrombus formation coupled with intolerance to anticoagulation (ie, bleeding) necessitate surgical consideration. With their insightful report of surgical strategies for failed WATCHMAN devices, Palmer and colleaguesadd to our knowledge and inform our management of complications that arise from intervening on the LAA.

PREVAIL trial endpoints and noninferiority criteria — WATCHMAN versus warfarin are defined as follows: the first primary endpoint ("primary efficacy") was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), cardiovascular or unexplained death, and systemic embolism over 18 months; the second ("late ischemic efficacy") was ischemic stroke and systemic embolism from 8 days after randomization onward, excluding periprocedural events, over 18 months; and the third mechanistic endpoint included all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device-/procedure-related events requiring specified surgical or endovascular intervention occurring from randomization to within 7 days of the procedure or by hospital discharge. Noninferiority hypotheses were set using the 18-month risk ratio thresholds of 1.75 (first endpoint) and 2.0 (second endpoint), with noninferiority declared only if both efficacy endpoints met criteria, and safety deemed acceptable if the third endpoint occurred in < 2.67% of WATCHMAN recipients.

FDA approval and guidelines

The congregate data from PROTECT AF, PREVAIL, and their respective registries led to the approval of LAAO with the Watchman 2.5 (Boston Scientific) device by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015. In 2021, a second LAAO device (Amulet, Abbott) was approved by the FDA based on its noninferiority to the Watchman 2.5 device. The Amulet investigational device exemption trial, the largest published LAAO trial to date, randomized 1,878 patients to LAAO with the Watchman 2.5 device or the Amulet occluder. The Amulet occluder was noninferior to the Watchman device for the primary effectiveness endpoint (composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 18 months, 2.8% vs 2.8%; P < 0.001 for noninferiority) and for the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular/unexplained death (5.6% vs 7.7%; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Although professional societies eventually incorporated LAAO in their guidelines, their recommendations for LAAO are weak (Class IIb, Level of Evidence: C) and critical of the lack of robust evidence supporting LAAO, (Table 2). In addition, to ensure the rational dispersion and continuous safety of the procedure, the FDA required LAAO programs to adopt a shared decision-making process involving nonimplanting physicians and decision-aid tools and to participate in a national registry for ongoing surveillance of clinical outcomes.

### Implant success and safety of left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device: peri-procedural outcomes from the EWOLUTION registry [^acb01758]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the introduction of new drug therapies for stroke prevention, many patients and physicians continue to seek alternatives for a variety of reasons, including contraindications, medication side effects, and adherence and quality-of-life concerns. Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is a non-pharmacological alternative for stroke prevention in high-risk patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in cases where oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) is deemed not to be the ideal long-term treatment. It was developed based on the finding that around 90% of thrombi in the left atrium originated in the left atrial appendage in this population. Several multicentre randomized studies found the treatment to be safe, effective, and non-inferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention, whereas longer-term follow-up supports a potential for superiority and lower mortality of LAAC.

Current international guidelines recommend the option of LAAC for high-risk patients with non-valvular AF who are either contraindicated or unsuitable for long-term OAT, at high bleeding risk, or otherwise prefer an alternative. In the specific patient population considered optimal by guidelines, there is actually only limited evidence available as it was not part of the randomized controlled trial (RCT). Questions remain with respect to the proper populations based on stroke and bleeding risk factors, considerations of adherence to OAT, and quality-of-life issues aside. In Germany and Switzerland, the therapy was established as part of standard practice > 5 years ago, while FDA approval in the USA was obtained only very recently, and in many other countries reimbursement remains a challenge

More broadly, the generalizability of findings from clinical trials into real-world clinical settings that invariably involve individual physician practice and a more diverse patient population is a key question with any new therapy. The prospective, multicentre EWOLUTION registry was designed to examine this question. In addition, a large prospective study can be helpful in better characterizing the incidence of rare events that may not have been observed, or have only been observed in very small frequencies, in previous smaller studies.

### Commentary: modern problems require modern solutions: fixing the failed WATCHMAN [^f35b73ff]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Combining careful thought with surgical expertise, Palmer and colleaguesoffer a clear strategy for treatment of patients with a failed WATCHMAN device. They provide a case series of 5 patients, all of whom had both failed catheter ablation of AF and failed LAA occlusion with the WATCHMAN. The surgeons fixed both problems. In their manuscript, they detail for readers the when (when to address the failed WATCHMAN) and the how (how to safely manage the LAA in such instances).

Managing 5 patients with a surgical indication after a failed WATCHMAN implantation, the authors employed either exclusion or extraction, individualizing the therapy depending upon the unique characteristics present in each surgical situation. In patients with no previous surgery and who had a "neck" at the orifice of the LAA, thoracoscopic exclusion with a clip was preferred. However, in those patients requiring open surgery, device extraction followed by LAA exclusion was preferred. If extensive ingrowth precludes WATCHMAN extraction, the LAA orifice can be covered with a pericardial patch. As most of these patients will still have AF, the surgeon should also perform a biatrial maze procedure at the time of open surgery.

The advent of catheter-based procedures invariably creates new scenarios that mandate surgical innovation. Palmer and colleagues provide important guidance as this pattern repeats itself once again in the management of the LAA.

### Left atrial appendage closure as an alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a patient-level meta-analysis [^59c407ea]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The risk-benefit ratio of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) versus systemic therapy (warfarin) for prevention of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) requires continued evaluation.

Objectives

This study sought to assess composite data regarding left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in 2 randomized trials compared to warfarin for prevention of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death in patients with nonvalvular AF.

Methods

Our meta-analysis included 2,406 patients with 5,931 patient-years (PY) of follow-up from the PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device In Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trials, and their respective registries (Continued Access to PROTECT AF registry and Continued Access to PREVAIL registry).

Results

With mean follow-up of 2.69 years, patients receiving LAAC with the Watchman device had significantly fewer hemorrhagic strokes (0.15 vs. 0.96 events/100 patient-years [PY]; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; p = 0.004), cardiovascular/unexplained death (1.1 vs. 2.3 events/100 PY; HR: 0.48; p = 0.006), and nonprocedural bleeding (6.0% vs. 11.3%; HR: 0.51; p = 0.006) compared with warfarin. All-cause stroke or systemic embolism was similar between both strategies (1.75 vs. 1.87 events/100 PY; HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.7; p = 0.94). There were more ischemic strokes in the device group (1.6 vs. 0.9 and 0.2 vs. 1.0 events/100 PY; HR: 1.95 and 0.22, respectively; p = 0.05 and 0.004, respectively). Both trials and registries identified similar event rates and consistent device effect in multiple subsets.

Conclusions

In patients with NVAF at increased risk for stroke or bleeding who are candidates for chronic anticoagulation, LAAC resulted in improved rates of hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular/unexplained death, and nonprocedural bleeding compared to warfarin.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^521fed38]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

First, this report relies on Medicare claims data, which lack the rigor, specificity, and nuance of data collected prospectively through clinical trials or registries. Nonetheless, these data offer a broad view of the current clinical application of a novel medical device about which there remain unanswered questions. Furthermore, it has long been recognized that clinical practice populations differ in important ways from clinical trial populations, with each offering important and complementary insights. Indeed, in recognition of these limitations of clinical trials, LAAO devices are covered under the Coverage With Evidence Development program, which compels ongoing postmarket data collection as a condition of Medicare coverage, which is achieved primarily through the LAAO registry. The claims-based analyses presented here complement the rigorous but more selected data from clinical trials, as well as the more detailed but shorter-term data available through the LAAO registry. Analyses based on claims-based diagnoses are imprecise, and outcomes cannot be independently verified; there are no clear standards for what defines major bleeding in administrative claims, so comparisons between analyses are not straightforward. No inference is made with regard to cause and effect between interventions and outcomes, and no comparisons have been made between WATCHMAN and any other treatments for the reduction in AF-related stroke risk. Nonetheless, we believe the observed patterns can help to inform future hypothesis generation, clinical decision-making, and regulatory and policy considerations.

Second, despite the lack of inclusion or exclusion criteria, our study of Medicare beneficiaries still has limitations to generalizability. Although most patients eligible for WATCHMAN fall into this population, there are other populations of patients for whom patterns seen here may not apply, including individuals insured by Medicare Advantage, which now comprise ≈50% of Medicare beneficiarieswithout substantial differences in beneficiary characteristics compared with fee-for-service Medicare, the Department of Defense (Veteran's Affairs), or private insurance. Also, during the period of study, WATCHMAN 2.5 was the only commercially available LAAO device, so the findings here may not generalize to other LAAO devices including the contemporary version of the WATCHMAN device (WATCHMAN FLX). Finally, medical therapy has changed in meaningful ways since these data were collected. This includes recommended periprocedural anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, as well as therapy for the management of AF and related cardiovascular conditions like heart failure. These evolutions may have a meaningful impact on the outcomes reported.

AHA/ASA 2021 — left atrial appendage closure in nonvalvular AF after stroke: The left atrial appendage is the thrombus location 90% of the time; the Watchman device occludes the appendage and is the only device with US Food and Drug Administration approval for left atrial appendage closure. Current practice uses short-term oral anticoagulation for 1.5 months after Watchman placement followed by 4.5 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and in patients at high bleeding risk from oral anticoagulation, appendage closure can reduce long-term bleeding with an ischemic stroke risk comparable to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^86742de7]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent cardiovascular disease, and it is estimated that it will afflict over 12 million Americans by 2030. Patients with AF are at an increased risk for stroke, due primarily to stagnant blood in the fibrillating atrium forming a thrombus, which can then embolize to the cerebral circulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of these thrombi develop in the left atrial appendage. – Historically, patients with AF have been stratified for ischemic stroke risk based on demographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment with oral anticoagulation was recommended for all but the lowest-risk patients. Oral anticoagulation, however, presents its own risks, primarily of bleeding. First approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the WATCHMAN device was developed to prevent thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage for patients with AF and at least moderate risk of AF-related thromboembolism.

There are limited long-term data available on outcomes in patients who undergo left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with WATCHMAN in routine clinical practice. Claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are a useful source of long-term follow-up data, since most patients eligible for and treated with WATCHMAN are Medicare beneficiaries, and during the early period following market authorization of the WATCHMAN device, there were no other commercially available LAAO devices that shared similar coding. Furthermore, many of the outcomes of interest following LAAO including death and stroke are measurable in claims data. Thus, Medicare claims data offer an opportunity to understand how this novel technology has been applied in clinical practice, identify evidence gaps, and generate hypotheses for future analyses and clinical trials. In this study, we used Medicare claims data to evaluate the rates of stroke, bleeding, and death among the first cohort of WATCHMAN recipients in clinical practice.

Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion — registry participation and follow-up requirements include specific FDA stipulations and counts: In its approval of the WATCHMAN device, the FDA specified several requirements, including continued follow-up of patients from the initial investigational device exemption studies and a new enrollment study of 1,000 patients implanted with a WATCHMAN device who have agreed to a 2-year clinical follow-up; in addition, the FDA approval stipulated the development, participation, and support of an LAA Occlusion National Cardiovascular Data Registry. The registry will include 1,000 serially implanted patients who are not enrolled in the new enrollment study, and it will be serially linked to the CMS database annually for 5 years post-implant, and the writing committee strongly believes that participation in a national registry should be mandatory for all LAA occlusion programs.

### Prospective randomized evaluation of the watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with atrial fibrillation versus long-term warfarin therapy: the PREVAIL trial [^a1cfd75f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial that evaluated patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion was noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention, but a periprocedural safety hazard was identified.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of LAA occlusion for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF compared with long-term warfarin therapy.

Methods

This randomized trial further assessed the efficacy and safety of the Watchman device. Patients with NVAF who had a CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack) score ≥ 2 or 1 and another risk factor were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to undergo LAA occlusion and subsequent discontinuation of warfarin (intervention group, n = 269) or receive chronic warfarin therapy (control group, n = 138). Two efficacy and 1 safety coprimary endpoints were assessed.

Results

At 18 months, the rate of the first coprimary efficacy endpoint (composite of stroke, systemic embolism [SE], and cardiovascular/unexplained death) was 0.064 in the device group versus 0.063 in the control group (rate ratio 1.07 [95% credible interval (CrI): 0.57 to 1.89]) and did not achieve the prespecified criteria noninferiority (upper boundary of 95% CrI ≥ 1.75). The rate for the second coprimary efficacy endpoint (stroke or SE > 7 days' postrandomization) was 0.0253 versus 0.0200 (risk difference 0.0053 [95% CrI: -0.0190 to 0.0273]), achieving noninferiority. Early safety events occurred in 2.2% of the Watchman arm, significantly lower than in PROTECT AF, satisfying the pre-specified safety performance goal. Using a broader, more inclusive definition of adverse effects, these still were lower in PREVAIL (Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trial than in PROTECT AF (4.2% vs. 8.7%; p = 0.004). Pericardial effusions requiring surgical repair decreased from 1.6% to 0.4% (p = 0.027), and those requiring pericardiocentesis decreased from 2.9% to 1.5% (p = 0.36), although the number of events was small.

Conclusions

In this trial, LAA occlusion was noninferior to warfarin for ischemic stroke prevention or SE > 7 days' post-procedure. Although noninferiority was not achieved for overall efficacy, event rates were low and numerically comparable in both arms. Procedural safety has significantly improved. This trial provides additional data that LAA occlusion is a reasonable alternative to warfarin therapy for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF who do not have an absolute contraindication to short-term warfarin therapy.

### Life in the left atrial appendage fast lane after FDA approval: moving forward on new technology at last [^5c0b0a23]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

FDA approval of the WATCHMAN is expected to spur development and availability of a range of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies for left atrial appendage occlusion. The fourth generation WATCHMAN described in this article has multiple features that will potentially streamline the deployment process and have the potential to make left atrial appendage occlusion safer. The population studied was too small to compare the relatively high adverse event rate with the known outcomes associated with existing WATCHMAN technology. Going forward, in part because of improvements in technology, it is likely that late ischemic stroke will supplant pericardial effusion as a key outcome measure for ongoing assessment of WATCHMAN safety and efficacy.

### Initial experience with high-risk patients excluded from clinical trials: safety of short-term anticoagulation after left atrial appendage closure device [^ce7f07a9]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The implantation of left atrial appendage closure device (WATCHMAN, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) is an alternative option to oral anticoagulation (OAC) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Patients require short-term OAC after implantation to avoid device thrombosis. The 2 clinical trials that assessed this device excluded patients thought not to be candidates for OAC. As such, little is known about the safety of this strategy in patients with previous major bleeding events.

Methods and Results

All 20 consecutive patients with history of spontaneous major bleeding while on OAC who had subsequently undergone WATCHMAN device implantation at our institution were included. A newly conceived multidisciplinary Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Prevention Center evaluated patients for candidacy for device implantation and subsequent antithrombotic therapy. The primary outcome was spontaneous major bleeding while receiving short-term postprocedural OAC. Median CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were 5 (quartiles 5–6) and 5 (quartiles 4–5), respectively. Previous major bleeding events were major gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, spontaneous hemopericardium with cardiac tamponade, and hemarthrosis in 11, 7, 1, and 1 patients, respectively. None of the patients had spontaneous major bleeding during the course of OAC after device implantation. In 1 patient, OAC was discontinued after 40 days because of mechanical fall with head trauma resulting in subdural hematoma with no associated neurological deficits; this was managed conservatively.

Conclusions

With careful multidisciplinary evaluation, a short course of OAC after WATCHMAN device implantation in patients with previous spontaneous major bleeding events is associated with low risk of recurrent spontaneous major bleeding.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure with the watchman device: long-term results up to 5 years [^8d902c5a]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with the Watchman device.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias and is associated with a high risk for cardioembolic ischemic events, most notably stroke. Percutaneous LAA closure is an alternative to oral anticoagulation, because most thrombi originate from the LAA.

Methods

All consecutive patients with minimum CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 1 who underwent LAA closure with the Watchman device between June 2006 and August 2010 were eligible. Follow-up examinations were performed after 45 days to 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year and thereafter annually. Afterward, alternating office visits and telephone follow-up were performed every 6 months.

Results

A total of 102 patients were included. The mean age was 71.6 ± 8.8 years, and 37.3% were women. The mean CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 2.7 ± 1.3 and 4.3 ± 1.7, respectively. Procedural success was achieved in 96.1% of patients. During a mean follow-up period of 3.0 ± 1.6 years, the annual rates of transient ischemic attack, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and death were 0.7%, 0.7%, 1.1%, and 3.5%, respectively.

Conclusions

LAA closure with the Watchman device is safe and feasible for stroke protection in patients with atrial fibrillation. Low ischemic events rates demonstrate its effectiveness during long-term follow-up.

### Left atrial appendage closure: a new technique for clinical practice [^921f127b]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It is associated with increased risk for stroke mainly due to cardiac embolism from the left atrial appendage (LAA). Occlusion of the LAA by means of a device represents a valid alternative to oral anticoagulation, mainly in patients who cannot tolerate this therapy because of a high bleeding risk. Recent data on the endocardial device WATCHMAN show encouraging results for this patient population in terms of stroke risk reduction compared to the expected rate as well as in terms of implant success. This article reviews all relevant publications related to the main surgical and transcatheter devices used for LAA closure (LAAC).

Methods/Results

PROTECT-AF, the first prospective randomized trial conducted on this technique, showed that LAA occlusion using the WATCHMAN was noninferior to warfarin for a combined end-point in patients with nonvalvular AF. There is a lack of large-scale randomized trials on long-term stroke risk in patients submitted to LAAC. Most studies are relatively small and focus on the comparison of different surgical techniques with regard to complete/incomplete closure success. More recently, PROTECT-AF long-term results (4-year follow-up) demonstrated that LAAC was statistically superior to warfarin in terms of efficacy.

Conclusion

This review concludes that it is now appropriate to consider these techniques for patients with AF who are at high risk for stroke for whom effective conventional or novel anticoagulant therapy is not available or who present problems in managing drug treatment.

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^5e84e4c8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) devices — FDA postapproval surveillance for the WATCHMAN device included requirements for 3 postapproval studies: a continued follow-up of prior cohorts; a new enrollment study of 1,000 patients with 2-year clinical follow-up and 5-year claims follow-up; and a novel surveillance study of an additional 1,000 patients enrolled in a registry with 12 months of clinical follow-up and 5 years of claims follow-up. FDA-proposed timing for postapproval assessments specifies clinical assessment at 45 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years and additional follow-up with claims data through 5 years. The latter 2 registry-based studies are patterned after the TVT registry, and a registry would optimally be "device agnostic", designed to capture data for all patients undergoing percutaneous left atrial closure regardless of the technology employed. Registries would include estimates of risks for stroke using CHA2DS2-VASc and of bleeding using an accepted score such as HAS-BLED, previous experience with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and follow-up outcomes including immediate procedural success, procedural complications, longitudinal rates of death, stroke, bleeding, hospitalization, and longer-term device complications. The use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy should also be collected during follow-up, and a critical element that should be included in the registry is an assessment of learning curve effects.

### Bleeding outcomes after left atrial appendage closure compared with long-term warfarin: a pooled, patient-level analysis of the WATCHMAN randomized trial experience [^0709d414]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the relative risk of major bleeding with left atrial appendage (LAA) closure compared with long-term warfarin therapy.

Background

LAA closure is an alternative approach to chronic oral anticoagulation for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

We conducted a pooled, patient-level analysis of the 2 randomized clinical trials that compared WATCHMAN (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) LAA closure with long-term warfarin therapy in AF.

Results

A total of 1,114 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 3.1 years. The overall rate of major bleeding from randomization to the end of follow-up was similar between treatment groups (3.5 events vs. 3.6 events per 100 patient-years; rate ratio [RR]: 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66 to 1.40; p = 0.84). LAA closure significantly reduced bleeding > 7 days post-randomization (1.8 events vs. 3.6 events per 100 patient-years; RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.75; p = 0.001), with the difference emerging 6 months after randomization (1.0 events vs. 3.5 events per 100 patient-years; RR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.49; p < 0.001), when patients assigned to LAA closure were able to discontinue adjunctive oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. The reduction in bleeding with LAA closure was directionally consistent across all patient subgroups.

Conclusions

There was no difference in the overall rate of major bleeding in patients assigned to LAA closure compared with extended warfarin therapy over 3 years of follow-up. However, LAA closure significantly reduced bleeding beyond the procedural period, particularly once adjunctive pharmacotherapy was discontinued. The favorable effect of LAA closure on long-term bleeding should be considered when selecting a stroke prevention strategy for patients with nonvalvular AF.

### Evaluating the new watchman FLX pro 40 mm device: a case study series [^4771fecd]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is a well-established alternative for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are not suitable for long-term anticoagulation. The WATCHMAN FLX Pro 40mm device is a novel advancement featuring a fluoropolymer coating to enhance thromboresistance and a size expansion to accommodate larger left atrial appendages (LAA). However, clinical data on this new device remains limited.

Objective

This study presents the first case series evaluating the procedural success, safety, and early outcomes of the 40mm WATCHMAN FLX Pro device.

Methods

A total of nine patients underwent LAAC with the 40mm WATCHMAN FLX Pro between July and November 2024. Pre-procedural imaging, intraoperative guidance, procedural outcomes, and follow-up imaging were analyzed. Procedural success was defined by the successful deployment of the device meeting "PASS" criteria, with no major complications.

Results

The study demonstrated a 100% procedural success rate, with all patients undergoing same-day discharge. No procedural or periprocedural complications were observed. Follow-up imaging at 4 months (available for 88.9% of patients) revealed no high-grade device-related thrombus (DRT), though some cases exhibited peridevice leaks, predominantly minor subfabric leaks.

Conclusion

The 40mm WATCHMAN FLX Pro expands LAAC treatment options for patients with larger LAA anatomy, demonstrating a favorable safety and efficacy profile in this early experience. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate these findings.

### Left atrial appendage exclusion for stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation [^27ae9adf]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy of oral anticoagulation (OAC) for stroke prevention in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF) has clearly been established. However, a substantial number of patients with AF who are at high risk for thromboembolic events are not candidates for long-term OAC. The left atrial appendix (LAA) is the most common place of thrombosis in patients with AF, and it can easily be excluded from the systemic circulation at the time of cardiac surgery by excision, ligation, suturing, or stapling. Currently, removal of the LAA at the time of mitral valve surgery is recommended to reduce future stroke risk. The ongoing LAA Occlusion Study (LAAOS) is evaluating the efficacy of the routine LAA occlusion in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Recently, two devices specifically designed for percutaneous transcatheter LAA occlusion have been introduced: the Percutaneous LAA Transcatheter Occlusion (PLAATO; Appriva Medical Inc) and WATCHMAN LAA system (Atritech, Inc). More than 200 PLAATO devices were implanted worldwide in patients with nonrheumatic AF who were at high risk for ischemic stroke and not candidates for long-term OAC. In a follow-up time of 258 patient-years, an estimated 61% reduction in stroke risk was achieved with PLAATO procedure. The WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic PROTECTion in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the WATCHMAN device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are eligible for long-term OAC. The trial is assessing whether the treatment arm (WATCHMAN device) is noninferior to the control arm (warfarin). Although present results suggest that LAA occlusion may reduce the long-term stroke risk, available data are still very limited. At present, percutaneous LAA occlusion may be an acceptable option in selected high-risk patients with AF who are not candidates for OAC. The current understanding of LAA exclusion for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonrheumatic AF is the major focus of this review.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion: current advances and remaining challenges [^1d876fb6]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Key Findings of the LAAO Randomized Clinical Trials

The totality of the data suggests that LAAO is not inferior to anticoagulation in carefully selected patients with nonvalvular AF. However, several concerns remain. 1) A key issue with these data is the lack of convincing evidence that supports the mechanism of action of LAAO; reducing cardiac thromboembolism due to exclusion of the LAA cavity from systemic circulation. Indeed, ischemic events were higher in the device arm in PROTECT AF and PREVAIL (Figure 2), raising the question of whether LAAO is effective in eliminating the embolic source or whether its efficacy is merely driven by the mitigation of the bleeding risks associated with long-term anticoagulation. 2) The infrequency of ischemic events in the trial raises some concerns about the fragility of the conclusions. It is likely that the power calculations performed during trial design utilized expected ischemic rates based on historical risk-prediction schemes (ie, CHA2DS2-VASc) that are shown to overestimate the risk of ischemic stroke in contemporary practice. Hence, the potential need for larger trials to further confirm the role of LAAO for stroke prevention has been raised.3) These trials only enrolled patients who are deemed candidate for a short-term course of anticoagulation after the procedure. No randomized data are yet available to support LAAO in patients with absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. The only RCT that was designed to assess this population (ASAP-TOO [Assessment of the WATCHMAN™ Device in Patients Unsuitable for Oral Anticoagulation] trial;) was terminated due to enrollment difficulties although follow-up for the enrolled patients will continue through 5 years.

### Transition from WATCHMAN V.2.5 to WATCHMAN FLX for closure of the left atrial appendage: echocardiographic and clinical findings [^f080d88e]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who had a stroke, at least 90% of underlying thrombi are originating from the left atrial appendage (LAA). Therefore, interventional closure of the left atrial appendage (LAAC) has been established as an alternative treatment within the last years — especially if contraindications regarding the use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) are existing. Nowadays, several manufacturers are offering various devices for LAAC (for review see Cruz-Gonzalez et al), as the anatomy of appendages varies in shape, size and lobar structure. Among them, the WATCHMAN device is one of the most studied devices so far. WATCHMAN FLX (WM FLX) as the newest WATCHMAN LAAC device has been available within the EU since 2015, redesigned in 2019, and in the USA since 2020, respectively. The WM FLX differs in several technical characteristics from its precursor, the WATCHMAN V.2.5 (WM V.2.5), which is paralleled by changes in the handling instructions during the implantation procedure.

Meanwhile, a number of clinical studies have shown the clinical performance of the WM FLX in patients with AF, indicating a further improvement of clinical endpoints in comparison to its precursor version. However, detailed information especially regarding differences in echocardiographic findings during follow-up examinations between the two devices are scarce so far.

### Intracardiac versus transesophageal echocardiography for left atrial appendage occlusion with watchman [^98b4276d]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is mostly performed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) may be an alternative imaging modality for LAAO that precludes the need for general anesthesia or sedation.

Methods and Results

All consecutive single center, single operator LAAO candidates were analyzed. Baseline clinical and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between patients in whom a Watchman was implanted with ICE vs. TEE guidance. In 76 consecutive patients the Watchman device was deployed under ICE in 32 patients (42%) and under TEE guidance in 44 patients (58%). Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups, except that patients in the TEE group were older (81 [75–85] years vs. 75 [68–80] years, P = 0.007). Total injected contrast media as well as fluoroscopy time were comparable between groups (90 mL [54–140] vs. 85 mL [80–110], P = 0.86 and 7.9 min [6.4–15.5] vs. 9.8 min [7.0–13.2], P = 0.51, for TEE vs. ICE, respectively). However, time from femoral venous puncture to transseptal puncture and to closure was longer in the ICE group (14 min [7.3–20] vs. 6 min [3.3–11], P = 0.007 and 48 min [40–60] vs. 34.5 min [27–44], P = 0.003, respectively). In the TEE group one patient suffered esophageal erosion with bleeding, which was managed conservatively and one non-LAAO related in-hospital mortality occurred in an 88-year-old patient. Device implantation success rate was 100% in both groups. No device embolization, no significant peri-device leak, no tamponade, no stroke, and no access site bleeding occurred in any patient. Total hospital stay for stand-alone LAAO was comparable between groups (2 days [2–2] vs. 2 days [2–3.3], P = 0.17, in ICE vs. TEE, respectively).

Conclusions

ICE guidance for LAAO with the Watchman device is feasible and comparable to TEE and may become the preferred imaging modality for LAAO. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: an update [^0a70cc16]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since the first percutaneous LAA closure in 2002, a rapidly growing number of studies have shown that this strategy can be a safe and efficacious therapy in the management of patients with NVAF for whom OAC is indicated but who are at a high risk of bleeding. As a result, the WATCHMAN device received substantial endorsement from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel in December 2013 — a definitive FDA approval is expected later this year.

Although the only RCTs available until now (PROTECT AF, PREVAIL) included only patients who were eligible for OAC therapy, we believe that the current data only justify the use of this therapeutic option in patients with contraindications to OAC therapy. Patients with NVAF who have no contraindication(s) for OAC should have LAA occlusion only in exceptional cases. Accordingly, the updated ESC guidelines recommend LAA occlusion in patients with AF who are at a high risk of stroke and who have contraindications to long-term OAC therapy.

In future studies, it will be important to identify patients who may benefit the most from percutaneous LAA closure as a valid strategy for stroke prevention. It has been reported that LAA closure has a larger 'net clinical benefit' when compared with OAC therapy in patients with a high stroke risk — the higher the stroke risk, the larger the 'net clinical benefit' of LAA occlusion. On the other hand, patients at a high risk for thromboembolism — high platelet count, high CHADS₂ score, LV dysfunction or prior stroke — have also been shown to be at a higher risk for LA cavity thrombusand device thrombosis. Clearly, more studies are warranted to investigate whether some subgroups are more suitable for LAA closure than others.

When starting up an LAA closure programme, it is important to understand that safety is the most 'vulnerable' aspect of the procedure — a low complication rate is a 'must' in order to establish a successful programme. Moreover, one should realise that imaging is an integral part of planning, performing and follow-up of LAA closure procedures. In addition, the LAA has a highly variable anatomical structure and may offer various procedural challenges.

### Delayed dislodgment of a watchman device: a rare complication manifesting as a transient ischemic event [^3f79a8e4]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of left atrial appendage occlusion devices for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to expand. Device embolization is a rare but potentially catastrophic complication with variable clinical presentations. Here, we present a case of delayed dislodgment of a watchman device discovered on routine echocardiographic follow-up in a patient who later admitted to neurological symptoms. Urgent surgical device retrieval was performed with no further complications or neurological sequelae.

### Implant success and safety of left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device: peri-procedural outcomes from the EWOLUTION registry [^8d7cb40c]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The study adhered to international rules for scientific studies, the Helsinki principles, with local ethics committee approval in all participating centres. All subjects provided informed consent prior to the procedure. Boston Scientific Corporation provided funding for the study.

Briefly, EWOLUTION was designed as a multicentre, prospective, non-randomized cohort study aiming to include over 1000 patients. Subjects were recruited from the general population of clinical sites at each participating physician's discretion if they were eligible to receive the WATCHMAN device according to the appropriate local and international guidelines, and were of legal age to provide informed consent. Implanting physicians and centres with varying levels of past experience with the device participated in the registry. All implanting physicians underwent a thorough training and certification programme to ensure an appropriate level of expertise in order to minimize patient risk.

Follow-up for subjects was based on each institution's standard practice, generally a clinical visit between 1 and 3 months post-procedure, LAA imaging to assess residual flow around the device, and annual follow-up visits. Reporting on adverse events in this study is based on peri-procedural monitoring until 30 days of follow-up post-procedure. The relatedness of each adverse event to the device/procedure was determined by the participating centre. Events and relevant source documents were additionally reviewed by the Sponsor Medical Safety Group (MSG). The MSG includes physicians with expertise in Electrophysiology and/or Cardiology, as well as other healthcare professionals with the necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to evaluate the events. Centres were required to provide additional information in case of disagreement with the investigators' assessment of device-relatedness classification. The MSG could overrule the investigator to upgrade an event to become device-/procedure-related. On the other hand, the MSG could never downgrade the centre classification to classify an event as unrelated to the device/procedure. For all patient deaths, source documents were requested at the sites and reviewed by the MSG.

### Amulet or watchman device for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure: primary results of the SWISS-APERO randomized clinical trial [^e96bea2c]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

No study has so far compared Amulet with the new Watchman FLX in terms of residual left atrial appendage (LAA) patency or clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous LAA closure.

Methods

In the investigator-initiated SWISS APERO trial (Comparison of Amulet Versus Watchman/FLX Device in Patients Undergoing Left Atrial Appendage Closure), patients undergoing LAA closure were randomly assigned (1:1) open label to receive Amulet or Watchman 2.5 or FLX (Watchman) across 8 European centers. The primary end point was the composite of justified crossover to a nonrandomized device during LAA closure procedure or residual LAA patency detected by cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at 45 days. The secondary end points included procedural complications, device-related thrombus, peridevice leak at transesophageal echocardiography, and clinical outcomes at 45 days.

Results

Between June 2018 and May 2021, 221 patients were randomly assigned to Amulet (111 [50.2%]) or Watchman (110 [49.8%]), of whom 25 (22.7%) patients included before October 2019 received Watchman 2.5, and 85 (77.3%) patients received Watchman FLX. The primary end point was assessable in 205 (92.8%) patients and occurred in 71 (67.6%) patients receiving Amulet and 70 (70.0%) patients receiving Watchman, respectively (risk ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.80–1.16]; P = 0.713). A single justified crossover occurred in a patient with Amulet who fulfilled LAA patency criteria at 45-day CCTA. Major procedure-related complications occurred more frequently in the Amulet group (9.0% versus 2.7%; P = 0.047) because of more frequent bleeding (7.2% versus 1.8%). At 45 days, the peridevice leak rate at transesophageal echocardiography was higher with Watchman than with Amulet (27.5% versus 13.7%, P = 0.020), albeit none was major (ie, > 5 mm), whereas device-related thrombus was detected in 1 (0.9%) patient with Amulet and 3 (3.0%) patients with Watchman at CCTA and in 2 (2.1%) and 5 (5.5%) patients at transesophageal echocardiography, respectively. Clinical outcomes at 45 days did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

Amulet was not associated with a lower rate of the composite of crossover or residual LAA patency compared with Watchman at 45-day CCTA. Amulet, however, was associated with lower peridevice leak rates at transesophageal echocardiography, higher procedural complications, and similar clinical outcomes at 45 days compared with Watchman. The clinical relevance of CCTA-detected LAA patency requires further investigation.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^21e88abf]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In a selected cohort of patients who underwent successful elective LAAC with the WATCHMAN device without same-day procedure-related complications, the primary safety outcome and secondary outcomes were similar in patients with SDD compared with non-SDD. At 7 and 45 days post-procedure, there were no statistically significant differences in stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding requiring transfusion, vascular complications requiring endovascular intervention, death, all-cause readmission, and significant peri-device flow or device-related thrombus on 45-day TEE between the two groups. SDD has the potential to minimize the unnecessary use of medical resources and improve patient satisfaction without compromising patient safety. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, our findings are considered hypothesis generating. Prospective trials with postprocedural randomization of SDD and non-SDD are warranted to confirm the findings of our study.

PREVAIL early results at the December 2013 FDA panel — At 18 months, the first coprimary composite outcome occurred in 6.4% with WATCHMAN versus 6.3% with warfarin and did not meet non-inferiority, while the second coprimary outcome occurred in 2.5% versus 2.0%, meeting noninferiority; because both endpoints had to meet noninferiority, overall noninferiority was not met. Safety showed no procedure-related deaths, a primary safety endpoint rate of 2.2% in WATCHMAN, and pericardial effusion requiring drainage in 1.5% of WATCHMAN patients.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion: current advances and remaining challenges [^3efe9f7f]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for DRT

Identifying predisposing factors for DRT is crucial to optimize risk stratification and procedural outcomes. However, this task has been challenging due to the large number of potential risk factors and the low DRT event rate overall. Nonetheless, several predictors of DRT have been identified in the literature (Figure 4). One study attempted to model a risk-prediction scheme (the DRT score) to provide a practical aid for clinicians when considering patients for LAAO. The DRT score was derived from an international registry of 711 patients (237 with and 474 without DRT). In this registry, among > 40 candidate risk factors considered in the logistic regression model, 5 were independently predictive of DRT (hypercoagulopathy, renal insufficiency, permanent AF, deep device implantation, and pericardial effusion). Although the type of post-LAAO antithrombotic therapy in this global registry did not impact the risk of DRT, other studies yielded opposite conclusions. In the Watchman trials and nested registries, the incidence of DRT was higher when the post-LAAO regimen included antiplatelets therapy alone vs anticoagulation (3.1% vs 1.4%, P = 0.018). In the NCDR LAAO (National Cardiovascular Data Registry Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion) registry, a short course of anticoagulation with warfarin or a DOAC after the procedure was associated with a lower incidence of major adverse events through 6 months of follow-up. Finally, whether the risk of DRT is device-specific remains uncertain. The Amulet device had a slightly lower DRT rate than the Watchman 2.5 device in the Amulet IDE trial, and this was hypothesized to be related to the larger neo-LAA that remains with plug-based vs disc-lobe device and to the differential impact on device design on healing and endothelialization (Figure 5). This concept remains to be corroborated in further studies.

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^75181756]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion — WATCHMAN randomized trial design (PROTECT AF) — Two randomized controlled trials and several observational studies include more than 2,400 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) implanted with WATCHMAN. In PROTECT AF, 707 patients were enrolled between February 2005 and June 2008 at 59 sites in the United States and Europe, with warfarin-eligible patients (CHADS2 score ≥ 1) randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive WATCHMAN or control (warfarin) therapy. Post-implant management for WATCHMAN patients included warfarin for at least 45 days, a transesophageal echocardiogram at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months, and warfarin discontinuation if LAA closure was complete or the width of the flow jet was < 5 mm; thereafter clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily were prescribed until completion of 6-month follow-up, followed by aspirin alone. Control patients received warfarin for the duration of the study with an international normalized ratio goal 2.0 to 3.0. PROTECT AF was designed to assess the noninferiority of WATCHMAN compared with warfarin for a composite endpoint of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

### Left atrial appendage closure-current status and future directions [^88f3c4f6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has become an important non-pharmacological intervention for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). LAAC aims to reduce the risk of thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding, a crucial strategy for patients at high risk for bleeding. Over the last few decades, the safety and long-term efficacy of the procedure in specific populations have grown, and more patients are being treated with these devices. Current and future studies focus on expanding the target population as well as the iteration of current technology. This article reviews recent, present, and future LAAC studies on the two most common devices, the Watchman device (Boston Scientific Corporation) and the Amplatzer cardiac plug (ACP) (St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, MN), and their subsequent next generations, the Watchman FLX, and the Amulet, respectively.

Left atrial appendage closure versus adjusted-dose warfarin in atrial fibrillation — A randomized study of 707 patients compared percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure using the WATCHMAN device with adjusted-dose warfarin targeting an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 and found a statistically nonsignificant reduction in the primary efficacy outcome with LAA closure (absolute risk reduction, 1.9% per year; 95% CI, 3.2% per year less to 1.2% per year more), along with a significantly higher rate of adverse events in the LAA closure arm (absolute risk increase, 3.0% per year), including serious pericardial effusion in 4.8% of patients; the guideline states, "At this time, we make no formal recommendations regarding LAA closure devices".

### Commentary: watch out for WATCHMAN device failures [^490a0dbc]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

In 3 patients, the device was explanted and the left atrial appendage (LAA) excluded with either suture or with the AtriClip (AtriCure Inc, Mason, Ohio). In 1 patient, the device remained and the LAA was excluded with the AtriClip and in another patient the device was excluded with a pericardial patch. LAA occlusion was 100% successful — there was no flow or residual stump of the LAA; all patients underwent a maze procedure at the time of operation.

Several questions arise from this case series. First, why did 3 of these patients require valve replacements? Did the WATCHMAN device cause these valve pathologies and if not, shouldn't these patients have been referred for surgical valve treatment and maze as the initial treatment? If the valve pathologies were caused by the device, it would be interesting to see on echocardiography how the device caused MR or aortic valve disease; there are case reports in the literature of MR and aortic stenosis caused by the WATCHMAN device. Second, while the immediate postoperative echocardiography findings are promising, we know that most failures occur late. This series would be strengthened by long-term imaging confirmation of LAA occlusion. Third, 2 of the patients remained on anticoagulation for 6 months; this seems unusual since both of the patients had preoperative bleeding complications. If the anticoagulation is for prevention of thromboembolism after bioprosthetic valve replacement, then why was one of the patients on rivaroxaban, which is not the recommended anticoagulant, and both were anticoagulated for 6 months, which is on the longer end of the recommended 3-6-months?Finally, the authors include a supplemental video, which nicely shows a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique for LAA exclusion with the AtriClip while keeping the device in place. This approach, as the authors comment in their conclusions, works well when there is no atrial thrombus or protrusion of the device into the left atrium. But when those criteria are not met, a robotic or right mini-thoracotomy approach could be equally effective while providing patients with the benefit of a minimally invasive operation.

This series is an excellent summary of the types of WATCHMAN device failures and varied surgical approaches to address these failures and eliminate the LAA as a source of stroke. We encourage the authors to elaborate on this series with more patient and operative details to further understand the optimal surgical management of these complex WATCHMAN device failures.

### Amplatzer amulet left atrial appendage occluder versus watchman device for stroke prophylaxis (amulet IDE): a randomized, controlled trial [^9d62cd6f]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board monitored all safety data and was involved in decisions regarding trial continuation. Adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee that was blinded to treatment assignment and device implanted. An independent core laboratory was used to analyze transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) images.

Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with documented paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and were at increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism defined as CHADS₂ score ≥ 2 or a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥ 3. Patients were screened with TEE to ensure suitable LAA anatomy for implanting both devices before enrollment. As required by the directions for use for the Watchman device, patients had to be suitable for anticoagulation therapy for 6 months and have appropriate rationale to seek a nonpharmacological alternative. A complete list of enrollment criteria is provided in. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo percutaneous LAAO with the Amulet occluder (Abbott) or the Watchman device (Boston Scientific) according to a computer-generated randomization scheme (Table 1 ;). Randomization was stratified by investigational site in permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6.

Table 1.
Comparison of Devices

Procedures

Implant procedures were guided by TEE and fluoroscopy. Patients implanted with the Amulet occluder were discharged on either aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin plus OAC at the discretion of the investigator, whereas patients assigned to and implanted with the Watchman device received aspirin plus warfarin per the device directions for use. When LAAO was confirmed by TEE (residual jet ≤ 5 mm) at the 45-day visit, cessation of OAC was required for all patients. Patients were then instructed to take aspirin and clopidogrel until the 6-month visit when clopidogrel was discontinued and aspirin continued indefinitely. Details about the trial assessments are shown in.

### SCAI / HRS expert consensus statement on transcatheter left atrial appendage closure [^8efd031a]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Transcatheter left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) in atrial fibrillation — abstract overview notes that exclusion of the left atrial appendage to reduce thromboembolic risk was first performed surgically in 1949, and over the past 2 decades LAAC has rapidly expanded with devices approved or in clinical development; procedure volumes have increased exponentially since Food and Drug Administration approval of the WATCHMAN (Boston Scientific) device in 2015. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) previously published statements in 2015 and 2016, and with publication of important clinical trials and registries, maturation of clinical practice, and evolving device and imaging technologies, SCAI prioritized an updated consensus to provide recommendations on contemporary, evidence-based best practices for transcatheter LAAC focusing on endovascular devices.

### Left atrial appendage closure: a therapy uniquely suited for specific populations of patients with atrial fibrillation [^3763dd7c]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia and confers a fivefold increased risk for stroke. Cardioembolic stroke secondary to AF is a devastating event, but is largely preventable with appropriate oral anticoagulation (OAC). The PROTECT and PREVAIL trials demonstrated that the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) device in combination with short-term warfarin therapy is noninferior to long-term warfarin with respect to a composite endpoint of stroke, cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism. Importantly, the WATCHMAN confers a significant reduction in life-threatening bleeding compared to OAC. Although direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) are superior to warfarin in eligible patients, several important AF populations exist in whom left atrial appendage (LAA) closure may be preferable to DOAC. Populations warranting strong consideration of LAAC include patients with contraindications to DOAC, end-stage renal disease, prior intracranial hemorrhage, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, and patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement or left atrial electrical isolation. Device-related thrombosis is an important complication of LAAC, and DOAC may be preferential to warfarin for prevention and treatment of this complication remains unexplored. Prospective clinical trials comparing DOAC to LAAC in these unique populations are either ongoing or needed.

### Propensity-matched comparison of oral Anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy after left atrial appendage closure with WATCHMAN [^6df14588]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In this propensity-matched analysis of post-left atrial appendage closure antithrombotic therapy, the safety and effectiveness of oral anticoagulation (OAC) and antiplatelet therapy (APT) were compared.

Background

Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device is an alternative to OAC in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, who are at high bleeding risk. Initial trials included 45 days of post-implantation OAC, but registry data suggest that APT may suffice.

Methods

Patients from the PROTECT-AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation), PREVAIL (Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy), CAP (Continued Access to PROTECT-AF), CAP2 (Continued Access to PREVAIL), ASAP (ASA Plavix Feasibility Study With Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology), and EWOLUTION (Registry on WATCHMAN Outcomes in Real-Life Utilization) trials receiving either OAC or APT post-implantation were matched and compared for nonprocedural bleeding and stroke or systemic thromboembolism over 6 months following implantation. Each patient on APT was matched with 2 patients on OAC, with propensity scores derived from age, sex, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, peripheral vascular disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, renal impairment, and different atrial fibrillation subtypes.

Results

The cohort on OAC (n = 1,018; 95% receiving warfarin and 5% receiving nonwarfarin OAC) was prescribed 45-day OAC post-implantation (92% also received single APT), followed by 6-month single or dual APT. The cohort on APT (n = 509; 91% receiving dual APT and 9% receiving single APT) received APT for variable durations. Six-month freedom from nonprocedural major bleeding was similar (OAC, 95.7%; APT, 95.5%; p = 0.775) despite more early bleeds with OAC. Freedom from thromboembolism beyond 7 days was similar between groups (OAC, 98.8%; APT, 99.4%; p = 0.089). However, device-related thrombosis was more frequent with APT (OAC, 1.4%; APT, 3.1%; p = 0.018).

Conclusions

After left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN, although device-related thrombosis was more common with APT, both APT and OAC strategies resulted in similar safety and efficacy endpoints.

### Clinical efficacy and safety comparison of watchman device versus ACP / amulet device for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a study-level meta-analysis of clinical trials [^fd1384ff]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although LAAC has been widely used in many centers, there are still some problems that need to be solved. First, more specific antithrombotic strategies are required. Warfarin had been widely used in the first 45 days for the postimplant anticoagulation after LAAC for preventing device‐related complications in previous pivotal trials, while novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) was used more frequently in resent studies. Nowadays, neither the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) nor the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines had specific recommendations on NOAC or warfarin at discharge after LAAC and the choice is left at the clinician's discretion. The Chinese Society of Cardiology (CSC) of the Chinese Medical Association recommends using OAC monotherapy for patients with high bleeding risk (30 days after LAAC) (HAS‐BLED ≥ 3 points), while OAC + aspirin was used for those with low bleeding risk (HAS‐BLED < 3 points). However, these recommendations were based on small clinical trials. Second, the efficacy and safety of the new generation device need to be verified. The Watchman FLX is a new generation product. The PINNACLE FLX study included 400 patients who underwent LAAC with Watchman FLX. The incidence of DRT was 1.75% at 12 months follow‐up and the incidence of PDL > 5 mm was 0%. The new generation device Watchman FLX is a new option to look forward for further applications. Watchman FLX achieved a near 100% implantation success and a substantial decrease in the occurrence of periprocedural complications as compared to Amplatzer Amulet occlusion. Watchman FLX also had a lower DRT at 45 daysand a higher sealing rate at 3 months as compared to the Watchman device in small sample size of clinical trials. Watchman FLX is the commonly implanted device, but it has not been widely used in most developing countries. Therefore, this study does not include the Watchman FLX. A comparison of the Amulet to the FLX device would be of significantly more interest in the future.

### SCAI / ACC / HRS institutional and operator requirements for left Atrial Appendage occlusion [^8af63206]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion cognitive requirements and background — Percutaneous LAA occlusion is a new technique, and a significant learning curve for deployment of the WATCHMAN device has demonstrated reduced procedure time, decreased complications, and improved procedural success rates with increasing operator experience; in the PREVAIL trial, Forty percent of the patients were enrolled by new implanters and success and complication rates were not significantly different from those achieved by experienced operators. In atrial fibrillation (AF), the main obstacle to long-term anticoagulant use is major bleeding, which has an incidence of 2%-4%/year, and the observation that greater than 90% of thrombi identified in patients with non-valvular AF are found in the LAA has led to development of mechanical approaches; Only one such device to date, the WATCHMAN, has received FDA approval for this indication. Physicians performing this procedure must have a firm grasp of the underlying principles surrounding AF, including the medical management and clinical course of AF; principles of rate and rhythm control; current tools for assessing stroke risk, such as the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system; the indications for and management of oral anticoagulant therapy and knowledge of the various agents available; understanding the risks and benefits of antiarrhythmic agents; understanding the bleeding risks of oral anticoagulants and the use of bleeding risk assessment tools such as the HAS-BLED score; knowledge of indications, risks, and benefits of invasive surgical and catheter-based ablation techniques; and knowledge and understanding of shared decision making. Prior to performing percutaneous LAA occlusion procedures, physicians should have a detailed understanding of the regional anatomy of the heart, including the left atrium and LAA.

### Safety and feasibility of same-day discharge after left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device [^75759d64]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

As the use of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) becomes more widespread, improvements in resource utilization and cost-effectiveness are necessary. Currently, there are limited data on same-day discharge (SDD) after LAAC. We aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDD versus non-SDD in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who underwent LAAC.

Methods:

We retrospectively studied 211 patients who underwent the WATCHMAN procedure in a tertiary hospital (June 2016 to June 2019). The primary safety outcome was the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding requiring transfusion, vascular complications requiring endovascular intervention, or death through 7 days (periprocedural) and 45 days post-procedure. The secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome and all-cause readmission. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients who had SDD and non-SDD post-procedure.

Results:

Patients with procedure-related complications on the day of LAAC and patients who were admitted for acute clinical events before LAAC were excluded. One hundred ninety patients were included in the final analysis. Seventy-two of 190 (38%) patients had SDD, and 118 of 190 (62%) had non-SDD. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary safety outcome through 7 days (1.4% versus 5.9%; P = 0.26) and 45 days post-procedure (2.8% versus 9.3%; P = 0.14) between the two groups. The secondary outcomes were similar in both groups. No patients had device-related thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography at 45 days. Only 1 patient from the non-SDD group had clinically significant peri-device flow (> 5 mm) at 45 days.

Conclusions:

In a selected cohort of patients who underwent successful elective LAAC with WATCHMAN without same-day procedure-related complications, the primary safety outcome and secondary outcomes through 7 and 45 days post-procedure were similar in the SDD and non-SDD groups. Our findings are hypothesis generating and warrant further investigation in prospective trials.

### 2015 ACC / HRS / SCAI left atrial appendage occlusion device societal Overview [^ac76927f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) stroke prevention — current evidence and guidelines report that AF affects as many as 6.1 million individuals in the United States and may account for as many as 1 in 5 strokes in persons over 80 years of age, and that for patients with nonvalvular AF, the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the most common source of thrombus resulting in stroke. Chronic anticoagulation — traditionally with warfarin and more recently with direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors — has been established as the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF who have an elevated stroke risk profile, provided that the risk of bleeding is not prohibitive, with stroke risk estimation using the CHA2DS2-VASc point score. The guideline includes a Class I recommendation for oral anticoagulation for patients with prior stroke or a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 (estimated annual stroke risk of 2.2%) in the context of shared decision making, and it does not formally include bleeding risk scores such as HAS-BLED in its recommendations. Guideline recommendations for LAA occlusion for stroke prevention are substantially more limited due to the lack of clinical trials data for any these devices aside from WATCHMAN.

### Strategies to incorporate left atrial appendage occlusion into clinical practice [^2c345cd3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The left atrial appendage (LAA) has been identified as a predominant source of thrombus formation leading to significant thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Medical therapy to eliminate thrombus formation in the LAA has been the standard of care for several decades, but mechanical approaches designed to exclude the LAA from the circulation have recently been developed. The largest body of randomized and nonrandomized data to date has been for the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts), which was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for selected patients in the United States. There are no current guidelines or guidance for institutions and operators looking to become involved in this therapy. This perspective is aimed at exploring these issues and providing necessary information and guidance to these programs and operators to help ensure a successful launch of a LAA occlusion program and optimize patient selection, procedural performance, and outcome.

### Effectiveness of left atrial appendage exclusion procedures to reduce the risk of stroke: a systematic review of the evidence [^0bd6171c]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is an important cause of cardioembolic stroke. Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce stroke risk but increase the risk of serious bleeding. Left atrial appendage (LAA) procedures have been developed to isolate the LAA from circulating blood flow, as an alternative to OAC. We conducted a systematic review of the benefits and harms of surgical and percutaneous LAA exclusion procedures.

Methods and Results

We searched multiple data sources, including Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase, through January 7, 2015. Of 2567 citations, 20 primary studies met prespecified inclusion criteria. We abstracted data on patient characteristics, stroke, mortality, and adverse effects. We assessed study quality and graded the strength of evidence using published criteria. Trials found low-strength evidence that percutaneous LAA exclusion confers similar risks of stroke and mortality as continued OAC, but this evidence was limited to the Watchman device in patients eligible for long-term OAC. Observational studies found moderate-strength evidence of serious harms with a variety of percutaneous LAA procedures. There is low-strength evidence that surgical LAA exclusion does not add significant harm during heart surgery for another indication, but evidence on stroke reduction is insufficient.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence that the Watchman device may be noninferior to long-term OAC in selected patients. Data on effectiveness of LAA exclusion devices is lacking in patients ineligible for long-term OAC. Percutaneous LAA devices are associated with high rates of procedure-related harms. Although surgical LAA exclusion during heart surgery does not seem to add incremental harm, there is insufficient evidence of benefit.

### Efficacy and safety of left atrial appendage closure with WATCHMAN in patients with or without contraindication to oral anticoagulation: 1-year follow-up outcome data of the EWOLUTION trial [^aa2584e6]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion with WATCHMAN has emerged as viable alternative to vitamin K antagonists in randomized controlled trials.

Objective

EWOLUTION was designed to provide data in routine practice from a prospective multicenter registry.

Methods

A total of 1025 patients scheduled for a WATCHMAN implant were prospectively and sequentially enrolled at 47 centers. Indication for LAA closure was based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Follow-up and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were performed per local practice.

Results

The baseline CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 4.5 ± 1.6; the mean age was 73.4 ± 9 years; previous transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke was present in 312 (30.5%), 155 (15.1%) had previous hemorrhagic stroke, and 320 (31.3%) had a history of major bleeding; and 750 (73%) were deemed unsuitable for oral anticoagulation therapy. WATCHMAN implant succeeded in 1005 (98.5%) of patients, without leaks > 5 mm in 1002 (99.7%) with at least 1 TEE follow-up in 875 patients (87%). Antiplatelet therapy was used in 784 (83%), while vitamin K antagonists were used in only 75 (8%). At 1 year, mortality was 98 (9.8%), reflecting the advanced age and comorbidities in this population. Device thrombus was observed in 28 patients at routine TEE (3.7%) and was not correlated with the drug regimen (P = 0.14). Ischemic stroke rate was 1.1% (relative risk 84% vs estimated historical data); the major bleeding rate was 2.6% and was predominantly (2.3%) nonprocedure/device related.

Conclusion

LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device has a high implant and sealing success. This method of stroke risk reduction appears to be safe and effective with an ischemic stroke rate as low as 1.1%, even though 73% of patients had a contraindication to and were not using oral anticoagulation.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following the WATCHMAN device use in Medicare beneficiaries [^e58dde80]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, there was a striking imbalance noted by race with > 93% of the cohort being White. The cohort of Black patients included just 1583 beneficiaries (3.25%) despite this group making up about 10% of the total Medicare population. While Black Americans have a lower lifetime likelihood of AF diagnosis compared with other groups, the prescription of oral anticoagulation after AF diagnosis is less likely compared with other groups, and the associated risk of stroke and bleeding is higher, regardless of anticoagulation prescription status. Whether this latter finding reflects differences in pathophysiology, medication persistence, or other factors remains uncertain and is deserving of future investigation to identify optimal strategies to balance risks of stroke and bleeding. In the meantime, however, patients with AF with lower socioeconomic status and those in racially and ethnically minoritized groups have less access to LAAO even when controlling for geographic factors. These differences mirror those seen for other cardiovascular procedures, suggesting that the differences are not related to medical decision-making per se but, rather, structural differences in access to care.

### Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: an update [^d7a49a5e]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Intermediate/long-term clinical outcome

Most of the studies published until now are non-randomised cohort studies or prospectively collected, retrospectively analysed multicentre registries, which demonstrate that annualised stroke rates after percutaneous LAA closure are favourable when compared with expected stroke rates as predicted by a CHADS 2 score (table 4).

Table 4
Intermediate/long-term outcome data following percutaneous LAA occlusion

The only prospective, randomised trial so far published is the PROTECT AF trial in which 707 patients with NVAF were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either percutaneous LAA occlusion with the WATCHMAN device or to warfarin therapy. The study was designed to assess the non-inferiority of the device against chronic OAC therapy. Patients with paroxysmal, persistent or permanent NVAF were eligible for enrolment if they had a CHADS 2 risk score ≥ 1. The trial confirmed the non-inferiority of WATCHMAN LAA occlusion compared with OAC therapy regarding the primary efficacy endpoint — a composite of stroke, systemic embolism and cardiovascular death (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.25). The probability of non-inferiority of the intervention was > 99.9%.

At the Heart Rhythm Society's 34th Annual Scientific Sessions (2013), 4-year follow-up results from the PROTECT AF trial were presented. The primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 2.3% of the device group vs 3.8% of the warfarin group (RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.05), demonstrating a 40% relative risk reduction in primary efficacy in the WATCHMAN group. Cardiovascular death occurred in 1.0% of the device group vs 2.4% of the warfarin group (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72, p < 0.05). The rate of haemorrhagic stroke was 0.2% in the device group vs 1% in the warfarin group (RR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.60, p < 0.05). In conclusion, these long-term follow-up data seem to provide additional support for LAA closure as a potential alternative to OAC therapy in patients with NVAF.

### SCAI / HRS expert consensus statement on transcatheter left atrial appendage closure [^9e38983c]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

SCAI/HRS expert consensus — combined procedures with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) are not routinely recommended pending data from ongoing RCTs. In a report of 139 patients from 10 European centers undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation followed by WATCHMAN LAAC in the same setting, LAAC success was 100% with early (28 days) 98% freedom from PDL of > 5 mm; at 2-year follow-up, 92% were off oral anticoagulation (OAC) with a relative 84% cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack reduction compared with predicted in similar-risk patients not treated with OAC. The OPTION trial enrolled ~1600 patients 1:1 to either OAC or WATCHMAN FLX following AF ablation, with approximately one-third of devices placed concomitantly; results are anticipated 2023. The AMAZE study prospectively randomized patients 2:1 to percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure (LARIAT, SentreHEART) as an adjunct to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) ablation and found that performing LAA ligation together with PVI was safe, with no reduction in recurrent AF compared with PVI alone. The WATCH-TAVR trial randomized 350 patients with aortic stenosis and AF to transcatheter aortic valve replacement and medical therapy versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement with concomitant WATCHMAN LAAC; results are anticipated 2023.

### Left atrial appendage occlusion in the Elderly: insights from PROTECT-AF, PREVAIL, and continuous access Registries [^7e11bc88]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Data on the safety and efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in elderly patients are limited.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare the outcomes of LAAO between patients ≥ 80 and < 80 years of age.

Methods

We included patients enrolled in randomized trials and nonrandomized registries of the Watchman 2.5 device. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular/unknown death, stroke, or systemic embolism at 5 years. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular/unknown death, stroke, systemic embolism, and major and nonprocedural bleeding. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards, and competing risk analysis methods. Interaction terms were used to compare the 2 age groups. We also estimated the average treatment effect of the device with the use of inverse probability weighting.

Results

We studied 2,258 patients, of whom 570 (25.2%) were ≥ 80 years old, and 1,688 (74.8%) were < 80 years old. Procedural complications at 7 days were similar in both age groups. The primary endpoint occurred in 12.0% in the device group vs 13.8% in the control group (HR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.6–1.4) among patients < 80 years of age and in 25.3% vs 21.7%, respectively (HR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.7–2.0) among patients ≥ 80 (interaction P = 0.48). There was no interaction between age and treatment effect for any of the secondary outcomes. The average treatment effects of LAAO (compared with warfarin) were similar in the elderly population (compared with younger patients).

Conclusions

Despite the higher event rates, octogenarians derive similar benefits from LAAO as their younger counterparts. Age alone should not preclude LAAO in otherwise suitable candidates.

PREVAIL extended follow-up and third FDA panel — After additional follow-up, eight more ischemic strokes occurred, totaling 13 in WATCHMAN versus 1 in control (rate ratio: 1.15, p = 0.044); hemorrhagic strokes were rare in both arms (rate ratio: 1.92, p = 0.61). Systemic embolism occurred in 1 WATCHMAN patient, deaths were evenly distributed (rate ratio: 1.45, p = 0.575), and PREVAIL failed to meet either primary efficacy endpoint, with ischemic stroke risk statistically significantly higher in WATCHMAN. Among 14 WATCHMAN subjects with ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, only 1 event was implant-related; the remaining 12 ischemic strokes and 1 systemic embolism occurred at a mean of 15 ± 8 months postimplant (range: 2 to 26 months). The warfarin control group had an unexpectedly low ischemic stroke rate (1 subject with 140.1 total patient-years of follow-up).

### Long-term outcomes following left atrial appendage occlusion in Medicare beneficiaries: outcomes from the national cardiovascular data registry [^7cf97f18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a catheter‐based alternative to long‐term anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation who are not good candidates for, or have contraindications to, long‐term anticoagulation. The WATCHMAN LAAO device (Boston Scientific Corporation)was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 after the completion of 2 pivotal trials showing that LAAO was noninferior to warfarin for preventing ischemic stroke. These studies required patients to be candidates for long‐term anticoagulation; however, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) only approved reimbursement for WATCHMAN implantation for patients able to take short‐term anticoagulation, not for those with contraindications to long‐term anticoagulation. Multiple studies have shown that the majority of patients undergoing LAAO in real‐world practice have contraindications to long‐term anticoagulation, most commonly bleeding. Given these key differences between trial patients and real‐world patients, there is a need to understand long‐term outcomes following LAAO in large nationally representative real‐world populations.

One‐year clinical outcomes following transcatheter LAAO were recently reported using follow‐up data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) LAAO registry and showed favorable outcomes, arguably superior to that observed in the pivotal trials. However, registry data could be limited by loss of follow‐up, incomplete data, or underreporting from sites. One‐year stroke rates may also be substantially impacted by postprocedural anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Postprocedural antithrombotic strategies vary but generally include anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 6 months, followed by single antiplatelet therapy thereafter. This may lead to lower stroke rates in the first year that are not sustained once short‐term anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy has been discontinued. To address these various limitations, we evaluated long‐term outcomes after LAAO using the NCDR LAAO registry linked to CMS inpatient claims data, which provides robust follow‐up for adverse events.

### Indications for left atrial appendage occlusion in the United States and associated in-hospital outcomes: results from the NCDR LAAO registry [^4f415682]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Food and Drug Administration approved left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device for patients who are at increased stroke risk and are suitable for oral anticoagulation but who have an appropriate reason to seek a nondrug alternative. These broad criteria raise the question of their interpretation in clinical practice. There is a lack of studies comprehensively evaluating the indications for Watchman implantation among a large series of patients from contemporary, real-world practice in the United States.

Methods

We used the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry to identify Watchman procedures performed between 2016 and 2018. We assessed procedural indications for Watchman implantation in the United States and evaluated the association between procedural indications and in-hospital adverse events.

Results

A total of 38314 procedures were included. The mean patient age was 76.1 ± 8.1 years, and 58.9% were men. The mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 4.8 ± 1.5, whereas the mean hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol (HAS-BLED) score was 3.0 ± 1.1. Prior stroke or transient ischemic attack was reported in 40.2% and prior bleeding in 70.1%, with gastrointestinal bleeding being most common (41.9%). The most common site-reported procedural indications for Watchman implantation were increased thromboembolic risk (64.8%) and history of major bleed (64.3%), followed by high fall risk (35.5%). Most (71.9%) had ≥ 2 procedural indications. Patients with high fall risk had increased risk of in-hospital adverse events (adjusted OR, 1.12; P = 0.025), but no other differences were found in the risk of in-hospital adverse events by procedural indication.

Conclusions

Among patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry, the most common procedural indications for Watchman implantation were increased thromboembolic risk, history of major bleed, and high fall risk. A majority of patients had multiple procedural indications. High fall risk conferred a modestly increased risk of in-hospital adverse events.

### Amplatzer amulet left atrial appendage occluder versus watchman device for stroke prophylaxis (amulet IDE): a randomized, controlled trial [^ff746df7]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient Characteristics

A total of 2592 patients were consented in the Amulet IDE trial (Figure 1). The most common reason for screen failure was LAA anatomy not being appropriate for one or both devices. From September 2016 through March 2019, a total of 1878 patients (1598 at 78 US centers and 280 at 30 centers outside the US) at 108 sites were randomly assigned to receive either an Amulet occluder (934) or Watchman device (944). Baseline characteristics were well-matched between groups (Table 2). The average age was 75 years, and a majority were men. Patients had a high risk for stroke and bleeding as reflected by the average CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (4.5 and 4.7) and HAS-BLED (3.2 and 3.3). History of stroke was present in ≈20% of patients.

Procedural Outcomes

Procedural outcomes are shown in Table 3. Device implant attempt as randomly assigned occurred in 915 patients with Amulet occluders and 916 patients with Watchman devices. Device successas randomly assigned was similar between groups (98.4% versus 96.4%). The most common reason for an unsuccessful implant was unsuitable patient anatomy, which was less common in the Amulet group (9 versus 30; Figure 1). Technical and procedural successes were similar between groups (97.2% versus 95.3% and 96.0% versus 94.5%). At hospital discharge, 75.7% of patients with Amulet occluders were on aspirin and clopidogrel and 20.0% were on anticoagulation plus aspirin. Most (82.0%) patients with Watchman devices were discharged on warfarin plus aspirin. At the 9-month follow-up visit and beyond, most patients (≈85%) in both groups were on single-antiplatelet therapy. Details of antithrombotic medication use at each scheduled follow-up visit are provided in Figure 2.

### LAAO in cardio-oncology: protecting the delicate balance between stroke and bleeding? [^d8cc0820]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cancer is well recognized as an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), and cancer therapies may increase the risk of AF through cardiotoxic effects. Malignancy, particularly upper gastrointestinal and hematological malignancies, increase the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis and thereby raises the ischemic stroke risk. The cornerstone of stroke prevention in AF remains systemic anticoagulation, which may promote bleeding because of the presence of metastases, thrombocytopenia, and drug-drug interactions with chemotherapeutic agents. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) has emerged as a means to mitigate stroke risk without the bleeding risk of anticoagulation. Since approval of the first-generation Watchman (Boston Scientific) by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, LAAO is now widely performed and has a 2B recommendation for stroke prevention in patients with AF and contraindications to long-term anticoagulation in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm guideline update. However, cancer patients were excluded from the original clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of Watchman LAAO, and outcomes in these patients remain unclear.

Limitations

Our study consists only of 169 LAAC cases which limits the statistical strength especially regarding clinical outcomes. Additionally, TEE was not available in all patients at both time points in part caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to the study protocol, only procedures with the WATCHMAN were included into the trial so that no comparison between different LAAC devices can be given.

### Comparative safety of transcatheter LAAO with the first-generation watchman and next-generation watchman FLX devices [^bdef7133]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Procedural complications limit the clinical benefit of transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO). Next-generation devices incorporate design modifications intended to improve procedural safety, but their clinical impact has not been described.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare in-hospital outcomes for the Watchman FLX with the predicate Watchman 2.5 device.

Methods

The National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAAO Registry was used to identify patients who received the Watchman FLX and an identical number of patients receiving the Watchman 2.5 at the same sites directly preceding the first Watchman FLX case at each site. The primary endpoint was in-hospital major adverse events (MAE), defined as a composite of death, cardiac arrest, stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracranial hemorrhage, systemic arterial embolism, major bleeding, major vascular complication, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion requiring intervention (percutaneous or surgical), and device embolization. A secondary analysis was performed using 2:1 propensity score matching of patients receiving the Watchman 2.5 or Watchman FLX.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 27,013 patients receiving each device. The rate of in-hospital MAE was significantly lower for the Watchman FLX compared with the Watchman 2.5 (1.35% vs 2.40%; adjusted OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.50–0.65; P < 0.0001), driven largely by fewer pericardial effusions requiring intervention (0.42% vs 1.23%; adjusted OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.28–0.42; P < 0.0001). The Watchman FLX was also associated with significant lower rates of the individual endpoints of in-hospital mortality (0.12% vs 0.24%; P < 0.0001), major bleeding (1.08% vs 2.05%; P < 0.0001), cardiac arrest (0.13% vs 0.24%; P = 0.006), and device embolization (0.02% vs 0.06%; P = 0.028), while myocardial infarction, stroke, and major vascular complications did not differ between groups. Propensity score matching analysis demonstrated similar results, with lower rates of MAE with the Watchman FLX (1.34% vs 2.58%; OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.46–0.58; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Transcatheter LAAO with the Watchman FLX was associated with lower rates of in-hospital MAE compared with the predicate Watchman device, including mortality, pericardial effusion, major bleeding, cardiac arrest, and device embolization. This may favorably influence the balance of risks and benefits of transcatheter LAAO for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.

4 DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the Watchman device vs the ACP/Amulet device for NVAF patients with high risk of stroke or bleeding. There were three main findings in our study:
(1) No statistical differences were detected between the Watchman and the ACP/Amulet group in terms of stroke, systematic embolism.
(2) The all‐cause death and cardiogenic death were similar between two groups. and major bleeding. Watchman group had a potential trend of higher occurrences of major bleeding than ACP/Amulet group, though it did not have statistically significant difference.
(3) The Watchman group had a significantly higher incidence of DRT (3.3% vs. 2.2%) and PDL > 5 mm (2.4% vs. 1.0%) than ACP/Amulet group.

### Primary outcome evaluation of a next-generation left atrial appendage closure device: results from the PINNACLE FLX trial [^90813c49]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion provides an alternative to oral anticoagulation for thromboembolic risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Since regulatory approval in 2015, the WATCHMAN device has been the only LAA closure device available for clinical use in the United States. The PINNACLE FLX study (Protection Against Embolism for Nonvalvular AF Patients: Investigational Device Evaluation of the Watchman FLX LAA Closure Technology) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the next-generation WATCHMAN FLX LAA closure device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in whom oral anticoagulation is indicated, but who have an appropriate rationale to seek a nonpharmaceutical alternative.

Methods

This was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter US Food and Drug Administration study. The primary safety end point was the occurrence of one of the following events within 7 days after the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later: death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring cardiac surgery. The primary effectiveness end point was the incidence of effective LAA closure (peri-device flow ≤ 5 mm), as assessed by the echocardiography core laboratory at 12-month follow-up.

Results

A total of 400 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 73.8 ± 8.6 years and the mean CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 4.2 ± 1.5. The incidence of the primary safety end point was 0.5% with a 1-sided 95% upper CI of 1.6%, meeting the performance goal of 4.2% (P < 0.0001). The incidence of the primary effectiveness end point was 100%, with a 1-sided 95% lower CI of 99.1%, again meeting the performance goal of 97.0% (P < 0.0001). Device-related thrombus was reported in 7 patients, no patients experienced pericardial effusion requiring open cardiac surgery, and there were no device embolizations.

Conclusions

LAA closure with this next-generation LAA closure device was associated with a low incidence of adverse events and a high incidence of anatomic closure. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02702271.

Numerous nonrandomized studies have documented the efficacy of LAAO in reducing ischemic stroke and major bleeding. However, these studies were observational, used heterogenous endpoints, lacked a control arm, and indirectly derived efficacy conclusions by comparing the ischemic and bleeding event rate with what is predicted by the CHA2DS2-VASc and HASBLED scores, respectively. Therefore, although these data provided reassurance, it did not generate the level of evidence needed to widely accept LAAO as a mainstream stroke-prevention modality, and the need for further randomized data remain.

### Clinical efficacy and safety comparison of watchman device versus ACP / amulet device for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a study-level meta-analysis of clinical trials [^e6de3dda]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria: (1) Any clinical trials that included patients who suffered from NVAF with high stroke or bleeding risk and had undergone LAAC with Watchman device or ACP/Amulet device; (2) Studies reported any of effective or safety outcomes after LAAC. The exclusion criteria: Animal experiments, case reports, reviews, meta‐analyses, conference proceedings without a full manuscript, and trials that did not directly compare Watchman device versus ACP/Amulet device were excluded.

2.2 Intervention measures and outcomes

The Watchman or ACP/Amulet devices were used for left atrial appendage occlusion in patients. The effective outcomes were stroke and systemic embolism. Safety outcomes were all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, and major bleeding. Device‐related complications included device‐related thrombus (DRT), peri‐device leaks (PDL > 5 mm).

2.3 Search strategy

PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched automatically using the keywords "Atrial Fibrillation; Left atrial appendage closure; Left atrial appendage occlusion; Amplatzer Cardiac plug; Amplatzer; Watchman device; Watchman FLX". Finally, the newly published and unincluded literature was searched manually. Two researchers independently screened the literature, submitted the data and cross‐checked it. In case of any disagreement, a third researcher was assigned to assist in the final decision.

### The clinical impact of incomplete left atrial appendage closure with the watchman device in patients with atrial fibrillation: a PROTECT AF (percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage versus warfarin therapy for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation) substudy [^ebefb1b0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical impact of incomplete left atrial appendage (LAA) sealing and consequent peri-device residual blood flow in patients undergoing percutaneous LAA closure with the Watchman device (Atritech, Inc, Plymouth, Minnesota).

Background

During percutaneous LAA closure for stroke prophylaxis, the geometric variability of the LAA ostium may result in an incomplete seal of the LAA. On the one hand, this could enhance thrombus formation and embolization of thrombi around the device into the circulation; on the other hand, the relatively small size of these leaks may preclude clinically relevant embolizations.

Methods

Patients randomly assigned to device implantation in the PROTECT AF (Percutaneous Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage Versus Warfarin Therapy for Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial were analyzed. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 45 days, 6 months, and 12 months. Per the study protocol, patients discontinued warfarin therapy if the 45-day Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed either minimal or no peri-device flow (jet ≤ 5 mm width). The impact of peri-device flow severity, defined as minor, moderate, or major (< 1 mm, 1 mm to 3 mm, > 3 mm, respectively) on the composite primary efficacy endpoint (stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death) is expressed as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

Transesophageal echocardiography follow-up revealed that 32.0% of implanted patients had at least some degree of peri-device flow at 12 months. The HR of the primary efficacy endpoint per 1 mm larger per-device flow was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62 to 1.14; p = 0.256). Compared to patients with no peri-device flow, the HRs were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.11 to 6.40), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.33 to 2.09), and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.11 to 2.09) for minor, moderate, and major peri-device flow, respectively (p = 0.798). Compared to patients with no peri-device flow who discontinued warfarin, the HR for patients with any peri-device flow and continuing warfarin was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.14 to 2.71; p = 0.530).

Conclusions

These data indicate that residual peri-device flow into the LAA after percutaneous closure with the Watchman device was common, and is not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. This finding should be interpreted with caution as the low event rate decreases the confidence of this conclusion.

Myocardial recovery in patients with left ventricular assist devices is a rare event. Surgical explantation remains a risky and challenging procedure. Alternative percutaneous techniques could represent an effective solution. This report describes the clinical use of a Watchman closure device (Boston Scientific Corp, Marlborough, MA) in deactivation of a HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).

### SCAI / HRS expert consensus statement on transcatheter left atrial appendage closure [^480c8cb1]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Transcatheter left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) — postprocedural antithrombotic therapy should follow device-studied regimens and patient bleeding risk, as "Patients should be prescribed antithrombotic therapy with warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants, or DAPT after LAAC according to the studied regimen and instructions for use for each specific device and tailored to bleeding risks of each patient". For WATCHMAN, warfarin plus aspirin "were administered for 45 days, and if no DRT or PDL of > 5 mm was observed on TEE, patients transitioned to DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel until 6 months after implant and to aspirin alone afterward". Evidence on alternative regimens includes the Amulet IDE study in which "75.7% of patients were discharged on DAPT after Amulet implantation,… in which 95.8% were on OAC at discharge", the EVOLUTION registry where "60% of patients were discharged on DAPT", and the NCDR LAAO Registry where DAPT after WATCHMAN was "relatively uncommon (5% of implants)". A meta-analysis "of 83 studies including 12,326 LAAC patients (7900 on antiplatelet, and 4151 on OAC) showed no difference in stroke, DRT, bleeding, or overall mortality with antiplatelet versus OAC after LAAC". Overall, "Discharge on DAPT appears well established for the Amulet device", and "the choice and duration of antithrombotic regimen after LAAC should be made according to the studied regimen for each specific device, potentially individualized based on the patient's bleeding/thrombotic risk, and potentially modified if PDL or DRT is seen on post-LAAC imaging surveillance".

### Amplatzer amulet left atrial appendage occluder versus watchman device for stroke prophylaxis (amulet IDE): a randomized, controlled trial [^129ece26]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage (LAA) is an alternative to chronic oral anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The Amulet IDE trial (Amplatzer Amulet Left Atrial Appendage Occluder IDE Trial) was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the dual-seal mechanism of the Amulet LAA occluder compared with the Watchman device.

Methods

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at increased risk of stroke were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo percutaneous implantation of a LAA occluder with the Amulet occluder or Watchman device. The primary end points included safety (composite of procedure-related complications, all-cause death, or major bleeding at 12 months), effectiveness (composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 18 months), and the rate of LAA occlusion at 45 days. Prespecified secondary end points included a composite of all stroke, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular/unexplained death at 18 months, major bleeding at 18 months, and superiority test of the 3 primary end points.

Results

A total of 1878 patients were enrolled. The Amulet occluder was noninferior to the Watchman device for the primary safety end point (14.5% versus 14.7%; difference = -0.14 [95% CI, -3.42 to 3.13]; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Major bleeding and all-cause death were similar between groups (10.6% versus 10.0% and 3.9% versus 5.1%, respectively). Procedure-related complications were higher for the Amulet occluder (4.5% versus 2.5%), largely related to more frequent pericardial effusion and device embolization. The Amulet occluder was noninferior to the Watchman device for the primary effectiveness end point (2.8% versus 2.8%; difference = 0.00 [95% CI, -1.55 to 1.55]; P < 0.001 for noninferiority), and the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular/unexplained death (5.6% versus 7.7%, difference = -2.12 [95% CI, -4.45 to 0.21]; P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The rate of major bleeding was similar between groups (11.6% versus 12.3%; difference = -0.71 [95% CI, -3.72 to 2.31]; P = 0.32 for superiority). LAA occlusion was higher for the Amulet occluder than for the Watchman device (98.9% versus 96.8%; difference = 2.03 [95% CI, 0.41–3.66]; P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.003 for superiority).

Conclusions

The Amulet occluder was noninferior for safety and effectiveness of stroke prevention for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation compared with the Watchman device and superior for LAA occlusion. Procedure-related complications were higher with the Amulet occluder and decreased with operator experience. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02879448.

### Comparison of in-hospital outcomes after insertion of watchman device in men versus women (from the national inpatient data) [^a8071f7a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device is approved to manage nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and prevent stroke in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. This study aimed to analyze the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data to evaluate gender disparities and further assess its impact on medical decision-making. The NIS data for 16,505 patients who underwent left atrial appendage occlusion with the Watchman device from 2016 to 2017 was used to perform a cross-sectional analysis. The primary end point was risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality. The study included 9,825 men and 6,680 women. Male patients were younger than female patients (mean age of 75.3 years vs 76.3 years, p < 0.001). The observed in-hospital mortality was higher in female patients (0.3% vs 0.1%, p = 0.003). This remained significant after adjustment for baseline confounders (adjusted odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 6.3, p = 0.005). In conclusion, analysis of the large pool of NIS data reveals that female patients have relatively worse in-hospital outcomes in terms of mortality, length of stay, and total hospitalization cost than male patients who underwent Watchman device implantation. However, these disparities are not enough to impact the medical decision-making process and to defer the use of the Watchman device in female patients.
