## Question

Is it safe to take bismuth subsalicylate following a gastrointestinal bleed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to take bismuth subsalicylate after a gastrointestinal bleed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of bismuth subsalicylate and whether it acts like a salicylate in ways that could worsen bleeding. Then, I should verify what major GI-bleed guidelines say about salicylates and NSAIDs in the post-bleed period. Next, I will examine any direct safety signals for bismuth subsalicylate itself, including case reports and labeling. After that, I need to consider common post-bleed scenarios such as anticoagulation and renal impairment. Finally, I will synthesize a risk-benefit conclusion and suggest safer alternatives consistent with guideline-based care.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Bismuth subsalicylate is hydrolyzed in the gut to bismuth and salicylic acid; the salicylate moiety is pharmacologically active and shares antiprostaglandin and antiplatelet effects with aspirin-class agents, which can compromise mucosal defenses and platelet function — exactly the pathways we try to avoid after a bleed [^113kPeWq].

> Hold on, I should verify how this translates to clinical guidance after a bleed. Core post-UGIB recommendations emphasize high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy, treatment of the underlying cause (for example, H. pylori eradication), and strict avoidance of ulcerogenic agents, notably NSAIDs and salicylates, given their well-documented association with increased rebleeding risk in patients with prior peptic ulcer or GI bleeding history, where risk increases more than tenfold in exposed patients [^113styHD] [^111NEbxv] [^115U7dyK] [^1115DSvr].

> Wait, let me double-check something about risk stratification tools. I initially thought the Glasgow-Blatchford and Rockall scores explicitly incorporate NSAID or aspirin use, but that's not quite right; these tools focus on hemodynamics, comorbidity, laboratory parameters, and endoscopic stigmata rather than medication exposures, even though guidelines do flag NSAID/salicylate use as a major clinical risk factor for rebleeding and adverse outcomes, so the clinical principle still stands despite my earlier assumption [^114isajK] [^114LR9xo] [^113suHbB] [^1127G6rW].

> Next, I should review direct safety signals tied to bismuth subsalicylate itself. There are reports of coagulopathy with bismuth subsalicylate overuse, particularly in patients with cirrhosis, highlighting potential impairment of vitamin K–dependent factors and factor V activity; chronic use can also yield clinically significant salicylate levels with neurotoxicity in older adults, and the FDA safety information lists gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena among adverse reactions for this salicylate-containing agent [^112pS5Um] [^115U7dyK] [^116iu7Zo].

> I need to consider drug–drug interactions common after a bleed. Many patients require rapid resumption of anticoagulation to lower thromboembolic and mortality risks, but doing so increases rebleeding risk; adding a salicylate (even via bismuth subsalicylate) can potentiate warfarin and other anticoagulants, further tipping the balance toward bleeding — an especially precarious mix in the immediate post-bleed window [^116VeRkV] [^1146EC2X] [^116Yksuh].

> Let me think about organ function and age. Bismuth is largely renally eliminated and accumulates with impaired renal function, a not-infrequent issue after hemorrhagic hypoperfusion; labeling warns about nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity risks, and older age independently magnifies salicylate-associated GI complications — precisely the population in whom we should be most conservative after a bleed [^113kPeWq] [^112HoEYF] [^115U7dyK].

> But wait, what if bismuth subsalicylate just "darkens stool" and doesn't meaningfully affect bleeding risk? I should confirm the clinical relevance. Beyond potential pharmacologic bleeding risk, bismuth compounds can blacken stool and mimic or mask melena, complicating bedside monitoring for ongoing hemorrhage; labeling also lists melena as a potential adverse event, underscoring the potential to confound clinical assessment [^116zMWmW] [^116iu7Zo].

> I will now examine whether any guideline endorses bismuth subsalicylate in this specific context. Although bismuth subsalicylate is recommended for travelers' diarrhea in selected patients and is a component of certain H. pylori eradication regimens, these are not recommendations for post-bleed symptom control; in fact, H. pylori trials and comparative regimens exclude active GI bleeding, and UGIB guidance does not advocate salicylate-containing agents during the healing phase, focusing instead on PPI therapy and definitive hemostasis strategies [^1142KbmB] [^113Acyad] [^114ozqbB] [^113styHD].

> Next, I should review what we should do instead. Post-bleed management centers on resuscitation, early endoscopy with hemostasis, high-dose PPI therapy, and H. pylori eradication when indicated; symptom control for non-bloody diarrhea can consider loperamide where appropriate rather than salicylates, and antiemetic therapy can be individualized — all while avoiding agents that impair mucosal healing or platelet function during the vulnerable recovery period [^111NEbxv] [^116VrEPo] [^112Rs5po] [^1142KbmB].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should be clear. No guideline supports using bismuth subsalicylate after a GI bleed, and its salicylate component conflicts with the core principle of avoiding NSAIDs/salicylates in high-risk patients; documented coagulopathy, salicylate toxicity, potential for masking melena, interactions with anticoagulants, and accumulation risks in renal impairment all argue against use during recovery from a bleed, so bismuth subsalicylate should be avoided after GI bleeding unless a specialist provides a compelling indication and close monitoring plan aligned with definitive therapy of the bleeding source [^113styHD] [^115U7dyK] [^116iu7Zo].

---

No, bismuth subsalicylate is **not safe following a recent GI bleed** due to its salicylate component [^113kPeWq], which can impair platelet function [^1146EC2X] and increase rebleeding risk [^116iu7Zo] [^1115DSvr]. It is **especially risky** in patients with coagulopathy, liver disease [^112pS5Um], or those on anticoagulants or antiplatelets [^1146EC2X]. Use **PPIs or H2 blockers** instead [^116VrEPo], and avoid bismuth subsalicylate until hemostasis is confirmed and bleeding risk is low.

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to GI bleeding

Bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the GI tract to bismuth and salicylic acid [^113kPeWq]; the salicylate is systemically absorbed and can impair platelet function, **increasing bleeding risk**, particularly following a recent GI bleed [^1146EC2X] [^11177b74].

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Although trials specifically in post-GI bleed patients are limited, case reports and clinical experience **highlight significant risks**:

- **Salicylate toxicity**: Chronic use can cause salicylate toxicity, including coagulopathy and bleeding complications.

- **Coagulopathy**: Documented in patients with underlying liver disease, exacerbating bleeding risk [^112pS5Um].

- **Black stools**: Can mimic melena, complicating clinical assessment of ongoing bleeding [^116zMWmW].

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend bismuth subsalicylate** for patients with recent GI bleeding and instead emphasize:

- **Risk stratification**: Use validated scoring systems (e.g. Rockall, Glasgow-Blatchford) [^114isajK] to guide management decisions [^114LR9xo].

- **Alternative therapies**: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 receptor antagonists are preferred for acid suppression and ulcer healing.

- **Avoidance of salicylates**: Salicylate-containing medications should be avoided due to their potential to impair platelet function and increase bleeding risk.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing safety

Several patient-specific factors **significantly affect the safety** of bismuth subsalicylate following a GI bleed:

| **Patient factor** | **Impact on safety** |
|-|-|
| Age (elderly) | Increased risk of bleeding and salicylate toxicity [^111icbSE] [^1115DSvr] |
| Comorbidities (e.g. liver disease, coagulopathy) | Higher risk of bleeding complications [^112pS5Um] [^115U7dyK] |
| Concurrent medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelets) | Increased bleeding risk due to impaired platelet function [^1146EC2X] |
| Renal impairment | Increased risk of salicylate accumulation and toxicity [^112HoEYF] [^1121LigR] |

---

## Alternative medications and therapies

Given these risks with bismuth subsalicylate, **alternative medications and therapies are recommended** for patients recovering from a GI bleed:

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Effective in reducing gastric acid secretion, promoting ulcer healing, and preventing rebleeding [^113styHD].

- **H2 receptor antagonists**: Useful for acid suppression and ulcer healing.

- **Sucralfate**: Provides a protective barrier over ulcers, promoting healing without affecting platelet function.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If bismuth subsalicylate is considered (e.g. for H. pylori eradication), **careful monitoring is essential**: perform regular clinical assessments for recurrent bleeding, salicylate toxicity, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and periodically evaluate coagulation parameters, renal function, and salicylate levels when clinically indicated [^11177b74] [^1121LigR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bismuth subsalicylate is **not recommended** following a recent GI bleed because its salicylate component impairs platelet function and increases bleeding risk. PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and sucralfate are preferred alternatives. If bismuth subsalicylate is deemed necessary, careful monitoring and individualized risk assessment are essential.

### Salicylate toxicity from chronic bismuth subsalicylate use [^11177b74]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening confusion, falls, and hearing impairment. An initial workup for infectious, metabolic, and structural causes was unrevealing. However, further history revealed that he had been ingesting one to two bottles of Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) daily for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms.

On his second day of admission, the plasma salicylate concentration was 2.08 mmol/L (reference range 1.10–2.20 mmol/L), despite no sources of salicylate in the hospital. He was diagnosed with chronic salicylate toxicity, and Pepto-Bismol use was discontinued. The patient was treated supportively with isotonic intravenous fluids only, and the plasma salicylate concentration fell to less than 0.36 mmol/L. Concurrently, all his symptoms resolved.

This case highlights the potential adverse effects of over-the-counter medications. The diagnosis of chronic salicylate toxicity is challenging, particularly in the elderly and in undifferentiated presentations, as it can be missed if not suspected.

### Bismuth subsalicylate coagulopathy in a patient with chronic liver disease [^112pS5Um]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Low credibility.

Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is the active ingredient in over-the-counter antacid and antidiarrheal medications. Coagulopathy in the setting of acetylsalicylic acid toxicity is well documented but not in the setting of bismuth subsalicylate overuse. We present a case report of coagulopathy from BSS poisoning in a patient with underlying cirrhosis. The patient's high prothrombin time suggests inhibition of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The patient had decreased factor V activity, which is responsible for converting prothrombin to thrombin. Patients with cirrhosis often have hypoprothrombinemia, which may be exacerbated by salicylate-induced coagulopathy. Given the widespread use of BSS products, physicians should recognize coagulopathy as a possible manifestation of toxicity, especially in patients with underlying liver disease.

### Biaxin [^1112sWiz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

In a U.S. double-blind, randomized, multicenter, dose-comparison trial, ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks plus clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. for the first 2 weeks was found to have an equivalent H. pylori eradication rate (based on culture and histology) when compared to ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks plus clarithromycin 500 mg t.i.d. for the first 2 weeks. H. pylori eradication was defined as no positive test at 4 weeks following the end of treatment. Patients must have had two tests performed, and these must have been negative to be considered eradicated of H. pylori.

- **Exclusions from analysis**: The following patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis:
	- Patients not infected with H. pylori prestudy
	- Dropouts
	- Patients with major protocol violations
	- Patients with missing H. pylori tests

	- Patients excluded from the intent-to-treat analysis included those not infected with H. pylori prestudy and those with missing H. pylori tests prestudy. Patients were assessed for H. pylori eradication 4 weeks following treatment regardless of their healing status at the end of treatment.

- **Relationship with ulcer recurrence**: The relationship between H. pylori eradication and duodenal ulcer recurrence was assessed in a combined analysis of six U.S. randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials using ranitidine bismuth citrate with or without antibiotics. The results from approximately 650 U.S. patients showed that the risk of ulcer recurrence within 6 months of completion of the trial was impacted by the H. pylori eradication status.

### Resumption of anticoagulant therapy after anticoagulant-related gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VeRkV]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is permanently discontinued in up to 50% of patients following a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. A previous meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of thromboembolism and death, and a non-statistically significant increased risk of re-bleeding associated with resumption. We conducted an updated meta-analysis to determine the risks of re-GI bleeding, thromboembolism, and death in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for new references from January 2014 to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies involving adults with OAC-related GI bleeding were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's ROBINS-I tool. Pooled relative risk (RR) ratios were calculated using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: We identified 12 observational studies involving 3,098 patients. There was an increased risk of re-GI bleeding (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.47–2.48, I² = 0%, 11 studies) and a reduced risk of thromboembolism (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13–0.68, I² = 59.8%, 9 studies) and death (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38–0.70, I² = 71.8%, 8 studies) in patients who resumed OAC compared to those who did not. Eleven studies were judged to be at serious risk of bias due to confounding.

- **Conclusions**: Resuming OAC after OAC-related GI bleeding appears to be associated with an increase in re-GI bleeding, but a reduction in thromboembolism and death. Further prospective data are needed to identify specific patient subgroups that may benefit the most from resuming therapy.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^112PSMut]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Tetracycline is present in human milk at concentrations similar to maternal serum levels; however, it binds with calcium in human milk. Data indicate that oral absorption of tetracycline in infants is low due to the calcium binding in human milk. It is not known whether bismuth subsalicylate is excreted in human milk.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules in pediatric patients infected with H. pylori have not been established. Tetracycline use in children may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules should not be used in children up to 8 years of age (see warnings).

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, elderly patients may have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant diseases or other drug therapies. Bismuth subsalicylate, a component of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater.

### Can risk stratification improve the management of acute upper-gastrointestinal bleeding [^115cNFiT]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute upper-gastrointestinal bleeding is a common indication for emergency admission to the hospital. Risk-stratification scores have been devised to identify patients at risk of re-bleeding or death, but these usually require both clinical and endoscopic assessment. Two recent studies have employed clinical criteria alone to identify low-risk patients who may not require admission or in-patient endoscopy. While each of these studies has individual merit, both are unable to answer the question of whether risk stratification improves health outcomes or resource use in acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. They will nevertheless aid the development of guidelines that enable patients to be managed more efficiently and outcomes to be compared more fairly.

### Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding [^113vEFdS]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This document is one of a series outlining the utilization of gastrointestinal endoscopy in typical clinical scenarios. Prepared by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, this guideline was developed through a MEDLINE literature search, complemented by additional references from article bibliographies and expert consultant recommendations. In scenarios where well-designed prospective trials are sparse, emphasis is placed on the findings from extensive series and reports by recognized experts. Guidelines for the appropriate use of endoscopy are founded on a critical review of existing data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are essential to clarify certain aspects of this statement, and revisions may be required as new data become available. Clinical considerations may warrant actions that differ from these recommendations.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: Evaluation and management [^1127G6rW]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is defined as hemorrhage from the mouth to the ligament of Treitz. Common risk factors include prior upper GI bleeding, anticoagulant use, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and older age. Causes of upper GI bleeding may involve peptic ulcer bleeding, gastritis, esophagitis, variceal bleeding, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and cancer. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, hematemesis, and melena.

Physical examination should include assessment of hemodynamic stability, the presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Laboratory tests should comprise a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation panel, liver tests, and type and crossmatch. A bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution should be rapidly infused to correct hypovolemia and maintain blood pressure; blood transfusion is indicated when hemoglobin is less than 7 g per dL.

- **Risk stratification and treatment**:
	- Clinical prediction guides, such as the Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score, are necessary for upper GI bleeding risk stratification and determining therapy. Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy, performed within 24 hours of presentation.

	- **Failed endoscopic hemostasis**:
		In cases where endoscopic hemostasis fails, a common strategy is to attempt transcatheter arterial embolization, then proceed to surgery if hemostasis is not achieved.

Proton pump inhibitors should be initiated upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. Guidelines recommend hi

### Celebrex [^115U7dyK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding who used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) had more than a 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Additional factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Furthermore, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose aspirin (ASA). Patients aged 65 years and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, which increased to 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].

- **Strategies to minimize the GI risks in NSAID-treated patients**: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^111GULr1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Advise pregnant women that Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules can cause fetal harm. Tetracycline use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray brown) and may inhibit bone development, and metronidazole has been shown in one study to increase the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see WARNINGS).

Advise women to avoid feeding their infants with their milk during Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules therapy. Women should either discontinue feeding or pump and discard their milk during treatment and for 24 hours after the last dose (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).

Inform patients that Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may cause allergic reactions and to discontinue use at the first sign of urticaria, erythematous rash, flushing, and fever or other symptoms of an allergic reaction (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Inform patients of the risk of central and peripheral nervous system effects with Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. Advise them to discontinue use and report immediately to their healthcare provider.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^114ewuQx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Laboratory test interactions**:
	- Bismuth absorbs x-rays and may interfere with x-ray diagnostic procedures of the gastrointestinal tract. Bismuth subsalicylate may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the stool; however, this change does not interfere with standard tests for occult blood. Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide (NAD+ NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7.

- **Development of drug resistant bacteria**:
	- Prescribing bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Alosetron [^1146V5nP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Alosetron should not be initiated in patients with constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. It is contraindicated in those with a history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation, intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation and/or adhesions, ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or severe hepatic impairment.

- **Constipation**: Alosetron tablets are specifically not to be initiated in patients with constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **History of severe bowel or hepatic disorders**: Alosetron is contraindicated for patients with a history of chronic or severe constipation, intestinal obstruction, ischemic colitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or severe hepatic impairment.

- **Concomitant use of fluvoxamine**: The concurrent use of alosetron tablets with fluvoxamine is contraindicated. Fluvoxamine is a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and has been shown to increase mean alosetron plasma concentrations approximately 6-fold and prolong the half-life by about 3-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113A8nA2]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of the patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management:

- **Pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment**: Emphasizing individual patient characteristics, this stage involves evaluating and preparing the patient for endoscopy.

- **Endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis**: During this stage, the endoscopic approach should be tailored to the bleeding lesions and clinical expertise available.

- **Post-endoscopic management**: Strategies should focus on the continuous monitoring and management of the patient's condition, integrating the clinical setting and resources.

We emphasize the need for personalized management strategies based on patient characteristics, the nature of bleeding lesions, and the clinical setting, including available resources.

### Key points from the revised Maastricht consensus report: The impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post-gastric cancer resection, a first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes.

- **Advisable indications**: Functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Since H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce re-bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs.

- **Additional recommendations**: Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with an uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, the administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^115KECXL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The physical, chemical, and therapeutic properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are governed by their molecular structures and intermolecular interactions. Many APIs are crystalline substances with periodic arrangements of their constituent molecules or ions. The specific arrangement of molecules and their intermolecular interactions affect stability and solubility, which in turn influences bioavailability, efficacy, and dosage. Therefore, determining the structures of pharmaceutical compounds is an integral part of drug formulation.

Traditionally, the method of choice for crystal structure determination has been single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). However, the technique requires large specimens and is not readily applicable for submicrometer-sized crystals. While structure determination of small crystallites can often be performed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), the technique can sometimes struggle with complicated and disordered structures.

These reasons, among others, have previously prevented the structure determination of the API bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), a crystalline compound made from Bi 3+ cations, O 2 − anions, and salicylate anions (Hsal −). It is administered in its crystalline state and is the API of popular over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol, commonly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as dyspepsia and diarrhea. Numerous studies have confirmed the efficacy of BSS as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antacid agent. Antimicrobial properties of several other bismuth compounds also contribute to its therapeutic effects.

### Risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115Mjn9V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Patient-important gastrointestinal bleeding is an endpoint developed by patients and family members; however, risk factors for this outcome are unknown. The objective of this study is to identify risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding among invasively ventilated adults.

This pre-planned regression analysis of an international trial database evaluated baseline and time-varying risk factors in the preceding 3 days for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, accounting for illness severity and the competing risk of death.

- **Measurements and main results**: Patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in the ICU among 131 of 4,821 (2.7%) patients.
	- The baseline APACHE II score showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.24 [95%CI 1.12, 1.37] per 5-point increase.
	- Increased risk factors included the use of inotropes or vasopressors (HR 2.05 [1.35, 3.12]), severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L) (HR 2.21 [1.24, 3.94]), and platelet inhibitor drugs (HR 1.69 [1.11, 2.56]).
	- A lower bleeding risk was associated with pantoprazole (HR 0.36 [0.25, 0.54]) and enteral nutrition (HR 0.81 [0.68, 0.97]) for every 500 mL/day increase.
	- No interaction was found between enteral nutrition and pantoprazole (interaction p-value = 0.94). Allocation to pantoprazole was linked to a lower risk of patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding irrespective of the volume of enteral nutrition (HR 0.36 [0.22, 0.58] for 500ml/day, and HR 0.36 [0.18, 0.72] for no enteral nutrition).

### Diclofenac sodium [^1115DSvr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs have a more than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include the longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

- **Strategies to minimize the GI risks in NSAID-treated patients**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternative therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

### Proposed risk stratification in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: Is hospitalisation essential [^113NsHbK]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (UGIH) are usually admitted to hospital regardless of the severity of the bleed. The aim of this study was to identify patients who could be safely managed without hospitalisation and immediate inpatient endoscopy. Based on a literature review, a protocol was devised using clinical and laboratory data regarded as being of prognostic value. A retrospective observational study of consecutive patients who attended the emergency department (ED) with UGIH was conducted during one calendar month.

Fifty-four patients were identified, of whom 44 (81%) were admitted. Twelve suffered an adverse event. One of the 10 patients (10%) initially discharged from the ED was later admitted. Strict implementation of the protocol would have resulted in the safe discharge of a further 15 patients (34% of those admitted), and a saving of an estimated 37 bed days per month.

Patients at low risk from UGIH may be identified in the ED. If validated, this protocol may improve patient management and resource utilisation.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk scores: who, when and why [^114isajK]. World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology (2016). High credibility.

The initial Rockall score is a clinical calculator used for predicting mortality due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This scoring system applies to patients presenting with upper GI bleeding, regardless of the underlying cause. The score is calculated based on three parameters: age, shock, and presence of comorbidity. The higher the score, the higher the risk of mortality.

The clinical utility of the initial Rockall score is to aid in the risk stratification of patients with upper GI bleeding, helping clinicians identify high-risk patients who may require more aggressive management or intervention. It can also assist in decision-making regarding hospital admission and discharge.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for using the initial Rockall score. However, it should be noted that this score does not consider the severity or source of the bleeding, and therefore should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings and diagnostic tools.

The initial Rockall score is designed to estimate the risk of mortality due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding by evaluating three factors: age, the presence and degree of shock, and any major comorbidities. Each factor is assigned a score, and these scores are then summed to provide an overall risk score.

- **For age, the scoring is**:
	- **Less than 60 years**: 0 points
	- **Between 60 and 79 years**: 1 point
	- **80 years or older**: 2 points

Shock is assessed based on blood pressure metrics and patient consciousness levels, but further details are truncated in the source text.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^111FuCq7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Adults should follow these recommended dosages**: bismuth subsalicylate, 525 mg (two 262.4 mg chewable tablets); metronidazole, 250 mg (one 250 mg tablet); and tetracycline hydrochloride, 500 mg (one 500 mg capsule), taken four times daily for 14 days along with an H2 antagonist approved for the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer. Patients are instructed to take their medication at mealtimes and at bedtime. Tablets of bismuth subsalicylate should be chewed and swallowed, while the metronidazole tablet and tetracycline hydrochloride capsule should be swallowed whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces). The concomitantly prescribed H2 antagonist should be taken as directed.

- **Fluid intake recommendation**:
	- Patients are advised to ingest an adequate amount of fluid with their bedtime dose of tetracycline hydrochloride to minimize the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (see adverse reactions).

- **Missed doses protocol**:
	- If a dose is missed, patients should continue with the normal dosing schedule until the medication is finished. Double dosing should be avoided. If more than four doses are missed, patients should contact their prescriber.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^117CtA9L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Most important information for patients**: Scientists have discovered that most ulcers are caused by an infection from a specific germ called H. pylori. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been found to play a primary role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulcers and is considered the causative organism in 80% to 95% of patients with duodenal ulcers. Each pill of every dose is crucial. Studies have shown that taking all this medicine is vital to eradicate all the ulcer-causing germs. If doses are skipped or treatment is stopped early, some of these germs may not be eradicated, and another ulcer can develop.

- **Components and indication**: The components of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Appropriate doses of an H2 antagonist indicated for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer should be prescribed for ulcer healing.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^113kPeWq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics for bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules when coadministered has not been studied. There is no information about the gastric mucosal concentrations of bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline after administration of these agents concomitantly or in combination with an acid suppressive agent. The systemic pharmacokinetic information presented below is based on studies in which each product was administered alone.

- **Bismuth subsalicylate**: Upon oral administration, bismuth subsalicylate is almost completely hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to bismuth and salicylic acid. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of bismuth subsalicylate following oral administration can be described by the individual pharmacokinetics of bismuth and salicylic acid.

- **Bismuth**: Less than 1% of bismuth from oral doses of bismuth subsalicylate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation. Absorbed bismuth is distributed throughout the body. Bismuth is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 90%). Bismuth has multiple disposition half-lives with an intermediate half-life of 5 to 11 days and a terminal half-life of 21 to 72 days. Elimination of bismuth is primarily through urinary and biliary routes with a renal clearance of 50 ± 18 mL/min. The mean trough blood bismuth concentration after 2 weeks of oral administration of 787 mg bismuth subsalicylate (3 chewable tablets) four times daily.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly [^111icbSE]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding affects a substantial number of elderly people and is a frequent indication for hospitalization. Bleeding can originate from either the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract, and patients with gastrointestinal bleeding present with a range of symptoms. In the elderly, the nature, severity, and outcome of bleeding are influenced by the presence of medical comorbidities and the use of antiplatelet medication. This review discusses trends in the epidemiology and outcome of gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients. Specific causes of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed, and recommendations for approaches to endoscopic diagnosis and therapy are given.

### International consensus recommendations on the management of patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115NbByX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A multidisciplinary group of 34 experts from 15 countries developed this update and expansion of the recommendations on the management of acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from 2003.

- **Methods**: The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) process and independent ethics protocols were used. Sources of data included original and published systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and abstracts up to October 2008. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations have been rated by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.

- **Recommendations**: Recommendations emphasize early risk stratification by using validated prognostic scales and early endoscopy (within 24 hours). Endoscopic hemostasis remains indicated for high-risk lesions, whereas data support attempts to dislodge clots with hemostatic, pharmacologic, or combination treatment of the underlying stigmata. Clips or thermocoagulation, alone or with epinephrine injection, are effective methods; however, epinephrine injection alone is not recommended. Second-look endoscopy may be useful in selected high-risk patients but is not routinely recommended. Pre-endoscopy proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may downstage the lesion, while intravenous high-dose PPI therapy after successful endoscopic hemostasis decreases both rebleeding and mortality in patients with high-risk stigmata. Although selected patients can be discharged promptly after endoscopy, high-risk patients should be hospitalized for at least 72 hours after endoscopy.

### Sprix [^115G235w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sprix is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. NSAIDs, including ketorolac, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events such as inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

- **Risk factors for GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation**: Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^116M1zpr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Metronidazole has been associated with central and peripheral nervous system effects. Cases of convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, and peripheral neuropathy (including optic neuropathy) have been reported with metronidazole. Encephalopathy has been reported in association with cerebellar toxicity characterized by ataxia, dizziness, and dysarthria. CNS lesions seen on MRI have been described in reports of encephalopathy and are generally reversible within days to weeks upon discontinuation of metronidazole. Peripheral neuropathy, mainly of the sensory type, has been reported and is characterized by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Cases of aseptic meningitis have also been reported with metronidazole. Symptoms can occur within hours of dose administration and generally resolve after metronidazole therapy is discontinued.

Tetracyclines, including tetracycline hydrochloride, have been associated with intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri). Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause IH. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116VrEPo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production and are used to manage upper GI bleeding. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of proton pump inhibitors initiated before endoscopy in people with upper GI bleeding.

The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of PPI treatment initiated prior to endoscopy in people with acute upper GI bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, as well as major conference proceedings up to October 2008 for previous versions of this review. Additionally, we conducted searches in April 2018, October 2019, and on June 3, 2021, for this update. We also contacted experts in the field and searched trial registries and references of trials to identify any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with a PPI (oral or intravenous) versus control treatment using either a placebo, histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2 RA), or no treatment prior to endoscopy in hospitalized individuals with uninvestigated upper GI bleeding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted study data, and evaluated risk of bias. Outcomes assessed at 30 days included mortality (our primary outcome), rebleeding, surgery, high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage (such as active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot) at index endoscopy, endoscopic haemostatic treatment at index endoscopy, and time to discharge.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111NEbxv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the stepwise management of patients with overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status is first assessed, and resuscitation is initiated as needed. Patients are risk-stratified based on features such as hemodynamic status, comorbidities, age, and laboratory tests. Pre-endoscopic erythromycin is considered to increase diagnostic yield at first endoscopy. A pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered to decrease the need for endoscopic therapy but does not improve clinical outcomes. Upper endoscopy is generally performed within 24 hours.

The endoscopic features of ulcers direct further management. Patients with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessels receive endoscopic therapy, such as bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, sclerosant, or clips. Those with an adherent clot may receive endoscopic therapy as well; these patients then receive intravenous PPI, starting with a bolus followed by continuous infusion. Patients with flat spots or clean-based ulcers do not require endoscopic therapy or intensive PPI therapy.

Rebleeding after endoscopic therapy is treated with a second endoscopic treatment; if bleeding persists or recurs, treatment with surgery or interventional radiology is undertaken. Prevention of rebleeding is based on the etiology of the bleeding ulcer. H. pylori is eradicated, and following a cure is documented, anti-ulcer therapy is generally not given. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are stopped; if they must be resumed, a low-dose COX-2-selective NSAID plus PPI is used.

### First-line therapies for eradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^111nJAFq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The ITT eradication rate following such a quadruple therapy was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79–91%) in 299 patients in the US and 80% (95% CI 74–85%) in 440 patients in Europe, while another international trial found an 89.3% eradication rate (modified ITT of 93%, 95% CI 85.4–100%) without any difference between patients with metronidazole-resistant or susceptible strains. Unfortunately, despite the three-in-one capsule formulation, as many as 3 tablets q.i.d. for 10 days plus 2 PPI tablets are needed, totaling 14 tablets daily. Therefore, patients' compliance with this therapy needs to be opportunely assessed in real life, where several patients are already taking other drugs for frequent chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Moreover, some concerns may arise regarding bismuth toxicity, especially when considering the co-administration of PPIs. Although bismuth salts are scarcely absorbed (< 1%), high doses, long-term consumption, and the simultaneous use of PPIs may lead to high blood levels and potential toxicity. In the past, bismuth doses of 240, 300, or 480 mg daily were generally administered for 4–10 days. When a 480 mg bismuth dose has been used with omeprazole for 14 days, 9% of patients have blood bismuth levels higher than 50 µg/L, which is over the safety threshold for potential bismuth neurotoxicity, according to Hillemand's scale. Notably, when the novel three-in-one capsules are used, a dose as high as 1680 mg subcitrate potassium (corresponding to 560 mg bismuth) is administered daily.

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^1127DQ53]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Structure determination of pharmaceutical compounds is invaluable for drug development but remains challenging for those that form as small crystals with defects. Bismuth subsalicylate, among the most commercially significant bismuth compounds, is an active ingredient in over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol, used to treat dyspepsia and H. pylori infections.

### Low-volume polyethylene glycol and bisacodyl for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy: a meta-analysis [^112XsqGY]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

OR 1.15; 95% CI: 0.81–1.64, P = 0.44; I² = 10%, P = 0.34, and nausea - OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49–0.88, P5mg of bisacodyl has been withdrawn from the market in the United States per FDA recommendations due to safety concerns, specifically ischemic colitis. Given this recent event, further randomized controlled trials would have to be performed to evaluate the benefit of 2 L PEG with 5 mg of bisacodyl.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis shows that low-volume (2 L) PEG with bisacodyl demonstrates less nausea and vomiting without adversely affecting the bowel preparation. Therefore, low-volume PEG with bisacodyl appears to be a reasonable alternative to the traditional 4 L PEG for bowel preparation in appropriate patients. However, given the increased risk of ischemic colitis with larger doses of bisacodyl and PEG, additional randomized controlled trials with low- dose bisacodyl and PEG would be extremely beneficial.

- **Summary box**:

	- **What is already known**:
		Adequate bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy is extremely important. Many studies have evaluated alternative bowel preparation methods to improve tolerability without affecting the efficacy of the traditional 4 L polyethylene glycol (PEG). Adding bisacodyl to 2 L PEG may improve tolerability without sacrificing efficacy; however, studies have varied in their results.

	- **What the new findings are**:
		2 L PEG with bisacodyl does improve patient tolerability as compared to the traditional 4 L PEG. 2 L PEG with bisacodyl demonstrates no statistically significant changes.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^1146EC2X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Anticoagulants**: Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules may alter the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants. Salicylates may cause an increased risk of bleeding when administered with anticoagulant therapy. Metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. Tetracycline has been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding.

- **Lithium**: In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term use of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules may cause elevation of serum lithium concentrations and signs of lithium toxicity due to the interaction between metronidazole and lithium. Serum lithium and serum creatinine concentrations should be monitored several days after beginning treatment with bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity.

- **Antacids, multivitamins, or dairy products**: The absorption of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules may be influenced by antacids, multivitamins, or dairy products.

- **Oral contraceptives**: As with many antibacterial preparations, the concomitant use of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules may reduce the effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives; breakthrough bleeding may occur. Patients should be advised to use an additional or different form of contraception. Women who become pregnant while taking these medications should be advised to notify their prescriber immediately.

- **Anticoagulants**: Individual components of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules have the potential to interact with anticoagulants. Monitoring anticoagulant therapy with appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dosage may be warranted if concurrent therapy is instituted. See the package insert for more information.

- **Lithium**: In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term metronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity. Serum lithium and serum creatinine should be obtained several days after beginning metronidazole to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity.

- **Antidiabetic agents**: There is a possible enhanced hypoglycemic effect when given with salicylates.

- **Cimetidine**: The simultaneous administration of drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity, such as cimetidine, may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole.

The lower limit for this calculation was -2.2 but was truncated to 0 for reporting purposes.

- **Evaluable patients**: Evaluable patients were defined as having a history of a confirmed duodenal ulcer prior to treatment and having taken ≥ 70% of each component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules (bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, tetracycline hydrochloride) during the 14-day dosing period. Eradication was defined as no evidence of H. pylori infection by two or three diagnostic tests (culture, histology, and rapid urease test) from at least 4 weeks to 6 weeks post-treatment. Excluded from the evaluable population were patients who were noncompliant with medication, patients who were not infected with H. pylori at baseline, and patients without ulcer documentation. Three patients in the Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules group and one patient in the control group were included as eradication failures because they withdrew from the study due to treatment-related adverse events.

- **Patients included in the analysis**: Patients were included in the analysis if they had documented H. pylori infection at baseline and had confirmed duodenal ulcer disease. All dropouts were included as failures of therapy. Eradication was defined as no evidence of H. pylori infection by culture, histology, or rapid urease test.

Compliance with the triple therapy regimen was also evaluated in the clinical study. In the intent-to-treat population, 93% of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline…

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^116WK1c5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Evaluable patients were defined as having a confirmed duodenal ulcer within two years prior to treatment and having taken 14 days of bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline (range 11 to 17 days). Eradication was defined as no evidence of H. pylori infection by culture, histology, rapid urease test, and/or urea breath test from at least four weeks post-treatment up to one year post-treatment.

- **Study 2**: Evaluated the long-term outcome in patients treated for active duodenal ulcer by frequently monitoring for ulcer recurrence for up to one year after therapy. This study compared patients who received bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), metronidazole (MTZ), and tetracycline hydrochloride (TCN) for two weeks with ranitidine to those who received ranitidine alone. The ulcer recurrence rates at six months and one year, regardless of post-treatment eradication status, are summarized below for duodenal ulcer patients who were H. pylori positive at baseline.

- **Patient demographics**: Includes all patients randomized to therapy who were H. pylori positive at baseline (by culture, histology, and/or urea breath test) who had ulcer healing and 24 or 48 weeks of endoscopic follow-up data.

- **Eradication of H. pylori in patients with a history of duodenal ulcer disease**: A controlled, multicenter trial (Study 4) in the U.S. compared the rates of eradication of H. pylori following 14 days of treatment with bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules or control.

### A COX-2-specific inhibitor plus a proton-pump inhibitor: Is this a reasonable approach to reduction in NSAIDs' GI toxicity [^11142sZW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The two prevailing approaches to decrease the risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated gastrointestinal (GI) events are the use of a COX-2 inhibitor or co-therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). A major limitation of each approach is that, in patients at the highest risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, neither treatment is effective when used as a stand-alone strategy. An important question is whether combination therapy with a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI offers improved GI safety compared to a traditional NSAID plus a PPI. This study evaluated high GI risk patients who were taking either the PPI, esomeprazole, or a placebo along with their NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor. It confirms that our approach of adding PPIs to reduce NSAIDs' ulcer risks is an effective strategy. However, this study did not show a safety advantage for using a COX-2 inhibitor instead of a traditional NSAID in high GI risk patients who take PPIs. Thus, there continues to be no prospective data to support a GI benefit of a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI over a traditional NSAID plus a PPI in high-risk patients.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117Fzesk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines. This document aims to provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues.

- **Review and consensus processes**: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

- **Main findings**: Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection.

### Bismuth subsalicylate/metronidazole/tetracycline hydrochloride [^1121LigR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Contraindications**:

	- **Methoxyflurane**: Do not administer methoxyflurane to patients taking bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules. The use of tetracycline hydrochloride, a component of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules, with methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

	- **Disulfiram**: Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules is contraindicated in patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who are using metronidazole, a component of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules and disulfiram concurrently (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

	- **Alcohol**: Alcoholic beverages or other products containing propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least three days after usage of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules. A disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing) may occur due to the interaction between alcohol or propylene glycol and metronidazole, a component of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

- **Renal impairment**: Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets/metronidazole tablets/tetracycline hydrochloride capsules is contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment.

### Preventing recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection who are taking low-dose aspirin or naproxen [^111qdExV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Many patients who have had upper gastrointestinal bleeding continue to take low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for musculoskeletal pain. It is uncertain whether infection with Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for bleeding in such patients.

- **Methods**: We studied patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were infected with H. pylori and who were taking low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs. We evaluated whether eradication of the infection or omeprazole treatment was more effective in preventing rebleeding. We recruited patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was confirmed by endoscopy. Their ulcers were healed by daily treatment with 20 mg of omeprazole for eight weeks or longer. Then, those who had been taking aspirin were given 80 mg of aspirin daily, and those who had been taking other NSAIDs were given 500 mg of naproxen twice daily for six months. The patients in each group were then randomly assigned separately to receive 20 mg of omeprazole daily for six months or one week of eradication therapy. This therapy consisted of 120 mg of bismuth subcitrate, 500 mg of tetracycline, and 400 mg of metronidazole, all given four times daily, followed by placebo for six months.

- **Results**: We enrolled 400 patients (250 of whom were taking aspirin and 150 of whom were taking other NSAIDs). Among those taking aspirin, the probability of rebleeding during the six-month period was 1.9 percent for patients who received eradication therapy and 0.9 percent for patients who received omeprazole.

### Management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Guideline recommendations from the international consensus group [^113styHD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This update of the 2010 International Consensus Recommendations on the Management of Patients With Nonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) refines previous important statements and presents new clinically relevant recommendations.

- **Methods**: An international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the recommendations. Data sources included evidence summarized in previous recommendations, as well as systematic reviews and trials identified from a series of literature searches of several electronic bibliographic databases from inception to April 2018. Using an iterative process, group members formulated key questions. Two methodologists prepared evidence profiles and assessed the quality (certainty) of evidence relevant to the key questions according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Group members reviewed the evidence profiles and, using a consensus process, voted on recommendations and determined the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional.

- **Recommendations**:
	- **Preendoscopic management**: The group suggests using a Glasgow Blatchford score of 1 or less to identify patients at very low risk for rebleeding, who may not require hospitalization. In patients without cardiovascular disease, the suggested hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is less than 80 g/L, with a higher threshold for those with cardiovascular disease.
	- **Endoscopic management**: The group suggests that patients with acute UGIB undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. Thermocoagulation and sclerosant injection are recommended techniques for these cases.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Expert review [^112Rs5po]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and best practice advice statements regarding the use of endoscopic therapies in treating patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 10 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, which reflect landmark and recent published articles in this field. This expert review also reflects the experiences of the authors who are gastroenterologists with extensive experience in managing and teaching others to treat patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB).

- **Best practice advice 1**: Endoscopic therapy should achieve hemostasis in the majority of patients with NVUGIB.
- **Best practice advice 2**: Initial management of the patient with NVUGIB should focus on resuscitation, triage, and preparation for upper endoscopy. After stabilization, patients with NVUGIB should undergo endoscopy with endoscopic treatment of sites with active bleeding or high-risk stigmata for rebleeding.
- **Best practice advice 3**: Endoscopists should be familiar with the indications, efficacy, and limitations of current therapies.

### Fourteen-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy for treatment: a randomized clinical trial [^114ozqbB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

This study was designed as a single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial, reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

- **Study population**: From November 2022 to April 2024, patients visiting the outpatient gastroenterology department of our hospital were screened for eligibility based on the following criteria. Inclusion criteria included: (i) adults aged 18–70 years; (ii) confirmed diagnosis of H. pylori infection through at least one of the following diagnostic methods: 13 C-urea breath test (UBT), 14 C-UBT, histopathological examination, rapid urease test, or bacterial culture; (iii) no history of previous treatment for H. pylori. Exclusion criteria were: (i) documented allergies to study medications; (ii) history of prior upper gastrointestinal surgery; (iii) active gastrointestinal bleeding; (iv) recent use of bismuth, or antibiotics, acid suppressants, including PPIs, P-CABs, or H2 receptor antagonists, within the past 4 weeks; (v) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (vi) serious medical conditions potentially interfering with outcome evaluation, such as hepatic or renal insufficiency or heart failure; (vii) history of alcohol or drug abuse; (viii) inability or refusal to provide informed consent.

- **Randomization and treatment**: A computer-generated random allocation sequence was used to assign participants to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. They received either a 14-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy or a 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT).

### Major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism [^116Yksuh]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a frequent site of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE). At-risk patients have not been consistently identified yet.

- **Methods**: We used the RIETE registry to assess the clinical characteristics of patients developing major GI bleeding during the course of anticoagulation. Then, we built a predictive score based on multivariable analysis, aiming to identify patients at increased risk for major GI bleeding.

- **Results**: We included 87,431 patients with acute VTE. During the course of anticoagulation, 778 (0.89%) suffered major GI bleeding, 815 (0.93%) non-major GI bleeding, and 1462 (1.67%) had major bleeding outside the GI tract. During the first 30 days after major GI bleeding, 7.6% of patients re-bled, 3.9% had VTE recurrences, and 33% died. On multivariable analysis, male sex, age ≥ 70 years, initial VTE presentation as pulmonary embolism, active cancer, prior VTE, recent major bleeding in the GI tract, esophageal varicosities, anemia, abnormal prothrombin time, renal insufficiency, and use of corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk for major GI bleeding. Using the predictive score, 39,591 patients (45%) were at low risk; 36,602 (42%) at intermediate risk; 9315 (11%) at high risk; and 1923 (2.2%) at very high risk. Their rates of major GI bleeding were 0.21%, 0.96%, 2.41%, and 6.08%, respectively. The c-statistics was 0.771 (95% CI 0.755–0.786).

- **Conclusions**: We have developed a score which has the potential to identify patients at increased risk for GI bleeding, but further validation is needed.

### SPL drug information for bismuth subsalicylate [^112HoEYF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of bismuth subsalicylate PO:

- **Constipation, diarrhea**: Use caution with a history of gastrointestinal disorders or those prone to gastrointestinal disturbances. Monitor patients closely for gastrointestinal symptoms while on bismuth hydrochloride and provide dietary recommendations for managing constipation or diarrhea. If gastrointestinal side effects like constipation or diarrhea occur, adjust fluid intake, offer dietary changes, and consider symptomatic treatments as appropriate.

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Use extreme caution with impaired renal function. Use bismuth hydrochloride cautiously in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction and monitor renal function regularly during treatment. Discontinue the medication, provide appropriate renal support, and consult a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

- **Tremor, encephalopathy**: Use extreme caution with a history of neurological disorders, as well as those who are at risk of neurotoxicity. Administer bismuth hydrochloride within recommended doses and duration and closely monitor patients for signs of neurotoxicity. Promptly discontinue the medication, provide supportive care, and consult with a neurologist for further assessment and management.

### A "rare" case of melena in a 3-year-old [^116zMWmW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Melena is a potential sign of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, there are numerous substances ingested resulting in a stool appearance similar to melena. Examples of such substances include black licorice, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron supplements. We report a case of a well-appearing 3-year-old Vietnamese girl presenting to our emergency department after two episodes of "black, sticky" stool. The cause of her "melena" was determined after her father revealed that she had ingested two bowls of pork blood soup during the preceding 12 hours. This case highlights the need for a careful dietary history and cultural considerations in children presenting with what may appear to be melena.
