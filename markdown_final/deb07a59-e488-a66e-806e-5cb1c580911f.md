## Question

How do I treat for pediatric eczema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat pediatric eczema (atopic dermatitis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of emollients and bathing. Next, I will consider potency-appropriate topical corticosteroids for flares, followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories for sensitive areas or maintenance. After that, I need to check proactive strategies and infection control. Then, I will review escalation to systemic therapies for refractory disease. Finally, I should ensure adherence, trigger management, and follow-up plans are addressed, and I will double-check any conflicting evidence along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity, because treatment hinges on accurate staging and impact on quality of life. I should use validated tools like SCORAD or EASI when possible and document distribution, chronicity, sleep disturbance, and infection risk, since these guide therapy and monitoring. I also need to screen for atopic comorbidities and exclude mimics such as psoriasis, scabies, or contact dermatitis, and I should remember that most children develop AD in the first year of life, which shapes counseling and expectations [^111Xwkaj] [^117CxEZe] [^111XWq4k].

> Next, I should review the universal foundation: emollients and bathing. Wait, let me verify the bathing cadence and products. Current pediatric guidance supports frequent, short baths with lukewarm water and a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser, followed by immediate liberal application of a leave-on emollient to damp skin. I initially thought daily bathing might be too drying, but wait, the balance of evidence and contemporary pediatric reports support frequent bathing when paired with immediate moisturization to repair the barrier, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize the routine rather than the frequency alone [^111vNTp1] [^111XWq4k]. I should also confirm that bath additives are not routinely beneficial; the BATHE randomized trial showed no added value from emollient bath additives beyond standard care, so I should avoid recommending them routinely [^113Zfx1v] [^116NCVkP].

> Now, for active inflammation, I need to ensure potency-appropriate topical corticosteroids are used. For mild disease, low-potency agents are reasonable; for moderate disease, moderate-potency agents are appropriate; for severe disease, potent agents are often needed, but I should avoid very potent steroids in children unless under specialist supervision. Hold on, I should verify frequency and safety. Cochrane suggests once-daily application is probably as effective as twice daily for flares, and weekend proactive therapy reduces relapse risk substantially, which I should incorporate into plans for recurrent disease. I also need to counsel that short-term use of topical corticosteroids is associated with very low rates of skin thinning in trials, and I should avoid continuous use without breaks [^114WrPkL] [^1117nAWA] [^115N1Szm] [^116wwvUA].

> For sensitive areas such as the face, eyelids, and intertriginous zones, I should confirm that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are preferred. Topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus 0.03% or pimecrolimus 1% are effective alternatives, and I should prepare families for transient burning or stinging. Crisaborole, a PDE-4 inhibitor, is another option, though it may cause application-site reactions. I need to ensure families understand that these agents can be used for maintenance or as steroid-sparing therapy in thin skin regions [^112sSQJX] [^116a2u2o] [^116wwvUA].

> I will now examine proactive therapy, because recurrent flares are common. Weekend or twice-weekly application of a topical anti-inflammatory to previously inflamed sites reduces relapse risk by about half compared with reactive use, and I should set expectations that proactive therapy is typically continued for months with periodic reassessment. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to children as well; yes, the evidence base and guidelines support proactive strategies in pediatric patients with frequent flares [^114WrPkL] [^1117nAWA] [^115N1Szm].

> Infection risk and management need attention. I should double-check for secondary bacterial infection, especially with Staphylococcus aureus, and consider diluted bleach baths or sodium hypochlorite cleansers during moderate-to-severe flares, while reserving oral antibiotics for clearly infected eczema. I need to ensure we do not overuse topical antibiotics, as evidence for routine use is limited, and I should culture if there is no improvement in 48 hours or if MRSA is suspected [^114oUvfv] [^1133bUzU].

> For refractory moderate-to-severe disease despite optimized topical therapy, I should review systemic options. Dupilumab is FDA-approved down to 6 months of age and has strong evidence for improving signs, symptoms, and quality of life with a favorable safety profile; I should monitor for conjunctivitis and discuss vaccination timing. Tralokinumab is approved for ages 12 and older and is a reasonable alternative when dupilumab is unavailable or not tolerated. Traditional immunosuppressants like methotrexate or cyclosporine can be considered off-label with careful monitoring, but I need to ensure shared decision-making given adverse effect profiles and limited pediatric RCT data. Systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided except for short rescue courses in exceptional circumstances, given rebound and safety concerns [^113b4L2H] [^117R5rQX] [^111yhbGD] [^113yRupp] [^113ApyEb].

> But wait, what if the child is an infant or has early-onset disease? I should confirm that early, proactive management may mitigate disease trajectory, and I need to balance this with the mixed evidence on infant emollients for primary prevention. The most recent pragmatic RCT suggests daily emollients from early infancy can modestly reduce incident AD in unselected infants, which is distinct from treating established disease, so I should not overgeneralize prevention data to therapy. In infants with established AD, I should still prioritize barrier repair and cautious, potency-appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy [^117UZtKy] [^117DdGYZ] [^112BhLmW].

> Next, I should review adherence and education, because poor adherence drives treatment failure. I need to check for steroid phobia, complexity of regimens, and caregiver burden, and then implement practical solutions such as written action plans, simplified routines, teach-back, and follow-up within 2 to 4 weeks initially. Nurse-led education, text-message reminders, and potency "traffic light" tools improve adherence, and I should tailor the emollient choice to preference to sustain use, recognizing that leave-on emollients are the key component rather than bath additives [^11697NkZ] [^115RVmFv] [^113Zfx1v].

> I should confirm trigger management and ancillary measures. Fragrance-free, dye-free skin care, gentle laundering, and environmental controls for dust mites or pets may help selected patients, but I need to avoid overly restrictive diets without evidence of food allergy. Allergen immunotherapy can be considered in polysensitized children with concomitant allergic rhinitis or asthma after shared decision-making, but I should not expect it to replace skin-directed therapy for AD itself [^116wwvUA] [^116MAfnw].

> Finally, I need to ensure a structured follow-up plan. Reassess severity, sleep, and quality of life at each visit. Adjust potency and frequency of topicals based on response. De-escalate to lowest effective potency during maintenance. And escalate promptly if control is lost, considering infection, adherence, or undertreatment. I should double-check that families know when to seek urgent care for eczema herpeticum or widespread secondary infection, and I should coordinate with pediatricians, allergists, and dermatologists as needed for complex cases [^111XWq4k] [^111Q71xY].

Treat pediatric eczema with a **stepwise approach**: start with daily emollients and gentle skin care, escalate to low-potency topical corticosteroids for flares, and add topical calcineurin inhibitors for sensitive areas or maintenance. For moderate-to-severe disease, consider crisaborole or dupilumab; reserve systemic corticosteroids for short rescue only. Address triggers, reinforce adherence, and monitor growth with prolonged steroid use. Educate families to apply emollients liberally, use medications as prescribed, and seek care for infection or uncontrolled flares [^111vNTp1] [^116wwvUA] [^113b4L2H].

---

## General principles of management

- **Emollients (moisturizers)**: Apply liberally at least once daily to the entire body, especially after bathing, to restore the skin barrier and reduce transepidermal water loss [^111vNTp1] [^111XWq4k].

- **Bathing**: Daily or every-other-day short baths (5–10 minutes) with lukewarm water and a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser; avoid soaps and bubble baths [^111vNTp1] [^111XWq4k].

- **Trigger avoidance**: Identify and minimize exposure to irritants (fragrances, detergents, wool), allergens (dust mites, pets, pollen), and environmental factors (dry air, heat, sweat) [^notfound].

---

## Topical anti-inflammatory therapies

### Topical corticosteroids (TCS)

- **First-line therapy**: Use the lowest effective potency; apply once or twice daily to inflamed areas until clearance, then taper to maintenance [^116wwvUA] [^114WrPkL].

- **Potency selection**: Low-potency for face, intertriginous areas, and infants; moderate-potency for trunk and extremities in older children; high-potency for thick, lichenified areas only and for short courses [^117BryDh] [^114oUvfv].

- **Safety**: Risk of skin atrophy is low with short-term use; monitor growth with prolonged use and avoid continuous application without breaks [^116wwvUA] [^116a2u2o].

---

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)

Tacrolimus 0.03% or pimecrolimus 1% are **steroid-sparing options** for sensitive areas (face, eyelids, intertriginous regions) or for maintenance therapy. Local burning or stinging may occur but typically resolves with continued use.

---

### Topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor

Crisaborole 2% is a **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory** for mild-to-moderate disease, particularly on sensitive skin or as maintenance.

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are reserved for **moderate-to-severe disease refractory to topical therapy**.

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dupilumab | ≥ 6 months, moderate-to-severe | Weight-based dosing every 2–4 weeks | - Injection site reactions <br/> - Conjunctivitis <br/> - Eosinophilia |
| Cyclosporine | Severe, refractory | 2.5–5 mg/kg/day | - Renal function <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Drug interactions |
| Methotrexate | Severe, refractory | 0.2–0.4 mg/kg/week | - CBC <br/> - LFTs <br/> - Teratogenicity counseling |
| Systemic corticosteroids | Short rescue only | 0.5–1 mg/kg/day ≤ 2 weeks | - Growth <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Glucose <br/> - Infection risk |

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Wet-wrap therapy**: For severe flares, short courses under specialist supervision [^117BryDh].

- **Bleach baths**: Dilute sodium hypochlorite baths (0.005–0.006%) 2–3 times weekly for patients with recurrent infections or high bacterial colonization [^notfound].

- **Antihistamines**: Sedating antihistamines (e.g. hydroxyzine) at night for sleep disruption and scratching; limited benefit for pruritus itself [^115zmxKG].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Education is essential to improve outcomes. Key points include **correct application of emollients and medications**, adherence to bathing and trigger-avoidance strategies, and recognition of infection or uncontrolled flares. Adherence is improved with simplified regimens, written action plans, and regular follow-up [^11697NkZ] [^111BKVqz].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular visits should assess disease control, adherence, and adverse effects. Growth should be monitored with prolonged topical or systemic corticosteroid use, and therapy should be adjusted to the lowest effective dose to maintain control [^116wwvUA].

---

## Special considerations

Infants generally require **low-potency TCS** and careful monitoring for adverse effects. School-aged children may need higher-potency TCS for thick lesions, with attention to adherence and psychosocial impacts. Adolescents should be engaged in shared decision-making and adherence strategies, including addressing body-image concerns [^notfound].

---

## When to refer

Refer to pediatric dermatology or allergy for **moderate-to-severe disease refractory to topical therapy**, suspected food or environmental allergies, recurrent infections, or significant psychosocial impact [^113hq6sf].

---

Pediatric eczema care centers on **emollients, trigger avoidance, and stepwise anti-inflammatory therapy**, with escalation to systemic agents for refractory disease. Close follow-up, education, and adherence support are essential to maintain control and minimize adverse effects.

### How we treat atopic dermatitis now and how that will change over the next 5 years [^115LGFE3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

We live in exciting times in atopic dermatitis therapeutics, with many novel treatments in the clinical trial pipeline. Frustratingly, most of these trials are vehicle- or placebo-controlled, rather than head-to-head comparisons. Network meta-analyses can rank treatments against each other, even for placebo-controlled studies, aiding evidence-based guideline formulation and clinical decision-making. Treatment registries are an important additional vehicle to collect 'real-world' data on the long-term (cost) effectiveness and safety of the new drugs, outside of the stringent and short-term settings of clinical trials. As further agents enter clinical practice, the need for biomarkers of treatment response and drug safety becomes more pressing to move us towards personalized medicine and to avoid wasting healthcare resources. This review takes stock of our current treatment armamentarium for atopic dermatitis, highlights important gaps in our knowledge - including the relatively low number of studies conducted in children - and maps out how our treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis can become more targeted and holistic in the future.

### Management of severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients [^111Q71xY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disorder, present in about 12% of children worldwide. Optimizing management of severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients is critical to reduce signs of inflammation, alleviate pruritus and sleep disturbance, minimize the development and/or impact of comorbidities, and improve the patient and caregiver's quality of life. Evaluating the longitudinal severity of pediatric atopic dermatitis is an important component of measuring therapeutic response and long-term management, and is different in clinical practice versus clinical trials. This article describes when and how to use different treatments for pediatric patients with severe atopic dermatitis, including topical medications, phototherapy, and systemic medical therapies (traditional immunosuppressants, biologics, and small molecule inhibitors). It also provides recommendations useful in clinical practice for nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric patients with severe atopic dermatitis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111Xwkaj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis diagnosis and assessment — scope of guideline states that this guideline addresses the diagnosis and assessment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD; atopic eczema) of all severities, and that other forms of dermatitis, such as irritant dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis in those without AD, are outside of the scope of this document. It specifies that this document is the first section in the series and covers methods for diagnosis and monitoring of AD, disease severity and quality of life scales for outcomes measurement, and common clinical associations that affect patients, and notes that a discussion on known risk factors for the development of AD is also presented. It further states that the second guideline in the series will address the management and treatment of AD with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic topical modalities; the third section will cover phototherapy and systemic treatment options; and the fourth section will address the minimization of disease flares, educational interventions, and use of adjunctive approaches.

### Perceptions of physicians and pediatric patients about atopic dermatitis, its impact, and its treatment [^114GTGey]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The National Eczema Association for Science and Education surveyed 429 patients with atopic dermatitis or their parents and 303 physicians about atopic dermatitis, its effect on quality of life (QOL), and the adequacy of available treatments. The physician survey focused on disease severity and management; the patient survey, on disease severity, impact on QOL, and treatment preferences. Physician and patient/parent respondents generally agreed about their assessments of disease severity, poor effectiveness of over-the-counter products, and the need for more patient support groups and toll-free phone information. Atopic dermatitis significantly impacts QOL in children, particularly in those with moderate-to-severe disease. New treatments should offer enhanced efficacy, less frequent application, and fewer adverse effects.

### Past, present, and future shared decision-making behavior among patients with eczema and caregivers [^114hA3F6]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Eczema is a term that encompasses a group of conditions that cause the skin to become itchy and inflamed. National estimates for the prevalence of eczema indicate that 1 in 10 individuals will be affected by eczema at some point in their lifetime. Atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, can have both pediatric and adult onset. After initial presentation, eczema can be continuous for many years, or it can show a relapsing-remitting nature. Disease severity, specific phenotypes of the disease, triggers for flares, and quality-of-life effects are extremely patient-specific, necessitating an individualized treatment approach. The patient journey to achieving desired care experience and outcomes can additionally be challenging, time consuming, and negatively affect overall burden of disease.

Shared decision-making (SDM) is a practice in which a health care practitioner (HCP) works with a patient or caregiver to incorporate their unique preferences and values into decisions about medically appropriate treatment options. Eczema is particularly well suited for SDM owing to its clinical and patient-reported heterogeneity that may allow for varying treatment approaches that can be informed by preference-sensitive decision-making. However, little is known about experiences with SDM among patients with eczema and caregivers in a clinical setting in the US.

This study's objective is to investigate how patients with eczema and caregivers of pediatric patients with eczema have experienced SDM in the past, what their current preferences are to engage in SDM, and their level of confidence and motivation to engage in SDM in the future. As the therapeutic landscape for eczema is evolving, this study's results can inform HCPs about the readiness of patients with eczema to engage in SDM with the goal of facilitating positive health care experiences and ultimately better health outcomes.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^114jjtHC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis guideline — scope states that this guideline addresses the treatment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD) of all severities and that the treatment of other forms of eczematous dermatitis is outside the scope of this document. Recommendations on AD management are subdivided into 4 sections to update and expand on the clinical information and recommendations previously published in 2004. This document is the final in the series of 4 publications and discusses the management and control of AD flares using topical modalities and the utility and timing of allergen testing and avoidance, and also discusses the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches, such as environmental, dietary, and educational interventions, in addition to complementary therapies.

### Management of atopic dermatitis in the pediatric population [^116vEbFr]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis, one of the most common skin disorders in young children, has a prevalence of 10% to 20% in the first decade of life. It is a chronic illness that requires a multifaceted treatment strategy in the setting of limited therapeutic options. Balancing safety concerns with efficacious treatment is of particular importance in the pediatric population. Parents of patients with atopic dermatitis turn to their primary caregivers for guidance regarding this physically demanding and psychologically stressful condition. In addition to serving as a review of atopic dermatitis, this article delves into the state-of-the-art therapeutic options and includes a detailed review of the differences between topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. We also discuss new treatment strategies that are being used by atopic dermatitis specialists, such as comprehensive "education-as-intervention" models, wet wraps, bleach baths, and systemic immunomodulatory therapies.

### Treatment of eczema [^1172mgTJ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that has reached nearly epidemic proportions in childhood. Moreover, it is a difficult disease to control and, with its onset in childhood, is often the first manifestation of atopy. The clinical features of eczema include itchy red skin accompanied by dryness and lichenification. In the past, treatment options consisted primarily of avoidance of soap and water. These options have considerably improved with both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. However, eczema is still a treatment challenge. Part of the problem in developing new treatment options has been the relative failure in translating basic science information into clinical application. It is hoped that the newer biologics will help bridge this gap and lead to greater success rates.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^1157GtA9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Emollients are universally recommended for atopic dermatitis/eczema ('eczema'), to improve the skin barrier and reduce symptoms. However, our knowledge of the frequency and nature of adverse effects associated with their use is limited.

Objectives

We sought to determine how well adverse events are reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of emollients for eczema.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched from inception (1946) to May 2022. Inclusion criteria were RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with eczema. Exclusion criteria were non-RCTs; patients with other diagnoses included; use of emollient as bath additives, soap substitutes or as preventative; and not published in English. References of eligible papers were reviewed for any additional, relevant research. Data were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analysed descriptively. An assessment of study quality was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for RCTs.

Results

From 369 potential papers, 35 papers (reporting on 34 studies) were included. Most research was conducted in research centres or hospitals (unclear in 34%). In total, 89% reported collecting data on adverse events related to emollient treatment use but the methods used were poorly reported (40% unclear). Four papers used patient questionnaires/diaries. However, it was unclear how and what was collected as only two studies showed the questionnaires used.

Conclusions

Reporting of adverse events related to emollient use in trials of patients with eczema is poor and inconsistent. Agreement should be reached on how and what adverse events should be collected, to standardize reporting across studies.

### New and emerging therapies for paediatric atopic dermatitis [^113FaRwS]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2019). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic inflammatory skin disorder with a profound symptom burden, and substantially affects patients' quality of life. It is particularly challenging to manage in children, because conventional treatments such as topical corticosteroids might be inadequate or cause considerable safety concerns. Research into the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis has led to the testing and development of numerous topical, oral, and injectable targeted therapeutic agents. This Review explores relevant drugs that hold therapeutic promise and are being studied in the paediatric setting, with a focus on target relevance, available efficacy and safety data, potential safety concerns, and long-term effect in children with atopic dermatitis.

### Developing drugs for treatment of atopic dermatitis in children (≥ 3 months to… [^117PWAgx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease, and it primarily affects children. Although atopic dermatitis (AD) has the highest effect on burden of skin disease, no high-level studies have defined optimal therapy for severe disease. Corticosteroids have been used to treat AD since the 1950s and remain the only systemic medication with Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in children, despite published guidelines of care that recommend against this option. Several clinical trials with level 1 evidence have supported the use of topical treatments for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children, but these trials have had little consistency in protocol design. Consensus recommendations will help standardize clinical development and trial design for children. The Food and Drug Administration issues guidance documents for industry as a source for "the Agency's current thinking on a particular subject". Although they are nonbinding, industry considers these documents to be the standard for clinical development and trial design. Our consensus group is the first to specifically address clinical trial design in this population. We developed a draft guidance document for industry, Developing Drugs for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children (≥ 3 months to < 18 years of age). This draft guidance has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration based on a provision in the Federal Register (Good Guidance Practices).

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^114WrPkL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first‐line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician‐reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient‐reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty‐five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data.

Stronger‐potency versus weaker‐potency topical corticosteroids

Sixty‐three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician‐reported signs of eczema.

We pooled four trials that compared moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low‐certainty evidence).

Twice daily or more versus once daily application

We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks.

Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare‐up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher‐potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low‐certainty evidence.

Longer versus shorter‐term duration of application for induction of remission

No trials were identified.

Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare‐ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application

Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe).

Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty.

Other comparisons

Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare‐ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare‐ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low‐ or very low‐certainty, short‐term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1117nAWA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first-line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician-reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main Results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty-five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data. Stronger-potency versus weaker-potency topical corticosteroids Sixty-three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician-reported signs of eczema. We pooled four trials that compared moderate- versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate-potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low-certainty evidence). Twice daily or more versus once daily application We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks. Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare-up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher-potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low-certainty evidence. Longer versus shorter-term duration of application for induction of remission No trials were identified. Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare-ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe). Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty. Other comparisons Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare-ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare-ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low- or very low-certainty, short-term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer-term trials, in people with mild eczema.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^117DdGYZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur together in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective in preventing eczema or food allergy.

Objectives

Primary objective To assess effects of skin care interventions, such as emollients, for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to July 2020: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We contacted field experts to identify planned trials and to seek information about unpublished or incomplete trials.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (0 to 12 months) without pre-existing diagnosis of eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition were included. Comparison was standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions included moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow-up was required.

Data Collection and Analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured by the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician-assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen.

Main Results

This review identified 33 RCTs, comprising 25,827 participants. A total of 17 studies, randomising 5823 participants, reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. Eleven studies randomising 5217 participants, with 10 of these studies providing IPD, were included in one or more meta-analysis (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis). Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported our outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to two years. We assessed most of this review's evidence as low certainty or had some concerns of risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. Evidence for the primary food allergy outcome was rated as high risk of bias due to inclusion of only one trial where findings varied when different assumptions were made about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change risk of eczema by one to two years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) nor time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). It is unclear whether skin care interventions during infancy change risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to two years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.47; 996 participants, 1 trial) or allergic sensitisation to a food allergen at age one to two years (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.69; 1055 participants, 2 trials) due to very low-certainty evidence for these outcomes. Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial). However, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to significant over-reporting of cow's milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.77; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) or stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although confidence intervals for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions are wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses show that effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, FLG mutation, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and risk of developing eczema or food allergy.

Authors' Conclusions

Skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema, and probably increase risk of skin infection. Effects of skin care interventions on risk of food allergy are uncertain. Further work is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might promote or prevent eczema and to evaluate effects on food allergy based on robust outcome assessments.

Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search Methods

We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre-existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition.

We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta-analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only. Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low-certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low-certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over-reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin (FLG) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy.

### Treatment adherence in pediatric atopic dermatitis: a systematic review [^11697NkZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adherence to pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment regimens can be complex and a major challenge to optimizing treatment outcome. We aimed to review factors associated with nonadherence in pediatric AD and propose interventions to improve adherence.

Methods

PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for articles from 2000 to February 2023 related to AD and adherence, with an additional update in December 2023. Non-human studies, reviews, commentaries, and meta-analyses were excluded. Articles were sorted into pediatric versus adult study population based on volume. Herein, we examine the results of papers discussing adherence factors related to pediatric patients.

Results

A total of 62 studies met inclusion criteria. Thirty-six studies surveyed patients and caregivers (N = 10,268) to identify barriers to treatment adherence. None of the included studies were specific to systemic medications. Barriers included poor caregiver quality of life, inadequate AD-related education, topical corticosteroid (TCS) phobia, unclear therapy-related instructions, and dissatisfaction with physician interaction. Five studies solely measured adherence using medication electronic monitoring systems, Morisky medication adherence scale, or self-reported adherence to measure adherence to topical medications. Twenty-one studies described interventions involving nurse-led or web-based education programs, text message or email reminders, and TCS education. Adherence was improved with caregiver education programs, daily text-message reminders, eczema action plans, TCS potency "traffic light" color system, and frequent follow-up visits.

Conclusion

Adherence to pediatric AD treatment poses a multifactorial challenge for caregivers and patients. This study provides an index of strategies to optimize adherence, as it is essential for prevention of long-term sequela associated with AD in children. As the AD treatment landscape rapidly expands, further studies are vital to assess pediatric adherence to new topical, oral, and injectable medications.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^11424wdA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We created summary of findings tables for our main comparisons. We selected the following four most relevant and important comparisons, from both clinician and patient perspectives, to be included in the summary of findings tables.

Stronger potency versus weaker potency for treatment of eczema flare‐ups
Twice daily versus once daily application for treatment of eczema flare‐ups
Longer‐ versus shorter‐term application for induction of remission
Twice weekly application to prevent relapse (weekend therapy) versus no application

We included both primary outcomes and secondary outcomes in each summary of findings table. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each primary and secondary outcome for our main comparisons. GRADE includes the assessment of five factors: trial limitations (risk of bias); inconsistency of results; indirectness of evidence; imprecision; and publication bias (Schünemann 2013). Each outcome can be downgraded by one or two levels for each domain, and we classed the overall certainty as high, moderate, low or very low. We used GRADEpro GDT to create our summary of findings tables and undertake our GRADE assessments.

### TREatment of ATopic eczema (TREAT) registry taskforce: protocol for a European safety study of dupilumab and other systemic therapies in patients with atopic eczema [^111tcQZp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A long-term prospective observational safety study is essential to characterize fully the safety profile of systemic immunomodulating therapies for patients with atopic eczema. The TREatment of ATopic eczema (TREAT) Registry Taskforce offers a large platform to conduct such research using national registries that collect the same data using a predefined core dataset.

Objectives

To present a protocol for a safety study comparing dupilumab with other systemic immunomodulating therapies in children and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic eczema, to assess the long-term safety risk of these therapies in a routine clinical care setting.

Methods

We describe a registry-embedded international observational prospective cohort study. Adult and paediatric patients who start treatment with dupilumab or another systemic immunomodulating agent for their atopic eczema will be included. The primary end point is the incidence of malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) compared between the treatment groups. Secondary end points include other serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, such as eye disorders and eosinophilia.

Conclusions

This protocol delineates a safety study for dupilumab in adult and paediatric patients with atopic eczema, using a standardized methodological approach across several national registries. The protocol could also be used for other novel systemic immunomodulating therapies, and could provide licensing and reimbursement authorities, pharmaceutical companies and clinicians with safety evidence from a routine clinical care setting. What's already known about this topic? There is a need for long-term data on the safety of systemic immunomodulating therapies in patients with atopic eczema. Regulatory bodies, such as the European Medicines Agency, increasingly stipulate the collection of such data as part of the licensing agreement for new treatments, to assess the new agent's long-term safety profile against established therapies. Large numbers of patients with a long duration of follow-up are necessary in order to detect rare events like malignancies. What does this study add? The TREAT Registry Taskforce offers a platform to conduct such research with a network of multiple national atopic eczema research registries. We present a protocol for an investigator-initiated multicentre safety study comparing dupilumab with other systemic immunomodulating therapies in adults and subsequently adolescents and children with moderate-to-severe atopic eczema. This protocol can be used as a framework for similar studies for other novel systemic immunomodulating therapies across both adult and paediatric populations.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^115UxMcC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How often to apply topical corticosteroid?

See: Table 5; Table 6; and Table 7.

Applying topical corticosteroid twice daily probably does not increase the proportion of participants (adults and children) who achieve clinician‐reported treatment success for treating a flare (1 to 4 weeks) compared to once daily application (moderate‐certainty evidence). This still applied when restricting to trials where the same topical corticosteroid was used in both arms; however, most of those trials were in participants with moderate to severe eczema, using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid. It also applied in the trials that spanned more than one strategy, comparing higher‐potency, often newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroid applied once a day with lower‐potency topical corticosteroid applied more frequently.

The evidence suggests that frequency of application results in little to no difference between strategies in the risk of developing skin thinning (low‐certainty evidence). The number of reported cases was low, and more than three‐quarters of cases were seen in participants using very potent topical corticosteroid. The evidence addressing whether using topical corticosteroids more than once daily affects cortisol levels is very uncertain and there were no data on clinically relevant effects.

No trials looked at longer‐ versus shorter‐term duration of treatment for induction of remission from a flare.

Weekend, or 'proactive' therapy, in which topical corticosteroids are applied twice a week for two consecutive days in between flares, aims to prevent rather than treat eczema flares. Weekend therapy likely results in a large decrease in the likelihood of experiencing a new flare compared to no topical corticosteroid application, with moderate‐certainty evidence. This effect was seen in children and adults and across all eczema severities, although most evidence was in moderate to severe eczema. With regard to safety, no cases of skin thinning, or new cases of abnormal cortisol levels were reported (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence), but there were no data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression or impact on growth. The trials of weekend therapy were significantly longer in duration (16 weeks to 12 months) than trials identified for other strategies, primarily because of the need to detect the number of new flares rather than treating the existing flare. Whilst these trials may be better designed to detect adverse events that take longer to manifest, such as skin thinning, it should be noted that the data are not necessarily comparable with the other strategy comparisons as the topical corticosteroid use was intermittent (two days per week) rather than daily as is normal for treating a flare.

### Treatment effect of omalizumab on severe pediatric atopic dermatitis: the ADAPT randomized clinical trial [^115HdBF3]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Systemic treatments for severe childhood atopic dermatitis have limited evidence and/or are unlicensed. Despite the efficacy of anti-IgE medication (omalizumab) in the treatment of atopy, no large randomized studies in childhood atopic dermatitis have been published.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of omalizumab in treating severe atopic dermatitis in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Atopic Dermatitis Anti-IgE Pediatric Trial (ADAPT) was a 24-week single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial with a 24-week follow-up. Conducted from November 20, 2014, to August 31, 2017, at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London in the United Kingdom, this trial recruited participants after a screening visit. Eligible participants (n = 62) were aged 4 to 19 years and had severe eczema (with objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD] index > 40) that was unresponsive to optimum therapy. Statistical analysis was conducted using the intention-to-treat principle.

Interventions

Subcutaneous omalizumab or placebo for 24 weeks. The drug manufacturer's dosing tables were used to determine the dosage based on total IgE (30–1500 IU/mL) and body weight (in kilograms) at randomization.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Objective SCORAD index after 24 weeks of treatment.

Results

In total, 62 children (mean [SD] age, 10.3 [4.2] years; 32 (52%) were male) were randomized to either omalizumab (n = 30) or placebo (n = 32). Five participants withdrew from treatment (4 [13%] from the placebo group, and 1 [3%] from the omalizumab group). Follow-up attendance was 97% at week 24 and 98% at week 48. After adjustment for baseline objective SCORAD index, age, and IgE level, the mean difference in objective SCORAD index improvement between groups at week 24 was -6.9 (95% CI, -12.2 to -1.5; P = 0.01), significantly favoring omalizumab therapy and reflecting the results in other assessments of atopic dermatitis severity. Improved quality-of-life scores were seen in the omalizumab group, as measured by the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index/Dermatology Life Quality Index (-3.5; 95% CI, -6.4 to -0.5) and Pediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire score (-0.5; 95% CI, -0.9 to -0.0). Improvements in disease severity occurred despite lower potent topical corticosteroid use in the omalizumab group compared with the placebo group (median [interquartile range (IQR)] percentage of body surface area covered, 16% [10%-46%] vs 31% [14%-55%]; median [IQR] number of days of use, 109 [34–164] days vs 161 [82–171] days).

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that omalizumab significantly reduced atopic dermatitis severity and improved quality of life in a pediatric population with atopy and severe eczema despite highly elevated total IgE levels at baseline. The result was associated with a potent topical corticosteroid sparing effect and may suggest that omalizumab is a treatment option for difficult-to-manage severe eczema in children with atopy.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116H7vGa]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Eczema affects up to 20% of infants, 6% of school‐age children and 5% of adults worldwide and is the most burdensome skin condition globally. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the most commonly used anti‐inflammatory treatment for eczema and have been available for over 70 years. While there is great interest in novel systemic treatments for moderate–severe eczema, new classes of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments have also been licensed for mild, moderate or severe eczema treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) tacrolimus and pimecrolimus were licensed in 2000, and subsequently phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors such as crisaborole, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as ruxolitinib and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators such as tapinarof have subsequently become available or are in development. There is a lack of comparative effectiveness research in eczema, as in many other areas of healthcare. This paucity makes it very difficult for health care professionals and patients to decide which treatment is best in terms of benefits and the least harms. It also hampers guideline development. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) is a tool developed for indirectly evaluating the relative effectiveness and safety of interventions used to treat the same condition. One NMA that included different interventions in addition to topical anti‐inflammatory treatments was published after our work started.

We conducted a NMA focussed on use of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for treating eczema, in order to statistically rank and compare the effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments.

### Translating atopic dermatitis management guidelines into practice for primary care providers [^114UP3qh]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis affects a substantial number of children, many of whom seek initial treatment from their pediatrician or other primary care provider. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have mild disease and can be adequately managed at the primary care level. However, recent treatment guidelines are written primarily for use by specialists and lack certain elements that would make them more useful to primary care providers. This article evaluates these recent treatment guidelines in terms of evaluation criteria, treatment recommendations, usability, accessibility, and applicability to nonspecialists and integrates them with clinical evidence to present a streamlined severity-based treatment model for the management of a majority of atopic dermatitis cases. Because each patient's situation is unique, individualization of treatment plans is critical as is efficient communication and implementation of the plan with patients and caregivers. Specifically, practical suggestions for individualizing, optimizing, implementing, and communicating treatment plans such as choosing a moisturizer formulation, avoiding common triggers, educating patients/caregivers, providing written treatment plans, and scheduling physician follow-up are provided along with a discussion of available resources for patients/caregivers and providers.

### Atopic dermatitis: skin-directed management [^1159YWpB]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by relapsing eczematous lesions in a typical distribution. It can be frustrating for pediatric patients, parents, and health care providers alike. The pediatrician will treat the majority of children with atopic dermatitis as many patients will not have access to a pediatric medical subspecialist, such as a pediatric dermatologist or pediatric allergist. This report provides up-to-date information regarding the disease and its impact, pathogenesis, treatment options, and potential complications. The goal of this report is to assist pediatricians with accurate and useful information that will improve the care of patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Biomarkers in atopic dermatitis-a review on behalf of the international eczema council [^114xsSbP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

THE GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS, ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION APPROACH TO ASSESS EVIDENCE STRENGTH

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach offers a system for rating quality of evidence, with a structured process for developing and presenting evidence summary. Herein, we searched for AD-related publications that included correlation analysis and found a significant (P < .05) correlation coefficient of greater than or equal to 0.4 between AD clinical severity and blood/skin potential biomarkers, both at baseline and during various AD treatments, and across both pediatric and adult patients. Biomarkers that were found to robustly correlate with AD clinical severity in more than 3 publications were included in this review. Next, we summarized these findings using the GRADE approach, in which accumulated evidence per each potential biomarker (separated by pediatric and adults, and at baseline and during topical and systemic treatments) was graded on the basis of strength of the overall published data, given our inclusion threshold.

### Emollients, education and quality of life: the RCPCH care pathway for children with eczema [^115RVmFv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) Science and Research Department was commissioned by the Department of Health to develop national care pathways for children with allergies. The eczema pathway focuses on defining the competences to improve the equity of care received by children with eczema.

Method

The eczema pathway was developed by a multidisciplinary working group and was based on a comprehensive review of evidence. The pathway was reviewed by a broad group of stakeholders including paediatricians, allergists, dermatologists, specialist nurses, dietician, patients' representatives and approved by the Allergy Care Pathways Project Board and the RCPCH Clinical Standards Committee. It was also reviewed by a wide range of stakeholders.

Results

The results are presented in three sections: the evidence review, mapping and the core knowledge document. The various entry points to the ideal pathway of care are defined from self-care through to follow-up. There is considerable emphasis on good skin care and when allergy problems should be dealt with. The pathway algorithm and associated competences can be downloaded from http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/allergy/eczema.

Conclusions

Effective eczema management is holistic and encompasses an assessment of severity and impact on quality of life, treatment of the inflamed epidermal skin barrier, recognition and treatment of infection and assessment and management of environmental and allergy triggers. Patient and family education which seeks to maximise understanding and concordance with treatment is also important in all children with eczema.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^113MA5HR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy.

Objectives

Primary objective

To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants.

Secondary objective

To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search methods

We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection criteria

We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre‐existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow‐up was required.

Data collection and analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta‐analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician‐assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen.

Main results

We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta‐analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta‐analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.

Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty‐five studies, including all those contributing data to meta‐analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta‐analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow‐up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients.

We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data.

Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE‐mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low‐certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low‐certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over‐reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low‐certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk.

Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin (FLG) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development.

Authors' conclusions

Based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy.

### Italian guidelines for therapy of atopic dermatitis-adapted from consensus-based European guidelines for treatment of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) [^115sM365]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) therapeutic approach calls for a long-term treatment. Treatment options for AD have recently undergone a revolutionary change by the introduction of the first biologic drug. Availability in daily practice of the last version of international AD guidelines, taking peculiarities of the country into account, can contribute to good clinical practice in Italy. To adapt European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guidelines for AD to the Italian medical-legal context, the EDF guidelines were assessed independently by two independent Italian renowned experts in the field and further integrated with articles published and systematically reviewed before May 2019. The first draft was collegially corrected and updated by the members of the SIDEMAST, ADOI, and SIDAPA. Recommendation levels (A; B; C; D) were graded based on the evidence levels (1–4). The adapted guidelines presented here focus on topical and systemic therapies in AD patients, both children and adults. As opposed to previous Italian guidelines, they include indications about biologics. New relevant evidence available from very recent literature and peculiarities of the Italian medical and legal context have been integrated in the revision process. If compared to general guidelines for AD not adapted to a specific national and cultural context, a revision for specific Italian needs is now available: It comprises the option of implementing the new biologic treatments and is likely to provide an important contribution to the improvement of clinical practice in Italy. Cooperation between patients, dermatologists, allergologists, and pediatricians remains mandatory in AD management. The authors of the present revision recommend an update of the Italian guidelines to be performed at least every second year.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^117VpdMw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory dermatosis that affects up to 25% of children and 2% to 3% of adults. This guideline addresses important clinical questions that arise in the management and care of AD, providing updated and expanded recommendations based on the available evidence. In this first of 4 sections, methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, outcomes measures for assessment, and common clinical associations that affect patients with AD are discussed. Known risk factors for the development of disease are also reviewed.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^1174zUcg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance addressing atopic dermatitis (AD) management, last issued in 2012 by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force, requires updating as a result of new treatments and improved guideline and evidence synthesis methodology.

Objective

To produce evidence-based guidelines that support patients, clinicians, and other decision-makers in the optimal treatment of AD.

Methods

A multidisciplinary guideline panel consisting of patients and caregivers, AD experts (dermatology and allergy/immunology), primary care practitioners (family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine), and allied health professionals (psychology, pharmacy, nursing) convened, prioritized equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, and implemented management strategies to minimize influence of conflicts of interest. The Evidence in Allergy Group supported guideline development by performing systematic evidence reviews, facilitating guideline processes, and holding focus groups with patient and family partners. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. Evidence-to-decision frameworks, subjected to public comment, translated evidence to recommendations using trustworthy guideline principles.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations to gain and maintain control of AD for patients with mild, moderate, and severe AD. The eAppendix provides practical information and implementation considerations in 1–2 page patient-friendly handouts.

Conclusion

These evidence-based recommendations address optimal use of (1) topical treatments (barrier moisturization devices, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors [crisaborole], topical JAK inhibitors, occlusive [wet wrap] therapy, adjunctive antimicrobials, application frequency, maintenance therapy), (2) dilute bleach baths, (3) dietary avoidance/elimination, (4) allergen immunotherapy, and (5) systemic treatments (biologics/monoclonal antibodies, small molecule immunosuppressants [cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, JAK inhibitors], and systemic corticosteroids) and UV phototherapy (light therapy).

### A comparison of international management guidelines for atopic dermatitis [^115xjBa6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic condition that is predominantly found in pediatric patients and commonly presents therapeutic challenges. The management of AD encompasses a variety of factors, and the pillars of optimal management revolve around skin barrier repair and antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, and antipruritic treatment. AD management guidelines exist in various geographic regions globally. The purpose of this review was to compare international guidelines to highlight the similarities and variances among populations and skin types. Comparisons were made for recommendations regarding moisturization, bathing, wet wrap therapy, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, antihistamines, antipruritics, antibiotics, systemic immunosuppressants, and biologics.

Methods

A literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases was performed for published guidelines in each geographic region. Inclusion criteria included publications available in English that were established by a dermatological association or group including dermatologists, pertained to the treatment of AD in humans, were the most recent guidelines available that were published between 2007 and 2018, and included comprehensive treatment recommendations.

Results

Publications from Europe, North America, Asia, the Asia-Pacific region, Australia, and Africa were reviewed, encompassing 14 guidelines. Notable diversity exists across these guidelines regarding recommendations for moisturization and bathing, as well as topical and systemic therapies for AD.

Conclusions

Due to the heterogeneity of the disease and regional treatment accessibility, complete standardization of AD management guidelines may be difficult. Nevertheless, more consensus on management guidelines is needed, and recommendations should be updated as new treatment modalities become available.

### Update on atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, severity assessment, and treatment selection [^113gupUz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting children and adults. The intense pruritus and rash can be debilitating, significantly impairing quality of life. Until recently, treatment was largely nonspecific and, in severe disease, sometimes ineffective and/or fraught with many side effects. Now, multiple agents targeting specific disease pathways are available or in development. Two new therapies, crisaborole and dupilumab, have become available since 2016, and dupilumab has dramatically improved outcomes for adults with severe AD. This article provides an overview of AD, including strategies for differential diagnosis and assessment of disease severity to guide treatment selection. Key clinical trials for crisaborole and dupilumab are reviewed, and other targeted treatments now in development are summarized. Two cases, representing childhood-onset and adult-onset AD, are discussed to provide clinical context for diagnosis, severity assessment, and treatment selection and outcomes.

### Does order of application of emollient and topical corticosteroids make a difference in the severity of atopic eczema in children? [^116irt5T]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder in children, with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) commonly prescribed as treatment. There is no published guidance on the correct order of application of emollient and TCS in children with AE.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether the order of application of emollient and TCS makes a difference in the severity of AE in children.

Methods

Forty-six patients ages 4 months to 5 years with moderate to severe AE were randomized to two groups: group A applied emollient followed by TCS 15 minutes later twice daily, and group B applied TCS followed by emollient 15 minutes later twice daily for 2 weeks.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected, or itch score between groups A and B (p > 0.05). Group A had statistically significant improvement in the EASI score, percentage BSA affected, and itch score from baseline to weeks 1 and 2; group B demonstrated statistically significant improvement only in the EASI score from baseline to week 1 and in itch score from baseline to week 2. There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.

Conclusion

This study suggests that the order of application of emollient and TCS does not matter in the treatment of AE in children and that parents can apply topical medications in whichever order they prefer.

### Steroid-free over-the-counter eczema skin care formulations reduce risk of flare, prolong time to flare, and reduce eczema symptoms in pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis [^115YkcqX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin condition associated with decreased barrier function resulting in periodic flare-ups of erythematous and pruritic lesions. Guidelines recommend daily treatment of atopic skin with emollient moisturizers for prevention of flares and maintenance of the flare-free state. This study evaluated the efficacy of 2 steroid-free, nonprescription eczema skin care formulations for reducing the risk of flare and relieving symptoms in infants and children with AD: Body Cream for the daily maintenance treatment of atopic skin and Flare Treatment for the treatment of atopic flares.

Methods

After a 2-week washout period, subjects (N = 45; mean age 3.5 years) were randomized to cleanser plus daily moisturizing with Body Cream (moisturizer group) or cleanser only (control group) for 6 months or until flare. Subjects experiencing flare received Flare Treatment for 4 weeks.

Results

The incidence of flare was significantly lower in the moisturizer group compared with the control group (21% vs 65%; P ≥ 0.006), while the median time to flare was shorter in the control group (28 vs > 180 days). Risk of flare was reduced by 44.1% after 6 months of Body Cream application. Flare Treatment reduced overall eczema symptom severity at week 2 and week 4; 78.9% of flares had improved or cleared at week 4.

Conclusions

Body Cream reduced the incidence of flare and the time to flare, reinforcing guidelines that daily emollient therapy should be an integral part of the maintenance treatment plan for the prevention of disease flares. Body Cream and Flare Treatment are effective over-the-counter steroid-free options for management of AD in children.

### Management of infant atopic eczema to prevent severe eczema and food allergy [^112BhLmW]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

Early intervention and active management of infant atopic eczema may play a crucial role in limiting eczema severity and preventing the onset of immediate-type food allergy. Eczema management involves education, skincare and medications targeting skin inflammation and barrier repair. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of anti-inflammatory therapy, with nonsteroidal options available for some infants. Proactive therapy, addressing subclinical inflammation, is useful for preventing eczema flares, especially in infants with recurrent eczema flares despite reactive therapy. In clinical practice, holistic consideration of overall infant and family health is essential. Providing advice on maternal stress management, nutritional guidance and recommendations for proper sleep and lifestyle is crucial for the well-being of children and their families, not limited to eczema treatment alone.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^116wwvUA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2017. part 1: treatment and prevention [^1133bUzU]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 25 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2017, and focuses on the treatment and prevention of AE. There is high-quality evidence to demonstrate that dupilumab is better than placebo for the treatment of AE, is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects and does not increase the risk of infection compared with placebo; however, comparison studies with other systemic treatments are necessary. Topical tofacitinib is a promising treatment for mild-moderate AE, but currently lacks sufficient evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing with other active treatments. Topical doxepin may be effective for pruritus in AE, but available studies have short follow-up periods and longer-term outcomes are needed. Bleach baths were no more effective than water baths alone at reducing AE severity. Topical antibiotics cannot be recommended for infected AE, owing to insufficient evidence of benefit. There is little comparison of different emollients in RCTs, but overall evidence indicates that they reduce AE severity, are steroid-sparing and lead to better outcomes in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) than TCS alone. No clear benefit was demonstrated for vitamin D/C/E supplementation in pregnancy for eczema prevention.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^117BryDh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Key differences with NICE guidance.

NICE says use once or twice a day. This review suggests there is no evidence of additional effectiveness of application of potent topical corticosteroids once a day over twice a day (we GRADE‐assessed the evidence as moderate certainty). For mild or moderate topical corticosteroids there is a lack of evidence regarding once‐ or twice daily application.
NICE says there is limited evidence on strategies to prevent flares. This review provides moderate‐certainty evidence for use of weekend (proactive) therapy.
This review suggests that newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than older topical corticosteroids; this is not included in NICE guidance. We did not GRADE‐assess the evidence within this analysis as it was not one of the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables.

We found limited or no evidence to support some of the recommendations in NICE.

NICE says occlusion strategies should not be used as first‐line treatment in children, should only be initiated by a healthcare professional trained in their use, and should only be used for 7 to 14 days without specialist dermatological advice.
NICE says do not use potent topical corticosteroids in children under 12 months without specialist dermatological supervision.
NICE says to start treatment of moderate eczema with moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid and severe eczema with potent topical corticosteroid. Whilst this review supports the notion that stronger topical corticosteroids probably have increased effectiveness, there was insufficient data in participants with mild to moderate eczema to fully support this stepped approach.
NICE says, in children over 12 months, to use potent topical corticosteroids for as short a time as possible and in any case for no longer than 14 days.
NICE says to use mild potency for the face and neck, except for short‐term use of moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids for severe flares, and to use moderate or potent preparations for short periods only in the axillae and groin.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^1125WjHQ]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) skin-directed management in pediatrics — standard care and flare prevention — states that standard of care for AD treatment includes topical corticosteroids for active disease and moisturization to repair the barrier defect, with emerging treatments including dupilumab and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors; reduction of triggers and proactive treatment with topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors can reduce flares, and treatment plans should be clear and as simple as possible to maximize adherence.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients: results from a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study [^112sSQJX]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.03% with vehicle ointment for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric patients.

Methods

A total of 317 patients (2–15 years of age) with mild to moderate AD were randomized to receive tacrolimus ointment or vehicle ointment twice daily in a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind study. Efficacy evaluations, including the Investigators' Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment, eczema area and severity index, percentage of total body surface area affected, and patient assessment of itch occurred at baseline, day 4, and weeks 2, 4, and 6. Cutaneous adverse events were recorded to evaluate safety.

Results

At the end of study, 50.6% (80 of 158) of the patients were treated successfully with tacrolimus ointment based on Investigators' Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment scores, a significant improvement compared with patients treated with vehicle ointment (25.8% [41 of 159]). The percent improvement from baseline in eczema area and severity index scores was also significantly greater in tacrolimus-treated patients (54.8%) compared with vehicle-treated patients (20.8%). There was also a significant improvement in the percentage of total body surface area affected of tacrolimus-treated patients (50.5% reduction from baseline) compared with vehicle-treated patients (16.4%). Patient itch scores were significantly lower in tacrolimus-treated patients (2.1) versus vehicle-treated patients (3.7). Overall, the incidence of cutaneous adverse events reported was similar for both treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of burning or stinging between treatment groups. Significantly fewer tacrolimus-treated patients prematurely discontinued from the study because of a cutaneous adverse event in the treatment area or experienced increased itching and erythema at the application site.

Conclusion

Monotherapy with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is a safe and effective treatment alternative for pediatric patients with mild to moderate AD.

### Treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic eczema in adults within the U.K.: results of a national survey of dermatologists [^114cMyJV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema is a disabling long‐term condition. Although it is often considered a disease of childhood, the prevalence of atopic eczema in adults is about 3–10%. 1, 2 Atopic eczema is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction and chronic inflammation. The itching, associated loss of sleep and skin infections that accompany moderate‐to‐severe disease significantly impair quality of life. Although around 60% of children will go into remission by adolescence, refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema in adults usually runs a prolonged and protracted course, 3 typically affecting over 40% of the body surface area. 4, 5 While many adult patients respond to treatment with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors and moisturizers, a significant percentage have recalcitrant disease.

Adults with moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema refractory to topical treatments may be considered for phototherapy or systemic drug treatment. Currently, ciclosporin is the only oral drug licensed for refractory atopic eczema. It should be used only for a limited period (the British National Formulary recommends 2 months maximum) because prolonged use is associated with hypertension, renal impairment and risk of cancer. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

In 2000 a systematic review 12 highlighted the lack of therapeutic options for patients with refractory atopic eczema and underscored the need for robust testing of a range of treatments for the disease. Investigators responded with clinical trials assessing a variety of modalities of phototherapy and a number of systemic agents, often adapted from use in other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In 2012, the European Dermatology Forum, the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis, the European Federation of Allergy, the European Society of Pediatric Dermatology and the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network published a consensus set of guidelines for the treatment of atopic eczema. 9 This summarized the evidence base for phototherapy and systemic agents. The 2013 European TREatment of severe Atopic eczema in children Taskforce (TREAT) survey provided valuable information about treatment of atopic eczema in children across eight European countries, including the U.K. 2 Whether or not dermatologists are following national and international guidelines on treatment of atopic eczema in adults, and indeed their degree of knowledge of the evidence base, is not known.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1165ve7z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A total of 104 trials and 8443 participants were included in this review. These covered a wide range of clinically plausible strategies for using topical corticosteroids in treating eczema, which fell into three broad categories:

which topical corticosteroid to use;
how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for; and
how best to apply the topical corticosteroid.

Summary of main results

The main findings, for which we have drawn up summary of findings tables, address 1. which topical corticosteroid to use, and 2. how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for.

Which topical corticosteroid to use

See: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4.

Our review focused on four comparisons of topical corticosteroid of one potency with another topical corticosteroid of a different potency (moderate versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus moderate topical corticosteroid, and very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid) for treating eczema flare‐ups, which reflects clinical practice decision making based on a stepped approach. In mainly moderate to severe eczema, potent and moderately potent topical corticosteroid probably result in an increased number of participants achieving clinician‐reported treatment success compared to mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence), with insufficient data to determine whether this applied to people with mild disease. There was also insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroid compared to moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence). Again, the trials were mainly in moderate to severe eczema but perhaps more representative of the population that may be offered these higher‐potency topical corticosteroids There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroid, with only three small trials included in the meta‐analysis (low‐certainty evidence). These trials usually included more children than adults. The number of reported cases of skin thinning was very low, with a relatively even spread across groups but tending towards more events with increasing potency of topical corticosteroid. Most trials were of short duration so may not detect longer‐term adverse events (low‐certainty evidence for local adverse events, except for the comparison of very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid which we assessed as very low‐certainty.)

In six trials involving 188 participants, 16 participants had levels of cortisol outside of the normal range (very low‐certainty evidence). There were minimal data on whether the levels returned to normal once the topical corticosteroids were stopped, minimal data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression, and no data regarding impact on growth (see: Completeness of outcomes; safety).

### Real-world treatment outcomes of systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in children aged less than 12 years: 2-year results from PEDIatric STudy in atopic dermatitis [^114x9LFp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The arrival of biologics and small-molecule therapies (eg Janus kinase inhibitors) changed atopic dermatitis treatment, but older systemic treatments continue to be prescribed.

Objective

To provide real-world effectiveness, safety, and adherence data for dupilumab, cyclosporine, and methotrexate.

Methods

PEDIatric STudy in Atopic Dermatitis (NCT03687359) is a real-world, prospective, observational, 10-year study of children (< 12 years) with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. We report 2-year interim results.

Results

Median treatment durations were 8.1, 13.0, and 10.7 months for dupilumab (n = 144), methotrexate (n = 114), and cyclosporine (n = 121), respectively. Dupilumab had numerically greater within-group improvements than methotrexate and cyclosporine in Eczema Area and Severity Index (-12.4∗ vs -5.7∗ and -3.3); body surface area affected (-19.9%∗ vs -11.8%∗ and -8.8%∗); itching (night-time: -2.1∗ vs -0.4 and + 0.1; daytime: -1.5∗ vs +0.1 and + 0.2; ≥ 6 years); itching/scratching (-3.6∗ vs -1.4∗ and -0.2; < 6 years); and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (-7.0∗ vs -4.7∗ and -1.5) (✱ p < .05 within-group improvements from baseline). Dupilumab had less discontinuations (8.3% vs 28.9% and 43.0%) and adverse event(s) (18.1% vs 29.8% and 31.4%).

Limitations

No randomization, placebo, or specified dosages.

Conclusion

Dupilumab was associated with numerically greater outcomes and higher adherence than cyclosporine or methotrexate.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2009–2010 [^114T6tPo]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

This review provides a summary of key findings from 18 systematic reviews on atopic eczema, published or indexed between January 2009 and 24 August 2010. There was no good evidence on the possible benefit of organic food consumption and eczema. Maternal intake of fish or fish oil may be associated with a reduced risk of eczema in offspring, although further studies are needed. There is some evidence that partially hydrolysed infant formulas rather than standard formulas may be associated with a reduced risk of eczema in infants, but there are shortcomings in the existing evidence. An inverse relationship has been found between gliomas/acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and allergic disease/eczema, but there appears to be no association between multiple sclerosis and eczema. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder does appear to be associated with eczema, but there is no evidence of a causal link. The risk of eczema seems to be increased in urban compared with rural areas. Some new evidence has suggested superiority of 1% pimecrolimus over potent and mild corticosteroids at 6months but not 12months, and there is some evidence for superiority of 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus over 1% pimecrolimus. An updated Cochrane Review still found no evidence of a benefit from any form of antistaphylococcal treatment in managing clinically infected or uninfected eczema. The evidence base is poor for bath emollients, occlusive treatments (e.g., wet and dry wraps) and woven silk clothing in treating eczema. In general, the methods used in most systematic reviews of eczema need to be reported more clearly, especially with regard to a more vigorous quality assessment of included studies. Included studies are frequently heterogeneous, proxy reporting is common, and appropriate disease definitions are often lacking. Better adherence to existing guidance on trial reporting and prospective registration of clinical trials may help improve the quality of studies.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^117R5rQX]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Tralokinumab — treatment recommendation and comparative effects in atopic dermatitis (AD): In patients 12 years of age or older with moderate–severe AD refractory, intolerant, or unable to use mid-potency topical treatment, the JTF panel recommends adding tralokinumab over continued topical treatment without tralokinumab (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). Compared with continued standard care alone, adding tralokinumab led to improvements in multiple patient-important outcomes, including AD severity and AD-related quality of life, without an increase in serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation. Compared with dupilumab, tralokinumab was one category lower across multiple patient-important outcomes, and conjunctivitis was similar between both tralokinumab and dupilumab. The safety data to date are reassuring. No randomized trials of tralokinumab address infants or young children with AD.

### Recommendations for vaccination in children with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab: a consensus meeting, 2020 [^111yhbGD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab is the only biologic therapy currently approved in Europe and the United States for severe atopic dermatitis in patients 6 years of age or older. Off-label use is rationalized in younger children with severe atopic dermatitis. Decisions about vaccination for children on dupilumab are complex and depend on both the child's current treatment and the type of vaccination required. To achieve consensus on recommendations for vaccination of pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis treated with or planning to start dupilumab, a review of the literature and a modified-Delphi process was conducted by a working group of 5 panelists with expertise in dermatology, immunology, infectious diseases and vaccination. Here, we provide seven recommendations for vaccination of pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis treated with or planning to start dupilumab. These recommendations serve to guide physicians' decisions about vaccination in children with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab. Furthermore, we highlight an unmet need for research to determine how significantly dupilumab affects cellular and humoral immune responses to vaccination with live attenuated and inactivated vaccines.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^116N7QTD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The review was prospectively registered on Research Registry (unique number: reviewregistry1441) and conducted/reported in line with PRISMA guidance (Appendix S1; see the Supporting Information).

Literature search

The MEDLINE database (Ovid) was searched from 1946 to May 2022. The search strategy used is given in Appendix S2; see the Supporting Information.

The citations were exported into Microsoft Excel, and their eligibility assessed. Firstly, they were screened using the title and abstract. Next, the remaining papers were read in full to create a list of eligible papers. Lastly, these were then reviewed for any additional papers, which were then added to create the final list to be used for data extraction and analysis. Papers were independently screened by two authors (E.R.E. and S.C. or M. A.) and any questions were discussed with a fourth author (M.J.R.) until a decision was made.

Quality assessment

An overall quality assessment of the papers included was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for RCTs.M. A. led this assessment and ambiguities were resolved with E.R.E. and M.J.R.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis. Papers were excluded if: they did not study leave-on emollients or moisturizers (e.g. bath additives or soap substitutes); were not RCTs; included patients with other diagnoses; the use of emollients as preventative treatments; were not published in English; and were not in humans.

Emollients or moisturizers used in the treatment of eczema do not have a strict definition, but for the purposes of this review were defined as products applied directly to the skin to help retain moisture. They did not contain recognized anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

The adverse events focused on in this report are those related to the treatment.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^113yRupp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, it is the consensus of the IEC that systemic CS have a limited role in the treatment of severe AD in children and adults. Clinicians should limit their use to special circumstances and always consider other treatment options. If they are prescribed, they should be limited to short‐term use with a long‐term treatment plan not involving systemic CS. We hope that this serves to curb the overprescription of these medications for patients with AD.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2019. part 2: treatment [^115zmxKG]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual evidence updates on atopic eczema (AE), and provides a summary of key findings from systematic reviews (SRs) published or indexed in 2019 related to AE treatment. Several SRs assessed the efficacy of topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors and topical Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway inhibitors. However, there is a lack of good-quality trials comparing topical treatment agents with TCS, which remain the standard of care for patients with AE. Most of the included trials lack meaningful comparisons as they used vehicle as a comparator. There is also lack of harmonization of outcome measures for AE across studies. Large, well-designed RCTs are needed to further determine whether any specific emollients offer superior benefit. There is evidence highlighting limited benefit of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment of eczema. Mycophenolate mofetil may have a role in patients with refractory AE. Among biologic therapies, most of the efficacy data relate to dupilumab. Furthermore, there is growing evidence for the efficacy and safety of systemic JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors, but the existing data are of low quality.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^114w6FeW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Adult atopic dermatitis topical therapies — scope and methods focus on providing evidence-based recommendations for the management of adult AD using topical therapies available and approved for use in the United States, covering nonprescription agents (moisturizers, bathing practices, wet wraps) and pharmacologic modalities including topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors, antimicrobials, and antihistamines. A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and employed the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and for formulating and grading clinical recommendations; pediatric topical therapy will be addressed in a forthcoming guideline, and treatment of other forms of dermatitis outside AD is outside this document's scope.

### Management of pediatric atopic dermatitis by primary care providers: a systematic review [^114CjG1m]. Academic Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary care providers (PCPs), including pediatricians and general practitioners, are often the first to see children with eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD). Little is known about management of pediatric AD by PCPs and adherence to national guidelines.

Objective

To review existing literature examining management components of pediatric AD (topical corticosteroids [TCS], topical calcineurin inhibitors [TCIs], antihistamines, bathing, emollients, and diet) by PCPs.

Data Sources

PubMed/Medline and Embase.

Study Eligibility Criteria

English-language articles dated 2015 to 2020 reporting outcomes addressing management of pediatric AD by PCPs.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, extracted relevant data, and evaluated study quality. Disagreements were resolved by a third author.

Results

Twenty articles were included. Surveys and national database analyses were the most common methodologies (n = 7 each). PCPs commonly prescribed TCS but had a preference for low-potency agents, overprescribed nonsedating antihistamines, and avoided TCIs. PCPs commonly recommended emollients, although this was not universal. Data characterizing nonmedication management were limited.

Limitations

Most studies did not examine individual patient encounters, but rather relied on providers reporting their general behaviors. Provider behavior may vary based on country of practice.

Conclusions and Implications Of Key Findings

Knowledge and management gaps exist among PCPs in treating pediatric AD in key areas including knowledge of TCS safety profiles and prescribing of TCIs. The current literature is largely limited to small studies that evaluate prescribing behaviors with limited data characterizing nonmedication management, highlighting the need for future research in this area.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-dupilumab for children and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^116qWgSB]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of atopic dermatitis, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based), its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each outcome and age group. In addition, future approaches and research priorities are discussed.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^115N1Szm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

Key areas where this review supports NICE guidance (NICE 2007).

NICE says do not use very potent preparations in children without specialist dermatological advice. Most cases of skin thinning collated into this review were in participants using very potent steroids. We assessed the evidence found within this review relating to the rates of skin thinning using GRADE as low or very low certainty.
NICE says start with mild steroids for those with mild eczema. Within the potent versus mild topical corticosteroid comparison, there was no difference between mild and potent topical corticosteroid in participants with mild to moderate eczema, suggesting that mild steroids may work well enough for this group, however this only considered 43 participants from two trials and the confidence interval was wide compared to the data in moderate to severe eczema, which favoured potent topical corticosteroid. Furthermore, as there were more reports of skin thinning in more potent steroids, the trade‐off of more effectiveness from higher potency does not seem necessary for this group unless it fails to control the flare. The evidence for potency in relation to specific disease severities was not GRADE‐assessed independently from the overall analysis of potency.
NICE says healthcare professionals should discuss risks and benefits, emphasising that the benefits outweigh possible harms when topical corticosteroid are applied correctly. Most participants had a good response to topical corticosteroids, these results were taken from within trials usually GRADE‐assessed to be of moderate certainty. Rates of adverse events such as skin thinning were generally very low, though we GRADE‐assessed this evidence as low or very low certainty.
NICE says prescribe according to lowest acquisition cost. We did not find any data that compared generic and branded topical corticosteroids.
NICE says healthcare professionals should consider treating problem areas of atopic eczema with topical corticosteroids for two consecutive days per week to prevent flares, instead of treating flares as they arise, in children with frequent flares (2 or 3 per month) once the eczema has been controlled. This strategy should be reviewed within three months to six months to assess effectiveness. This review supports weekend (proactive) therapy for the prevention of eczema flares, including in children, however more trials are needed to verify for how long this should be continued (effectiveness evidence for weekend (proactive) therapy GRADE‐assessed as moderate certainty).
This review confirms the research gap identified by NICE regarding a lack of good, long‐term data on topical corticosteroid safety. For example, we GRADE‐assessed the safety data reported for the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables as low or very low certainty.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^116a2u2o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, long-term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application-site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high-income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry-funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti-inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was only possible for short-term outcomes. Patient-reported symptoms NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE-4 inhibitors. NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -2.42 to -0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI. A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Clinician-reported signs NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE-4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness. NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -2.69, 95% CI -3.36, -2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD -1.87, 95% CI -2.69, -1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class-level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI. A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Investigator Global Assessment NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE-4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta-analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants). Local adverse effects NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application-site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions. NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%. NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term (median 3 weeks, range 1–16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' Conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE-4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application-site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term TCS but an increase with longer-term TCS.

### Expert perspectives on key parameters that impact interpretation of randomized clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^111Lccg1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that causes significant morbidity for patients, which when unaddressed may impact psychosocial wellbeing. Prior to 2017, treatment options for AD in the US were largely limited to topical corticosteroids (TCS) and off-label use of immunosuppressants. There was recently a marked increase in AD clinical research, particularly for moderate-to-severe disease. The number of clinical trials initiated in participants with moderate-to-severe AD increased from 1 in 2011 to 38 in 2018 (ClinicalTrials.gov, retrieved 23 February 2021). Dupilumab was the first biologic approved for use in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, and another biologic, tralokinumab, has received authorization in the EU and other health authorities. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are also an emerging treatment option. The AD therapeutic pipeline remains robust, with 20 trials initiated in 2020 alone (ClinicalTrials.gov, retrieved 23 February 2021) and 17 trials initiated to date in 2021 (ClinicalTrials.gov, retrieved 24 August 2021). As our understanding of AD pathophysiology evolves, investigations continue to support the development of new treatments through further elucidation of underlying inflammatory pathways and identification of disease biomarkers.

As with any rapidly developing area of study, various trial designs have been utilized to assess the effectiveness of investigational treatments for AD. Depending on trial timing, guidance from the regulatory bodies may also change, adapting to the evolving treatment landscape. The combination of different trial designs with evolving regulatory guidance poses challenges when interpreting clinical trial results and incorporating evidence into clinical practice. Clinical dermatologists are left to weigh the importance and impact of trial design factors, which may have a material impact on trial outcomes. While indirect treatment comparisons (e.g. network meta-analyses) are often used to derive some insights from different trials, such efforts remain limited by between-trial differences in key study parameters. There are several ongoing efforts to improve the consistency of clinical research in AD, including the Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative, which offers guidance for minimum mandatory outcomes measures and standardizing study design elements in pediatric AD trials. Despite these efforts, important clinical trial design elements remain variable across many phase III studies. As such, those seeking to make evidence-based clinical decisions must evaluate clinical trial results in the context of varying study designs, statistical methodology, and additional parameters that might impact trial efficacy outcomes.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^11342JAE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Future research recommendations — By reviewing the cumulative data addressing AD to date, the panel made 22 key research recommendations, and the guideline main text and eAppendix address research needs for specific interventions. The outlined study designs include a directive to stop split-body studies (where different parts of an individual patient's body are randomized to different treatments and disease activity at each site is compared against each other), noting these have significant limitations including being unable to adequately assess adverse events, equally important to efficacy assessments.

### Dupilumab safety and efficacy up to 1 year in children aged 6 months to 5 years with atopic dermatitis: results from a phase 3 open-label extension study [^116GVwaQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) often experience a high disease burden and have a high risk of persistent disease. Standard-of-care immunosuppressive systemic treatments have been used off-label for AD in pediatric patients despite concerns for suboptimal safety with continuous use and risk of relapse upon discontinuation. The biologic agent dupilumab is the first systemic treatment approved for moderate-to-severe AD in children as young as 6 months. Long-term safety and efficacy data in this patient population are needed to inform continuous AD management.

Objectives

The purpose of this work was to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab treatment up to 1 year in an open-label extension (OLE) study [LIBERTY AD PED-OLE (NCT02612454)] in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD who previously participated in the 16-week, double-blind, phase 3 LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL trial (NCT03346434 part B; parent study) and were subsequently enrolled in PED-OLE.

Methods

In PED-OLE, patients received dupilumab every 4 weeks according to a weight-tiered regimen (body weight ≥ 5 kg to < 15 kg: 200 mg; ≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg: 300 mg).

Results

Data for 142 patients were analyzed, 60 of whom had completed the 52-week visit at time of database lock. Mean age at baseline was 4.1 y [SD, 1.13; range, 1.0–5.9 years]. A majority (78.2%) of patients reported ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), most of which were mild or moderate and transient. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (19.7%), cough (15.5%), and pyrexia (14.1%). One TEAE led to treatment discontinuation (severe urticaria, which resolved in 1 day). By week 52, 36.2% of patients had achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear skin), and 96.6%, 79.3%, and 58.6% had at least 50%, 75%, or 90% improvement, respectively, in Eczema Area and Severity Index scores.

Conclusions

Consistent with results seen in adults, adolescents, and older children (aged 6–11 years), treatment with dupilumab for up to 1 year in children aged 6 months to 5 years with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD demonstrated an acceptable long-term safety profile and sustained efficacy. These results support the long-term continuous use of dupilumab in this patient population.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^117CMeH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), but their use remains widespread.

Objectives

To reach consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD.

Methods

A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if < 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

Results

Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring < 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Conclusions

Based on expert opinion from the IEC, routine use of systemic corticosteroids for AD is generally discouraged and should be reserved for special circumstances.

### Atopic dermatitis-American Academy of Pediatrics… [^111XWq4k]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

We have assembled clinical guidance for atopic dermatitis including signs and symptoms, treatment, referral considerations and additional resources. You will find an interactive image tool, case scenarios, a diagnostic aid for educating and diagnosing patients, a treatment tool, and detailed management guidance. Atopic Dermatitis Overview Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic, relapsing-remitting, inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritic lesions.
- Atopic dermatitis is the most common pediatric skin disorder, with 12-month prevalence rates averaging approximately 10% in resource-rich countries and ranging up to 20% globally.
- Approximately 60% of children with atopic dermatitis develop symptoms in the first year after birth, and 90% develop symptoms by 5 years of age.
- Symptoms of atopic dermatitis typically resolve by adulthood, but between 10% and 30% of children continue to exhibit symptoms of atopic dermatitis as adults.
- Up to 15% of children with atopic dermatitis have severe disease, according to an international study of 12-month prevalence rates. Children who have atopic dermatitis are susceptible to certain bacterial and viral infections.
- The increased adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to the skin and reduced production of antimicrobial peptides may explain the high rates of colonization and infection with these bacteria.
- Altered T-cell function may explain the predisposition of children to develop molluscum contagiosum, eczema herpeticum, and eczema vaccinatum. Clinical Resources Below you will find clinical information and resources to help care for children with atopic dermatitis including risk factors, signs and symptoms and treatment options. Professional Tools & Resources The following tools and resources are designed to aid diagnosis, patient consultation, and patient education. The development of this information was made possible through support from Sanofi and Regeneron.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory disease that commonly presents in the pediatric population. Although definitions and diagnosis of AD have largely been agreed upon, allergists and dermatologists have similar and divergent approaches to the management of AD. This review facilitated integration of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Joint Task Force 2012 AD Practice Parameter and the 2014 American Academy of Dermatology guidelines to highlight the basic principles of AD management and discuss therapies and management of AD from the distinct perspectives of the allergist and dermatologist.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1154LsbF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

We also reported outcomes at baseline, end of treatment, and end of follow‐up regardless of timing. We attempted to pool data at similar time points where possible.

Because many different instruments are used to assess effectiveness of treatments for eczema (Schmitt 2007), we used a hierarchical approach in which we initially extracted data from one instrument per outcome based on the priority order described below. We also made a note of the other instruments reported to maximise our ability to summarise data in pooled analyses of lower‐priority instruments. We planned to compare effect sizes against minimal clinically important differences (MCID) from the literature where possible.

Throughout this review, we used the term 'effectiveness' to describe both 'efficacy' and 'effectiveness'. In many trials it was unclear whether the trial was primarily assessing efficacy or effectiveness and we preferred to avoid making inappropriate judgements.

Safety outcomes of interest reflected the side effects of topical corticosteroids. We defined 'relevant' adverse events as those previously identified as being of particular concern to patients (Li 2017), the side effects listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics for topical corticosteroids used to treat eczema, and original data submissions from the Eczema Priority Setting Partnership, outlining patients' and clinicians' concerns about the safety of topical corticosteroids (Batchelor 2013). We reported data on individual relevant adverse events and their relatedness to the trial drug where available. Where outcomes were assessed during post‐treatment follow‐up, we only included data where participants are retained in their randomised groups. We did not use long‐term safety data from cross‐over or within‐participant trials due to the high likelihood of contamination.

For safety data, we reported adverse events at the end of treatment and the end of follow‐up (where specified).

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^111vkvTP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti‐inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta‐analysis.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection criteria

We included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti‐inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti‐inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient‐reported eczema symptoms, clinician‐reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, long‐term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application‐site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high‐income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry‐funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti‐inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) was only possible for short‐term outcomes.

Patient‐reported symptoms

NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE‐4 inhibitors.

NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.99, 95% CI ‐3.25 to ‐0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐1.57, 95% CI –2.42 to ‐0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI.

A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Clinician‐reported signs

NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE‐4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE‐4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness.

NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐2.69, 95% CI ‐3.36, ‐2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.87, 95% CI ‐2.69, ‐1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class‐level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI.

A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Investigator Global Assessment

NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE‐4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI.

Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta‐analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants).

Local adverse effects

NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application‐site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions.

NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%.

NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term (median 3 weeks, range 1‐16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE‐4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application‐site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term TCS but an increase with longer‐term TCS.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^113Zfx1v]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This trial provides strong evidence that emollient bath additives provide minimal or no additional benefit beyond standard eczema care in the management of eczema in children.

The BATHE trial was an adequately powered trial, with high follow-up rates and good adherence to trial intervention allocations. The study has strong external validity as it was pragmatic in design to reflect normal practice, and, despite the relatively low response rate, participants were broadly reflective of children with eczema seen in primary care. We used a participant reported outcome measure with good validity that has been accepted by international consensus. A participant reported outcome could be biased in favour of finding a positive effect of trial intervention owing to a perception of benefits of treatment. However, the negative result of the trial suggests that this was not the case.

This trial was large; previous reviews of the literature have not been able to draw conclusions owing to the small size of existing trials.

We cannot exclude the possibility of a small benefit among children bathing more than five times a week or among children aged less than 5 years, but differences are sufficiently small to be unlikely to be clinically useful. Furthermore, caution is needed in interpreting these underpowered subgroup analyses as statistically significant results might arise because the data have been tested multiple times rather than because a genuine difference exists between the groups.

These findings are timely for clinicians and prescribing advisers, as prescribing guidelines vary widely in their advice on the use of bath additives, and pressure on budgets has led to formularies becoming increasingly restrictive. Reviews have estimated that bath additives might contribute to up to one third of the costs of eczema in the United Kingdom. Our findings provide evidence that can contribute to effective prescribing in this area, where there is currently little research evidence to guide decision making. These findings are also useful for families with members who have eczema as they have more certainty about directing their efforts towards more effective treatments.

Our findings are only relevant to the use of emollient bath additives. More research is needed into optimal regimens for other emollients, although there is strong evidence that regular use of leave-on emollients prevents flare-ups in eczema, and there is widespread clinical consensus around the role of emollients as soap substitutes.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^111vNTp1]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD) — general skin-directed management recommendations include: "Bathing should be frequent (daily to every other day) and short, with lukewarm water and gentle cleanser"; "Avoid products with added fragrance, dyes, or essential oils, as these are potential irritants and/or contact allergens"; "Topical anti-inflammatories (corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, etc) should be applied once to twice daily to active eczema patches" and "Topical medications should not be mixed with topical emollients unless specifically instructed, as this dilutes the potency of the medication"; "Moisturizers should be applied liberally to the entire body skin surface at least daily in patients with atopic dermatitis, especially after a bath or shower"; and "Proactive" treatment with topical anti-inflammatories can reduce flares of recurrent AD.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^113pyhRb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use the topical corticosteroid?

Timing of application of topical corticosteroid (2 trials in 158 participants)
Wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials in 221 participants)
Topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin (1 trial in 45 participants)
Topical corticosteroid applied before emollient versus topical corticosteroid applied after emollient (1 trial in 46 participants)
Time between application of emollient and steroid (no trials)

*Key comparisons for which summary of findings tables are presented.

Several included trials tested a combination of the above, reflecting how topical corticosteroids might be used in clinical practice, therefore, are found in more than one results section. For instance, Rafanelli 1993 compares a newer, second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) applied once daily with a moderate‐potency, older topical corticosteroid (clobetasone butyrate) used twice daily. As a result, Rafanelli 1993 is included in three separate meta‐analyses; 1. potency versus moderate topical corticosteroid; 2. second‐generation versus older topical corticosteroid; and 3. frequency of application, and the comparison of interest changes for each.

Trials that compared treatment strategies designed to treat eczema flares were generally short‐term (range 1 to 6 weeks) and rarely conducted any follow‐up. Trials included in the comparison of weekend (proactive) therapy with topical corticosteroid versus no topical corticosteroid, where the intervention aimed to prolong time to new flare (i.e. prevent relapse), were longer in duration. These trials involved a two‐ to four‐week stabilisation phase where both groups received topical corticosteroid, followed by a 16‐ to 20‐week maintenance phase, with the exceptions of Fukuie 2012 and Fukuie 2016, which observed participants at 6 and 12 months, respectively.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^1156F5bs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We were unable to reach consensus on many issues related to dosing and duration of systemic CS use. However, the clear majority of participants (94%) agreed that the use of systemic CS should be limited to short periods of time. This is in keeping with clinical practice guidelines. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Our group did not reach consensus on a definition of short‐term use. The European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis/European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology task force position statement on the treatment of AD suggests that a typical regimen of systemic CS might be methylprednisolone 0.5 mg kg⁻¹ daily for 1–2 weeks tapered over 1 month, 3 but there is no RCT evidence for the safety or efficacy of this specific regimen.

Most respondents (but not enough for consensus) agreed that systemic CS should never be used in children. Further, while the circumstances agreed upon for the use of systemic CS in AD can be applied to patients of all ages, they are less likely to be applicable for young children. Most children will have fewer comorbidities complicating the use of immunomodulatory agents such as ciclosporin. As such, while systemic CS should be used rarely for severe AD in general, their use should be even more limited in children, particularly given concerns regarding infection, growth delay and increased rates of obesity. 18

### Systematic review of self-management interventions for people with eczema [^111BKVqz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 8 and the protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015025314). 9

Information sources and search strategy

We searched relevant databases (MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Embase, CINAHL and Global Resource for EczemA Trials, 10 from inception to August 2016) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions (delivered to children with eczema, caregivers of children with eczema and adults with eczema) that promote self‐management. With the aid of a medical information scientist, a search strategy was developed that included the following terms: eczema (and its synonyms atopic eczema and atopic dermatitis), self‐care, self‐management, education, patient education, action plan, treatment plan and management plan (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information). Authors were contacted regarding further trial publications and any unpublished studies and/or unpublished data. Forward and backward searching was also conducted within the reference lists of all included studies.

References from the searches were downloaded into Endnote (Endnote X7, Thomson Reuters, New York, NY, U.S. A.). Two people independently screened all titles and abstracts using the eligibility criteria. All included studies were accessed in full and were screened by two reviewers independently. The reasons for exclusion of all full‐text trials were recorded and any disagreements were resolved by the research team.

Eligibility criteria

We restricted our search to RCTs of interventions that promote patient/carer self‐management in children (and/or their caregivers, including parents) and adults with atopic eczema/atopic dermatitis, compared with no intervention, usual care, or an alternative intervention. The outcomes of primary interest were effects on eczema severity and quality of life.

There is no agreed definition of self‐management. Therefore, based on the relevant literature, 11, 12, 13, 14 we defined a self‐management intervention as one that included one or more of the features listed in Table 1. If a trial included patients with other skin diseases, and the data for eczema could not be analysed separately, it was excluded. As our main outcomes of interest were eczema severity and quality of life, we excluded trials that did not include these outcomes.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^113sQUET]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use the topical corticosteroid?

Timing of application of topical corticosteroid
Wet wrap versus no wet wrap
Topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin
Topical corticosteroid applied before emollient versus topical corticosteroid applied after emollient
Time between application of emollient and steroid

We also included combinations of any of the strategies above (e.g. short burst of potent topical corticosteroids versus longer duration of mild topical corticosteroids).

Since the focus of this review was to compare different strategies of using topical corticosteroids, we excluded the following comparisons.

Topical corticosteroid compared with either no treatment, vehicle or placebo (unless it was specifically assessing an alternative regimen such as weekend (proactive) therapy)
Topical corticosteroid compared with another topical corticosteroid of the same potency and preparation but no differences in how they were used. We developed a hierarchy of sources to assign potency to each topical corticosteroid (Table 9). Potencies were most frequently determined using the British National Formulary 2018 and WHO 1997. If we could not establish the potency using these sources, we reviewed regional guidelines and the wider scientific literature, and consulted regional experts until we could reach a decision.
Topical corticosteroid compared with different topical treatments such as calcineurin inhibitors or emollients
Topical corticosteroid compared with systemic treatments
Topical corticosteroid treatment in conjunction with an eczema treatment used for the most severe cases of eczema as defined by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); that is, phototherapy and systemic therapy (NICE 2018). This was because it would have been difficult to detect any differences in efficacy or safety between the topical corticosteroid strategies when such treatments were also used.

Classification of topical corticosteroid potency

Types of outcome measures

We assessed both effectiveness and safety to reflect the overall aim of this review.

The effectiveness outcomes of interest for this review were focused on the two domains for which the international Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative recommended core outcome measurement instruments, that is, clinician‐reported signs and patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (HOME).

There is currently no agreed standardised timing for effectiveness outcome assessments for eczema trials. Therefore, to assess treatment effects in a consistent way, we focused on short‐term effectiveness outcomes reported between one and four weeks (taking the earliest available time point within that range), medium‐term effectiveness outcomes between 12 and 16 weeks (taking the closest time point to 12 weeks), and long‐term effectiveness as the longest time point longer than 16 weeks.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Dupilumab for moderate-severe atopic dermatitis — In patients 6 months of age or older with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis refractory, intolerant, or unable to use mid-potency or greater topical treatment, the JTF panel recommends adding dupilumab over continued standard topical treatment without dupilumab (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). Supporting evidence from a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that adding dupilumab led to large improvements in multiple patient-important outcomes without an increase in serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation, although conjunctivitis was higher with dupilumab.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^114HBu2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted.

Objectives

To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short-term measurements (defined as less than three months follow-up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study). Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate-to-severe eczema after short-term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low-quality evidence). When short-term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate-to-severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (mean improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain. All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low-quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long-term control. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low-quality evidence). There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate-to-severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all. Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — systemic therapies (biologics and JAK inhibitors): The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) found that, versus conventional standard topical treatment alone, adding dupilumab or tralokinumab improved multiple patient-important outcomes, with no clear increase in serious adverse events or discontinuations, although conjunctivitis was higher than with placebo. Compared with dupilumab, tralokinumab was one category lower in multiple patient-important outcomes and is approved for AD in ages 12 years and older, while dupilumab is approved for children/adults aged 6 months and older for AD. For oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, the NMA reported that the benefits and harms of abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib varied by drug and increased with dose; although mild common harms increased with dose, assessment of less common serious harms was limited by short study duration (16 weeks typically).

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^113cPtmB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have tremendous impact on quality of life for affected children and adults. First-line therapy for acute management of AD includes topical therapies such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor crisaborole. Topical agents have remained the mainstay therapy for decades; however, there has been a longstanding need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of adverse effects with long-term use. Given the ongoing advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, there are novel targets for pharmacological intervention. We are now in an unprecedented time with more than 40 topical treatments in the pipeline for AD in addition to many developments and treatments on the horizon. This review summarizes selected therapeutic topical agents in later phases of development that target various aspects in the pathogenesis of AD such as Janus kinase inhibition (ruxolitinib and delgocitinib), phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition (roflumilast and difamilast), aryl hydrocarbon modulation (tapinarof), and modulation of the microbiome. We also review novel targeted therapies that are in early phase clinical trials, including AMTX-100, BEN-2293, and PRN473. Preliminary findings on efficacy and tolerability of most of these agents are promising, but further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of these novel agents against the current standard of care.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^116NCVkP]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Childhood eczema (also known as atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) is a common condition that can have a substantial impact on quality of life for children and their families. Guidelines suggest that complete emollient therapy forms the mainstay of treatment for eczema and should be used regularly with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, used in addition for flare-ups.

Emollients are thought to act by providing a barrier over the skin, decreasing moisture loss, and protecting against skin irritants. Emollients are applied in one of three ways: leave-on, where emollients are directly applied to the skin; soap substitutes, where emollients are used instead of soap or other wash products; and bath additives, comprising oil or emulsifiers, or both designed to be added to bath water and thought to leave a film of oil over the skin. Some emollients can be used in more than one way. We therefore use the term "emollient bath additives" or "bath additives" rather than bath emollients to emphasise the differences between the three methods of application in recognition that products may have more than one method of application.

Although there is evidence for the need for leave-on emollientsand widespread clinical consensus around soap substitutes, there is less agreement about the potential additional benefits of bath additivesand a dearth of evidence on their effectiveness. Systematic reviews have found no evidence of effectiveness, and one small study suggested bath additives might actually worsen eczema outcomes. Bath additives are, however, widely prescribed at a cost of more than £23m ($33m; €26m) annually to the National Health Service in England.

We determined both the clinical effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of including emollient bath additives in the standard management of eczema in children.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^117CxEZe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) definition and epidemiology — AD is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children, but also affects many adults, follows a relapsing course, and is often associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgE) levels and a personal or family history of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma; atopic eczema is synonymous with AD. AD onset is most common between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the eruption in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age, and while the majority have resolution by adulthood, 10% to 30% do not. AD has a complex pathogenesis involving genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors that lead to a dysfunctional skin barrier and dysregulation of the immune system, notable clinical findings include erythema, edema, xerosis, erosions/excoriations, oozing and crusting, and lichenification, and pruritus is a hallmark of the condition that contributes substantially to disease burden.

Allergen immunotherapy for atopic dermatitis — use and evidence: "In patients with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis refractory, intolerant, or unable to use mid-potency topical treatment, the JTF panel suggests adding allergen immunotherapy to standard topical treatment over not adding (conditional recommendation, moderate-certainty evidence)". Conditions to consider include that "Allergic comorbidities that will likely be responsive to immunotherapy (eg, allergic rhinitis, or asthma with relevant sensitization) may lead to benefits for multiple diseases and therefore favor AIT", "Values and preferences regarding SCIT vs SLIT (eg, convenience, age, travel plans)", and the "plausibility of allergen sensitization to reflect allergy". The linked review included "23 RCTs (11 SCIT and 12 SLIT)" with "1957 adult and pediatric patients (median of study mean ages, 19 years; range of means, 4–34 years)", mostly to "HDMs (D pteronyssinus or D farinae)", with AIT "typically for 12 (range 3–36) months", added to "standard topical therapy including TCSs and moisturizers", and "Most of the studies included polysensitized patients in addition to HDM sensitization".

### Omalizumab for treatment of refractory severe atopic dermatitis. A pediatric perspective [^117D5uyS]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody, targeting Fc receptor of IgE, approved for the treatment of allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria. Its utility in atopic dermatitis appears controversial from data in literature since the molecule is well tolerated but it seems less effective than other medications used in adult patients (eg, Dupilumab). At present, the use of Dupilumab is not approved in pediatric patients therefore there are no second level treatments available in this age group. Here we report two clinical cases of patients (15 and 16years old) suffering from both atopic dermatitis and asthma, treated with Omalizumab. Our experience suggests that atopic eczema of young patients with allergic comorbidities can benefit from asthma treatment with Omalizumab observing improvement on both conditions.

### Systemic treatments in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients up to 12 years of age: real-world treatment outcomes from the PEDISTAD registry [^112GDw2E]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic systemic disease, can cause intense skin itching and negatively impact sleep, mood, and quality of life (QoL) for patients and families.

Methods

PEDISTAD is an ongoing, 10-year, observational registry describing disease characteristics, atopic comorbidities, and treatment patterns in pediatric patients (aged < 12 years at enrollment) with moderate-to-severe AD. This 3-year interim analysis evaluates clinician-reported and caregiver-reported/patient-reported outcomes (Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI], percent body surface area affected, worst itching/scratching, Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index, and Dermatitis Family Impact) in children treated with dupilumab, methotrexate, and/or cyclosporine. Outcomes were assessed as change from therapy start to last observation (either data cutoff date or treatment discontinuation).

Results

Mean (± SE) EASI scores at the time of the last 3-year interim observation were consistent with mild disease in the dupilumab cohort and moderate disease in the methotrexate and cyclosporine cohorts. Improvements in pruritus were numerically greater in the dupilumab cohort relative to the methotrexate and cyclosporine cohorts, while improvements in QoL were similar in the dupilumab and methotrexate cohorts, with no significant change in the cyclosporine cohort. Rates of AD exacerbation were numerically lower with dupilumab treatment relative to methotrexate treatment which were numerically lower than cyclosporine treatment. Dupilumab discontinuation rates were numerically lower relative to methotrexate which were numerically lower than cyclosporine.

Conclusions

This PEDISTAD 3-year interim analysis of dupilumab, methotrexate, and cyclosporine treatment in children with AD demonstrates numerically greater improvements in AD signs, symptoms and QoL with dupilumab treatment relative to methotrexate and cyclosporine [Video abstract and graphical abstract available].

### Atopic dermatitis yardstick: practical recommendations for an evolving therapeutic landscape [^115dmaij]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The implementation of treatment guidelines for atopic dermatitis is challenging, in part because of different guidance documents being used by different groups of specialists and in part because the language of guidelines often reflects the evidence base rather than the practical "how to". The Atopic Dermatitis Yardstick is part of a series developed in response to the need to proactively address the loss of disease control for atopic illnesses at all levels of severity. It presents a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in therapy for the patient with inadequately controlled or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis. Patient profiles, based on current guidelines and the authors' combined clinical experience, provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide to aid physicians in helping their patients achieve the goal of clear to almost clear. The intent is not to replace guidelines but to complement their recommendations incorporating the latest research and therapies.

### Capturing and reporting topical treatment use in childhood eczema: lessons for data collection in eczema trials [^113q4L5w]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCS) prevent and treat flares in eczema. However, topical treatment use is poorly recorded and reported in clinical trials. There is no clear consensus of how best to capture and summarize topical treatment use.

Objectives

To explore different ways of capturing and reporting topical treatment use in childhood eczema.

Methods

This was a secondary data analysis using 450 participants from the Best Emollients for Eczema (BEE) trial. Participants were allocated to use one type of emollient (lotion, cream, gel or ointment) 'twice daily and when required' for 16 weeks. Otherwise, clinical management remained unchanged. Parents completed weekly questions about topical therapy use and eczema symptoms. Two versions of topical treatment use questionnaires were used. The first (n = 202, 44.9%) asked parents to report treatment use on days 1–7, starting completion on the day they were randomized. The second (n = 248, 55.1%) reported use by day of the week (Monday to Sunday), starting completion the first Monday after randomization. Both underwent patient and public involvement review but the second version was tested more thoroughly using cognitive interviewing techniques, following parent feedback that questions on the first version were confusing. Descriptive statistics compared questionnaire completion and differences in emollient and TCS use.

Results

Overall, questionnaire completion for both emollient and TCS use decreased with time, but at weeks 1 and 16, it was 84.7% (381/450) and 58.9% (265/450) for emollient use, and 94.2% (424/450) and 80.4% (362/450) for TCS use, respectively. Fewer emollient use questionnaires were completed with the first (33.5%, 1082/3232 patient-weeks) than the second (87.9%, 3489/3968 patient-weeks) version (P < 0.001). TCS use questionnaire completion were similar for both (84.9%, 2744/3232 patient-weeks and 87.4%, 3468/3968 patient-weeks, P = 0.002). We present different ways of summarizing topical treatment use.

Conclusions

Although questionnaire completion was similar for TCS use, emollient-use data completeness was higher in the second version. When designing questionnaires, balancing the detail and complexity of questions is important, especially if being collected as a secondary outcome measure. Numerous ways of summarizing the same data can provide different information. Future collection and reporting of treatment use should reflect specific trial aims.

### Treatment of atopic dermatitis-AAP… [^114oUvfv]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Parents should be encouraged to establish healthy sleep routines as part of the treatment plan. Adequate sleep is necessary for optimal growth and development, promotes mental health, and improves quality of life for the patient and family. Reducing Itch The chief way to reduce itch is to address xerosis with the daily application of emollients. When the disease is active, however, administer a bedtime dose of a first-generation antihistamine to provide sedation, improve sleep, and reduce scratching. Daytime doses may occasionally be needed but should be lower. Wet-wrap therapy may also be useful during severe flares.
- **Infants**: Use a low-potency preparation.
- **Young children**: Use a low-potency preparation or, if necessary, a mid-potency preparation.
- **Older children and adolescents**: Use a mid-potency preparation; a high-potency agent may be needed for resistant, non-facial areas during a flare.
- Twice weekly 5- to 10-minute baths to which standard household bleach is added
- Use of a sodium hypochlorite body wash in the bath or shower.
- Intranasal mupirocin If there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection, consider administering an oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days.

If no improvement is noted within 48 hours, consider a skin swab for bacterial culture to assess for resistant organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant.

### Emollients to prevent pediatric eczema: a randomized clinical trial [^117UZtKy]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Atopic dermatitis (AD) imposes a global health burden for children and is a risk factor for developing food allergy and asthma. Few studies have evaluated emollient intervention for primary AD prevention in infants not selected for risk.

Objective

To determine whether emollient intervention in infants not selected for risk reduces AD incidence by age 24 months.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, decentralized pragmatic clinical trial was conducted that involving 1247 infant-parent dyads recruited from 25 community-based pediatric and family medicine clinics that are members of 4 statewide practice-based research networks. Participants were recruited from July 2018 to February 2021, with follow-up completed through February 2023.

Intervention

Dyads were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: a daily full-body emollient application daily moisturizer group starting by age 9 weeks or a control group that refrained from emollient use.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was physician-diagnosed AD recorded in the patient's medical record by age 24 months. Participants completed quarterly electronic surveys to report adverse events and alert the team if an AD diagnosis had been made. Trained research coordinators abstracted participants' medical records.

Results

Of 1247 infants, 553 (44.3%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at randomization was 23.9 (16.3) days. At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of AD was 36.1% (SE, 2.1) in the daily moisturizer group and 43.0% (SE 2.1) in the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73–0.97; P = 0.02), and the magnitude of effect was larger in the population not at high risk of AD (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–0.90; P = 0.01). The protective effect was significantly modified by the presence of a dog in the home (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50–0.90; P = 0.01). There were no between-group differences in cutaneous adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that daily emollient application beginning before age 9 weeks in a representative US population not selected for risk reduced the cumulative incidence of AD at age 24 months. Implementing this approach to pediatric skin care may be a feasible way to reduce the burden of AD in US communities.

### Allergy and dermatology US treatment guidelines review for adults with atopic dermatitis [^111SpHQH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic condition that involves a complex interplay between the immune system and the skin that manifests mainly as pruritus and an eczematous eruption. In the United States, patients with AD are typically managed by primary care physicians, dermatologists, and allergists. Both the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) have independently developed guidelines for management of AD. The most recent AAD guidelines, published from 2022 to 2024, focus on adults with AD, not children, and are an update of the AD clinical guidelines that were published in 2014. In 2023, the JTFPP expanded on its 2012 AD Practice Parameter, with updated guidelines for both children and adults.,

In 2015 Mohan and Lio, successfully compared and contrasted the AD management guidelines put forth by the 2014 AAD work group and the 2012 JTFPP representing the AAAAI, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The management of AD has changed drastically since the review article of Mohan and Lio, especially related to the treatment of AD with medications such as biologics and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Therefore, we are providing an updated comparison of the most recent dermatology and allergy AD guidelines to identify key similarities and differences in management of this condition in adults only, as there had not been a pediatric update from the AAD as of the time at which this review was performed.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Ch22T]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this Cochrane systematic review and NMA of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema, we found potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as among the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema. Our confidence in the findings was low or moderate, largely due to concerns about selective reporting; and we were not able to reliably rank the comparative effectiveness of these three treatments. Safety data were limited, but local application site reactions were most common with tacrolimus 0.1% and the PDE‐4 inhibitor crisaborole 2%. Although skin thinning was not increased with short‐term (< 16 weeks) use of any TCS potency, skin thinning was reported as an adverse effect in 0.3% participants treated with TCS for 6 to 60 months.

These findings largely relate to short‐term use of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for treating non‐severe eczema in adults living in high‐income countries. There is a need for more work to identify longer‐term outcomes, to evaluate effectiveness and safety in young children, in whom eczema is most common, and in low‐middle income countries. For example, recent trials have reported no impact of intermittent mild–moderate TCS on young children's growth over up to 5 years, but significant growth suppression when a proactive potent TCS regimen is used in infants with eczema. We did not formally evaluate cost effectiveness, but it is worthwhile noting that per gram, TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE‐4 inhibitors and AHR activators typically cost 4–20 times more than TCS.

Our findings are broadly consistent with previous literature, including a recent NMA of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema. However, there are some differences in emphasis between the two NMA findings, including slightly lower efficacy ranking of JAK inhibitors by Chu et al. and a different focus of adverse event outcomes. Inclusion criteria differed between the two NMAs, and there were some differences in methodology. For example, the review of Chu et al. excluded within‐participant trials, and included complementary therapy, moisturisers, non‐licensed treatment regimens and secondary prevention of eczema flares using regular anti‐inflammatory treatment which were not part of this Cochrane review. This is likely to explain any differences in rankings between the two NMAs, for comparable outcomes. Our finding that TCS rarely cause skin thinning is consistent with the conclusions of a separate Cochrane review evaluating strategies for intermittent short‐term treatment of eczema with TCS.

### The use of alternative medicine in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [^114CGXmU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Alternative medicine has been defined as forms of therapy or examination that have no scientific basis and for which no effective or diagnostic reliability has been demonstrated by scientific methods. The use of complementary or alternative medicine is increasing and controlled clinical trials on the subject are few. We performed a questionnaire-based study of 80 pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis. This questionnaire assessed the duration of treatment, the reason(s) for trying alternative therapy, the approximate cost and the success of the treatment, the duration of the childhood eczema, and whether the child had ever required hospital admission for eczema. Of the total, 34 (42.5%) patients had used alternative medicine. Herbal remedies and homeopathy were used most often. Most treatments were reported to show no benefit and in three instances deterioration was reported. This study has prompted us to enquire routinely regarding alternative medicine use. Alternative therapies are subject to minimal regulation and have been associated with serious side effects. We would recommend enquiries regarding alternative medicine use in all pediatric dermatology patients.

### Dupilumab in children aged 6 months to younger than 6 years with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^113jhcdD]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current systemic treatments for children younger than 6 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that is uncontrolled with topical therapies might have suboptimal efficacy and safety. Dupilumab is approved for older children and adults with atopic dermatitis and for other type 2 inflammatory conditions. We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant low-potency topical corticosteroids in children aged 6 months to younger than 6 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 trial was conducted in 31 hospitals, clinics, and academic institutions in Europe and North America. Eligible patients were aged 6 months to younger than 6 years, with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score 3–4) diagnosed according to consensus criteria of the American Academy of Dermatology, and an inadequate response to topical corticosteroids. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous placebo or dupilumab (bodyweight ≥ 5 kg to < 15 kg: 200 mg; bodyweight ≥ 15 kg to < 30 kg: 300 mg) every 4 weeks plus low-potency topical corticosteroids (hydrocortisone acetate 1% cream) for 16 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by age, baseline bodyweight, and region. Patient allocation was done via a central interactive web response system, and treatment allocation was masked. The primary endpoint at week 16 was the proportion of patients with IGA score 0–1 (clear or almost clear skin). The key secondary endpoint (coprimary endpoint for the EU and EU reference market) at week 16 was the proportion of patients with at least a 75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75). Primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned patients, as randomly assigned) and safety analyses were done in all patients who received any study drug. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03346434.

Findings

Between June 30, 2020, and Feb 12, 2021, 197 patients were screened for eligibility, 162 of whom were randomly assigned to receive dupilumab (n = 83) or placebo (n = 79) plus topical corticosteroids. At week 16, significantly more patients in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group had IGA 0–1 (23 [28%] vs three [4%], difference 24% [95% CI 13–34]; p < 0.0001) and EASI-75 (44 [53%] vs eight [11%], difference 42% [95% CI 29–55]; p < 0.0001). Overall prevalence of adverse events was similar in the dupilumab group (53 [64%] of 83 patients) and placebo group (58 [74%] of 78 patients). Conjunctivitis incidence was higher in the dupilumab group (four [5%]) than the placebo group (none). No dupilumab-related adverse events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation.

Interpretation

Dupilumab significantly improved atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms versus placebo in children younger than 6 years. Dupilumab was well tolerated and showed an acceptable safety profile, similar to results in older children and adults.

### The adverse effect profile of oral azathioprine in pediatric atopic dermatitis, and recommendations for monitoring [^111k2c8h]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Assessment of posttreatment effects of azathioprine therapy for pediatric AD is outside the scope of our study. The long-term safety profile is unknown, and this fact should be discussed with families before starting azathioprine. Azathioprine use is associated with a range of hematologic, hepatotoxic, clinical, and long-term carcinogenic adverse effects including nonmelanoma skin cancer. As with any systemic therapy, concerns have to be balanced against the need to treat refractory eczema with its attendant effects on longitudinal growthand neurodevelopment.
