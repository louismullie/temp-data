## Question

Is it ok to guve jardiance wuth AKI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is ok to give Jardiance (empagliflozin) with acute kidney injury (AKI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether we are talking about initiating Jardiance during an active AKI versus continuing it in someone who develops AKI on therapy. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic kidney effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and how to distinguish the expected eGFR dip from true AKI. Next, I will review trial data on AKI risk, recognize limitations in acutely ill populations, and align with regulatory labels and guidelines on withholding during acute illness. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations on holding, when to restart, monitoring, and special risk groups, making sure I don't overgeneralize from chronic CKD data to acute AKI scenarios.

> Let me first clarify the clinical scenarios, because the management differs; the question can mean either starting Jardiance de novo during an AKI episode or deciding whether to continue Jardiance in a patient who has developed AKI while on it, and I should confirm that AKI represents an acute decline in kidney function often driven by volume depletion, hemodynamic instability, sepsis, nephrotoxins, or obstruction, where drug management typically follows "sick day" principles to reduce further kidney stress.

> Next, I will examine mechanism and acute renal hemodynamics; empagliflozin causes osmotic diuresis and natriuresis and increases distal sodium delivery, enhancing tubuloglomerular feedback with afferent vasoconstriction, which can produce an early, small, reversible dip in eGFR that stabilizes and improves after discontinuation, a pharmacodynamic effect distinct from tubular injury, and I need to ensure I don't mislabel this expected dip as pathologic AKI in otherwise stable patients after initiation [^112WNig6] [^112GX1BU] [^115h2ND8].

> Now, let me review the risk of AKI with SGLT2 inhibitors overall; meta-analyses of major outcome trials and real-world cohorts consistently show a lower risk of AKI events with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with controls, including empagliflozin, but hold on, I should verify that these trials generally excluded patients with active acute illness or hemodynamic instability, so this protective signal applies to chronic use rather than use during an active AKI episode [^111ohiNz] [^114YJV1X] [^112bvvTt].

> I need to check regulatory and guideline positions specific to acute illness; the FDA label warns about volume depletion and postmarketing AKI reports and advises withholding Jardiance in temporary clinical situations predisposing to ketoacidosis and with reduced oral intake, which typically coincide with AKI risk states, while the UK Kidney Association explicitly recommends temporarily withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness, and KDIGO CKD guidance similarly acknowledges holding them during intercurrent illness that could precipitate AKI [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm].

> Let me distinguish expected eGFR changes from true AKI; an early eGFR decline within weeks of initiation that is modest, typically less than 30% from baseline and asymptomatic, is expected and should not trigger discontinuation on its own, but wait, if the decline exceeds about 30%, is rapid, or is accompanied by hypotension, oliguria, or clinical hypovolemia, I should verify that this pattern suggests true AKI and warrants holding the drug and evaluating for precipitating factors [^115nTXzm] [^112GX1BU] [^115h2ND8].

> Applying this to management, during an active AKI episode I should double-check that the prudent action is to withhold empagliflozin immediately while addressing volume status, nephrotoxins, and hemodynamics, then reassess kidney function and clinical stability before resumption, consistent with "sick day" guidance and label precautions for volume depletion and intercurrent illness [^115nTXzm] [^114mmSiF].

> Regarding when to restart or initiate after AKI, I should confirm that resumption or new initiation is reasonable once the AKI has resolved and the patient is euvolemic with adequate oral intake and stable blood pressure, with eGFR thresholds guided by indication: for glycemic control, efficacy wanes below eGFR 30, whereas for heart failure and CKD risk reduction empagliflozin can be used down to eGFR 20, and I should recheck creatinine/eGFR within 2–4 weeks to ensure the expected hemodynamic dip remains within acceptable bounds to avoid premature discontinuation [^113Lbc3c] [^115wqfkX] [^112kjQJi] [^115nTXzm] [^112GX1BU].

> I need to ensure special risks are mitigated; elderly patients, those with eGFR below 60, or on loop diuretics have higher susceptibility to symptomatic hypotension and AKI from volume depletion, so let me consider reducing concurrent diuretic doses and reinforcing "sick day" rules, and I should also be vigilant for euglycemic ketoacidosis during acute illness or reduced intake and follow the label's advice to hold and resume only once stable [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm] [^112WNig6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that if the creatinine bump was small one might continue through a mild AKI, but hold on, that small early dip pertains to initiation in stable patients, not to an established AKI where volume depletion or hemodynamic stress may be present; while emerging acute-illness trials in MI and COVID populations suggest SGLT2 inhibitors can be started safely in selected hospitalized patients, these studies were not designed to support continuation during active AKI, so I should not generalize them to override sick-day withholding in true AKI [^1158GshT] [^117TamWh].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the course is to temporarily stop Jardiance during active AKI or intercurrent illness with volume depletion, treat the precipitant, and restart once kidney function stabilizes and the patient is euvolemic with adequate intake, using appropriate eGFR thresholds for the indication and early follow-up labs to interpret the expected hemodynamic dip correctly rather than as injury [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm] [^113Lbc3c] [^112GX1BU].

No — Jardiance (empagliflozin) **should not be initiated or continued** in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to volume depletion [^114mmSiF] and hemodynamic effects [^112GX1BU] that can cause or worsen AKI. Current guidelines recommend **temporarily withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness or AKI** [^115nTXzm] and resuming only after renal function has recovered and the patient is clinically stable [^114mmSiF]. If AKI develops while taking Jardiance, stop the drug immediately, correct volume status, and monitor renal function until recovery.

---

## Pharmacological considerations in AKI

Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 [^112WNig6], increasing urinary glucose and sodium excretion and causing osmotic diuresis [^114mmSiF], volume depletion, and hemodynamic changes [^112GX1BU] that **may precipitate or worsen AKI**, especially in patients with impaired renal function or those on diuretics.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA warnings**: Empagliflozin can cause volume depletion [^114mmSiF] and acute transient creatinine rises [^112GX1BU]; postmarketing reports include AKI requiring hospitalization or dialysis [^114mmSiF].

- **UK Kidney Association**: Temporarily withhold SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness or AKI; resume only when clinically stable and renal function has recovered [^115nTXzm].

- **KDIGO**: Emphasizes careful management of nephrotoxic drugs and close monitoring in AKI [^1128f7Be] [^111kB82j].

---

## Risks associated with empagliflozin in AKI

- **Volume depletion**: Osmotic diuresis [^112WNig6] can worsen hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion [^114mmSiF].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Reduced intraglomerular pressure can acutely lower GFR [^115h2ND8] and worsen AKI [^112GX1BU].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Risk of hyperkalemia and other abnormalities.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: Increased risk, especially in acute illness or reduced insulin states [^114mmSiF] [^112CaRXS].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Patient with AKI | Immediately discontinue empagliflozin; correct volume status; monitor renal function until recovery [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm] |
| Patient recovering from AKI | Consider restarting only after full renal recovery and clinical stability [^115nTXzm] [^114mmSiF] |
| Patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without AKI | Empagliflozin may be beneficial [^116BsyB6] for renal and cardiovascular outcomes [^112kjQJi], but monitor renal function closely [^113Lbc3c] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Renal function monitoring**: Regularly check serum creatinine and eGFR [^114mmSiF].

- **Volume status assessment**: Monitor for hypovolemia and correct promptly [^115nTXzm].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Check potassium and other electrolytes regularly.

- **Patient education**: Instruct patients to stop empagliflozin during acute illness or dehydration and seek medical attention [^114mmSiF] [^115nTXzm].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Empagliflozin **should not be initiated or continued in patients with AKI** because of the risks of volume depletion, hemodynamic instability, and electrolyte disturbances. Temporarily **withhold during acute illness or AKI** [^115nTXzm], and resume only after renal recovery and clinical stability. If AKI occurs during therapy, stop the drug, correct volume status, and monitor renal function until recovery.

### Jardiance [^114mmSiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and others at risk for ketoacidosis, if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who show signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Jardiance, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Jardiance.

Withhold Jardiance, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Jardiance when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Jardiance and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Jardiance can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension.

### Jardiance [^112GX1BU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory test abnormalities have been observed in clinical trials involving Jardiance.

- **Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR**: Initiation of Jardiance therapy results in an increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in eGFR within weeks, which then stabilize. In a trial involving adults with moderate renal impairment, larger mean changes were observed. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, the increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR generally did not exceed 0.1 mg/dL and -9.0 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, at Week 4. These changes reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may contribute to the renal function changes observed with Jardiance.

- **Increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)**: Dose-related increases in LDL-C were observed in adults treated with Jardiance. LDL-C levels increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, Jardiance 10 mg, and Jardiance 25 mg, respectively. The mean baseline LDL-C levels ranged from 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across the treatment groups.

- **Increase in hematocrit**: In a pool of four placebo-controlled trials in adults, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in the placebo group but increased by 2.8% in both the Jardiance 10 mg and Jardiance 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with initially normal hematocrit levels had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, Jardiance 10 mg, and Jardiance 25 mg, respectively.

6.2 Postmarketing experience has identified additional adverse reactions.

- **Recommendations for implementation**: Acute kidney injury (AKI), hypovolaemia, and potassium. We recommend that individuals initiated on an SGLT-2 inhibitor do not routinely require an early assessment of kidney function or potassium following initiation of treatment (Grade 1C). We suggest that if an individual has a kidney function assessment within the first few weeks post initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor, a decline in eGFR needs to be interpreted with caution and in the context of an expected drug effect to avoid unwarranted discontinuation of treatment (Grade 2B). We suggest that individuals on diuretics are counselled on the symptoms of hypovolaemia and advised to seek medical attention if they develop any such symptoms after starting SGLT-2 inhibition (Grade 2B). We suggest that clinicians consider an early clinical review and, if appropriate, a diuretic or antihypertensive dose reduction in individuals they consider at high risk of hypovolaemia (Grade 2C). We recommend that SGLT-2 inhibitors are temporarily withheld during acute illness (Grade 1C).

- **Rationale**: SGLT-2 inhibitors have proven benefit in relation to reducing the rate of long-term decline in kidney function in certain groups of people with CKD. The means by which they provide this benefit may involve changes to intraglomerular pressure and reduction in hyperfiltration at an individual glomerulus level. This can result in a reduction in eGFR over the initial few weeks following initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors, which is relatively small, largely reversible and should not usually be seen as an adverse effect.

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^116BsyB6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

- **Results**: Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% relative risk reduction.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112kjQJi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY was published by the EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study relates to chronic kidney disease. The trial aimed to investigate the role of empagliflozin in patients with CKD.

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, RCT.
- **Population**: 6,609 patients (2,192 female, 4,417 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with CKD having an eGFR ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Polycystic kidney disease; receipt of a kidney transplant.
- **Interventions**:
	- n = 3,304 received empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg/day).
	- n = 3,305 received a matching placebo.
- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in the progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes (13.1% vs. 16.9%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes (4% vs. 4.6%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07).
	- Significant decrease in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause (24.8 events/100 py vs. 29.2 events/100 py; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95).
	- No significant difference in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.08).
- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in serious adverse events.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^115h2ND8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

It is well established that SGLT2 inhibitors result in an initial drop in total eGFR, related to altered intra-renal haemodynamics. Reductions in intraglomerular pressure may acutely cause a drop in eGFR due to reduced filtration pressure but are protective against a decline in kidney function over time by reducing nephron loss.

The effect on eGFR was clearly demonstrated in the CREDENCE trial, where participants receiving canagliflozin experienced a larger reduction in eGFR in the first 3 weeks than with placebo (between-group difference of −3.17 mL/min/1.73 m²) but then a much smaller decline in eGFR over time (−1.85 ± 0.13 vs. −4.59 ± 0.14 mL/min/1.73 m²). By 12 months, the two groups had a similar change in eGFR from baseline, and thereafter, the canagliflozin arm had a more favourable eGFR change from baseline. The acute drop in eGFR reverses upon medication cessation, providing reassurance that it is not due to injury.

Large trials, including the CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients – Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trials of canagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively, demonstrated that the acute treatment-associated eGFR drop was reversible when treatment was ceased at the end of the study.

Despite early reports raising concern about an AKI risk with SGLT2 inhibitor use, later clinical trial evidence and large real-world studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of AKI.

### Jardiance [^112WNig6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions, including but not restricted to increasing tubuloglomerular feedback, reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart, and downregulating sympathetic activity.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

- **Urinary volume**: In a 5-day study, the mean 24-hour urine volume increased from baseline by 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac electrophysiology was also studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study with 30 healthy subjects.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1128f7Be]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

Use of drugs associated with kidney injury or dysfunction is common both in the hospital setting and in the community for patients with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and CKD. These drugs are often referred to as "nephrotoxic", although many of them lead to kidney dysfunction without direct glomerular or tubular cell damage. Furthermore, some drugs that may cause a rise in serum creatinine are actually reno-protective and associated with improved outcomes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy.

Although it would be ideal to propose a simple yet inclusive term to encompass the various mechanisms by which drugs interface with the kidney, meeting participants were unable to identify one. Thus, here the term "nephrotoxic drugs" is retained for consistency with the literature. A new classification should also encompass drugs that are not directly harmful to kidney function but are eliminated by the renal route, and where there is concern about harm from accumulation of parent drug or metabolites in the setting of AKI and AKD. Similarly, failure to increase drug doses and intervals in renal recovery or with enhanced elimination via extracorporeal clearance may lead to therapeutic failure.

In the past 10 years, significant progress has been made regarding susceptibility, management, and preventive strategies to avoid or ameliorate drug- and drug combination–associated kidney injury.

### Jardiance [^113Lbc3c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Jardiance for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to Jardiance had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m²; 91 adult patients exposed to Jardiance had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; and 97 patients exposed to Jardiance had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m². The glucose-lowering benefit of Jardiance 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions, and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use of Jardiance for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

Jardiance was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m²) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: Analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome) demonstrated that empagliflozin, when added to standard care, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. This study utilized EMPA-REG Outcome data to assess whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification influenced the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² at screening were randomized to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard care. In a post hoc analysis, cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, along with safety, were examined using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

- **Results**: Among 6952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin demonstrated consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes, with P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranging from 0.26 to 0.85, and for kidney outcomes, with P values ranging from 0.16 to 0.60. In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin exhibited similar advantages.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^112B4tCc]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven renal benefits, such as empagliflozin or canagliflozin. This approach aims to reduce the risk of nephropathy progression in adult patients with T2DM who have clinical CVD and an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², if glycemic targets are not met with existing antihyperglycemic medications.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: A consensus statement [^116Y3cMm]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) is considered to be due to volume depletion resulting from natriuresis, the effect on tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), and consequent kidney medullary hypoxia. The US FDA issued an initial warning for an increased risk of AKI in December 2015 and then strengthened the warning in June 2016 for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. However, the incidence of AKI was significantly lower in patients receiving dapagliflozin compared to placebo (1.5% vs. 2.0%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.87) in the DECLARE TIMI-58 study. Similar observations were reported from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS programs.

A recent meta-analysis reported a consistent and robust reduction in the likelihood of AKI among those participants who had been randomized to receive an SGLT2i (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54–0.80). The reports of AKI were similar in frequency to those of kidney disease progression. Furthermore, a Cochrane meta-analysis published in September 2018 concluded that SGLT2i have little or no risk of AKI in people with diabetes and CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Thus, the possibility of AKI should not preclude the use of SGLT2i in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD; however, SGLT2i should be discontinued if GFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Patients can be carefully monitored for any incidence of AKI. Similar monitoring is required for a rare but serious genital infection called Fournier's gangrene, for which the FDA has issued a warning.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117NHFcY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and avoiding end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, i.e. the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation) is highly desirable, given the associated adverse effects on quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and high economic costs. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was established to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. Findings from the active part of this trial and other large trials provided compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors substantially slowed kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular risk.

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: These inhibitors also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and acute kidney injury in patients with CKD and other high-risk conditions, including diabetes and heart failure.

Post-trial follow-up tests how benefits evolve once participants stop the study drug, as it is possible that additional cardiorenal benefits or harms could emerge after its discontinuation. Our trial was relatively short, as it was stopped early for efficacy following a median of two years of follow-up. Consequently, there were a lower number of primary outcomes in participants who progressed more slowly, and a low number of ESKD and fatal outcomes. Post-trial follow-up provides particular value through prospectively collecting more ESKD outcomes, as these outcomes take longer to accrue than surrogates of progression (e.g. percentage declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). We now report the effects observed in the post-trial follow-up phase.

### Effectiveness of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin for kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^116yX1bv]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

No large randomized clinical trial has directly compared empagliflozin with dapagliflozin, leaving their comparative effectiveness regarding kidney outcomes unknown. This study aimed to compare kidney outcomes between the initiation of empagliflozin vs. dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment.

This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected Danish health care data to compare the initiation of empagliflozin vs. dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who received antihyperglycemic treatment between June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to August 2024. Participants were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first.

- **Exposure**: Initiation of empagliflozin vs. dapagliflozin.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Outcomes included acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a competing event.

Results showed a total of 32,819 individuals who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and 17,464 with dapagliflozin were included in the study (median [IQR] age, 63 [54–71] years; 18,872 female individuals [37.5%]).

### Evaluating the overall renal outcomes of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^114YJV1X]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

The safety of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney-related disorders remains a topic of significant interest. Regarding acute kidney injury (AKI), the SGLT2 inhibitors treatment group showed a significant reduction in risk compared with controls, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, further subgroup analyses revealed that the attenuated occurrence of AKI was mainly derived from empagliflozin. These differences may be partly explained by the patients' characteristics of baseline diabetes (empagliflozin vs. dapagliflozin: 55.8% vs. 77.5%) and the assignment of diabetes treatment to all three other SGLT2 inhibitors. Additionally, the limited reported trials in CKD patients for the other four SGLT2 inhibitors (less than two trials) may impact the results, highlighting the need for larger subgroup studies. At the time of writing, the precise mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors prevent AKI remains unclear. The possible mechanisms include a reduction in intraglomerular pressure by enhancing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, decreasing tubular oxygen consumption, mitigating renal inflammation, and restoring the metabolism of cellular energy. More research is needed to confirm these findings and their underlying mechanisms.

We also confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of volume-related adverse events with renal insufficiency compared with controls, consistent with previous meta-analyses. However, our subgroup analysis revealed an increased risk exclusively in stage 2 CKD (OR 1.426, 95% CI 1.151–1.767, P = 0.001). This may be attributed to the diminished, but not entirely failed, renal capacity to regulate volume and sodium in the early stages of CKD.

### Acute kidney injury with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: A meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^111ohiNz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Three multicentre, large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have each shown substantial reductions in rates of hospitalization for heart failure and progression of chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes. However, safety concerns remain for this ostensibly paradigm-shifting drug class. In particular, the US Food and Drug Administration has highlighted the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. To investigate this further, we conducted a meta-analysis of the three trials to compare the frequency of AKI adverse event reports between participants treated with placebo and those who had received an SGLT2 inhibitor. Rather than an increase, we noted a consistent and robust reduction in the likelihood of AKI among those participants who had been randomized to receive an SGLT2 inhibitor (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.80). We further noted that the reports of AKI were similar in frequency to those of kidney disease progression. The caveats of the non-adjudicated reporting of AKI in the trials notwithstanding, these data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may protect vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes from AKI and that prospective studies to evaluate this additional aspect of kidney protection are warranted.

### Jardiance [^116sz57g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin were investigated in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Oral administration of empagliflozin at 10 mg and 25 mg resulted in exposure within the range observed in adult patients.

- **Effects of age, body mass index, gender, and race**: Age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and race (Asians versus primarily Whites) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin.

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: In adult patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh classification, the area under the curve (AUC) of empagliflozin increased by approximately 23%, 47%, and 75%, and the maximum concentration (Cmax) increased by approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.

- **Patients with renal impairment**: In adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild (eGFR: 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), moderate (eGFR: 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and severe (eGFR: less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) renal impairment, as well as in patients on dialysis due to kidney failure, the AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in patients with moderate renal impairment and patients on dialysis due to kidney failure compared to subjects with normal renal function, while peak plasma levels were roughly 20% higher in patients with mild and severe renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function.

### Choice of endpoint in kidney outcome trials: considerations from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^115C4GSa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Doubling of serum creatinine, equivalent to a 57% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), is an established surrogate for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, this endpoint necessitates lengthy follow-up and large sample sizes in clinical trials. We explored whether alternative eGFR decline thresholds provide more feasible surrogate kidney endpoints.

- **Methods**: The study involved post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial. Adults with type 2 diabetes, high cardiovascular risk, and an eGFR of ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² were assigned to receive empagliflozin at doses of 10 mg or 25 mg (n = 4687) or placebo (n = 2333), on top of standard care. We assessed composite endpoints incorporating different eGFR decline thresholds (≥ 30, ≥ 40, ≥ 50, or ≥ 57%) combined with initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or renal death. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01131676).

- **Results**: Empagliflozin versus placebo significantly lowered the risk of decline in eGFR for each threshold listed above, combined with initiation of RRT or renal death, ranging from a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.91] for endpoints based on a 30% eGFR decline to an HR of 0.37 (0.23–0.61) for endpoints based on a 57% eGFR decline. Lower thresholds, such as 30%, were associated with higher event rates but weaker treatment effects. The time to the 95% CI of the HR falling to < 1.0 decreased with increasing eGFR thresholds.

- **Conclusions**: The composite of a 40% decline in eGFR, ESKD, or renal death appears to provide results that are reliable similar to the traditional 57% decline in eGFR.

### Jardiance [^115wqfkX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Jardiance is indicated for the following uses:

- **Cardiovascular health**: To reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure. It also aims to lower the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**: To reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. It serves as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Limitations of use**: Jardiance is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, as it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. It is also not recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², as it is likely to be ineffective in this setting based on its mechanism of action.

Jardiance is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or those requiring, or with a recent history of, intravenous immunosuppressive therapy, or greater than 45 mg of prednisone or equivalent for kidney disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. It is not expected to be effective in these populations.

### Consistent effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of diabetic kidney disease categories: Insights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^113LA1up]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

To explore the cardiovascular (CV) and kidney effects of empagliflozin in patients with different clinical phenotypes of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), including the presence or absence of overt albuminuria, participants were involved in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

- **Materials and methods**: EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomized participants (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo, added to standard care. Post hoc, patients with different clinical phenotypes of DKD at baseline were categorized into three subgroups:
	- **Overt DKD**: Overt albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of > 300 mg/g) with any estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (n = 769).
	- **Non-overt DKD**: Kidney impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and/or albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–300 mg/g; n = 1,972).
	- **No DKD**: eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² without albuminuria (n = 3,739).

- **Results**: Empagliflozin reduced the risk of the composite CV endpoint in all subgroups: overt DKD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–1.16), non-overt DKD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.97), and no DKD (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70–1.03). The interaction P-value was statistically insignificant (P = 0.20), suggesting consistent effects across subgroups. Hospitalization for heart failure was also significantly reduced with similar HRs across subgroups with a non-significant interaction P-value (all P > 0.6). The incidence of the prespecified renal composite outcome was consistently lower in the empagliflozin group in each subgroup (interaction P = 0.05), consistent with the overall trial population findings. Empagliflozin also significantly reduced the yearly loss of eGFR, assessed by chronic slopes, in all subgroups. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin was similar across all subgroups.

Empagliflozin may improve CV and kidney outcomes and slow the progression of disease in patients with varying severities of diabetic kidney disease participating in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of acute kidney injury in older adults with type 2 diabetes [^112bvvTt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been found to offer numerous benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unknown whether SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study examined the association between AKI hospitalization and the prior initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor compared to the initiation of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) among older adults with type 2 diabetes in routine practice.

- **Study design**: Population-based cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Older adults aged at least 66 years with type 2 diabetes enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service. Participants were new users of SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1RA agents in the interval from March 2013 to December 2017.

- **Exposures**: New use of an SGLT2 inhibitor versus new use of a DPP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1RA.

- **Outcome**: The primary outcome was hospitalization for AKI, defined as a discharge diagnosis of AKI in the primary or secondary position.

- **Analytical approach**: New users of SGLT2 inhibitors were matched at a 1:1 ratio to new users of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs using propensity scores in two pairwise comparisons. Cox proportional hazards regression models generated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in propensity score-matched groups.

- **Results**: Totals of 68,130 and 71,477 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors were matched to new users of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs, respectively. Overall, the mean age of study participants was 72 years. The risk of AKI was lower in the SGLT2 inhibitor group.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: A consensus statement [^117XaRxc]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Based on the outcomes of the CREDENCE trial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the ADA 2020 and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2019 consensus statements strongly recommend, with strength of recommendation A and 1B respectively, the first-line standard of care of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², particularly in those with > 300 mg/g albuminuria, with or without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), provided they have adequate renal function.

- **Safety concerns and contraindications with SGLT2i**: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are increasingly recognized as antihyperglycemic agents for individuals with T2DM with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. However, healthcare providers must remain cautious and vigilant about specific safety concerns when prescribing them. Regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Health Canada, have issued safety warnings regarding several adverse effects (AEs) such as acute kidney injury (AKI), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections (UTI), bone fractures, lower limb amputations, and acute and chronic pancreatitis. The association of acute and chronic pancreatitis with SGLT2i was highlighted in the safety review by Health Canada, which concluded there may be a link between the use of SGLT2i and the risk of acute pancreatitis, although there was only limited evidence suggesting a link with chronic pancreatitis.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^116dTxPJ]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

In EMPACT-MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced heart failure (HF) events among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and an increased risk for HF, although without improvement in all-cause mortality. Patients with acute MI have a high burden of kidney dysfunction, with about 40% having chronic kidney disease (CKD) and high rates of acute decompensated HF.

Data regarding the cardiovascular–kidney efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI with variable kidney function are limited. DAPA-MI (Dapagliflozin Effects on Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Patients With an Acute Heart Attack) was the only other clinical trial to evaluate SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI, but it had limited enrollment of patients with kidney dysfunction, few HF events, and did not assess kidney outcomes. Studies of patients with HF have shown the benefit and safety of initiating SGLT2 inhibitors early among many patients at index hospital admission, but have not assessed the safety in patients with acute MI. It is especially important to understand this safety profile among patients with acute MI because these individuals have a high risk for acute kidney injuries (AKIs), substantial risk for volume depletion or hypotension, and regular exposure to kidney stressors, such as contrast for imaging or cardiac catheterization or kidney-function-altering medications.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: Towards an indication to treat diabetic kidney disease [^113oTTUf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

There were initial safety concerns as SGLT2i adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included acute kidney injury (AKI), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), amputations, urinary and genital tract infections (UTIs), bladder cancer, and bone fractures. However, recent trials have downplayed these risks, indicating that the benefit/risk balance remains positive. Interestingly, in a pooled analysis of 11 Phase 3 RCTs, dapagliflozin use in patients with an estimated GFR (eGFR) between 12 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m² (CKD G3b–4) decreased the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), blood pressure, and body weight without modulating glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or increasing major side effects. This observation supports the concept of positive renal and cardiac effects of SGLT2i independent from glycemic control.

In this review, we describe the molecular mechanism involved in cardiorenal protection in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and the indications for SGLT2i treatment in DKD patients according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as suggestions by the scientific community to update the indication to include overt DKD. We also propose clinical practice recommendations for the safe use of SGLT2i in DKD patients on other antidiabetic, hypertension, and diuretic treatments.

### Jardiance [^1151bELR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Empagliflozin was administered directly to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 21 until PND 90 at doses of 1, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day. It caused increased kidney weights and renal tubular and pelvic dilatation at 100 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 13 times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg, based on AUC. These findings were not observed following a 13-week drug-free recovery period. These outcomes occurred with drug exposure during periods of renal development in rats that correspond to the late second and third trimester of human renal development.

In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, empagliflozin was administered during intervals coinciding with the first trimester period of organogenesis in humans. Doses up to 300 mg/kg/day, which approximates 48 times (rats) and 128 times (rabbits) the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg based on AUC, did not result in adverse developmental effects. In rats, at higher doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity, malformations of limb bones increased in fetuses at 700 mg/kg/day or 154 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose. Empagliflozin crosses the placenta and reaches fetal tissues in rats. In rabbits, higher doses of empagliflozin resulted in maternal and fetal toxicity at 700 mg/kg/day, or 139 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose.

In pre- and postnatal development studies in pregnant rats, empagliflozin was administered from gestation day 6 through to lactation day 20 (weaning) at up to 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 16 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose, without maternal toxicity. However, it resulted in reduced body weight in the offspring.

### The empagliflozin comparative effectiveness and safety (EMPRISE) study programme: Design and exposure accrual for an evaluation of empagliflozin in routine clinical care [^113vFXbv]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Follow-up for study outcomes started on the day after the initiation of treatment and continued in an "as-treated" approach until discontinuation or switch to a drug in the comparator class, the occurrence of an outcome of interest, a nursing home admission, death, healthcare plan disenrollment, or the end of the study period (30 September 2015 for this first interim analysis), whichever came first. We extended the exposure effect window until 30 days after the end of the last prescription's supply.

In order to address more fully potential exposure misclassification, informative censoring, and the nature of the specific outcome assessed, 24 planned sensitivity analyses include the redefinition of the exposure risk window to 14 or 90 days after the end of the last prescription's days' supply interval. Additionally, the application of an intention-to-treat type approach will carry forward the initial exposure until the occurrence of a study event, healthcare plan disenrollment, admission to a nursing home, or the end of the study period.

- **Study outcomes**: EMPRISE will assess several effectiveness, safety, and healthcare utilization outcomes. Primary outcomes of interest include the following: a 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcome, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality; hospitalization for heart failure (HHF); and all-cause mortality. In prior investigations, the positive predictive values of the validated ICD-9 code-based algorithms used to define these cardiovascular primary outcomes were 84% or higher.

### Reading between the (guide)lines — the KDIGO practice guideline on acute kidney injury in the individual patient [^115qv7nj]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist healthcare providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines aim to help clinicians make informed decisions based on a review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Jardiance [^116ALivP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In some clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors, an imbalance in the incidence of lower limb amputation has been observed. Across four Jardiance outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo group and the Jardiance 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.36).

In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial involving patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9 and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo and Jardiance 10 mg treatment arms, respectively. Amputations of the toe and mid-foot were most frequent (21 out of 28 Jardiance 10 mg treated patients with lower limb amputations), with some involving above and below the knee. Some patients had multiple amputations.

Peripheral artery disease and diabetic foot infection (including osteomyelitis) were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. The risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of diabetic foot, peripheral artery disease (including previous amputation), or diabetes.

Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving Jardiance for signs and symptoms of diabetic foot infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores, or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and institute appropriate treatment.

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115cLkeT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The results of the active period of EMPA-KIDNEY were previously reported; empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of progression of kidney disease or cardiovascular death during two years of active trial treatment in its population of participants with a wide range of CKD etiologies, levels of kidney function, and albuminuria, with no major safety concerns. We now report the results of two years of post-trial prospective observation in which patients and clinicians were blinded to participants' original treatment allocation, and during which between-group use of SGLT2 inhibitors was similar.

We found that there were residual cardiorenal benefits among patients allocated empagliflozin after the study drug (empagliflozin or placebo) was discontinued. Mathematically, if there had been no off-treatment effect of empagliflozin post-trial (i.e. the hazard ratio was 1.0 after the study drug stopped), absolute benefits would be observed to diminish from the end of the active trial period (see supplementary methods). Instead, we observed that absolute benefits both for the primary outcome and for the key secondary outcome of death or ESKD were initially maintained. In relative terms, the carry-over effect on the primary outcome was less than the effect of taking empagliflozin during the active trial period and appeared to last for up to 12 months, with most additional benefit exerted in the first six months after the active trial ended.

Although not demonstrated directly, this suggests that to maximize the cardiorenal clinical benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients, continued use might be advantageous beyond the active treatment phase.

### The pleiotropic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: Beyond the glycemic benefit [^1177rD1k]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

While postmarketing reports of AKI with SGLT-2 inhibitors prompted the inclusion of a warning for AKI in the United States prescribing information for each drug, CVOTs of empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin demonstrated no increase in the incidence of AKI versus placebo. In addition, a real-world study of patients with T2D showed SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with lower rates of hospitalization with AKI compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. Clinicians should consider factors that may predispose patients to AKI, including chronic renal insufficiency, hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, or concomitant medications (e.g. diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and discontinue SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment in patients who develop AKI.

The risk of lower extremity amputation may differ among the SGLT-2 class. An increased risk of lower extremity amputation was observed with canagliflozin versus placebo (6.3 vs. 3.4 events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.41–2.75]) in CANVAS. However, in the CREDENCE trial, the risk of amputation with canagliflozin versus placebo was not significantly higher (12.3 vs. 11.2 events per 1000 patient-years; HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.79–1.56]). Furthermore, a real-world meta-analysis of four observational databases (OBSERVE-4D) found no increased risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin versus non-SGLT-2 inhibitor glucose-lowering medications (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.93–1.10]). In contrast to CANVAS, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin showed no increase in the incidence of amputations in EMPA-REG.

### Network meta-analysis of novel glucose-lowering drugs on risk of acute kidney injury [^114xGfzL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Little is known about the comparative effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), or sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to compare the effects of these three novel classes of glucose-lowering drugs on AKI risk in patients with or without type 2 diabetes, using a network meta-analysis of event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We systematically searched electronic databases up to September 2020 and included 20 event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials. Among these, 18 trials included patients with type 2 diabetes only, and two trials included patients with or without type 2 diabetes. A network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed to compare the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs, or SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of AKI, and to estimate the probability of each intervention as the safest option. The primary analysis included 18 trials with type 2 diabetes only, and a secondary analysis included all 20 trials.

- **Results**: In the 18 trials with a total of 2,051 AKI events (range: 1–300) among 156,690 patients with type 2 diabetes only, our network meta-analysis showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of AKI compared with placebo (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.88). In contrast, both DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs had neutral effects on the risk of AKI. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly associated with a lower risk of AKI than both GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF).

- **Methods and results**: Individuals were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models assessed consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events. At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively.

Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with than without HF. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events per 100 patient-years was examined.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111tPVXR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, demonstrated positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

- **Methods**: In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or a matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area, or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

- **Results**: Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 43% in the placebo group).

### Acute renal outcomes with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: Real-world data analysis [^111WJZfs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the possible risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i), as well as changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hospitalizations, and mortality in a real-world setting.

- **Materials and methods**: Included in this historical cohort study were patients with type 2 diabetes in a large health organization in Israel who initiated therapy with SGLT2-i or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) from April 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017. Data were collected on serum creatinine measurements taken between 180 days prior to and 24 weeks after therapy initiation. Study endpoints included a ≥ 30% reduction in eGFR, hospitalization with AKI, any hospitalization, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: Overall, 6,418 and 5,604 patients initiated SGLT2-i and DPP-4i, respectively. Baseline mean (standard deviation) eGFR was higher among the SGLT2-i group compared with the DPP-4i group (88.3 [17.4] and 82.8 [23.7], respectively), but were similar when stratified by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for ≥ 30% reduction in eGFR with SGLT2-i versus DPP4-i was 0.70 (0.49–1.00). ORs ranged from 1.97 (0.62–6.26) to 0.45 (0.21–0.99) in patients with baseline eGFR 30 to 45 and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. Risks of AKI (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.80), hospitalization (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56–0.78), or all-cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.20–0.95) were lower in patients initiating SGLT2-i versus DPP-4i.

- **Conclusions**: This real-world data analysis supports reassuring findings from prior studies regarding the use of SGLT2-i and its association with renal outcomes.

### Cost of glycemic target achievement with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK [^113ecQrv]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Post-marketing data from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) through the end of 2015 identified a potential safety signal for acute kidney injury with all three SGLT2 inhibitors. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin all carry warnings from the FDA about increased risk of acute kidney injury. In contrast, no evidence of an increased risk of acute kidney injury was observed in the CANVAS Program or EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

Emerging evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk of lower-extremity amputation, the mechanism for which is unknown but under investigation. In the high cardiovascular risk population that comprised the CANVAS Program, an increased risk of amputation, mainly of the toe, was observed. Over the course of the CANVAS Program, amputation was uncommon, occurring at a rate of 6.3 and 3.4 per 1000 patient-years for patients treated with canagliflozin and placebo, respectively, which constitutes an increased risk of 1.97-fold. Patients with a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy were at the highest risk. At the time of writing, limited additional data are available on the risk of amputation with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, so it is currently not possible to establish whether the increased risk of amputation is an SGLT2 inhibitor class effect. To further evaluate this risk, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has now mandated that lower-extremity amputations be systematically captured in studies of SGLT2 inhibitors. Information on the risk of lower-limb amputation has been added to the can.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^1158GshT]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

In patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and increased risk for heart failure (HF), empagliflozin exhibited kidney-protective effects by reducing the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Empagliflozin also decreased the rate of HF endpoints, and these findings remained consistent irrespective of baseline kidney function. Initiating empagliflozin therapy shortly after acute MI was determined to be safe, showing similar adverse event (AE) rates in both the empagliflozin and placebo groups, regardless of baseline kidney function, blood pressure, or use of clinically relevant concomitant therapies.

In clinical practice, there is often concern among physicians about starting sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors due to an acute decrease in eGFR. This worry is particularly prevalent among patients with acute MI, who represent a vulnerable population with high rates of contrast exposure and acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the study reveals that the acute treatment effect on eGFR with empagliflozin was similar to placebo. After an initial decline in eGFR at two weeks, full recovery was observed in the empagliflozin group; in contrast, in the placebo group, eGFR continued to decline in the long term. This initial change in eGFR, observed with SGLT2 inhibitors, is hemodynamic and deemed non-harmful in the long term.

Among the subgroups, an initial eGFR decline with both empagliflozin and placebo was noted in patients with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻², but not in those with an eGFR < 60 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻². Prior studies of empagliflozin identified a subgroup of patients who experienced increases in eGFR post-treatment initiation, though these improvements were not sustained during longitudinal follow-up. Kidney-protective effects were observed consistently.

### Comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus other antihyperglycemics on risk of major adverse kidney events [^112XM4J8]. Diabetes Care (2020). Low credibility.

To examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline > 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.

- **Research design and methods**: In a cohort study of 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.

- **Results**: Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin use was associated with 0.99 (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) mL/min/1.73 m² less annual reduction in eGFR, 0.25 (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) kg/m² more annual decrease in BMI, and reduced risk of MAKE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.64, 0.73]). Empagliflozin use was associated with reduced risk of MAKE in eGFR ≥ 90, ≥ 60 to < 90, ≥ 45 to < 60, and ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82], 0.66 [0.60, 0.73], 0.78 [0.69, 0.89], and 0.71 [0.55, 0.92], respectively). This was observed in participants without albuminuria, with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (HR 0.65 [95% CI 0.57, 0.75], 0.72 [0.66, 0.79], and 0.74 [0.62, 0.88], respectively), and in participants with and without cardiovascular disease (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.61, 0.74] and 0.76 [0.69, 0.83], respectively). The association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication.

### Rationale and protocol of the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized controlled trial [^117YXTcN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

We are collecting specific safety data relevant to glucose-lowering therapy in general and SGLT2 inhibitors in particular, including information on fractures, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputations, and acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is of particular interest in DAPA-CKD because the hemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibitors may lead to an initial reduction in eGFR, similar to that seen with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, albeit due to a different purported hemodynamic mechanism (i.e. afferent arteriolar constriction with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with efferent arteriolar dilatation with renin–angiotensin system blockers). Despite these similarities, fewer episodes of AKI were reported with SGLT2 inhibition in the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58), Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), and Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) programs, although these findings are based on investigator-reported adverse events that did not have a specific definition and were not adjudicated.

To properly determine the effects of dapagliflozin on AKI in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), all potentially severe AKI events, defined as a doubling of serum creatinine compared with the last central laboratory measurement, are being adjudicated by the independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC). An unexpected increase in the rate of lower limb amputation was reported with canagliflozin in the CANVAS program.

### Acute kidney injury events in patients with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs: A retrospective cohort study [^113sGjYN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and prevent heart failure events. However, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Our objective was to assess whether SGLT2 inhibitor use, compared with all other glucose-lowering drugs (oGLDs), is associated with increased rates of AKI.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Adults in Manitoba, Canada, with type 2 diabetes mellitus followed up from June 2014 until March 2017.

- **Exposures**: Initial SGLT2 inhibitor or oGLD use ascertained through a province-wide outpatient prescription database.

- **Outcome**: The primary outcome was incident AKI, identified either by an increase in serum creatinine level and/or hospital discharge codes for AKI while taking glucose-lowering drugs (on-treatment approach).

- **Analytical approach**: A propensity score analysis was used to assemble groups of incident users of SGLT2 inhibitors and a 1:1 matched set of oGLD users. The rate of AKI was compared across matched groups using cause-specific hazards models. Sensitivity analyses considered exposure to be constant throughout follow-up after initiation of the drug treatment (intention-to-treat approach) or incorporated re-exposures (new user design).

- **Results**: Comparing 4,778 incident users of SGLT2 inhibitors with 4,778 incident users of oGLDs, there were no differences observed in the primary outcome (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40–1.03; P = 0.06) using an on-treatment approach. In neither set of sensitivity analyses were significant differences found.

### Diuretics for preventing and treating acute kidney injury [^113s4tXG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-known complication of critical illnesses, significantly affecting morbidity and the risk of death. Diuretics are widely used to ameliorate excess fluid accumulation and oliguria associated with AKI. Their popularity stems from their ability to reduce the energy demands of renal tubular cells by inhibiting transporters and flushing out intratubular casts. Numerous studies have assessed the effects of diuretics in the context of AKI prevention and treatment; however, a comprehensive systematic review addressing this topic has yet to be conducted.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to explore the benefits and harms of diuretics for both the prevention and treatment of AKI.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to May 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which diuretics were used to prevent or treat AKI.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess the effects of treatment, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was used. The primary review outcomes for AKI prevent.

### Jardiance [^1169dqKX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There is limited information regarding the presence of Jardiance in human milk, the effects of Jardiance on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Empagliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats [see Data] since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first two years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be a risk to the developing human kidney. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, including the potential for empagliflozin to affect postnatal renal development, advise patients that use of Jardiance is not recommended while breastfeeding.

- **Data**: Empagliflozin was present at a low level in rat fetal tissues following a single oral dose to the dams at gestation day 18. In rat milk, the mean milk-to-plasma ratio ranged from 0.634 to 5 and was greater than one from 2 to 24 hours post-dose. The mean maximal milk-to-plasma ratio of 5 occurred at 8 hours post-dose, suggesting accumulation of empagliflozin in the milk. Juvenile rats directly exposed to empagliflozin showed a risk to the developing kidney (renal pelvic and tubular dilatations) during maturation.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without type 2 diabetes: a prespecified analysis of the DARE-19 randomized trial [^117TamWh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). High credibility.

The rate of adverse events related to acute kidney injury was less common in the dapagliflozin group, both in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). This is in line with a post hoc analysis of the DAPA-HF trial evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with and without diabetes. Among participants with T2D, doubling of serum creatinine occurred in 2.0% of those in the dapagliflozin group and 3.9% in the placebo group (p = 0.01). Discontinuation of the study drug was similar in the two groups.

Furthermore, concerning the potential risk of volume depletion associated with SGLT2 inhibitors, our findings suggest that this concern is unfounded. The results demonstrate similarity in hematocrit levels — a surrogate marker for volume depletion (typically rising if volume depletion occurred) — for the dapagliflozin and placebo groups.

In addition to the study, several trials have evaluated the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness, supporting their safety. The ACTIV-4a trial, which included critically ill patients, found that initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was safe and did not result in worse outcomes. Acute kidney injury was reported in three (1%) patients in the SGLT2 inhibitor group and eight (3%) patients in the standard-of-care group. No cases of ketoacidosis were reported in either treatment group. Similarly, the RECOVERY trial found that initiating empagliflozin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection was safe, with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurring in five (0.2%) patients receiving empagliflozin versus two (0.1%) with usual care.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^1167EsK2]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse events associated with SGLT2 and concomitant therapies

The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) using dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, or empagliflozin varies between 57.3% and 83.0% in different clinical trials, which is similar to other antidiabetic drugs. For example, with metformin, it ranges between 36.6% and 81.0%. The most frequent AEs are infections of the genitourinary tract, including vulvovaginitis in women or balanitis in men, with a frequency between 3.6% and 9.0%. Patients usually experience only a single episode, mild in intensity, that responds to standard treatment.

SGLT2 inhibitors, when used in monotherapy, are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia due to their insulin-independent mechanism of action. Additionally, long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been associated with a rise in plasma glucagon levels and increased hepatic glucose production. Interestingly, SGLT2-induced glucagon secretion is prevented by administering sulfonylureas concomitantly, thus explaining the risk of hypoglycemia with the use of these agents. The frequency of hypoglycemia increases significantly when SGLT2 inhibitors are used with background therapy that includes sulfonylureas or insulin, compared to placebo. Reported frequencies of hypoglycemia using SGLT2 inhibitors vary greatly, from 6.9% to 43.2% with sulfonylureas and from 29.2% to 60.4% with insulin. AEs are more likely to occur during the first few days or weeks of treatment.

Reducing the insulin dose has also been associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding this potential complication.

### Safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: Pooled analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112gGCZB]. Diabetes Care (2022). High credibility.

To assess the safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (category G3–4) enrolled in clinical trials, this analysis pooled data from 19 randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–4 clinical trials and one randomized, placebo-controlled extension study. Patients received either empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily. Time to the first occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression models.

Among a total of 15,081 patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, 1,522, 722, and 123 were classified as having G3A, G3B, and G4 CKD, respectively, at baseline. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment groups across CKD categories. Rates of serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and events of special interest (including lower limb amputations and acute renal failure [ARF]) were also similar between empagliflozin and placebo across CKD subgroups. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, the risks for volume depletion and ARF were similar for empagliflozin and placebo in the combined group with CKD categories G3B and G4 and the G3A group. Notably lower risks were observed in both groups for hyperkalemia (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.37–0.96, P = 0.0323] and 0.48 [0.26–0.91, P = 0.0243], respectively) and edema (0.47 [0.33–0.68, P < 0.0001] and 0.44 [0.28–0.68, P = 0.0002], respectively).

Use of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD raised no new safety concerns.
