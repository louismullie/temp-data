## Question

Can Keppra be used during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Keppra (levetiracetam) can be used during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the human safety data from registries and large cohorts. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy and whether dose adjustments and therapeutic drug monitoring are required. Next, I will review current professional guidelines and labeling. After that, I need to weigh maternal seizure risks against potential fetal risks. Finally, I will outline practical management steps during pregnancy and postpartum, and synthesize a comparative safety context versus other antiseizure medications to reach a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the human safety signal. Over more than two decades of data, the FDA labeling for levetiracetam reports no identified drug-associated increase in major birth defects or miscarriage, with observed risks approximating the U.S. background rates for major malformations (2–4%) and miscarriage (15–20%) in clinically recognized pregnancies, based on published literature and pregnancy registries, which is reassuring, though not proof of zero risk [^112JXMky] [^112YJCWZ]. Population-based registry analyses of newer-generation ASMs likewise have not demonstrated an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations with levetiracetam exposure compared to unexposed controls, supporting a favorable teratogenicity profile in clinical use [^1147FJi8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without context. I should compare levetiracetam with other antiseizure medications to ensure its relative safety stands up. Network meta-analyses and comparative reviews consistently show higher malformation risks with valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and topiramate, whereas levetiracetam and lamotrigine are not associated with statistically significant increases versus control in major congenital malformations, positioning levetiracetam among the safer options in pregnancy, although the quality of some comparative evidence is variable and warrants cautious interpretation [^114TN3Y2] [^113pk7rV]. Prior expert reviews and practice parameters also emphasize avoiding valproate and minimizing polytherapy where possible, which further supports selecting agents like levetiracetam when clinically appropriate for women of childbearing potential [^1166TVv4] [^113sRwPt].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic changes, because this often drives clinical management. Levetiracetam concentrations decline progressively across pregnancy, most notably by the third trimester, due to increased clearance; prospective data suggest clearance may increase by approximately 1.7-fold as early as the first trimester, which correlates with seizure worsening when concentrations fall below individualized targets, indicating the need for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment to maintain pre-pregnancy exposure and seizure control [^115eYPeg]. FDA labeling similarly warns that plasma levels drop during pregnancy and advises dose modification to maintain clinical response, with close monitoring through pregnancy and into the postpartum period as clearance normalizes [^112JXMky] [^115iq4cc] [^114gRVin].

> I need to check guideline-level recommendations next. The 2024 AAN/AES/SMFM guidance advises that levetiracetam can be used in pregnancy when benefits outweigh potential risks, that physiologic changes mandate close concentration monitoring with potential dose adjustments, and that patients should be enrolled in a pregnancy registry to improve outcome ascertainment, which aligns with FDA labeling that encourages NAAED pregnancy registry enrollment [^115UxDFJ] [^115SyYai]. Let me first confirm a common point of confusion: I initially thought levetiracetam was FDA Pregnancy Category C, but wait, the FDA retired the letter-category system and now uses the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule; current labeling provides narrative risk summaries rather than letter categories, so I should rely on the PLLR content rather than outdated category letters, while still noting the Australian B3 designation mentioned in guideline summaries for completeness [^112JXMky] [^115UxDFJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the maternal-fetal risk balance because seizure control is central. Uncontrolled epilepsy carries risks of trauma, status epilepticus, and even maternal mortality; abrupt ASM discontinuation can precipitate breakthrough seizures and status epilepticus, which is contraindicated, so continuation with appropriate monitoring is generally favored when seizures require treatment during pregnancy [^113sRwPt] [^111HGucG]. Let me consider alternatives as well: when initiating treatment preconception, levetiracetam's favorable teratogenic profile relative to agents like valproate supports its selection in many cases, but individualized decisions should prioritize seizure type control and prior response, ideally optimized before conception when feasible [^113sRwPt] [^115NA1Ef].

> Next, I should review practical management steps to ensure they are actionable. I should confirm that patients should not stop levetiracetam abruptly if pregnancy is discovered; rather, maintain therapy, enroll in the NAAED registry, monitor trough concentrations frequently through pregnancy, titrate doses to pre-pregnancy targets as levels fall, and after delivery, reduce toward pre-pregnancy doses to avoid toxicity as clearance returns to baseline, all while preferring monotherapy when possible to minimize additive teratogenic risks of polytherapy [^111HGucG] [^112JXMky] [^115iq4cc] [^115eYPeg] [^1166TVv4]. I should double-check that labels stress ongoing postpartum monitoring if the dose was escalated during pregnancy, which they do, reinforcing the need for a proactive plan around delivery [^115iq4cc].

> But wait, what about safety counseling beyond teratogenicity? I need to ensure patients are counseled on class-wide AED risks like mood changes and suicidality and levetiracetam-specific behavioral effects; clinicians should monitor for emergent depression or suicidality, as well as somnolence and other adverse effects, balancing these against the risks of uncontrolled epilepsy during pregnancy [^111nExgu] [^114RVLEK] [^114UYftu]. I should also reconsider drug-drug interactions; levetiracetam lacks clinically meaningful interactions with common ASMs and combined oral contraceptives, which is advantageous in reproductive planning, although enzyme inducers may modestly increase its clearance in pediatric populations, typically without requiring adjustment, and the broader interaction-sparing profile remains a practical benefit in pregnancy care [^111v7j5z].

> I will now synthesize the comparative and guideline perspectives into a clear answer. Yes, levetiracetam can be used during pregnancy, and among antiseizure medications it has one of the most reassuring human safety profiles for major congenital malformations, provided that patients receive close therapeutic drug monitoring with dose adjustment as levels fall during gestation and careful dose de-escalation postpartum, along with registry enrollment and avoidance of abrupt discontinuation; in many cases, the maternal benefits of seizure control outweigh potential risks to the fetus, especially compared with higher-risk alternatives like valproate, aligning with contemporary FDA labeling and AAN/AES/SMFM guidance [^112JXMky] [^1147FJi8] [^114TN3Y2] [^115UxDFJ] [^113sRwPt].

Yes, Keppra (levetiracetam) is appropriate during pregnancy when seizure control is required, as it has a **low teratogenic risk** [^1147FJi8] and is not associated with major birth defects or miscarriage in human data [^112YJCWZ] [^112JXMky]. However, **plasma levels drop** during pregnancy — especially in the third trimester — so monitor levels and adjust the dose to maintain seizure control [^115iq4cc] [^114gRVin] [^115eYPeg]. Use the lowest **effective dose**, prefer monotherapy, and enroll patients in the NAAED pregnancy registry [^115UxDFJ] [^112JXMky]. Keppra is generally preferred over valproate and other older AEDs given its safer profile [^113icDs3] [^116AqDaK].

## Safety profile of keppra during pregnancy

### Human data

- **Human data**: No association with major birth defects or miscarriage in pregnancy registries [^112YJCWZ] and published literature [^1147FJi8] over two decades [^112JXMky].

- **Malformation risk**: Lower than many older AEDs (e.g. valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) [^113icDs3] [^114ergDK].

- **Neurodevelopment**: No consistent evidence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in exposed children [^115UxDFJ] [^112qzgjC].

---

### Animal data

In animals, developmental toxicity (embryofetal mortality, structural abnormalities, growth restriction, neurobehavioral changes) occurred at doses similar to human therapeutic exposures [^112YJCWZ] [^114gRVin] [^112JXMky]. However, these findings have **not been confirmed in human data**.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations during pregnancy

During pregnancy, **clearance** increases and plasma levels decline — especially in the third trimester [^115iq4cc] [^115eYPeg]. Measure levels regularly and adjust the dose to maintain therapeutic concentrations and seizure control [^115jZReA] [^115iq4cc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Use**: Recommended when benefits outweigh risks; maintain seizure control to prevent maternal and fetal harm [^112YJCWZ] [^112JXMky] [^115UxDFJ].

- **Dose**: Use the lowest effective dose and prefer monotherapy to minimize fetal exposure [^111oQhqT].

- **Registry**: Enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry [^112JXMky].

## Comparative safety with other antiepileptic drugs

| **Outcome** | **Levetiracetam (Keppra)** | **Lamotrigine** | **Valproate** | **Carbamazepine** | **Phenytoin** | **Phenobarbital** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Risk of major congenital malformations | Low [^113icDs3] [^1147FJi8] | Low [^114ergDK] [^113icDs3] | High [^113icDs3] [^116AqDaK] | Moderate [^114ergDK] [^116p3DXJ] | Moderate [^116p3DXJ] [^114TN3Y2] | Moderate [^116p3DXJ] [^116AqDaK] |
| Neurodevelopmental risk | No consistent evidence of harm [^115UxDFJ] | No consistent evidence of harm [^112qzgjC] | High [^112qzgjC] | Moderate [^112qzgjC] | Moderate [^1166TVv4] | Moderate [^1166TVv4] |

---

Overall, **Keppra is preferred** over valproate and other older AEDs due to lower teratogenic and neurodevelopmental risks [^113icDs3] [^115UxDFJ].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Adverse effects**: Somnolence, fatigue, behavioral changes, hematologic abnormalities, and rare severe cutaneous reactions [^114RVLEK] [^114nXYAA].

- **Suicidality**: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behavior [^111nExgu] [^114UYftu].

- **Withdrawal**: Do not discontinue abruptly due to risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus [^111HGucG].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Preconception management should optimize **seizure control**, use the lowest effective dose, and prefer monotherapy. During pregnancy, **monitor levels**, adjust the dose as needed, and ensure regular prenatal care. Postpartum, continue **close monitoring**, particularly if the dose was changed during pregnancy [^115iq4cc] [^112JXMky].

---

Keppra is appropriate during pregnancy when seizure control is required, with a **favorable safety profile** and **no established increase in major birth defects or miscarriage** [^112YJCWZ]. Monitor levels, adjust dosing to maintain control, and prefer monotherapy at the lowest effective dose [^115eYPeg] [^115UxDFJ].

- **Risk summary**: Prolonged experience with levetiracetam in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries, and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (including increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, and neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^114TN3Y2]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The large volume of evidence in this analysis suggests that the newer generation AEDs, lamotrigine and levetiracetam, were not associated with statistically significant increased risks to CMs compared to control and were statistically significantly less likely to be associated with children experiencing cardiac malformations than control. In contrast, the risk of malformations was increased for ethosuximide, valproate, topiramate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and 11 polytherapies. Additionally, a significant association between topiramate and increased combined fetal losses was identified.

However, caution is needed, as the overall low quality of the research available on this subject limits what can be definitively concluded, and AEDs may be potentially harmful to infants and children exposed in utero. Counselling is advised concerning teratogenic risks when the prescription is first written for a woman of childbearing potential and before women continue with these agents when considering pregnancy. This includes switching from polytherapy to monotherapies with evidence of lower risk and avoiding AEDs, such as valproate, that are consistently associated with CMs. These decisions must be balanced against the need for seizure control.

### Levetiracetam [^114gRVin]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Physiological changes during pregnancy can affect levetiracetam concentration. A decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed, particularly during the third trimester. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.

- **Data**:

	- **Human data**: While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, data from published literature and pregnancy registries have not established an association between levetiracetam use during pregnancy and major birth defects or miscarriage.

	- **Animal data**: When levetiracetam (0, 400, 1200, or 3600 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis, reduced fetal weights and increased fetal skeletal variations were observed at the highest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rats (1200 mg/kg/day) is approximately four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3000 mg on a body surface area (mg/m²) basis.

	- **Rabbits**: Oral administration of levetiracetam (0, 200, 600, or 1800 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased embryofetal mortality and incidence of fetal skeletal variations at mid and high doses. Decreased fetal weights and increased incidence of fetal malformations at the high dose were associated with maternal toxicity.

### Risk of major congenital malformations and exposure to antiseizure medication monotherapy [^113icDs3]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Women with epilepsy (WWE) require treatment with antiseizure medications (ASMs) during pregnancy, which may be associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) in their offspring.

- **Objective**: To investigate the prevalence of MCMs after prenatal exposure to 8 commonly used ASM monotherapies and changes in MCM prevalence over time.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study conducted from June 1999 to October 2022. Since 1999, physicians from more than 40 countries enrolled ASM-treated WWE before the pregnancy outcome was known and followed up their offspring until 1 year after birth. Participants aged 14 to 55 years who were exposed to 8 of the most frequently used ASMs during pregnancy were included in this study. Data were analyzed from April to September 2023.

- **Exposure**: Maternal use of ASMs at conception.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: MCMs were assessed 1 year after birth by a committee blinded to the type of exposure. Teratogenic outcomes across exposures were compared by random-effects logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders and prognostic factors.

- **Results**: A total of 10,121 prospective pregnancies exposed to ASM monotherapy met eligibility criteria. Of those, 9,840 were exposed to the 8 most frequently used ASMs. The 9,840 pregnancies occurred in 8,483 women (mean [range] age, 30.1 [14.1–55.2] years). MCMs occurred in 153 of 1,549 pregnancies for valproate (9.9%; 95% CI, 8.5%-11.5%) and 9 of 142 for phenytoin (6.3%; 95% CI, 3.4%-11.6%). MCMs also occurred in 21 of 338 for phenobarbital (6.2%; 95% CI).

Encourage women who are taking Keppra during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1–888–233–2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

- **Risk summary**: Prolonged experience with Keppra in pregnant women has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature that includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity, including increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, and neurobehavioral alterations in offspring, at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data].

- **Clinical considerations**: Levetiracetam blood levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. A decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester.

### Levetiracetam in chronic daily headache: A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled study. (The Australian KEPPRA Headache Trial [AUS-KHT]) [^113sYK9i]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic daily headache (CDH) represents a temporal profile of headache occurring 15 or more days per month, lasting 4 or more hours per day, for over six months. This study reports the first comprehensive and largest trial of levetiracetam (LEV) in CDH.

The study employed a 27-week, multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over, phase III B design to assess the efficacy of a target dose of 3g/day of LEV compared to six placebo tablets per day in CDH. The primary efficacy measure was the headache-free rate (HFR), while secondary parameters included loss of diagnostic criteria, severity, duration, disability, associated features, pain, and quality of life.

Ninety-six patients were recruited with a baseline HFR of 10.4 ± 14.6% and a median of 0%. At the onset of headache history, 73 patients (74.1%) reported migraines with or without aura, and 35 (36.5%) had tension-type headaches (TTH). In the six months leading up to recruitment, 54 patients (56.3%) experienced migraines and 42 (43.8%) experienced TTH. The headache history averaged 22.6 ± 15.0 years, with a median of 20 years. Eighty-eight patients received placebo and 89 received LEV, with over 80 patients maintaining a stable dose in either arm.

LEV achieved a 3.9% increase in HFR over placebo, indicating a trend but not statistical significance. Additionally, there was a 9.9% increase in the loss of CDH diagnostic criteria concerning headache days per month for LEV over placebo (p = 0.0325), reduced disability (p = 0.0487), and reduced pain severity (p = 0.0162). However, the Short-Form Quality of Life assessment (SF-36) indicated impaired mental health with LEV (p = 0.001).

These findings contrast with reports of LEV efficacy, highlighting the necessity of placebo control in headache trials. Primary efficacy equated to one additional headache-free day per month, with reduced disability and pain intensity.

### Subcutaneous levetiracetam for the management of seizures at the end of life [^114vJvW9]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to report the results of a combined case series analysis of subcutaneous levetiracetam (Keppra) for the management of seizures in palliative care patients.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature review on the use of subcutaneous levetiracetam was performed. These data were combined with a prospective observational audit of its use in terminal care, undertaken in a regional palliative care network.

- **Results**: Seven papers were identified from the literature review consisting of four case reports and three observational case series, reporting on a total of 53 cases where subcutaneous levetiracetam was administered. We report 20 further cases of subcutaneous levetiracetam administration from a prospective observational audit. Doses ranged from 250 mg to 4000 mg daily. Oral to subcutaneous conversion ratios, where stated, were 1:1. Levetiracetam was reported as the sole administered antiepileptic drug (AED) in eight cases, and no seizures were reported until death in five cases. Five were switched back to enteral levetiracetam. In seven cases, levetiracetam was combined with AEDs to provide seizure control at the end of life. There was one report of a sterile abscess after 25 days of continuous subcutaneous administration.

- **Conclusions**: Combined analysis of 73 reported cases of subcutaneous levetiracetam suggests this treatment may have a role in the management of seizures at the end of life. However, randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to establish the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous levetiracetam administration. If proven to be safe and effective, subcutaneous levetiracetam could be a valuable option in managing seizures in palliative care settings.

### Common antiepileptic drugs in pregnancy in women with epilepsy [^114DAsLR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The potential adverse effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) exposure during pregnancy are well-recognized, yet the relative risks of specific antiepileptic drug exposures remain poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: To assess the adverse effects of commonly used antiepileptic drugs on maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with epilepsy. The report compares outcomes of pregnancies exposed to specific antiepileptic drugs in utero with unexposed pregnancies, either in the general population or among women with epilepsy. This manuscript details the first phase of the review, focusing on the neurodevelopmental outcomes in children exposed to antiepileptic drugs in utero.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted searches in MEDLINE, Pharmline, EMBASE, Reprotox, and TERIS from 1966 to December 2003. Review articles and conference abstracts were also manually reviewed.

- **Selection criteria**: Included were all randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts of children born to pregnant women with and without epilepsy, and case-control studies (cases: developmental delay or impaired cognitive outcome, controls: normal development).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Methodological quality was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A wide variety of outcome measures and methodological approaches made meta-analysis difficult; thus, a descriptive analysis of the results is presented.

- **Main results**: The majority of studies were of limited quality. There was little evidence indicating which specific drugs pose more risk than others to child development.

### Use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth: Population based cohort study [^1159nM4c]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Epilepsy affects 0.3–0.8% of pregnant women, making it the most common neurological disorder requiring medical treatment during pregnancy. Treatment must balance the risk of seizures with the potential for adverse effects from drug use. Antiepileptic drugs are also commonly used for psychiatric disorders, pain disorders, and migraines.

A recent study from the United States found that antiepileptic drug use during pregnancy is increasing, especially for the newer drugs. In Denmark, the use of newer drugs during pregnancy has also increased, but this trend has been counterbalanced by a decrease in the use of older drugs; in combination, this has resulted in unchanged total use of antiepileptics. Use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy has been associated with pregnancy complications, including pre-eclampsia, bleeding, preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and fetal malformations. However, little is known about the association between antiepileptics and spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. In animal studies, a dose-dependent increased risk of fetal death has been observed after use of antiepileptics. Human studies are conflicting; some reported twice the risk of fetal death in exposed compared with unexposed pregnancies, whereas other studies found no association.

We conducted a large population-based cohort study to investigate the association between maternal antiepileptic drug use during pregnancy and spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, after taking potential confounders into account.

### Teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to antiseizure medication: Practice guideline from the AAN, AES, and SMFM [^115UxDFJ]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the use of levetiracetam ER PO (also known as Keppra XR) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Patients should be enrolled in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. Physiological changes during pregnancy can alter drug concentrations and therapeutic effects, requiring dose adjustments. The drug levetiracetam ER PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: Congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^111oQhqT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The strengths of this review update include the creation and advance publication of the review protocol, the clear inclusion criteria, extensive searches, the acquisition of unpublished data, and the inclusion of articles not written in English. Meta-analysis was conducted for all possible comparisons, considering specific as well as overall major malformation risks. The balance of systematic reviewing and content expertise, along with the assessment of risk of bias and quality in the non-randomised evidence, enhanced the review. Further, we improved the quality of the meta-analyses by stratifying by type of control group and, importantly, study design. The results across the different study types were summarised in separate meta-analyses due to potential overlap in the cases. For example, a national epilepsy and pregnancy register may contain the same children with a malformation as a population dataset that utilised routine health records for the same region or population.

There were concerns about likely heterogeneity from different measurement approaches, periods of follow-up, and different patterns of maternal indications. However, in comparisons with larger numbers of included exposed pregnancies, the prevalences were similar. We therefore regard cohort studies and studies utilising population-level health records as complementary evidence that can replicate each other's results to ensure consistency across the total available data. Under the Cochrane guidelines, this review will continue to be updated to maintain relevance and accuracy.

### Malformation risks of antiepileptic drug monotherapies in pregnancy: updated results from the UK and Ireland epilepsy and pregnancy registers [^114ergDK]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). High credibility.

Antiepileptic drug (AED) exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs). The magnitude of this risk varies by AED exposure. Here we provide updated results from the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register of the risk of MCMs after monotherapy exposure to valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine.

This was a fifteen-year prospective observational study from 1996 until 2012. The main outcome measure is the MCM rate.

Informative outcomes were available for 5206 cases. Of these, 1290 women were exposed to valproate monotherapy, 1718 to carbamazepine monotherapy, and 2198 to lamotrigine monotherapy. The MCM risk with valproate monotherapy exposure in utero was 6.7% (95% CI 5.5% to 8.3%) compared with 2.6% with carbamazepine (95% CI 1.9% to 3.5%) and 2.3% with lamotrigine (95% CI 1.8% to 3.1%). A significant dose effect was observed with valproate (p = 0.0006) and carbamazepine (p = 0.03) exposed pregnancies. A non-significant trend towards a higher MCM rate with increasing dose was noted with lamotrigine. The MCM rate for high-dose lamotrigine (> 400 mg daily) was lower than the MCM rate for pregnancies exposed to < 600 mg daily of valproate, but this was not significant (3.4% vs 5.0%, p = 0.31).

In conclusion, in utero exposure to valproate carries a significantly higher MCM risk than lamotrigine (p = 0.0001) and carbamazepine (p = 0.0001) monotherapy. Contrary to prior findings, high-dose lamotrigine was associated with fewer MCMs than all doses of valproate. While lamotrigine has a favorable profile compared with valproate for adverse pregnancy outcomes, it remains critical to consider the associated risks when prescribing.

### Teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to antiseizure medication: Practice guideline from the AAN, AES, and SMFM [^115SyYai]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the use of levetiracetam IV (also known as Keppra) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence shows fetal harm in animals. Monitor plasma drug levels closely during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The drug levetiracetam IV (also known as Keppra) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Keppra [^111HGucG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients and caregivers not to discontinue the use of Keppra without consulting with their healthcare provider. Keppra should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.

Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during Keppra therapy. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry if they become pregnant.

### Epilepsy in pregnancy and reproductive outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pX4Zn]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Antenatal care for women with epilepsy varies significantly. Quantifying the association between epilepsy, antiepileptic drug exposure, and pregnancy outcomes is crucial for guiding management. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore this association with or without exposure to antiepileptic drugs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, AMED, and CINAHL between January 1, 1990, and January 21, 2015. There were no language or regional restrictions. We sought observational studies of pregnant women with epilepsy that assessed the risk of obstetric complications during antenatal, intrapartum, or postnatal periods, along with any neonatal complications. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was utilized to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies and the risk of bias in cohort selection, comparability, and outcomes. We assessed the odds of maternal and fetal complications, excluding congenital malformations, by comparing pregnant women with epilepsy to those without. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on antiepileptic drug exposure among women with epilepsy. The association was summarized using odds ratios (OR; 95% CI) via random effects meta-analysis. The PROSPERO ID of this systematic review's protocol is CRD42014007547.

- **Findings**: Out of 7050 citations identified, 38 studies from both low-income and high-income countries met our inclusion criteria, representing 39 articles and a total of 2,837,325 pregnancies. Women with epilepsy (2,809,984 pregnancies) had higher odds of spontaneous miscarriage (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02–2.32; I² = 67%) compared to those without epilepsy.

### Open-label pilot study of levetiracetam (Keppra) for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease [^111TFoig]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of levetiracetam (LEV; Keppra) in reducing levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease (PD) in an open-label pilot study. Nine PD patients who were experiencing peak-dose dyskinesias for at least 25% of the awake day and were at least moderately disabling were treated with LEV in doses up to 3,000 mg for up to 60 days.

- **Primary outcome measure**: The primary outcome measure was the percent of the awake day that patients spent on without dyskinesia or with nontroublesome dyskinesia (good on time). LEV significantly improved percent of the awake day on without dyskinesia or with nontroublesome dyskinesia at endpoint compared to baseline (43% ± 12% vs. 61% ± 17%; P = 0.02).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Percent on time with troublesome dyskinesia decreased from 23% ± 10% at baseline to 11% ± 6% at endpoint, although not significantly. There was no significant increase in off time from baseline to endpoint. There was a 56% dropout rate, mostly due to somnolence. In PD patients who experienced peak-dose dyskinesia for at least 25% of the awake day, LEV significantly improved on time without dyskinesia or with nontroublesome dyskinesia.

The mean dose of LEV at endpoint was 625 ± 277 mg/day.

### Antiepileptic drug exposure in pregnancy and pregnancy outcome from national drug usage data [^113EpsC8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Women of child-bearing potential**: Over the study period, the number of women of childbearing age (between 15 and 45 years) dispensed any AED increased from 9 women per 1000 in 2008 to 11.4 women per 1000 in 2014 [Fig. 1]. During this time, the number of women dispensed sodium valproate or carbamazepine declined, while those dispensed lamotrigine, gabapentin, and levetiracetam increased. Prescriptions of AEDs to women of child-bearing age are most commonly provided by general practitioners, accounting for 60% of the prescriptions from 2008 to 2014 [Fig. 2].

	- **Fig. 1: Number of women of child-bearing age (15–45 years) dispensed an AED 2008–2014**
	- **Fig. 2: AED prescribing to women of child-bearing age by provider type 2008–2014**

- **Pregnant women**: Between 2009 and 2014, 2284 individual women received an AED in the 9 months before a birth, or 3 months before a pregnancy termination or spontaneous abortion. During the study period, 311 women had two pregnancies, and 59 women had three or more pregnancies, resulting in 2728 pregnancies. Women dispensed an AED during this period were more likely to be older than women who had not been dispensed an AED (p < 0.05).

	- **Table 1: Pregnancies by maternal age (years) 2009–2014**

Overall, women who had been dispensed an AED in the exposure period (within 9 months of a birth or stillbirth or within 3 months of a spontaneous abortion or pregnancy termination) had an increased rate of spontaneous abortion, 8.97 per 100 pregnancies, than those not dispensed AEDs.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^115sNsD9]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Similar results with the network meta-analysis (NMA) were observed in subgroup analysis including observational studies only, which consisted of 1 case-control and 29 cohort studies with a total of 13,437 pregnancies (τ² = 0.03; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.26) and in the Schmitz model. The Schmitz model included 1 RCT, 1 case-control study, and 29 cohort studies with 13,487 pregnancies (τ² = 0.36; 95% CrI, 0.00–4.17), where control was additionally associated with a marginally statistically significant lower risk of fetal losses than the combination of phenobarbital and phenytoin (OR, 3.04; 95% CrI, 1.07–7.18), except for topiramate (OR, 13.06; 95% CrI, 0.77–365.50).

The sensitivity analysis results for timing of at least first-trimester exposure to anti-epileptic drugs (AED) were in agreement with NMA. This analysis included 1 case-control and 16 cohort studies covering 6,970 pregnancies (τ² = 0.04; 95% CrI, 0.00–0.17). The only statistically significant results of all treatments versus control were for carbamazepine combined with valproate (OR, 7.83; 95% CrI, 1.62–32.08) or phenobarbital (OR, 4.73; 95% CrI, 1.24–17.24), with control being statistically significantly safer.

Two cohort studies with 318 women who had a history of alcohol use during pregnancy compared 10 treatments (τ² = 0.31; 95% CrI, 0.00–3.87), and another 3 cohort studies with 4,666 women with a smoking history compared 14 treatments (τ² = 0.14; 95% CrI, 0.00–2.19). These studies showed that only phenytoin plus valproate was statistically significantly different from control, with odds ratios indicating a high level of risk for these combinations (alcohol use: OR, 269.30; 95% CrI, 2.42–1.19 × 10⁶; smoking history: OR, 180.30; 95% CrI, 6.10–4.17 × 10⁵). The restriction to studies comparing only older AEDs included 1 RCT, 1 case-control, and additional studies.

### Optimizing treatment of epilepsy during pregnancy [^1137w9Yc]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Freedom from seizures is the ultimate goal in the treatment of patients with epilepsy. At the same time, the side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should not outweigh the benefits of treatment. This is particularly important in women with epilepsy who wish to become pregnant. These women and their partners should be made aware of the risks associated with uncontrolled seizures as well as the teratogenicity of some AEDs.

Recent studies have indicated a higher risk for birth defects and possibly also adverse cognitive effects associated with exposure to valproate compared with carbamazepine. Although further studies are needed, it appears reasonable to use valproate with caution in women with epilepsy who are planning to become pregnant and to consider whether other equally effective and safer AEDs are available. However, women who need valproate to control their seizures should continue the drug and not be discouraged from pregnancy, provided that they receive counseling with the best available knowledge.

With proper management before conception, during pregnancy, and after birth, the vast majority of pregnancies in women with active epilepsy will have a favorable outcome.

### Keppra [^115DbQzY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric patients:

- **1 month to < 6 months**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in two divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.

- **6 months to < 4 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in two divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.

- **4 years to < 16 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in two divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day.

- **Keppra tablet dosing in pediatric patients weighing 20 to 40 kg**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 500 mg given as twice daily dosing (250 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 500 mg to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1500 mg (750 mg twice daily).

- **Keppra tablet dosing in pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day.

### Keppra [^111nExgu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Keppra, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

- **Pooled analyses**: These analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients. This represents an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients; however, the number is too small to allow any conclusion about the drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

### SPL drug information for levetiracetam [^114RVLEK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of levetiracetam PO (also known as Keppra):

- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Behavioral or personality changes**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral changes, including aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, and personality disorder.

- **Exacerbation of seizures**: Do not discontinue abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus.

- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.

- **Incoordination**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of coordination difficulties, including ataxia, abnormal gait, and incoordination.

- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.

- **Somnolence**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of somnolence and fatigue.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation.

### KeppraXR [^1153VhZs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug, which represents 66% of the administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg, and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Elderly**: There are insufficient pharmacokinetic data to specifically address the use of extended-release levetiracetam in the elderly population. Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61–88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38%, and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.

- **Pediatric patients**: An open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, two-arm study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of KEPPRA XR in pediatric patients (13 to 16 years old) and in adults (18 to 55 years old) with epilepsy.

### Reproductive health effects and teratogenicity of antiepileptic drugs [^116SfbR1]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Women with epilepsy are less likely to bear children than women in the general population, and although this reduced fertility can be attributed in part to effects of the disease itself, the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including changes in reproductive endocrine function, are also a factor. Conversely, some AEDs interact with oral contraceptives and can increase the risk for contraceptive failure and unplanned pregnancy. Women with epilepsy also have elevated rates of congenital anomalies and major malformations in their offspring, for which exposure of the developing fetus to AEDs taken by the mother appears to be responsible. In utero exposure to some AEDs may also be associated with increased risk for impaired cognitive function in the growing child. Clearly, possible long-term effects on reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes require careful attention when AED therapy is being considered for a patient with childbearing potential. Moreover, because AEDs are increasingly being used in therapy for other conditions such as migraine, bipolar disorder, and pain, it is not only the treatment of women with epilepsy that will be affected by these concerns.

### Newer-generation antiepileptic drugs and the risk of major birth defects [^1147FJi8]. JAMA (2011). High credibility.

Epilepsy during pregnancy presents a therapeutic challenge. Since the 1990s, the number of licensed antiepileptic drugs has substantially increased, yet safety data on the use of newer-generation antiepileptic drugs during the first trimester are limited.

- **Objective**: To study the association between fetal exposure to newer-generation antiepileptic drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy and the risk of major birth defects.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This population-based cohort study involved 837,795 live-born infants in Denmark from January 1, 1996, through September 30, 2008. Individual-level information on dispensed antiepileptic drugs to mothers, birth defect diagnoses, and potential confounders were ascertained from nationwide health registries.

- **Main outcome measures**: Prevalence odds ratios (PORs) of any major birth defect diagnosed within the first year of life due to fetal exposure to antiepileptic drugs.

- **Results**: Of the 1,532 infants exposed to lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, or levetiracetam during the first trimester, 49 were diagnosed with a major birth defect compared to 19,911 of the 836,263 infants who were not exposed to an antiepileptic drug (3.2% vs 2.4%, respectively; adjusted POR [APOR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.36). A major birth defect was diagnosed in 38 of 1,019 infants (3.7%) exposed to lamotrigine during the first trimester (APOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.83–1.68), in 11 of 393 infants (2.8%) exposed to oxcarbazepine (APOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.46–1.59), and in 5 of 108 infants (4.6%) exposed to topiramate (APOR, 1.44; 95% CI).

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^115NA1Ef]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2023). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfills the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, it neither has the propensity for clinically relevant drug interactions nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward compared to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution, and injectable forms and is suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalized epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, apart from some situations, e.g. pregnancy, adherence check, inter-critical illnesses, and extremes of age.

### Teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs [^113pk7rV]. The Lancet Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Most women with active epilepsy need treatment with antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Antiepileptic drugs are also frequently used for other indications, such as migraine, pain syndromes, and psychiatric disorders, which are prevalent among women of childbearing age. The possible teratogenic effects of these drugs are therefore of wide concern, and the risks imposed by the drugs must be weighed against the risks associated with the disorder being treated. Adverse drug effects on the fetus can present as fetal loss, intrauterine growth retardation, congenital malformations, impaired postnatal development, and behavioral problems. For the optimum use of antiepileptic drugs in women of childbearing age and rational management of epilepsy during pregnancy, a thorough understanding of the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs and knowledge of the differences in risks between various treatment options are needed.

### The consequences of valproate exposure in utero [^113X73bQ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Prospective studies have unequivocally identified that valproate poses an unacceptable risk to the fetus in utero, prompting European and national bodies to issue unambiguous advice to neurologists. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency recommended strengthening the restrictions on the use of valproate in women and girls. The joint task force of the International League Against Epilepsy-Commission on European Affairs and the European Academy of Neurology responded with a detailed letter, later published in Epilepsia, which included seven recommendations. The first of which is: "Where possible, valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing potential". In January 2015, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom issued stringent guidance regarding the prescription of valproate to women of childbearing potential. The data supporting these statements were based on robust prospective research approximating the risk of major malformations at one in ten, and that four in ten children are at risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. The advice is, therefore, that first, valproate should not be used in girls or women of childbearing potential unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated, and second, that women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment.

However, valproate cannot simply be discarded from the panoply of anti-epileptic medications since it remains one of the most efficacious therapies, especially for those patients with genetic generalized epilepsy.

### Major congenital malformations associated with exposure to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [^116AqDaK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are prescribed for approved and off-label indications, including epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other neurologic and psychiatric disorders. The risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) following gestational exposure to AEDs, particularly at the time of conception and during early trimester exposure, has been examined in many studies. This risk is compared with the risk in unexposed general population controls and untreated controls with the same treatment indication. Moreover, the risk is compared pairwise among the AEDs.

There is consistent evidence from conventional and network meta-analyses and prospectively collected pregnancy registry data that early gestational exposure to valproate is associated with the highest risk of MCMs among the AEDs, with the risk being around 10% and dose-dependent. Furthermore, in pairwise comparisons that attenuate confounding by indication, valproate is significantly more teratogenic than most other AEDs. Phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and topiramate are other AEDs consistently associated with higher MCM risk relative to unexposed control groups and certain other AEDs.

Besides valproate (> 650 mg/d), phenobarbitone (> 80 mg/d), and carbamazepine (> 700 mg/d) are also associated with dose-dependent risks. In the AEDs associated with elevated risks, the extent to which the risks are due to confounding by indication is unknown. Importantly, confounding by indication notwithstanding, at conventional doses lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine.

### KeppraXR [^114UYftu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing Keppra XR or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

- **Somnolence and fatigue**: Keppra XR may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on Keppra XR to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

### Antiepileptic drug clearances during pregnancy and clinical implications for women with epilepsy [^115eYPeg]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to characterize the magnitude and time course of pregnancy-related clearance changes for different antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, phenytoin, and valproate. A secondary aim is to determine if a decreased AED serum concentration is associated with increased seizure frequency.

- **Methods**: Women with epilepsy were enrolled preconception or early in pregnancy and prospectively followed throughout pregnancy and the first postpartum year. They kept daily diaries of AED doses, adherence, and seizures. Study visits for AED concentration measurements occurred every 1–3 months. AED clearances in each trimester were compared to the nonpregnant baseline using a mixed linear regression model, with adjustments for age, race, and hours postdose. In women on monotherapy, a two-sample t-test was used to compare the ratio to target concentrations (RTC) between women with seizure worsening each trimester and those without.

- **Results**: AED clearances were calculated for levetiracetam (n = 18 pregnancies), oxcarbazepine (n = 4), topiramate (n = 10), valproate (n = 5), and phenytoin (n = 7). Mean maximal clearances were reached for: (1) levetiracetam in the first trimester, with a 1.71-fold increase in baseline clearance (p = 0.0001); (2) oxcarbazepine in the second trimester, with a 1.63-fold increase (p = 0.0001); and (3) topiramate in the second trimester, with a 1.39-fold increase (p = 0.025). Among 15 women on AED monotherapy, increased seizure frequency in the first, second, and all trimesters was associated with a lower RTC (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: AED clearance significantly changes by the first trimester for levetiracetam.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^111dDfUE]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A random-effects meta-analysis model was applied because the studies differed methodologically and clinically. Outcome data were pooled using the odds ratio (OR), and for two or more studies, the OR was estimated using Bayesian hierarchical models and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. When treatment comparisons formed a connected network of evidence, a random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using treatment nodes pre-specified by the team. Multiple doses were combined in nodes because this information was not reported consistently across the studies. In both pairwise meta-analyses and NMAs, we assumed common within-network between-study variance (τ²) across treatment comparisons, since there were many treatment comparisons, including a single study where the (τ²) was not estimable.

Prior to applying a NMA, the transitivity assumption was assessed using age, baseline risk, treatment indication, timing of exposure, and risk-of-bias as potential treatment effect modifiers. The mean of each continuous potential effect modifier and the mode (i.e. most frequent value) of each categorical potential effect modifier for each pairwise comparison and outcome were presented in tables. For each outcome, the entire network was evaluated for inconsistency using the design-by-treatment interaction model. The random-effects model was used when multiple studies were available in each design in the network; alternatively, we applied the fixed-effect model. If the global test suggested inconsistency, local inconsistency in specific network paths was assessed using appropriate methods.

### Antiseizure medication use during pregnancy and children's neurodevelopmental outcomes [^112qzgjC]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical recommendations should only be based on the literature as a whole, not individual studies. However, using antiseizure medications (ASMs) during pregnancy requires active monitoring to ensure safety and effectiveness. In cases where pregnant individuals have epilepsy, withdrawal of ASMs can lead to seizures, posing life-threatening risks to both the mother and the baby. Switching to less teratogenic alternatives, such as lamotrigine, well before conception could be a reasonable strategy. Decisions regarding switching or withdrawal of ASMs should be planned in consultation with relevant clinical specialists and individualized to the patient's clinical history.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has stated that the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) is 30–40% following exposure to valproate. We find substantially lower absolute risks in the UK and Sweden and corroborate results from the Nordic-based SCAN-AED study. The differences in estimates compared to those presented by the MHRA may be explained by our use of electronic health records and registry data, which offer increased sample sizes and lengths of follow-up, as well as by different measures used to assess neurodevelopment. This difference also highlights the need for better quality evidence and communication of risk in this area.

The findings of this large-scale study suggest that the use of topiramate, carbamazepine, and valproate during pregnancy is associated with higher risks of neurodevelopmental conditions in exposed children, whereas lamotrigine is not associated with such risks. These observational associations translate to tangible absolute risk increases, ranging from 0.3 to 2.1 extra cases by age.

### Keppra [^114BBCTh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric use

- **Safety and effectiveness**: The safety and effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month to 16 years of age have been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The dosing recommendation for these pediatric patients varies according to age group and is weight-based [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The safety and effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adolescents 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Unestablished safety and effectiveness**: Safety and effectiveness for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month; adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years; and adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of Keppra as adjunctive therapy in 98 (Keppra N = 64, placebo N = 34) pediatric patients, ages 4 to 16 years old, with partial seizures that were inadequately controlled. The target dose was 60 mg/kg/day.

### Keppra [^111v7j5z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Keppra (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption, its plasma clearance, or urinary excretion, There was also no effect on exposure to and excretion of the primary metabolite, UCB L057.

- **Other antiepileptic drugs**: Potential drug interactions between Keppra and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and valproate) were assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs, and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Effect of AEDs in pediatric patients**: There was about a 22% increase in apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

- **Oral contraceptives**: Keppra (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or the levels of luteinizing hormone and progesterone, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Digoxin**: Keppra (1000 mg twice daily) did not inf

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^114ot6n6]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

An experienced librarian developed the search strategies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials. The MEDLINE search strategy was peer-reviewed by another librarian using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies checklist, and the final version is provided in our protocol. The literature search was initially conducted from inception until March 18, 2014, and a rapid update was conducted on December 15, 2015. Reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews were scanned. Unpublished studies were sought by locating relevant conference abstracts and contacting authors of included studies and AED manufacturers.

After the team conducted two pilot tests of the eligibility criteria among 10 reviewers (12% disagreements), pairs of reviewers screened each title/abstract independently and conflicts (6%) were resolved through discussion. Subsequently, three level 2 screening pilots (26% disagreements) occurred, as well as three data abstraction pilots. The same process was followed for potentially relevant full-text articles (16% conflicts) and data abstraction. Authors were contacted for studies published in the last 10 years to clarify unclear or missing data.

The 'no AED use' arms were only included if the control group had the same indication as the active arm in the study (e.g. both had epilepsy). The malformation rates were expressed on a basis of live births plus stillbirths, based on the number of pregnant women enrolled in the study.

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: Congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^116c3jxb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The decision to continue antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment during pregnancy requires a careful risk-benefit assessment. There is a potential risk to the fetus when the medication acts as a teratogen. However, the health and well-being of the mother, who needs treatment throughout her pregnancy to minimize the risk of seizures, must also be considered. The choice of ASM depends on the type of epilepsy and the seizures experienced by the patient.

A lack of knowledge regarding fetal safety limits treatment options for women with epilepsy during their childbearing years, as women and their doctors may avoid ASMs with limited data. Conversely, the absence of evidence may result in the extensive use of an ASM with a higher fetal risk profile before thoroughly understanding its risks.

Numerous studies indicate a teratogenic risk from specific ASMs, but results vary regarding the degree of risk and types of malformations associated with particular ASMs. Data accumulate slowly, and an earlier version of this review noted extremely limited data on ASMs with more than a decade of clinical use. Such a lack of evidence complicates counseling women about treatment choices before or during pregnancy.

There is a clear need for a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data to inform these decisions. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) would provide the most reliable evidence regarding the effects of ASMs in pregnancy, ethical considerations and logistical challenges essentially preclude them.

### Practice parameter update: Management issues for women with epilepsy — focus on pregnancy (an evidence-based review): Teratogenesis and perinatal outcomes [RETIRED]: Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society [^1166TVv4]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

To reassess the evidence for management issues related to the care of women with epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy, a systematic review of relevant articles published between January 1985 and June 2007 was conducted. It is highly probable that intrauterine first-trimester valproate (VPA) exposure carries a higher risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) compared to carbamazepine and possibly compared to phenytoin or lamotrigine. Compared to untreated WWE, it is probable that VPA as part of polytherapy and possible that VPA as monotherapy contribute to the development of MCMs. Antiepileptic drug (AED) polytherapy as compared to monotherapy regimens probably contributes to the development of MCMs and to reduced cognitive outcomes. For monotherapy, intrauterine exposure to VPA probably reduces cognitive outcomes. Moreover, monotherapy exposure to phenytoin or phenobarbital possibly reduces cognitive outcomes. Neonates of WWE taking AEDs probably have an increased risk of being small for gestational age and possibly have an increased risk of a 1-minute Apgar score of < 7.

- **Recommendations**: If possible, avoidance of valproate (VPA) and antiepileptic drug (AED) polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy should be considered to decrease the risk of major congenital malformations (Level B). If possible, avoidance of VPA and AED polytherapy throughout pregnancy should be considered to prevent reduced cognitive outcomes (Level B). Additionally, avoidance of phenytoin and phenobarbital during pregnancy may be considered to prevent reduced cognitive outcomes.

### Keppra [^111F5AWe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of acute overdosage in humans**: The highest known dose of Keppra received in the clinical development program was 6000 mg/day. Other than drowsiness, there were no adverse reactions in the few known cases of overdose in clinical trials. However, cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and coma were observed with Keppra overdoses in postmarketing use.

- **Management of overdose**: There is no specific antidote for overdose with Keppra. If indicated, the elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage, while usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. A certified poison control center should be contacted for current information on the management of overdose with Keppra.

- **Hemodialysis**: Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose. Although hemodialysis has not been performed in the few known cases of overdose, it may be indicated by the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.

### Keppra XR [^111Kjqhj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra XR for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. This was supported by the demonstration of efficacy of immediate-release Keppra tablets in partial seizures in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adults, as well as a demonstration of comparable bioavailability between the XR and immediate-release formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in adults. The effectiveness of Keppra XR for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients, 12 years of age and older, was based upon a single pharmacokinetic study showing comparable pharmacokinetics of Keppra XR in adults and adolescents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. All studies are described below.

- **Keppra XR in adults**: The effectiveness of Keppra XR for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study across seven countries in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Study 1).

- **Study 1**: Patients enrolled in Study 1 had at least eight partial seizures with or without secondary generalization during the 8-week baseline period and at least two partial seizures in each 4-week interval of the baseline period. Patients were taking a stable dose regimen.

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^116p3DXJ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pregnant women with epilepsy frequently experience seizures related to pregnancy complications and are often prescribed anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) to manage their symptoms. However, less is known about the comparative safety of AED exposure in utero. We aimed to compare the risk of congenital malformations (CMs) and prenatal outcomes of AEDs in infants/children who were exposed to AEDs in utero through a systematic review and Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to December 15, 2015. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full-text papers for experimental and observational studies comparing mono- or poly-therapy AEDs versus control (no AED exposure) or other AEDs, then abstracted data and appraised the risk of bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of major CMs, overall and by specific type (cardiac malformations, hypospadias, cleft lip and/or palate, club foot, inguinal hernia, and undescended testes).

- **Results**: After screening 5305 titles and abstracts, 642 potentially relevant full-text articles, and 17 studies from scanning reference lists, 96 studies were eligible (n = 58,461 patients). Across all major CMs, many AEDs were associated with higher risk compared to control. For major CMs, ethosuximide (OR, 3.04; 95% CrI, 1.23–7.07), valproate (OR, 2.93; 95% CrI, 2.36–3.69), topiramate (OR, 1.90; 95% CrI, 1.17–2.97), phenobarbital (OR, 1.83; 95% CrI, 1.35–2.47), phenytoin (OR, 1.67; 95% CrI, 1.30–2.17), and carbamazepine (OR, 1.37; 95% CrI, 1.10–1.71) were all associated with an increased risk.

### Sodium valproate in pregnancy: What are the risks and should we use a shared decision-making approach [^114a5AiE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

In the context of epilepsy and bipolar disorder, valproate is not the sole medication available for women of childbearing age. There is a somewhat complex picture of efficacy and safety among the different alternatives. Schmidt and Schachter recently reviewed drug treatment for epilepsy and highlighted that epilepsy is not a single condition but an umbrella term encompassing various underlying pathologies and clinical manifestations. Different types of epilepsy respond to different drugs, and in 20–30% of refractory cases, multiple drugs need to be used in combination. Getting the right drug for a person with epilepsy involves balancing benefits and side effects while considering lifestyle issues and personal preferences.

While valproate, first licensed in 1967, is no longer the most commonly prescribed anti-epileptic drug, it remains one of the most effective. It is still used in emergency settings to control focal and generalized seizures. It may be effective when newer anticonvulsants have not worked, and it is the recommended first-line therapy for complex partial seizures.

Schmidt and Schachter point out that while two in every three women with epilepsy who become pregnant remain seizure-free throughout their pregnancy, antiepileptic drug dosages may need to be adjusted as the pregnancy progresses.

### KeppraXR [^112NXe7C]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study 3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted at 62 centers in Europe, comparing immediate-release KEPPRA 1000 mg/day (N = 106), immediate-release KEPPRA 2000 mg/day (N = 105), and placebo (N = 111), given in equally divided doses twice daily.

The first period of the study (Period A) was designed to be analyzed as a parallel-group study. After a prospective baseline period of up to 12 weeks, patients in Study 3 were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 16-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration period followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant.

- **Primary measure of effectiveness**: A between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period).

- **Secondary outcome variables**: The responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency).

The results of the analysis of Period A are displayed in Table 7.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the three treatment groups (x-axis) in Study 3 is presented in Figure 2.

- **Figure 2**: Responder rate (≥ 50% reduction from baseline) in Study 3: Period A

The comparison of immediate-release KEPPRA 2000 mg/day to immediate-release KEPPRA 1000 mg/day is also highlighted in the study.

### Anti-epileptics and pregnancy: an update [^115jtT5n]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In utero exposure to selected anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) has an established association with adverse outcomes in exposed offspring. However, since the majority of women with epilepsy still require ongoing treatment with AEDs during pregnancy, quantifying the risk of related adverse events as well as identifying potential modulating factors remains highly relevant. Although the teratogenic effects of valproate are now widely recognized, there remains a need to clarify risks of long-term intellectual impairment in children exposed to AEDs in general and to understand any underlying mechanisms of action.

This month's journal club reviews three papers which explore the use of anti-epileptic drugs in pregnancy. The first is a large, national, population-based study exploring the association between AED exposure and performance in language and mathematics tests in school-aged children. The second examines the relationship between folic acid levels and verbal ability in offspring of mothers with epilepsy. The third provides an insight into potential biological mechanisms by considering the action of valproate on the placenta.

### Management of reproductive risks in people with epilepsy [^113sRwPt]. The Lancet Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition worldwide, presenting unique management challenges for those affected during reproductive age. The effectiveness of contraceptives can be modified by antiseizure medication treatments, and pregnancy can alter the pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications. Furthermore, although treatment with some antiseizure medications can convey lifelong risks to offspring, inadequately controlled epilepsy can lead to injury or, in rare cases, death of the mother. In this complex set of circumstances, safe and effective antiseizure medication treatment, evidence-based decision-making regarding contraceptive selections, and clear counseling and risk minimization are imperative.

Although risk-benefit decision-making has become standard clinical practice for the management of women with epilepsy of childbearing age, reproductive treatment considerations could also be relevant for men. Most young adults with epilepsy live in low-income and middle-income countries, where access to contraceptives, antiseizure medications with adequate safety profiles, and reproductive care and counseling can be scarce. Strategies to optimize care for people with epilepsy in all stages of their reproductive journey must be tailored for resource-limited settings to improve parent-child health worldwide.

### Antiepileptic drug exposure in pregnancy and pregnancy outcome from national drug usage data [^115xTMNF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

This study found that the rates of antiepileptic drug (AED) use are increasing among women of child-bearing potential in New Zealand, with General Practitioners being the most common prescribers of AEDs to this group. This has implications for education for primary care practitioners and women in this age group, as it is likely that this trend will continue, leading to more women being exposed to AEDs during pregnancy both in New Zealand and internationally. Along with the well-documented risk of fetal malformations with some AEDs, this study found there may be additional risks for pregnant women using AEDs, such as an elevated risk of spontaneous abortion.

### Association of levetiracetam concentration with seizure frequency in pregnant women with epilepsy [^115jZReA]. Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of epilepsy in pregnant women involves balancing risks for both the mother and the fetus. Levetiracetam (LEV) is considered safe during pregnancy due to its low teratogenic potential and lack of drug-drug interaction with other antiseizure medications (ASMs). Recent studies have shown a decline in ASM concentrations during pregnancy caused by physiologically based pharmacokinetic changes. This study established a decrease in LEV concentration during pregnancy, investigated the effect of low LEV levels, and aimed to develop a target value for LEV levels during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Pregnant patients using levetiracetam were studied in this retrospective cohort study. Blood samples were collected monthly through venous puncture or the dried blood spot method. ASM serum concentrations were determined at least six months before conception and for each month of pregnancy. Seizure frequency and ASM dosages during pregnancy were obtained from patient records. Patients were divided into two groups: a seizure-free group and a non-seizure-free group, which contained pregnancies where the mother had experienced an epileptic seizure more than 12 months and less than 12 months before pregnancy, respectively.

- **Results**: We found decreased concentration/dose ratios in 29 pregnancies throughout all months of pregnancy. In the non-seizure-free group, low LEV concentrations were associated with increased seizure frequency (p = 0.022).
