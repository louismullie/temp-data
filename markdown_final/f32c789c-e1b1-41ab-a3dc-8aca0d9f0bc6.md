## Question

Dermovate cream in hypertrophic scar post mammoplastic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Dermovate (clobetasol propionate 0.05%) cream can be used to treat a hypertrophic scar following mammoplasty, and if so, how it should be used safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scar biology after breast surgery. Then, I should verify what the evidence says about topical superpotent corticosteroids for hypertrophic scars. Next, I will compare this option with first-line therapies and guideline-backed alternatives. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing and follow-up, and note any caveats or uncertainties that might change practice as new data emerge.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scar biology. Hypertrophic scars after mammoplasty typically arise from excessive fibroproliferation driven by tension, inflammation, and dysregulated collagen deposition; they are raised, erythematous, and often pruritic but remain within wound boundaries, unlike keloids, and they can regress over time, though symptoms and stiffness may persist without treatment [^116iJEj1] [^113X3h5a]. I should confirm that the chest and breast region are high-tension sites where hypertrophic scarring is more likely, which aligns with established risk distributions across body regions [^116bBVtT].

> Now, I need to check whether topical clobetasol has evidence for hypertrophic scars specifically. Wait, let me verify the literature base. High-quality randomized trials for superpotent topical steroids in established hypertrophic scars are lacking; most data come from case series and expert algorithms, which suggest that steroid ointments or creams can soften scars and reduce recurrence when used as part of combination therapy, but the certainty is low and application frequency is a practical barrier because creams rub off easily [^117AA9xG] [^116X5LTW]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline explicitly recommends topical clobetasol for hypertrophic scars; I do not see a high-credibility recommendation endorsing clobetasol cream as first-line monotherapy for hypertrophic scars, whereas steroid tapes/plasters are emphasized in some international algorithms, particularly in Japan, for early lesions [^111v9Zwt]. I should also note that fluocinolone acetonide is FDA-indicated for hypertrophic and keloid tissues, underscoring a role for topical steroids, but that product is a tape/plaster formulation rather than a simple cream, which may influence adherence and efficacy [^114YJYX7].

> Next, I should review first-line therapies to ensure I'm not missing a better-supported option. Silicone-based therapy remains the most consistently recommended first-line approach for both prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars, with multiple guidelines and systematic reviews supporting silicone gel sheeting or silicone gel to improve thickness, erythema, and symptoms, albeit with variable study quality and modest effect sizes [^111BcZJw] [^113Jg2sU] [^116iJEj1]. Let me consider intralesional corticosteroids as well; contemporary primary care guidelines recommend offering intralesional corticosteroids for keloids and hypertrophic scars, and they are widely used as first-line injectable therapy when scars are symptomatic or refractory to silicone alone [^114Td4Mz]. But wait, what if the scar is very early and erythematous? Pulsed-dye laser can reduce vascularity and symptoms in hypertrophic scars, though evidence quality varies and access or cost may limit use [^113FMBuS].

> I will now examine safety and monitoring for clobetasol cream. Superpotent steroids carry risks of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, and perilesional hypopigmentation, especially with prolonged use on thin skin or under occlusion; I need to ensure duration is limited and reassessment is planned if there is no response within a few weeks [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify contraindications and precautions; hypersensitivity to any component is a contraindication, and use on infected or ulcerated skin should be avoided; in post-mammoplasty scars, I should also consider that chronic systemic or topical steroid exposure can impair wound healing, so timing and duration matter, and any deterioration warrants stopping therapy and reassessing the diagnosis or technique [^115E4qGb] [^113xaUEX].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. If the hypertrophic scar is early, erythematous, and mildly indurated, I would prioritize silicone gel or sheeting as first-line, given its favorable safety profile and guideline support, and consider adding a short, time-limited course of clobetasol cream only if there is persistent pruritus, pain, or progression despite silicone, with close follow-up to avoid steroid-induced atrophy [^111BcZJw] [^113Jg2sU]. If the scar is firm, thickened, or symptomatic, I should confirm that intralesional triamcinolone is the more evidence-based and effective intervention than topical superpotent cream alone, and I would offer injections with or without 5-fluorouracil depending on severity and patient preference, reserving topical clobetasol as an adjunct for symptom control rather than monotherapy [^114Td4Mz] [^117AA9xG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought topical clobetasol might be a strong alternative to intralesional steroids; hold on, I should verify and correct that impression — guidelines and comparative evidence still place intralesional corticosteroids ahead of topical superpotent creams for efficacy in established hypertrophic scars, so clobetasol cream should not displace injections when scarring is significant [^114Td4Mz] [^117AA9xG].

> If clobetasol is used, I need to ensure precise instructions and monitoring. I would apply a very thin layer once or twice daily for a limited course, typically no more than 2 to 4 weeks, then reassess. I should avoid occlusion unless specifically indicated and only with caution, and I would counsel on signs of atrophy or irritation that warrant cessation [^notfound]. Let me double-check that I am not missing a better topical steroid formulation; steroid tapes or plasters can deliver sustained anti-inflammatory effect with better adherence than cream, and if available, they may be preferable in early hypertrophic lesions, though regional availability varies [^111v9Zwt] [^116X5LTW].

> I should also consider adjuncts and prevention going forward. Tension reduction with paper tape or silicone tape along incision lines, sun protection, and early recognition of recurrence are important, and patients should be followed for 12 to 24 months because hypertrophic scars can evolve and benefit from timely intervention if they recur [^116bBVtT] [^111zwb33]. Let me reconsider whether any emerging topical could change this plan; preliminary data for agents like 1,4-diaminobutane and kynurenine creams are intriguing for modulation of collagen cross-linking or matrix remodeling, but these remain investigational and should not replace silicone or intralesional therapy outside trials at this time [^115HdXQx] [^114JBhCQ].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the recommendation clearly. Dermovate (clobetasol propionate 0.05%) cream can be considered as a short, adjunctive course for symptom control in early or mildly hypertrophic post-mammoplasty scars, particularly for pruritus and erythema, but it is not first-line monotherapy and should not replace silicone-based therapy or intralesional corticosteroids when scarring is established or symptomatic. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, monitor closely for atrophy, and escalate to intralesional therapy if there is inadequate response [^111BcZJw] [^114Td4Mz].

---

Dermovate (clobetasol propionate 0.05%) is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for hypertrophic scars after mammoplasty because of limited evidence and potential adverse effects [^115rKLqU]. Silicone gel or sheeting remains the **gold standard** for prevention and treatment, with intralesional corticosteroids reserved for refractory cases [^111BcZJw]. If clobetasol is used, apply a thin layer once or twice daily for up to 2–4 weeks, then reassess; monitor for atrophy, telangiectasia, and systemic absorption. For best results, combine with silicone therapy and consider intralesional triamcinolone or 5-FU for persistent scars [^117AA9xG] [^113X3h5a].

---

## Clinical evidence for clobetasol propionate in hypertrophic scars

Evidence for clobetasol in hypertrophic scars is **limited**, with no robust RCTs; small case series suggest modest flattening and symptom reduction, but the risk of atrophy and telangiectasia is significant with prolonged use [^117AA9xG] [^115E4qGb]. In contrast, silicone gel/sheeting has consistent support for prevention and treatment, and intralesional corticosteroids are effective for established scars [^111BcZJw] [^114Td4Mz].

---

## Recommended application protocol for Dermovate cream

If clobetasol is used, follow this cautious protocol:

- **Dosage**: Apply a thin layer once or twice daily to the scar.
- **Duration**: Limit to 2–4 weeks, then reassess; avoid prolonged use.
- **Technique**: Gently massage until absorbed; avoid occlusion unless directed.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, and systemic effects (especially in large areas).

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Clobetasol is a super-potent steroid; **risks include**:

- **Local effects**: Atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, secondary infection, delayed healing [^notfound].
- **Systemic effects**: Rare with short courses, but possible with large areas or prolonged use (e.g. HPA axis suppression).
- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to clobetasol or formulation components [^115E4qGb].

---

## Comparison with other topical treatments

| **Treatment** | **Evidence level** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Silicone gel/sheeting | High | Effective for prevention and treatment | Excellent; minimal adverse effects [^111BcZJw] |
| Intralesional corticosteroids | High | Effective for established hypertrophic scars | Good; risk of atrophy, telangiectasia, pain [^notfound] |
| Clobetasol cream | Low | Limited evidence; modest benefit | Risk of atrophy, telangiectasia, systemic absorption [^notfound] |
| Onion extract gels | Moderate | Mixed evidence; modest benefit | Generally safe; mild irritation [^1171H8Sh] |

---

Silicone remains **first-line**; intralesional steroids are second-line; clobetasol is a lower-priority adjunct because of limited evidence and higher risk [^111BcZJw].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize silicone as **first-line** and intralesional corticosteroids for refractory scars; clobetasol cream is not a recommended first-line therapy because of limited evidence and potential adverse effects [^111BcZJw] [^114Td4Mz]. Use clobetasol cautiously, if at all, and prefer silicone-based therapies.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment should be **individualized** to scar age, size, and symptoms; patient age and skin type (Fitzpatrick); prior scar history (hypertrophic/keloid); and comorbidities such as diabetes, immunosuppression, or chronic steroid use. These factors guide the balance of efficacy and safety, especially with potent steroids [^111BcZJw] [^113xaUEX] [^117BCCSj] [^116bBVtT].

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence rates

Long-term data for clobetasol in hypertrophic scars are lacking; recurrence is common after any modality, and combining therapies (e.g. silicone plus intralesional steroids) reduces recurrence compared with monotherapy [^117BCCSj].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

- **Silicone gel/sheeting**: First-line; prevents and treats hypertrophic scars [^111BcZJw] [^113Jg2sU].
- **Intralesional corticosteroids**: Effective for established scars; consider triamcinolone or 5-FU combinations [^114Td4Mz] [^117AA9xG].
- **Laser therapy**: Pulsed-dye or fractional lasers can reduce erythema, pruritus, and thickness [^117AA9xG].
- **Pressure garments**: Useful for large or burn-related scars [^111BcZJw].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Silicone gel or sheeting for prevention and treatment [^111BcZJw].
- **Second-line**: Intralesional corticosteroids for established or refractory scars [^notfound].
- **Clobetasol**: Consider only as a short-term adjunct (≤ 2–4 weeks) with close monitoring; not first-line [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: Silicone plus intralesional steroids or laser improves outcomes and reduces recurrence [^notfound].

---

Dermovate cream may offer short-term symptom relief for post-mammoplasty hypertrophic scars, but **silicone therapy and intralesional corticosteroids remain the evidence-based mainstays**. Use clobetasol sparingly, monitor closely for adverse effects, and integrate with silicone and procedural therapies for optimal results.

### Kynurenine increases matrix metalloproteinase-1 and-3 expression in cultured dermal fibroblasts and improves scarring in vivo [^117StJMx]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

We previously demonstrated that the formation of hypertrophic scarring on the wounds of a rabbit ear fibrotic model was significantly reduced by grafting a bilayer skin substitute expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Here, we hypothesize that the improved healing quality is due to extracellular matrix modulatory effect of IDO-mediated tryptophan metabolites. To test this hypothesis, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted and the findings revealed a significant increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) in fibroblasts either transduced with human IDO gene or cultured with conditioned media obtained from IDO-expressing cells. Consistent with this finding, kynurenine (Kyn) treatment markedly increased the levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression through activation of the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase)-ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. On the other hand, Kyn significantly suppressed the expression of type I collagen in fibroblasts as compared with that of control. To test the anti-fibrogenic effect of Kyn in an in vivo model, rabbit ear fibrotic wounds were topically treated with cream containing 50μg Kyn per l00μl of cream per wound. The result showed a marked improvement in scar formation relative to the controls. These findings collectively suggest that Kyn can potentially be used as an anti-fibrogenic agent for treating hypertrophic scarring.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Analytical Assessments

Thirty patients were prospectively randomized in double-blind fashion to receive 1,4-diaminobutane (1,4 DAB) or control treatment by the hospital research pharmacist in Winnipeg, which supplied both centers with labeled jars of cream that were identical apart from the code on the jars. The study monitors at both centers provided patients with necessary instruction for use of the topical preparations and arranged before and after treatment follow-up. Topical 1,4 DAB was compounded as 0.8% weight/volume in a base that is available commercially (Glaxal Base; Glaxo Canada Ltd. Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and given the early commercial name Fibrostat. Arrangements were made for biopsy at 2 months after initiation of the study, as these patients had already had visible scars present for at least 1 month before enrolment. Subsequent work showed that maximum cross-link formation occurs at 3 months after injury (data not shown), and we also showed that maximum hardness in the scars appears at approximately 3 months postoperatively. Inclusion criteria required that two areas on the extremities or torso, as similar as possible, had to be assessable. However, separation of two treatment areas along a single scar simultaneously was allowed. It was desirable for the two scars to be actively hypertrophic as evidenced by their appearance clinically. Scars that were previously nonhypertrophic but became raised, red, and symptomatic were treated as well. Patients with dermatoses or malignancy were excluded from all phases, as were female patient who might have become pregnant during the study period or who were lactating. Patient age was not a consideration, unless compliance became an issue. The patients reported all and any adverse events to the study monitors. All were issued consents and numbered jars or cream along with patient instruction for proper application. The study was conducted in accordance with the local ethics committees at the universities of Manitoba and Alberta in keeping with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Silicone-based scar cream for post upper eyelid blepharoplasty-associated cicatricial and hypertrophic scarring [^115vrn6X]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE: Silicone cream has been shown to improve the appearance of postoperative scars. Nevertheless, surgeons may incorporate intralesional wound modulators such as a triamcinolone and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for scars that do not completely heal well or those that do not completely respond to other treatment options such as silicone cream. This study sought to determine whether a silicone-based topical scar cream that incorporates selective growth factors can help reduce the incidence of postoperative cicatricial and hypertrophic changes in upper eyelid blepharoplasty incisions.

METHODS: This is a single-surgeon, retrospective chart review of patients that underwent a cosmetic upper eyelid blepharoplasty. Subjects were divided into two cohorts depending on whether they received postoperative topical scar cream (SKN2017B) twice daily for 3 months versus no topical scar treatment. Using a modified Vancouver Scar Study Scale for treatment criteria, the incidence of focal intralesional injections of triamcinolone and 5-FU to targeted areas of cicatricial and hypertrophic changes was compared between the two groups.

RESULTS: 272 eyelids were identified, of those, 132 eyelids received no treatment and 140 were treated with SKN2017B. 43.9% of eyelids that did not receive treatment underwent intralesional injections of triamcinolone and 5-FU, and 22.9% of eyelids treated with SKN2017B underwent intralesional injections of triamcinolone and 5-FU. The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (P less than 0.05). No adverse reactions were reported from either group.

CONCLUSION: The use of a topical silicone-based scar cream has been shown to be safe and effective in decreasing the incidence of intralesional injections of triamcinolone and 5-FU for postoperative cicatricial and hypertrophic changes in upper eyelid blepharoplasty incisions.

### Management of keloids and hypertrophic scars [^113X3h5a]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Keloid and hypertrophic scars are a result of aberrant wound healing responses within the reticular dermis. They are thought to be secondary to the formation of a disorganized extracellular matrix due to excessive fibroproliferative collagen response. Prevention of these scars focuses on avoiding elective or cosmetic procedures such as piercings in patients at high risk, reducing tension across the lesion, and decreasing the inflammatory response. Topical treatments, including tension reduction with gel sheets, inflammatory reduction with corticosteroid ointments, and combined treatment with corticosteroid-infused tapes and plasters, can reduce scarring. Liquid nitrogen is beneficial, especially when injected into the scar through intralesional cryotherapy. Corticosteroid injection is effective for prevention and treatment. OnabotulinumtoxinA appears to be superior to both fluorouracil and corticosteroid injections for treating keloids and hypertrophic scars. Advanced treatment includes laser therapies (direct ablation, postsurgical, or laser-assisted drug delivery). Surgical revisions can be successful when tension-reducing techniques are used and when combined with other treatments such as postoperative steroid injection, laser ablation, and radiation therapy. For keloid prevention, corticosteroid injections administered 10 to 14 days postsurgery is superior to injections administered before or during surgery. Radiation therapy is considered safe with low cancer risk and can be used alone or in combination with other therapies.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116bBVtT]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevention of postsurgical Hypertrophic scars and keloids

Patients with a hypertrophic scar and keloid history are at high risk, as are patients with one or more of the following risk factors (special care must be taken during and after surgery).

Risk Factors

Local

Hypertrophic scars and keloids occur frequently on sites that are frequently stretched by daily body movements, including the major joints, anterior chest, scapula, and lower abdomen. By contrast, hypertrophic scars and keloids occur rarely on the scalp and anterior lower leg, where stretching tension is low. This is because stretching a wound prolongs and worsens its inflammation, thereby provoking hypertrophic scar and keloid formation. –

To prevent hypertrophic scar and keloid formation after surgery on susceptible body regions, surgical techniques that limit dermal tension should be used, namely, flaps, Z-plasties, and subcutaneous and deep fascial tensile-reduction sutures. Moreover, postsurgical wound stretching should be limited by fixation materials such as paper tape, gel sheets, gels, or compression bandages and garments. All are supported by meta-analyses/randomized controlled trials. Regarding paper tape, a randomized controlled trialdemonstrated that paper tape fixation reduced the hypertrophic scar risk after cesarean section by 13.6-fold. Regarding gel sheets, a meta-analysis on 20 trialsconcluded that silicone gel sheets may prevent hypertrophic scar and keloid formation in scar-prone people with newly healed wounds; however, they commented that trial quality was poor. A recent review on 10 trials had similar conclusions. Regarding gels, a randomized controlled trialshowed that silicone gel reduces sternotomy scar pigmentation, erythema, hardness, height, and pain and itchiness. This was confirmed by a review. Regarding compression therapy, a meta-analysis of 12 trials confirmed that 15- to 25-mmHg compression therapy reduces burn scar thickness, erythema, and hardness.

All patients undergoing surgery on susceptible body areas should be monitored closely for hypertrophic scars and keloids for 3 to 12 months. If induration is observed, steroid tape and plaster should be started and replaced with steroid injection if the induration prevails.

### Tretinoin (Renova) [^116uJEvK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Application of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging.

Mitigation (palliation) of fine facial wrinkling may occur gradually over the course of therapy. Up to 6 months of therapy may be required before the effects are seen.

With discontinuation of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% therapy, some patients may lose the mitigating effects of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% on fine facial wrinkles. The safety and effectiveness of using RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% daily for greater than 52 weeks have not been established.

Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended may not lead to more rapid or better results, and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur.

Patients treated with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% may use cosmetics but the areas to be treated should be cleansed before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Fillers for postsurgical depressed scars after skin cancer reconstruction [^111hhLyw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Traditional scar revision has addressed issues of thickness with intralesional corticosteroids, superficial contours with dermabrasion or laser resurfacing, and postrepair erythema with hemoglobin-targeted laser therapy. Historically, collagen fillers have been used to address several types of scars, including acne, varicella, and trauma, as well as larger soft tissue contour defects. With the introduction of new types of fillers to the dermatologic surgeon's armamentarium, many types of scars with longer lasting results can be addressed. Success has been noted with the use of these newer and more durable fillers, such as hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxylapatite, to fill and blend postsurgical depressed scars following the reconstruction of skin cancer defects.

### The use of silicone adhesives for scar reduction [^114egSBo]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Significance: This article discusses the history and developments of silicone gel sheeting (SGS) scar therapy. Furthermore, we review a breadth of literature to gain an insight into how and why topical silicone gels remain the favored treatment of medical experts in scar management. We also analyze an ever increasing number of alternative therapies claiming to provide enhanced scar reduction performance. Recent Advances: Topical silicone gel treatments seem to remain the first point of clinical recommendation in scar management. SGS has been used in scar therapy for over 30 years, during which its efficacy has been the subject of numerous clinical evaluations. Critical Issues: While the exact mechanisms by which SGS improves hypertrophic scars, keloid development and recovery are yet to be fully agreed upon, its ability to do so remains largely undisputed at present. However, there still is ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized. Future Direction: The clinical support of topical silicone gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the internationally recommended first-line form of scar management, and favored by consensus among healthcare professionals. However, there still remains the need for further clinical evidence and a better understanding of the mechanism behind the benefit of silicone gel for use in the prevention of abnormal scarring.

### High energy, double pass helium plasma dermal resurfacing: a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study [^117E8VC5]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the event of hypertrophic scar formation, common mitigation measures include early treatment with topical steroid cream, intralesional steroid and/or 5‐fluorouracil injections, and laser treatment of hypervascular scar tissue. Another mitigation approach that remains under investigation involves the use of laser (ablative fractional) assisted topical drug delivery to enable both limited debulking of hypertrophic scar tissue and delivery of steroid and/or antimetabolite drugs to the remaining hypertrophic scar tissue. Subjects with hypertrophic scarring in this study were treated with topical and/or intralesional steroids, intralesional 5‐fluorouracil, and vascular laser therapy (532 nm/1064 nm) with resolution in two of eight subjects by the 180‐day posttreatment visit (e.g. Figure 5); the remaining six AEs are responding to treatment and are expected to resolve with acceptable outcomes.

Acne/milia (n = 17 mild severity, n = 3 moderate severity) appeared to be related to COVID‐19 face‐covering mask use in some of the subjects as the lesions were in the area covered by the facial mask. No specific intervention/therapy was needed in 14 events whereas topical medication was used in two events and milia extractions were performed in two subjects (four events). Most (70%) acne/milia events were resolved by the 180‐day posttreatment visit with the remainder having resolved subsequently. Telangiectasia (n = 5 mild severity and n = 1 moderate severity) resolved in 50% subjects by the 180‐day posttreatment visit. One subject with ongoing telangiectasia was treated successfully with a pulsed 532 nm/1064 nm NdYAG vascular laser. Discoloration/hypopigmentation (n = 3 mild) resolved in two of three subjects by the 180‐day posttreatment visit and was ongoing in one subject that completed and exited the study and maybe more appropriately termed "relative hypopigmentation" due to contrast from baseline increased pigment in adjacent nontreated skin. Eye irritation (n = 1 moderate severity) was resolved by the 90‐day follow‐up visit with ocular lubricant drops as the sole intervention.

### Updated international clinical recommendations on scar management: part 2 – algorithms for scar prevention and treatment [^1164Aa9T]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 2002, an international advisory panel was convened to assess the scientific literature and develop evidence-based guidance for the prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring. Emerging clinical data, new treatment options, and technical advances warranted a renewed literature search and review of the initial advisory panel recommendations.

Objective

To update the management algorithm for pathologic scarring to reflect best practice standards at present.

Materials and Methods

Management recommendations were derived from clinical evidence amassed during a comprehensive literature search and from the clinical experience and consensus opinion of advisory panel members.

Results

A combination approach using multiple modalities provides the maximum potential for successful treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The advisory panel advocates a move toward more aggressive initial management of keloids, including earlier application of 5-fluorouracil. A growing body of clinical research supports a place in therapy for newer agents (e.g., bleomycin, onion extract, imiquimod, mitomycin C) and laser therapy (pulsed-dye, fractional) for scar management.

Conclusion

Prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring requires individualized care built upon the principles of evidence-based medicine and continues to evolve in step with technological and scientific advances.

### Clinical evaluation of a new self-drying silicone gel in the treatment of scars: a preliminary report [^111UXb2e]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Topical silicone gel sheeting and intralesional steroids are the only evidence-based recommendable forms of treatment to control the quality of a scar. The advantages and disadvantages of both are well known. This study was undertaken to verify the efficacy of a new topical silicone treatment: a self-drying spreadable gel that needs no means of fixation and cannot be seen because of complete transparency. Fresh surgical scars treated with the tested product showed significantly better outcomes than those untreated in a prospective trial involving a group of 160 patients. Patient compliance was particularly good, especially for scars on exposed areas such as the face, where the traditional gel sheeting is frequently discontinued at an early stage by patients who object to its visibility. The results of the self-drying silicone gel have indeed been satisfactory. Considering the effective results obtained and the good patient compliance, the authors currently rate this concept of treatment as the first choice for preventing hypertrophy of recent scars.

### Acne scarring: a review and current treatment modalities [^111BahJm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne is a prevalent condition in society and often results in secondary damage in the form of scarring. Of course, prevention is the optimal method to avoid having to correct the physically or emotionally troublesome scars. However, even with the best efforts, scars will certainly arise. This article attempts to give a broad overview of multiple management options, whether medically, surgically, or procedurally based. The hope is that a general knowledge of the current available alternatives will be of value to the physician when confronted with the difficult task of developing a treatment plan for acne-scarred individuals, even in challenging cases.

### Immediately injections of botulinum toxin A after surgical excision for ear keloids: a retrospective study [^116PDqAn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The ear keloids are hypertrophic scars that commonly arise in the ear region that mostly affect patients' psychosocial. Although different therapies have been reported to prevent or treat ear keloids, successful treatment remains difficult, and few treatment modalities have been proven ideal. First-line treatment of keloids including steroid creams and silicone creams have been shown to have little, if any, benefit. The surgical shave excision with radiation therapy may delivered to healthy surrounding tissues. It is, therefore, clear that a simple, safe, and effective treatment for ear keloids is greatly needed.

In recent years, injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) were proposed for the treatment of established scars in clinical investigation and could be an effective treatment. To this day, its potential mechanism theory still remains unclear. Currently, there are no studies evaluating immediate injections of BTX-A after surgical excision for ear keloids treatment. We conducted the study to investigate the safety and efficacy of intralesional BTX-A for the early postsurgical treatment of ear keloids using objective measurements. At the end of the follow-up period, most subjects showed significant reduction after treatment in comparison to that before treatment with more degree of clinical improvement. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of immediate injections of BTXA after surgical excision to make recommendations for the management of ear keloids.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116LqUs2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the past decade, many high-quality studies have been conducted, and the level of evidence for many treatment or prevention regimens has strengthened. As reflected in my reprised review here, these changes have led to pathologic scar management strategies that now effectively and safely prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate these pernicious scars. However, given ethnic differences in pathologic scar propensity, prevention and treatment algorithms should be optimized for each human race by means of international collaboration.

keloid Treatment

Keloid treatment starts with determining the keloid number and size (Fig. 2): this indicates the strength of the patient's keloid risk factors. If there is one keloid or the keloids are small, skin tension is probably the cause. However, if there are multiple or large keloids, genetic and systemic factors should be considered, especially when keloids are on different body regions. Single or small keloids can be treated with conservative therapy. Thick, large, multiple keloids should be assessed for surgery plus adjuvant therapy because they respond poorly to topical drugs. Physicians must carefully discuss therapeutic options with the patient and establish treatment goals.

Keloid inflammation generally worsens over time. Because scar massage, ablative lasers, and surgical monotherapy provoke inflammation and worsen keloids, they should be avoided.

Gel Sheets

The meta-analysis of O'Brien and Jonesshowed that silicone gel sheets alone can reduce keloid thickness and erythema.

Corticosteroid Injection

Many studies show that intralesional corticosteroid injections induce keloid regression. – However, combining corticosteroid injections with 5-fluorouracil, pulsed-dye laster, or cryotherapy has better outcomes than corticosteroid injections alone.

### Laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars [^113FMBuS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic and keloid scars are common skin conditions resulting from abnormal wound healing. They can cause itching, pain and have a negative physical and psychological impact on patients' lives. Different approaches are used aiming to improve these scars, including intralesional corticosteroids, surgery and more recently, laser therapy. Since laser therapy is expensive and may have adverse effects, it is critical to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of this therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.

Objectives

To assess the effects of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.

Search Methods

In March 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL EBSCO Plus and LILACS. To identify additional studies, we also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for treating hypertrophic or keloid scars (or both), comparing laser therapy with placebo, no intervention or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted the data, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and carried out GRADE assessments to assess the certainty of evidence. A third review author arbitrated if there were disagreements.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs, involving 604 participants (children and adults) with study sample sizes ranging from 10 to 120 participants (mean 40.27). Where studies randomised different parts of the same scar, each scar segment was the unit of analysis (906 scar segments). The length of participant follow-up varied from 12 weeks to 12 months. All included trials had a high risk of bias for at least one domain: all studies were deemed at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. The variability of intervention types, controls, follow-up periods and limitations with report data meant we pooled data for one comparison (and only two outcomes within this). Several review secondary outcomes - cosmesis, tolerance, preference for different modes of treatment, adherence, and change in quality of life - were not reported in any of the included studies. Laser versus no treatment: We found low-certainty evidence suggesting there may be more hypertrophic and keloid scar improvement (that is scars are less severe) in 585-nm pulsed-dye laser (PDL) -treated scars compared with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 3.45; two studies, 60 scar segments). It is unclear whether non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) impacts on hypertrophic scar severity when compared with no treatment (very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether fractional carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser impacts on hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with no treatment (very low-certainty evidence). Eight studies reported treatment-related adverse effects but did not provide enough data for further analyses. Laser versus other treatments: We are uncertain whether treatment with 585-nm PDL impacts on hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with intralesional corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), intralesional Fluorouracil (5-FU) or combined use of TAC plus 5-FU (very low-certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether erbium laser impacts on hypertrophic scar severity when compared with TAC (very low-certainty evidence). Other comparisons included 585-nm PDL versus silicone gel sheeting, fractional CO 2 laser versus TAC and fractional CO 2 laser versus verapamil. However, the authors did not report enough data regarding the severity of scars to compare the interventions. As only very low-certainty evidence is available on treatment-related adverse effects, including pain, charring (skin burning so that the surface becomes blackened), telangiectasia (a condition in which tiny blood vessels cause thread-like red lines on the skin), skin atrophy (skin thinning), purpuric discolorations, hypopigmentation (skin colour becomes lighter), and erosion (loss of part of the top layer of skin, leaving a denuded surface) secondary to blistering, we are not able to draw conclusions as to how these treatments compare. Laser plus other treatment versus other treatment: It is unclear whether 585-nm PDL plus TAC plus 5-FU leads to a higher percentage of good to excellent improvement in hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with TAC plus 5-FU, as the certainty of evidence has been assessed as very low. Due to very low-certainty evidence, it is also uncertain whether CO 2 laser plus TAC impacts on keloid scar severity compared with cryosurgery plus TAC. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser plus intralesional corticosteroid diprospan plus 5-FU on scar severity compared with diprospan plus 5-FU and about the effect of helium-neon (He-Ne) laser plus decamethyltetrasiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane cream on scar severity compared with decamethyltetrasiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane cream. Only very low-certainty evidence is available on treatment-related adverse effects, including pain, atrophy, erythema, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, regrowth, hyperpigmentation (skin colour becomes darker), and depigmentation (loss of colour from the skin). Therefore, we are not able to draw conclusions as to how these treatments compare. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars. The available information is also insufficient to perform a more accurate analysis on treatment-related adverse effects related to laser therapy. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, conflicting results, study design issues and small sample sizes, further high-quality trials, with validated scales and core outcome sets should be developed. These trials should take into consideration the consumers' opinion and values, the need for long-term follow-up and the necessity of reporting the rate of recurrence of scars to determine whether lasers may achieve superior results when compared with other therapies for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.

Other Hypertrophic Scar Therapies

Other therapies have been proposed for hypertrophic scars. Some may also be suitable for keloids. The evidence level is generally low. One is adipose tissue transplantation by using lipotransfer and lipoinjection techniques. A recent reviewnoted that adipose-derived stem cells can secrete trophic factors that alter fibrotic and remodeling mediator expression. The evidence is too limited to justify changes in clinical practice. A recent reviewof case series studies showed that cryotherapy is safe and achieves good scar reduction, albeit with some adverse effects (depigmentation, recurrence, pain).

Recent meta-analyses and reviewsshow that 5-fluorouracil injections are effective as a monotherapy but reduce hypertrophic scar and keloid elevation and erythema better when combined with triamcinolone acetonide injections. Intralesional botulinum toxin type A (Botox; Allergan, Inc. Dublin, Ireland) injections may improve and prevent hypertrophic scars and keloids by suppressing scar tension and fibroblast activities. Recent randomized controlled trials, show that postsurgical Botox injections prevent hypertrophic scar development. A meta-analysis of 14 studiesshowed that, compared to placebo, Botox injections significantly improved hypertrophic scar and keloid appearance and width.

A meta-analysisof five trials showed that bleomycin injections improved hypertrophic scars and keloids more effectively than triamcinolone acetonide and/or 5-fluorouracil injections. A 14-study review on topical onion extract gel (a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) reported that 11 detected beneficial effects on hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Oral tranilast (an antiallergic drug) improves inflammatory diseases with few adverse effects. It has long been used in Japan to treat hypertrophic scars and keloids.– Randomized controlled trials showed that tranilast improved hypertrophic scars and keloids and reduced the redness of new postsurgical hypertrophic scars.

### Successful treatment of depressed, distensible acne scars using autologous fibroblasts: a multi-site, prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^112Rybnx]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Of all the skin changes possible after inflammatory and nodulocystic acne eruptions of the face, including postacne erythema, dyschromia, and scarring, scarring leaves the most potentially permanent, cosmetically and psychologically devastating effects. Active acne, and probably facial acne scarring, is associated with negative psychosocial effects and poor quality of life. Acne scarring may not resolve spontaneously, and procedural interventions including surgery are required to reverse these skin changes. Acne scarring can be classified morphologically into atrophic or hypertrophic, or more specifically boxcar or fixed, icepick, and distensible or rolling scars. As expected given the diversity of acne scarring morphology and severity, certain treatment modalities are more effective with certain subgroups of scarring. For example, distensible scars are amenable to volumetric correction with dermal fillers. Even with the development of new treatment options, multiple treatment modalities are likely to be required to treat acne-scarred individuals.–

The advent of dermal fillers began with bovine collagen usage in the 1980s. In a small series, bovine collagen was shown to have efficacy in the treatment of acne scarring. Several studies have characterized the effectiveness and longevity of different types of permanent and semipermanent dermal fillers in the treatment of acne scarring. Such fillers include hyaluronic acid (HA)-based products with varying degrees of cross-linking. These HA products have themselves been shown to stimulate endogenous collagen formation over time, which could contribute to sustained volumetric correction of treated scars, but the use of dermal fillers is not without risk, and an awareness of existing treatment algorithms is needed to manage potential complications. Classically, device treatments such as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing have been considered first-line treatment of atrophic acne scarring.–Most recently, fractional carbon dioxide (CO 2) ablative laser was used successfully to treat atrophic acne scarring in a small randomized controlled, blinded evaluation. Subjects received three treatments at 4- to 5-week intervals. The authors concluded that acne scars can be safely improved using ablative fractional CO 2 laser resurfacing, with improvement seen as soon as after 1 month and sustained 6 months after treatment. They noted that the use of higher energy levels might have improved the results and possibly induced significant adverse effects.

The purpose of the study was to compare the safety and efficacy profile of autologous fibroblast treatments (LaViv, azficel-T, Fibrocell Sciences, Inc, Exton, PA) of moderate to severe depressed, distensible acne scars with that of vehicle control treatments.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116X5LTW]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid Tape and Plaster

As with hypertrophic scars, corticosteroid tape and plaster is the first-line keloid therapy in the 2019 Japanese guideline. Its long-term, continuous application softens and then flattens the mass. It also reduces pruritus and erythema. Figure 5 shows a steroid plaster–treated keloid. However, in my experience, rapidly growing keloids cannot be stopped by steroid tape and plaster alone, and this therapy must be combined with triamcinolone acetonide injections or other methods. The greatest advantages of steroid tape and plaster are its painlessness and few side effects. Strong steroid (deprodone propionate) plaster, which is available only in Japan, is more effective than fludroxycortide tape. It should become available worldwide for treating pathologic scars.

Fig. 5.
Treatment of keloids using deprodone propionate plaster. (Left) Pretreatment view. (Right) Three years after starting deprodone propionate plaster. A 40-year-old woman developed a keloid on her left shoulder as a result of folliculitis. She was treated with deprodone propionate plaster for 24 hours/day. The patient changed the tape every day and continued to use it for 3 years. Six months after starting this therapy, the scar became soft. In the ensuing 3 years, the scar became almost flat.

Corticosteroid Ointment and Cream

Case series studies showed that multiple daily corticosteroid cream applications had excellent to good effects on existing keloidsand reduced recurrence to 14.3 percent when applied postoperatively. However, a limitation is that the cream is easily rubbed off.

Cryotherapy

Recent reviews, showed that cryotherapy (monotherapy or with triamcinolone acetonide injection) effectively reduces keloid size. Cryotherapy methods include direct contact, sprays, – and intralesional needles. However, supporting evidence is limited to case series studies.

Antitumor and Immunosuppressive Agents

Recent meta-analyses, reviews, and new randomized controlled trials – show that intralesional 5-fluorouracil injection is an effective keloid monotherapy and reduces postoperative recurrence. – They also show that 5-fluorouracil effectively reduces keloid elevation and erythema when combined with triamcinolone acetonide injections. – A meta-analysisreported that bleomycin injections improve keloids more effectively than triamcinolone acetonide and/or 5-fluorouracil injections.

### The use of dermabrasion to achieve natural-looking areolas following breast reduction or mastopexy: a study of 23 patients [^114pidrH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although obtaining symmetrical breasts with good projection and a correctly positioned nipple-areola complex are the main objectives after breast reduction (BR) or mastopexy (MP), the importance of areola esthetics should not be underestimated. In this study, the authors discuss the use of dermabrasion for another purpose, which is to achieve a more natural areola with a smooth, natural border and depigmentation.

Methods

Twenty-three patients who had undergone BR surgery (18) or MP (5) between 2012 and 2014 were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 25.5 (range 19–43). Dermabrasion of the areola was performed using a diamond-type fraise to obtain a smooth transition from the border of the areola to the depigmented areola zones.

Results

The patients were followed up for 15 months on average (range 12–18 months). In a survey administered 1 year after surgery, the patients were asked to score their new areola on a scale of 0–10. The mean score was 8.6 (range 4–10). Three patients were re-operated due to the persistence of the sharp border due to insufficient dermabrasion. One patient had a hypertrophic scar and another had hyperpigmentation.

Conclusions

Satisfactory and a more natural areola can be obtained using dermabrasion with few complications in BR or MP patients. Therefore, this technique may be considered a complementary procedure for motivated and voluntary patients ready to accept the disadvantages of a secondary procedure.

### Update in scar revision [^1171bWwu]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Scar revision is indicated in certain situations for cosmetic and functional reasons. Improvement is not feasible with all scars; expectations must be tempered and realistic goals set. There is no generic approach to timing or technique in scar revision. Certain scars will benefit from revision at 6 to 12 months after the inciting traumatic event; others from much earlier intervention. Most scars will show degrees of improvement for up to 1 year. Many scars, however, may benefit from earlier treatment, including dermabrasion. The decision to revise a scar must be reached by patient and surgeon, with realistic expectations and the end-point clearly established. The simplest and most direct approach. should then be taken to reach this goal.

### Pressure-garment therapy for preventing hypertrophic scarring after burn injury [^116dfY9F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Burn damage to skin often results in scarring; however in some individuals the failure of normal wound-healing processes results in excessive scar tissue formation, termed 'hypertrophic scarring'. The most commonly used method for the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scarring is pressure-garment therapy (PGT). PGT is considered standard care globally; however, there is continued uncertainty around its effectiveness.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of pressure-garment therapy for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring after burn injury.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers on 8 June 2023 with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGT (alone or in combination with other scar-management therapies) with scar management therapies not including PGT, or comparing different PGT pressures or different types of PGT.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion using predetermined inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 15 studies in this review (1179 participants), 14 of which (1057 participants) presented useable data. The sample size of included studies ranged from 17 to 159 participants. Most studies included both adults and children. Eight studies compared a pressure garment (with or without another scar management therapy) with scar management therapy alone, five studies compared the same pressure garment at a higher pressure versus a lower pressure, and two studies compared two different types of pressure garments. Studies used a variety of pressure garments (e.g. in-house manufactured or a commercial brand). Types of scar management therapies included were lanolin massage, topical silicone gel, silicone sheet/dressing, and heparin sodium ointment. Meta-analysis was not possible as there was significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. Main outcome measures were scar improvement assessed using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) or the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) (or both), pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence to therapy. Studies additionally reported a further 14 outcomes, mostly individual scar parameters, some of which contributed to global scores on the VSS or POSAS. The amount of evidence for each individual outcome was limited. Most studies had a short follow-up, which may have affected results as the full effect of any therapy on scar healing may not be seen until around 18 months. PGT versus no treatment/lanolin We included five studies (378 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on whether PGT improves scars as assessed by the VSS compared with no treatment/lanolin. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, adverse events, and adherence. No study used the POSAS or assessed quality of life. One additional study (122 participants) did not report useable data. PGT versus silicone We included three studies (359 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT compared with silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, adherence, and other scar parameters. It is possible that silicone may result in fewer adverse events or better adherence compared with PGT but this was also based on very low-certainty evidence. PGT plus silicone versus no treatment/lanolin We included two studies (200 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on whether PGT plus silicone improves scars as assessed by the VSS compared with no treatment/lanolin. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, and adverse events. No study used the POSAS or assessed quality of life or adherence. PGT plus silicone versus silicone We included three studies (359 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT plus silicone compared with silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence. PGT plus scar management therapy including silicone versus scar management therapy including silicone We included one study (88 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT plus scar management therapy including silicone versus scar management therapy including silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence. High-pressure versus low-pressure garments We included five studies (262 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of high pressure versus low pressure PGT on adverse events and adherence. No study used the VSS or the POSAS or assessed pain, pruritus, or quality of life. Different types of PGT (Caroskin Tricot + an adhesive silicone gel sheet versus Gecko Nanoplast (silicone gel bandage)) We included one study (60 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of Caroskin Tricot versus Gecko Nanoplast on the POSAS, pain, pruritus, and adverse events. The study did not use the VSS or assess quality of life or adherence. Different types of pressure garments (Jobst versus Tubigrip) We included one study (110 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the adherence to either Jobst or Tubigrip. This study did not report any other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to recommend using either PGT or an alternative for preventing hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. PGT is already commonly used in practice and it is possible that continuing to do so may provide some benefit to some people. However, until more evidence becomes available, it may be appropriate to allow patient preference to guide therapy.

### A preliminary report of the biochemical and clinical effects of 1, 4-diaminobutane on prevention of human hypertrophic scars [^116hm7NT]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic scar formation remains a poorly understood disorder in postsurgical and trauma patients, although studies of its pathogenesis have been reported. Current treatment modalities rely on steroid injection, silicone gel and pressure garments, in addition to 5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy in keloids, although these scars are different in their pathogenesis. Results to date remain unreliable requiring invasive or cumbersome long-term treatment. We began these studies to attempt to control fibrous proliferation in hypertrophic scars. This led to the discovery of an enzyme-mediated cross-linking of precursor type III collagen in the wound, which forms a nidus for subsequent type III and type I collagen to form fibrils in the ongoing formation of scar. This study analyzes the mechanism of action of a biochemical inhibitor of the responsible enzyme, tissue transglutaminase, in reducing the cross-linking of the fibrous tissue matrix and also shows clinical evidence of objective improvement in the scar structurally by scar hardness using durometry and by patient assessment using the validated Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.

### Silicon gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars [^111iXFc2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Keloid and hypertrophic scars are common and are caused by a proliferation of dermal tissue following skin injury. They cause functional and psychological problems for patients, and their management can be difficult. The use of silicon gel sheeting to prevent and treat hypertrophic scarring is still relatively new, and started in 1981 with treatment of burn scars.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of silicon gel sheeting for: (1) prevention of hypertrophic or keloid scarring in people with newly healed wounds (e.g. post surgery); (2) treatment of established scarring in people with existing keloid or hypertrophic scars.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from searches of the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched September 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005); MEDLINE (1989 to June 2002); EMBASE (1988 to May 2002); CINAHL (1982 to May 2002) and reference lists of articles and relevant reviews. The major supplier of silicon gel sheeting (Smith and Nephew) was approached for details of unpublished, ongoing and recently published trials.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, or controlled clinical trials comparing silicon gel sheeting for prevention or treatment of hypertrophic or keloid scars against no treatment, placebo, or any other treatment type except surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

All relevant trials were assessed for methodological quality. Data were extracted independently by both reviewers using a standardized form, and the results cross-checked. All trials, meeting the selection criteria were assessed for methodological quality.

Main Results

Thirteen trials, involving 559 people, ranging in age from 2 to 81 years, were included in the review. The trials compared adhesive silicon gel sheeting with control; non-silicon gel sheeting; silicon gel plates with added Vitamin E; laser therapy; triamcinolone acetonide injection, and non-adhesive silicon gel sheeting. In the prevention studies, when compared with a no treatment option; whilst silicon gel sheeting reduced the incidence of hypertrophic scarring in people prone to scarring, (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) these studies were highly susceptible to bias. Silicon gel sheeting produced a statistically significant improvement in scar elasticity, (RR 8.60, 95% CI 2.55 to 29.02), but again these studies were highly susceptible to bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials evaluating silicon gel sheeting as a treatment for hypertrophic and keloid scarring are of poor quality and highly susceptible to bias. There is weak evidence of a benefit of silicon gel sheeting as a prevention for abnormal scarring in high risk individuals but the poor quality of research means a great deal of uncertainty prevails.

### Vascular and collagen target: a rational approach to hypertrophic scar management [^115vqFou]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Herein, we have introduced and discussed a number of therapeutic options that are suitable for clinical intervention and the ongoing management of vascular- and collagen-dominant scar tissue. We believe that this alternative perspective of scar pathology offers insights to more appropriate treatment applications and the future development of therapeutic modalities with improved efficacy and fewer side effects for scar management. Of course, current therapies are still encouraged and could be combined for scar treatment.

### A preliminary report of the biochemical and clinical effects of 1, 4-diaminobutane on prevention of human hypertrophic scars [^115HdXQx]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective evidence for the role of inhibition of collagen cross-linking in human scar using a nontoxic topical inhibitor, 1,4-diaminobutane (1,4 DAB), in patients with scars at risk for hypertrophic scar formation is presented. The authors used a concentration of 1,4 DAB of 0.8% (weight/volume) in a cream base similar to Glaxal Base. Application was once per day at night. The control was treated with cream base alone. In treatment phase studies at 2 months, tissue biopsies were performed and used to determine a therapeutic effect biochemically in paired scars harvested chosen with typical hypertrophic scars at two major treatment centers. Tissue transglutaminase activity revealed a significant reduction of the ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links in the treated scars: 7.96 ± 1.51 pmol/µmol amino acid versus 14.78 ± 3.52 pmol/µmol amino acid. A subset of paired scars (n = 15) was also analyzed for soluble procollagen type III amino propeptide. The effect was a significant increase in procollagen type III amino propeptide in the scars treated with 1,4 DAB compared with sham-treated scars: 47.75 ± 4.6 µg/mg wet weight versus 39.08 ± 6.02 µg/mg wet weight, respectively. Levels of tissue 1,4 DAB was found to be twice as high in the presence of the active cream versus in the tissue of the control group. In subsequent prophylaxis studies, the authors treated 44 breast reduction patients prospectively with active cream to one or the other side in a double-blind randomized fashion. Hardness (in grams) measured using a Rex Durometer at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively along with photographs were analyzed. The mean value ± SD of 24.98 ± 1.2 g on the active side versus 31.76 ± 1.1 g on the sham side was significantly different (p < 0.05). The patient scale scores of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale were also requested by survey in a responding 27-patient subgroup at a minimum 1 year postoperatively, and the differences between the two sides were found to be statistically significant, where the mean on the active side was 14.07 ± 1.34 and the mean on the sham side was 21.41 ± 1 (p < 0.05). The results are evidence to support the use of this agent in prevention of hypertrophic scars. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Therapeutic, II.

### Topical agents for scar management: are they effective? [^112Vk34Q]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Scar formation is the body's natural healing response to reestablish dermal integrity following an injury. Excessive scarring, however, can cause significant cosmetic, functional, and psychological problems. A wide variety of topical creams, lotions, and oils are available for scar treatment or wound healing. Sieving through the options and selecting the best option for their patients can be challenging for clinicians, especially given that clinical evidence for many of the active agents in commonly used topical treatments is lacking. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of topical treatments utilized for scar management, including their mechanism of action and evidence of efficacy. As knowledge of the wound healing process is critical to understanding the effects of topical treatments, the pathophysiology of wound healing is also reviewed. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(4):421–425. </em>.

### Hypertrophic burn scar management: what does the evidence show? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^112Cr5de]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertrophic scars (HTS) are a source of morbidity for burn survivors and can present with a range of lifestyle-limiting problems. These include pruritus, pain, burning, stiffness, and contractures. Many solutions have been developed, but few have been studied in the form of a prospective, randomized control trial (RCT). Given the importance these RCTs carry in shaping the treatment of burn patients, we sought to systematically and critically review this portion of the burn literature.

Methods

PubMed was used to perform 2 separate searches with limits that included Humans, English, and Randomized Controlled Trial. A keyword search using "hypertrophic", "Scar", "burn", and "treatment" was cross-referenced with a MeSH subject-heading search using "Cicatrix, Hypertrophic" AND "Burn". Studies were then reviewed and excluded if they did not address management of burn HTS in the non-acute setting.

Results

Two literature searches resulted in a total of 32 articles. Twelve articles were excluded because they were not relevant to the topic (n = 10) or could not be obtained (n = 2). The remaining 20 articles contained 882 patients treated for hypertrophic scars. Breakdown based on topics included laser therapy (58 patients, 2 articles), silicone gel (204 patients, 7 articles), compression garment (236 patients, 4 articles), silicone + pressure (226 patients, 3 articles), topical emollients (58 patients, 2 articles), systemic therapy (62 patients, 1 article), intralesional therapy (18 patients, 1 article), and surgical treatment (20 patients, 1 article). While some articles had favorable conclusions (laser, emollients, surgical, and intralesional therapy) or unfavorable conclusions (systemic therapy), there were conflicting results on silicone and/or compression.

Conclusions

Despite hypertrophic scars being a common occurrence in burn survivors, both the number of studies and consensus for treatment are limited. Efforts to perform larger, adequately powered RCTs are needed, specifically in the areas of silicone, compression garments, and combination therapy.

### Updated international clinical recommendations on scar management: part 1 – evaluating the evidence [^1154xhom]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is an ongoing need to standardize scar management by establishing safe and effective treatment options that can be applied in routine clinical practice.

Objective

To review available data on methods for preventing and treating cutaneous scarring.

Materials and Methods

Relevant scientific literature was identified through a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE database. Additional data and published studies were submitted for consideration by members of the International Advisory Panel on Scar Management.

Results

One of the most significant advances in scar management over the past 10 years has been the broader application of laser therapy, resulting in a shift in status from an emerging technology to the forefront of treatment. Accumulated clinical evidence also supports a greater role for 5-fluourouracil in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids, particularly in combination with intralesional corticosteroids. Encouraging data have been reported for newer therapies, including bleomycin, onion extract-containing preparations, imiquimod, and mitomycin C, although methodologic limitations in available studies merit consideration. In general, clinical and aesthetic outcomes seem to be enhanced by a combination approach to treatment.

Conclusion

Advances in therapeutic options and new study data necessitate a revision of algorithms for the prevention and management of cutaneous scarring.

### Hypertrophic scars and keloids: advances in treatment and review of established therapies [^117CrT1H]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic scars and keloids can have significant detrimental effects on patients both psychosocially and functionally. A careful identification of patient risk factors and a comprehensive management plan are necessary to optimize outcomes. Patients with a history of dystrophic scarring should avoid unnecessary procedures and enhance the wound-healing process using various preventive strategies. As there is no single, fully efficacious treatment modality, prevention remains the best approach in reducing aberrant scar formation. When prevention therapies fail, keloids have been shown to be respond to a variety of therapies including topical and injectable corticosteroids, 5-fluorouracil, radiotherapy, lasers, and surgical excision, all with varying efficacies. As such, management should be tailored to the individual patient's risk factors with the use of combination therapies to reduce recurrence rates. Still, keloid and hypertrophic scar therapies are widely diverse with novel treatment modalities providing alternatives for recurring lesions. Laser-assisted drug delivery, skin priming, and novel topical therapies may provide alternative options for the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids.

### Keloids and hypertrophic scars [^114MN6P4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Keloids are an exuberant response to skin wound healing in which abundant scar tissue grows beyond the boundaries of the inciting insult. Age, race, location, family history and personal history of keloids are relevant factors concerning the risk of developing keloids. Because keloids are prone to recurrence after surgical excision, post-operative management plays an important role in the treatment of keloids. There are many modalities that can be used to treat keloids or prevent their recurrence; a multimodal approach is often necessary in difficult cases.

### Interventions for acne scars [^112xGCFo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acne scarring is a frequent complication of acne and resulting scars may negatively impact on an affected person's psychosocial and physical well-being. Although a wide range of interventions have been proposed, there is a lack of high-quality evidence on treatments for acne scars to better inform patients and their healthcare providers about the most effective and safe methods of managing this condition. This review aimed to examine treatments for atrophic and hypertrophic acne scars, but we have concentrated on facial atrophic scarring.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for treating acne scars.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to November 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which allocated participants (whether split-face or parallel arms) to any active intervention (or a combination) for treating acne scars. We excluded studies dealing only or mostly with keloid scars.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data from each of the studies included in this review and evaluated the risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and arbitration supported by a method expert as required. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported scar improvement and any adverse effects serious enough to cause participants to withdraw from the study.

Main Results

We included 24 trials with 789 adult participants aged 18 years or older. Twenty trials enrolled men and women, three trials enrolled only women and one trial enrolled only men. We judged eight studies to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. With regard to blinding we judged 17 studies to be at high risk of performance bias, because the participants and dermatologists were not blinded to the treatments administered or received; however, we judged all 24 trials to be at a low risk of detection bias for outcome assessment. We evaluated 14 comparisons of seven interventions and four combinations of interventions. Nine studies provided no usable data on our outcomes and did not contribute further to this review's results. For our outcome 'Participant-reported scar improvement' in one study fractional laser was more effective in producing scar improvement than non-fractional non-ablative laser at week 24 (risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 12.84; n = 64; very low-quality evidence); fractional laser showed comparable scar improvement to fractional radiofrequency in one study at week eight (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.68; n = 40; very low-quality evidence) and was comparable to combined chemical peeling with skin needling in a different study at week 48 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.67; n = 26; very low-quality evidence). In a further study chemical peeling showed comparable scar improvement to combined chemical peeling with skin needling at week 32 (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.75; n = 20; very low-quality evidence). Chemical peeling in one study showed comparable scar improvement to skin needling at week four (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; n = 27; very low-quality evidence). In another study, injectable fillers provided better scar improvement compared to placebo at week 24 (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.59; n = 147 moderate-quality evidence). For our outcome 'Serious adverse effects' in one study chemical peeling was not tolerable in 7/43 (16%) participants (RR 5.45, 95% CI 0.33 to 90.14; n = 58; very low-quality evidence). For our secondary outcome 'Participant-reported short-term adverse events', all participants reported pain in the following studies: in one study comparing fractional laser to non-fractional non-ablative laser (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; n = 64; very low-quality evidence); in another study comparing fractional laser to combined peeling plus needling (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16; n = 25; very low-quality evidence); in a study comparing chemical peeling plus needling to chemical peeling (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.20; n = 20; very low-quality evidence); in a study comparing chemical peeling to skin needling (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; n = 27; very low-quality evidence); and also in a study comparing injectable filler and placebo (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.10 to 11.10; n = 147; low-quality evidence). For our outcome 'Investigator-assessed short-term adverse events', fractional laser (6/32) was associated with a reduced risk of hyperpigmentation than non-fractional non-ablative laser (10/32) in one study (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.45; n = 64; very low-quality evidence); chemical peeling was associated with increased risk of hyperpigmentation (6/12) compared to skin needling (0/15) in one study (RR 16.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 258.36; n = 27; low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the reported adverse events with injectable filler (17/97) compared to placebo (13/50) (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.27; n = 147; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of high-quality evidence about the effects of different interventions for treating acne scars because of poor methodology, underpowered studies, lack of standardised improvement assessments, and different baseline variables. There is moderate-quality evidence that injectable filler might be effective for treating atrophic acne scars; however, no studies have assessed long-term effects, the longest follow-up being 48 weeks in one study only. Other studies included active comparators, but in the absence of studies that establish efficacy compared to placebo or sham interventions, it is possible that finding no evidence of difference between two active treatments could mean that neither approach works. The results of this review do not provide support for the first-line use of any intervention in the treatment of acne scars. Although our aim was to identify important gaps for further primary research, it might be that placebo and or sham trials are needed to establish whether any of the active treatments produce meaningful patient benefits over the long term.

Corticosteroid Ointment and Cream

Randomized controlled trials on corticosteroid ointment and cream are lacking, but a case series studyshowed that triamcinolone acetonide injections of hypertrophic scar and keloid-excision sites combined with twice-daily 6-month corticosteroid ointment application yielded keloid and hypertrophic scar recurrence rates of 14.3 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively. These outcomes and good clinical experiences recently led several Japanese burn and scar societies, to recommend corticosteroid ointment and cream materials for superficial dermal burnsand hypertrophic scar prevention and treatment. However, since corticosteroid ointment and cream should be applied four times daily to generate steroid tape and plaster effects, patient education is necessary.

Laser

Two reviews, and a meta-analysisshowed that pulsed-dye laser significantly reduces hypertrophic scar erythema and pruritus – because its wavelength (585 to 595 nm) reaches the hypertrophic scar angiogenic region: its heat reduces hypertrophic scar blood flow and therefore inflammation. Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser (532/1064 nm) has similar effects, as shown by a review, a meta-analysis, case-series studies, and a randomized controlled trial. Randomized controlled trials showed that nonablative/ablative carbon dioxide fractional lasers have no beneficial effects. Fully ablative laser therapy is not recommended for pathologic scars because of high recurrence.

### Commonly recommended moisturising products: effect on transepidermal water loss and hydration in a scar model [^1122s7NT]. Burns (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Moisturizing is a widely recommended and accessible approach to scar management, yet objective evidence supporting the efficacy of commonly used products remains limited. Research suggests that moisturizers may reduce hypertrophic scar activity by normalising transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and enhancing skin hydration.

Aim

This study aimed to provide insights into the effect of generic moisturizers on TEWL and hydration in a scar model, helping clinicians make informed recommendations for scar treatment.

Methods

The performance of eight moisturizing products were evaluated using a tape-stripping method on normal skin to simulate the elevated TEWL conditions observed in active scars. Thirty participants were recruited based on power calculations, with TEWL and hydration measurements recorded at baseline and hourly for four hours. Untreated tape-stripped areas served as controls for each participant.

Results

Eucerin demonstrated the highest efficacy, significantly increasing hydration and normalising TEWL. Sorbolene ranked second, showing notable improvements in both hydration and TEWL regulation. Alhydran produced mixed results, effectively normalizing TEWL but reducing hydration. QV Lotion increased hydration but had minimal impact on TEWL. Aqueous Cream exhibited a non-significant trend toward TEWL normalisation. The silicone gel sheet provided high hydration levels but caused elevated TEWL after removal due to rapid evaporation of retained moisture. Liquid silicone (Strataderm) and BioOil performed poorly, with negligible effects on hydration and TEWL.

Conclusion

These findings reveal significant variability in the effectiveness of common scar management products, emphasising the limited utility of liquid silicones compared to basic moisturizers. Products with balanced formulations of humectants, emollients, and occlusives showed objective evidence to indicate efficacy in managing hypertrophic scars during their active phase. This study offers evidence-based guidance for clinicians and highlights the need for further research to optimise formulations for scar management.

### ArteFill permanent injectable for soft tissue augmentation: II. indications and applications [^113mW6Ev]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Complications

Errors of Technique

Because of its long-lasting effect, ArteFill demands a good technique and does not favor those who fail to heed the guidelines that are the product of long experience.
Uneven distribution in the form of a string of pearls can be compensated by a second implantation of ArteFill into the gaps.
The most common mistake resulting in incomplete or inadequate treatment is placing the ArteFill too deep (into the subcutaneous fat). The implantation must be redone correctly.
Implantation too superficially may cause long-lasting redness and itching, which can be treated with corticosteroid cream or intradermal corticosteroid injections.

Ridges and Nodules

Ridges or intradermal nodules can occur a few weeks following a too superficial (intradermal) injection of ArteFill (Fig. 3). Constant muscle movement appears to push the intradermal implant to be more superficial. Ridges or superficial nodularity can be easily removed by dermabrasion or tangential shaving without creating a noticeable scar because "exposed" ArteFill implants will epithelialize just like normal abraded skin. Dislodged nodules caused by intramuscular implantation may be softened by intralesional corticosteroid injections or, if palpable intraorally, may be excised. Excision of a nodule should always be performed thoroughly and completely since any residual ArteFill may potentially cause secondary hypertrophic scarring.

Hypertrophic Scarring

This phenomenon may occur in certain patients prone to keloid formation (Asians and African Americans) after superficial implantation of ArteFill. The therapy of choice is intralesional triamcinolone injections, which may level but do not narrow the scar.

Long-Lasting Redness or Telangectasia

This occurrence is usually caused by dilated capillaries, especially if extremely thin skin overlies the implant. This can be treated and resolved by laser or Intense-Pulse-Light (IPL) therapy.

### Topical treatments for hypertrophic scars [^111trh3p]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic scars represent an abnormal, exaggerated healing response after skin injury. In addition to cosmetic concern, scars may cause pain, pruritus, contractures, and other functional impairments. Therapeutic modalities include topical medications, intralesional corticosteroids, laser therapy, and cryosurgery. Topical therapies, in particular, have become increasingly popular because of their ease of use, comfort, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. This review will discuss the properties and effectiveness of these agents, including pressure therapy, silicone gel sheeting and ointment, polyurethane dressing, onion extract, imiquimod 5% cream, and vitamins A and E in the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars.

### Management of acne scarring, part II: a comparative review of non-laser-based, minimally invasive approaches [^113t3c7F]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Acne scarring is a commonly encountered yet extremely challenging problem to treat for the dermatologist. As acne scarring can lead to significant psychological distress and low self-esteem, it is of utmost importance to have effective and satisfying treatments in the physician's armamentarium. However, many treatments are unsatisfying, leading to patient disappointment and frustration. Although early treatment of acne lesions and inflammation with isotretinoin is beneficial in preventing acne scarring, many patients still present with troubling noticeable scars. Despite the advances in pharmacology and technology, scar treatment still remains suboptimal and is tainted with several adverse effects. However, some treatments can provide benefits. This review article exhaustively discusses and analyzes the various minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of acne scarring with an emphasis on pharmacologic agents, such as isotretinoin for atrophic acne scars and corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic drugs for hypertrophic scars. Intralesional injections of corticosteroids are efficacious in reducing keloid scar formation in addition to preventing recurrence following surgical excision. In-office and minimally invasive procedural management, including chemical peels, dermabrasion, tissue augmentation, and punch excision is also discussed. Superficial chemical peels are efficacious in treating atrophic scars with relatively few adverse effects and complications. Although dermabrasion is used less often with the advent of laser resurfacing, this technique remains as a viable option for those with atrophic scars. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can be managed successfully with topical agents such as azelaic acid and hydroquinone. The efficacy of various treatment modalities is highlighted with a focus on choosing the correct modalities for specific scar types.

### Effectiveness and safety of an overnight patch containing allium cepa extract and allantoin for post-dermatologic surgery scars [^117UKM4A]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Following surgical procedures or injury, cutaneous scars can develop due to production of collagen-rich connective tissue. These scars may be accompanied by redness, itching, pain, and restricted mobility of the skin. Typically, after a few weeks, the scar matures, becoming lighter and narrower, although full maturation of a scar may take up to 2 years. In some cases, however, cutaneous scars can become hypertrophic or result in keloids.

Preventing pathological scarring and keloids is much easier that treating them later and should be started as early as possible after the injury or surgery. Ointments containing onion extract and occlusion by silicone sheets or gels are commonly recommended to prevent excessive scarring. Other noninvasive measures include topical compounds, tapes, compression bandages, physiotherapeutic measures, and therapeutic ultrasound. Invasive measures for treating scars and keloids include injections with various agents, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and other surgical procedures. Topical treatments, in particular, are considered appropriate for all kinds of scars, irrespective of scar size or patient age.

A topical gel containing onion (Allium cepa) extract and allantoin has been available for more than 60 years treating, preventing, and reducing dermatologic scars and keloids. Onion extract is reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-proliferative, and regenerative activities, while allantoin is reported to have keratolytic, hydrating, epithelizing, and anti-irritant activities. Several clinical trials have confirmed that this gel is well tolerated and helps prevent pathological scarring and improves preexisting scars.

Combining onion extract and allantoin with occlusion has been reported to provide optimal results. An occlusive overnight intensive patch medical device (OIP) containing onion extract and allantoin was recently developed to provide optimal scar healing and improved convenience for the patient. The OIP features an occlusive active release liner with an adhesive layer separated by a micro-air cushion seal, and it can be cut to size for small scars or placed side-by-side for larger scars. In contrast to the gel, which must be applied twice daily, the OIP only needs to be applied once daily.

Here we describe the results of an intra-individual randomized controlled study confirming the efficacy and safety of the OIP for treating post-dermatologic surgery scars.

### A randomized, double-blind, active-and placebo-controlled trial evaluating a novel topical treatment for keloid scars [^114JBhCQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Keloid and hypertrophic scars are fibroproliferative disorders resulting from abnormal wound healing in genetically susceptible individuals. Current therapies are often ineffective. Kynurenine shows promise as a topical treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars. In this study, healthy adult male and female subjects seeking treatment for mature keloid scars were enrolled. Subjects were randomized in double-blind fashion to receive kynurenic acid 0.5% (FS2) cream (Group 1), an active onion extract comparator treatment (Group 2), or the inactive vehicle (Group 3). Each treatment was applied twice-daily. Qualitative assessments were made using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), as well as the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scales (POSAS). Among subjects in Group 1, there was a substantial decrease in mean PGSS scores after 30 days of treatment that continued to trend downward, becoming significant versus Group 2 at days 90 and 180 (P&lt;0.05) and versus Group 3 at day 180 (P&lt;0.01). Based on mean VSS scores, subjects in Group 1 achieved beneficial effects that became significant versus Group 2 at day 90 (P&lt;0.01), day 120 (P&lt;0.05), and day 180 (P&lt;0.001) and versus Group 3 at day 180 (P&lt;0.05). There were no significant improvements in Groups 2 or 3. There were no adverse events or local skin reactions. The twice-daily application of FS2 Cream represents a potentially new and effective treatment for mature keloid scars. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(9):964–968. doi:10.36849/JDD.6197.

### International clinical recommendations on scar management [^115r4D8Z]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Many techniques for management of hypertrophic scars and keloids have been proven through extensive use, but few have been supported by prospective studies with adequate control groups. Several new therapies showed good results in small-scale trials, but these have not been repeated in larger trials with long-term follow-up. This article reports a qualitative overview of the available clinical literature by an international panel of experts using standard methods of appraisal. The article provides evidence-based recommendations on prevention and treatment of abnormal scarring and, where studies are insufficient, consensus on best practice. The recommendations focus on the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids, and are internationally applicable in a range of clinical situations. These recommendations support a move to a more evidence-based approach in scar management. This approach highlights a primary role for silicone gel sheeting and intralesional corticosteroids in the management of a wide variety of abnormal scars. The authors concluded that these are the only treatments for which sufficient evidence exists to make evidence-based recommendations. A number of other therapies that are in common use have achieved acceptance by the authors as standard practice. However, it is highly desirable that many standard practices and new emerging therapies undergo large-scale studies with long-term follow-up before being recommended conclusively as alternative therapies for scar management.

### Effectiveness and safety of an overnight patch containing allium cepa extract and allantoin for post-dermatologic surgery scars [^111av9Yj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Subjects

Adults (≥ 18 years of age) who had undergone dermatologic surgery were considered for inclusion in the study if they had at least two newly formed scars 1–10 cm in length on similar body regions. The subjects had to be enrolled within 3 weeks after the surgery but after the wounds were closed, the scars were controlled and, if applicable, the suture material had been removed. Included subjects could not have had a known history of keloids or hypertrophic scars. Additional exclusion criteria included dermatologic resurfacing procedures or noninvasive skin-tightening procedures, such as medium or deep chemical peeling, dermabrasion, or laser therapy in the area intended to be treated within 8 weeks before enrollment; an infection, a wound, or eczema in the skin area intended to be treated; known hypersensitivity to any ingredient in the OIP; or an ongoing severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, malignant tumor, or known human immunodeficiency virus infection. Subjects could also not be taking or planning to take systemic corticosteroids or topical corticosteroids for the skin area intended to be treated. Women could not be pregnant or breastfeeding and, if of childbearing potential, had to be using an effective method of birth control.

### Prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids by the prophylactic use of topical silicone gel sheets following a surgical procedure in an office setting [^115e8i8X]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Topical silicone gel sheeting has been used for more than 20 years to help reduce the size of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Its clinical efficacy and safety is well established.

Objective

To determine whether topical silicone gel sheeting can be used to prevent hypertrophic scars and keloids from forming following dermatologic skin surgery.

Methods

Patients undergoing skin surgery were stratified into two groups: those with no history of abnormal scarring (low-risk group) and those with a history of abnormal scarring (high-risk group). Following the procedure, patients within each group were randomized to receive either routine postoperative care or topical silicone gel sheeting (48 hours after surgery). Patients were followed for 6 months.

Results

In the low-risk group, there were no statistical differences between individuals using routine postoperative care or using topical silicone gel sheets. In the high-risk group, there was a statistical difference (39% versus 71%) between patients who did not develop abnormal scars and used topical silicone gel sheeting and patients who developed abnormal scars after routine postoperative treatment. Those individuals having a scar revision procedure also showed a statistical difference if topical silicone gel sheeting was used following surgery.

Conclusion

Topical silicone gel sheeting, with a 20-year history of satisfaction in dermatology, now appears to be useful in the prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids in patients undergoing scar revision.

### A prospective, randomised, double-blinded trial to study the efficacy of topical tocotrienol in the prevention of hypertrophic scars [^114cszvU]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread beliefs regarding the use of topical tocotrienol in the prevention of hypertrophic scars, there is very little evidence from well controlled and randomised clinical trials to justify its benefits for surgical scars.

Objective

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of topical tocotrienol in preventing the development of hypertrophic scars.

Methods

A prospective, randomised, double-blinded study was performed on 122 patients with recently healed (< 2 weeks) surgical scars, who were randomised into either a treatment group with 5% topical tocotrienol or a placebo group. The patients were required to apply the preparation to their scars twice a day for 6 weeks starting at 2 weeks after surgery. Assessments of the scars were performed at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 16 following the onset of topical application using three methods: a clinical assessment using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), a photographic scar assessment by two independent assessors using a visual analogue scale and laser Doppler imaging (LDI). Data analysis was performed on 85 patients (tocotrienol group: 45 patients; placebo group: 40 patients), who had completed four assessments.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in scar parameters between the tocotrienol and the placebo groups in the POSAS, photographic scar assessment or mean flux of LDI (p > 0.05) categories. The mean LDI flux showed a decreasing trend over time, which was positively correlated with vascularity (correlation coefficient = 0.325, p = 0.008) and total scores (correlation coefficient = 0.248, p = 0.034) of the observer scar assessment scale on week 0. No significant adverse effect was observed.

Conclusions

Twice-daily application of 5% topical tocotrienol had no significant effect on the appearance and vascularity of scars over 4 months post-surgery. LDI has a promising role as a scar assessment tool.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^1175j9V9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

hypertrophic scar Treatment

Hypertrophic scars are detected several weeks after injury (Fig. 1). They grow for 3 to 6 months; if risk factors are minor, they then plateau and regress spontaneously. This process can be accelerated by the following conservative therapies, which reduce hypertrophic scar volume and suppress pain and itch. Hypertrophic scars rarely require surgery unless they contract and cause joint dysfunction; in this case, reconstructive surgery is indicated.

Compression Therapy

A recent meta-analysis (12 randomized controlled trials) showed that 15- to 25-mmHg compression therapy improves burn and hypertrophic scar thickness, erythema, and hardness. Compression therapy may promote wound healing by means of local vasoconstriction that limits burn-induced inflammation.

Gel Sheets

Gel sheets are soft and self-adhesive. A meta-analysis (20 trials)reported that continuous gel sheeting improves hypertrophic scar maturation. A new meta-analysison this question is currently underway: it will be of interest to learn their findings.

The type of material may not matter: a randomized controlled trialshowed that silicone and hydrocolloid matrix gel sheets reduce hypertrophic scar dimensions equally well. More important may be patient education: a randomized controlled trialon burn and hypertrophic scar patients suggests that instructional handouts and videotapes increase gel sheet effectiveness. Computer analysis suggests that gel sheets may prevent hypertrophic scar formation and promote hypertrophic scar maturation by limiting wound and scar tension.

Scar Massage

Randomized controlled trials on burn rehabilitation massage have conflicting results, and a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials concluded that the supporting evidence is weak. I advise caution regarding massage therapy. Wound healing associates with initial inflammation that normally slowly wanes. At this point, massage may promote mature scarring. However, in patients with risk factors, inflammation rises rather than subsides. Because massage stretches the scar, it could induce and worsen hypertrophic scars and keloids. Thus, scar massage in high-risk patients should be avoided.

### Silicone gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars [^113Jg2sU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Keloid and hypertrophic scars are common and are caused by a proliferation of dermal tissue following skin injury. They cause functional and psychological problems for patients, and their management can be difficult. The use of silicone gel sheeting to prevent and treat hypertrophic scarring is still relatively new and started in 1981 with treatment of burn scars.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of silicone gel sheeting for:(1) prevention of hypertrophic or keloid scarring in people with newly healed wounds (e.g. post surgery);(2) treatment of established scarring in people with existing keloid or hypertrophic scars.

Search Methods

In May 2013 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL for this second update.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, or controlled clinical trials, comparing silicone gel sheeting for prevention or treatment of hypertrophic or keloid scars with any other non surgical treatment, no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed all relevant trials for methodological quality. Three review authors extracted data independently using a standardised form and cross-checked the results. We assessed all trials meeting the selection criteria for methodological quality.

Main Results

We included 20 trials involving 873 people, ranging in age from 1.5 to 81 years. The trials compared adhesive silicone gel sheeting with no treatment; non silicone dressing; other silicone products; laser therapy; triamcinolone acetonide injection; topical onion extract and pressure therapy. In the prevention studies, when compared with a no treatment option, whilst silicone gel sheeting reduced the incidence of hypertrophic scarring in people prone to scarring (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.98) these studies were highly susceptible to bias. In treatment studies, silicone gel sheeting produced a statistically significant reduction in scar thickness (mean difference (MD) -2.00, 95% CI -2.14 to -1.85) and colour amelioration (RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.15) but again these studies were highly susceptible to bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak evidence of a benefit of silicone gel sheeting as a prevention for abnormal scarring in high-risk individuals but the poor quality of research means a great deal of uncertainty prevails. Trials evaluating silicone gel sheeting as a treatment for hypertrophic and keloid scarring showed improvements in scar thickness and scar colour but are of poor quality and highly susceptible to bias.

### Subdermabrasion in the treatment of post-burn facial hypertrophic scars [^115xpDjx]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic scars cause great discomfort to the patient and pose a challenge for the reconstructive surgeon. This is particularly true in the facial area. Optimal function and aesthetic appearance are the main goals of reconstruction. We suggest an adjunct to the surgical management of facial hypertrophic scars which involves abrasion of the subdermal plane. The technique consists of removal of all scarred skin from the aesthetic unit, dermabrasion of subcutaneous tissues, including the muscular surface (subdermabrasion), and a full thickness skin grafting. This technique was applied in a young patient with hypertrophic burn scars of the chin. Biopsy confirmed our basic assumption that hypertrophic scars extend into the muscular plane.

### Lasers for scars: a review and evidence-based appraisal [^1122diBc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Numerous treatment modalities are available for scar management depending upon scar characteristics, age and patient expectations. The focus of this article is to review commonly used nonsurgical methods of scar revision. These include topical applications (e.g., silicone, vitamin E, pressure dressing, herbal extracts), intralesional medication (e.g., steroids, antimitotics), soft-tissue augmentation (e.g., collagen, fat), laser applications (e.g., 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye, CO2), cryotherapy and make-up camouflage. Nonsurgical modalities can be used as prophylactic prevention of adverse scar formation, as definitive treatment, as intervening therapy until further surgical repair can be made, or as adjunctive treatment following surgical scar revision. There are several laser systems available that permit successful treatment of various types of scars. The 585-nm PDL remains the gold standard for laser treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Although atrophic scars may best be treated with ablative CO2 and Er:YAG lasers, the intense interest in procedures with reduced morbidity profiles has increased the popularity of nonablative laser procedures. This paper will focus on the use of lasers for scar revision.

### Comparison of intense pulsed light to 595-nm long-pulsed pulsed dye laser for treatment of hypertrophic surgical scars: a pilot study [^116VyR3k]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The short-pulsed pulsed dye laser (PDL) has been previously reported to improve the appearance of hypertrophic scars. Prolonged purpura following treatment led to the development of the newer long-pulsed pulsed dye laser (LPDL). Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been extensively used to improve the various components of photo damage and to reduce the incidence of purpura, but its effect on scars has not been analyzed. The objective of this pilot study was to prospectively determine and compare the safety and efficacy of LPDL and IPL on surgically induced scars.

Methods

Breast reduction scars (N = 10 scars) and abdominoplasty scars (N = 5 scars) were treated using both LPDL and IPL. For breast reduction scars, one side was treated with each technique. For abdominoplasty scars, one half of the scar was treated with each device. Two treatments were performed 2 months apart. Physician global assessment scores of improvement were determined by side-by-side comparison of preoperative and randomly presented postoperative photographs. Patient pain scores during treatment were also obtained and the presence of post, treatment purpura was assessed.

Results

Mean improvement on a 0 to 3 point scale was 2.2 (55%) after the first LPDL treatment and 3.2 (80%) after the second. Mean improvement was 1.8 (45%) after the first IPL treatment and 2.6 (65%) after the second. Differences in improvement between the LPDL and IPL sides were not statistically significant. Patients rated IPL as more painful than LPDL. The incidence of post-treatment purpura was lower with IPL.

Conclusions

This pilot study suggests that LPDL and IPL are equally effective in improving the appearance of hypertrophic surgical scars. IPL offers a novel method of treating scars that minimizes the risk of purpura.

### Silicone gel sheeting for treating hypertrophic scars [^116iJEj1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Each year, in high-income countries alone, approximately 100 million people develop scars. Excessive scarring can cause pruritus, pain, contractures, and cosmetic disfigurement, and can dramatically affect people's quality of life, both physically and psychologically. Hypertrophic scars are visible and elevated scars that do not spread into surrounding tissues and that often regress spontaneously. Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is made from medical-grade silicone reinforced with a silicone membrane backing and is one of the most commonly used treatments for hypertrophic scars.

Objectives

To assess the effects of silicone gel sheeting for the treatment of hypertrophic scars in any care setting.

Search Methods

In April 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with any hypertrophic scars and assessed the use of SGS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. We resolved initial disagreements by discussion, or by consulting a third review author when necessary.

Main Results

Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 10 to 60 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in duration of follow-up, and scar site. We report 10 comparisons, SGS compared with no SGS treatment and SGS compared with the following treatments: pressure garments; silicone gel; topical onion extract; polyurethane; propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting; Kenalog injection; flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser; intense pulsed light and Gecko Nanoplast (a silicone gel bandage). Six trials had a split-site design and three trials had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). Included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcomes of severity of scarring measured by health professionals and adverse events (limited data reported by some included studies, but further analyses of these data was not possible) and no data were reported for severity of scarring reported by patients. For secondary outcomes some pain data were reported, but health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness were not reported. Many trials had poorly-reported methodology, meaning the risk of bias was unclear. We rated all evidence as being either of low or very low certainty, often because of imprecision resulting from few participants, low event rates, or both, all in single studies. SGS compared with no SGS Seven studies with 177 participants compared SGS with no SGS for hypertrophic scars. Two studies with 31 participants (32 scars) reported severity of scarring assessed by health professionals, and it is uncertain whether there is a difference in severity of scarring between the two groups (mean difference (MD) -1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.77 to 0.12; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for serious imprecision). One study with 34 participants suggests SGS may result in a slight reduction in pain level compared with no SGS treatment (MD -1.26, 95% CI -2.26 to -0.26; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). SGS compared with pressure garments One study with 54 participants was included in this comparison. The study reported that SGS may reduce pain levels compared with pressure garments (MD -1.90, 95% CI -2.99 to -0.81; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). SGS compared with silicone gel One study with 32 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with silicone gel (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.88 to 1.68; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, twice for imprecision). SGS compared with topical onion extract One trial (32 participants) was included in this comparison. SGS may slightly reduce severity of scarring compared with topical onion extract (MD -1.30, 95% CI -2.58 to -0.02; low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and once for imprecision). SGS compared with polyurethane One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on the severity of scarring assessed by health professionals compared with polyurethane (MD 0.50, 95% CI -2.96 to 3.96; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, and twice for imprecision). SGS compared with self-adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting One study with 38 participants was included in this comparison. It is uncertain if SGS reduces pain compared with self-adhesive propylene glycol and hydroxyethyl cellulose sheeting (MD -0.12, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.06). This is very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for imprecision and once for indirectness. SGS compared with Gecko Nanoplast One study with 60 participants was included in this comparison. It is unclear if SGS impacts on pain compared with Gecko Nanoplast (MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.28 to 1.68; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. There was a lack of reportable data from the other three comparisons of SGS with Kenalog injection, flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser or intense pulsed light.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently limited rigorous RCT evidence available about the clinical effectiveness of SGS in the treatment of hypertrophic scars. None of the included studies provided evidence on severity of scarring validated by participants, health-related quality of life, or cost effectiveness. Reporting was poor, to the extent that we are not confident that most trials are free from risk of bias. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision-making in the use of SGS to treat hypertrophic scars.

### Comparison of leniScar silicone stick (ansCare) with traditional silicone gel (dermatix ultra) in wound scar prevention and removal [^115cVkoN]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The numbers of aesthetic surgical procedures are increasing around the world. After the surgery, scars are problematic for both the surgeons and patients. In many studies, silicone has proven effective in ameliorating keloids and hypertrophic scars and in preventing scar formation. – In 1983, Perkins et alfound that silicone gel sheeting prevented scar formation after burn injury. In 1989, Ahn et alproved the effectiveness of silicone gel sheeting in preventing scarring in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. In 2008, Mustoepublished a clinical guideline, based on evidence-informed medicine, about the treatment of scars, stating that only 2 methods have proven to be efficient: silicone gel sheeting and intralesional steroid injection. In 2006, in a systematic review of 13 studies (which included 559 patients) in the Cochrane Database, O'Brien and Panditconfirmed the prevention effect of silicone gel sheeting in patients who were prone to form scars and that the silicone gel sheeting was also effective in increasing the elasticity of the scars, which helped further lighten the color of red scars.

For scar prevention, silicone was used in the form of silicone gel sheeting in early studies and later in the form of silicone gel, which was easier to use. Patients are less likely to use silicone gel sheeting for several reasons. First, it needs to be cleaned every day, which is inconvenient for most patients. Second, it is not easy to apply at joints and in hair-bearing areas. The sensation of a foreign body also bothers patients, which makes consistent usage difficult and thus renders treatment less effective. Therefore, gel forms have replaced the sheet forms, especially in exposed areas such as the face, neck, and arms. Several recent studies have shown that silicone gel is at least as effective as silicone gel sheeting in treating scars, but it is more comfortable, much easier to use, and more cosmetically favorable; thus, patients prefer using silicone gel.

### Nonsurgical management of hypertrophic scars: evidence-based therapies, standard practices, and emerging methods [^115GP8Pj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic scars, resulting from alterations in the normal processes of cutaneous wound healing, are characterized by proliferation of dermal tissue with excessive deposition of fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix proteins, especially collagen, over long periods, and by persistent inflammation and fibrosis. Hypertrophic scars are among the most common and frustrating problems after injury. As current aesthetic surgical techniques become more standardized and results more predictable, a fine scar may be the demarcating line between acceptable and unacceptable aesthetic results. However, hypertrophic scars remain notoriously difficult to eradicate because of the high recurrence rates and the incidence of side effects associated with available treatment methods. This review explores the various treatment methods for hypertrophic scarring described in the literature including evidence-based therapies, standard practices, and emerging methods, attempting to distinguish those with clearly proven efficiency from anecdotal reports about therapies of doubtful benefits while trying to differentiate between prophylactic measures and actual treatment methods. Unfortunately, the distinction between hypertrophic scar treatments and keloid treatments is not obvious in most reports, making it difficult to assess the efficacy of hypertrophic scar treatment.

### Comparing the efficacy of multiple drugs injection for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloid: a network meta-analysis [^113nargy]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

It should be acknowledged that this network meta-analysis has certain limitations. First, there are great differences in the usage and dosage of drugs between different clinical studies, which may lead to different research conclusions. Second, the follow-up duration of these RCTs was inconsistent, ranging from 12 weeks to 22 months; this may also lead to differences between trials. Third, the population included in the study had some regional and ethnic limitations. Fourth, we still cannot rule out the possibility that the conclusions were influenced by publication bias. Last, our study was not investigated the other drugs.

### The use of fluid silicone gels in the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116q5To9]. Burns (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Silicone products, either as a sheet or in fluid form, are universally considered as the first line therapy in the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. However, the study results have been questioned by different authors and there has never been a large systematic synopsis published on the efficacy of fluid silicone gels. This systematic review aims to elucidate the available evidence of the results obtained by fluid silicone gels and present a complete and comprehensive overview of the available literature as well as a meta-analysis of the pooled data.

Methods

A systematic search for articles concerning the use of silicone gel in the treatment and prevention of scars was performed on 3 different databases (Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane library) according to the PRISMA statement. Only RCT's were included. Qualitative assessment was done by 2 separate reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 2) assessment tool. Revman 5.4.1 software was used for meta-analysis.

Results

The search yielded 507 articles. Two articles were identified through other sources. After deduplication and removal of ineligible records, 340 records were screened on title and abstract. Full text screening was done for 23 articles and ultimately 18 articles were included. A meta-analysis comparing fluid silicone gel to no treatment or placebo gels was conducted.

Conclusion

Studies on the effects of liquid silicone gels on hypertrophic scars are numerous and this systematic review shows that the use of liquid silicone gels is associated with both a prophylactic and a curative effect on scars. However, a considerable amount of the available 'high evidence' trials are at a high risk for bias and it is uncertain whether or not the effects of silicone gels are comparable to silicone sheets and if the additional components present in many silicone gels are partially responsible for their scar improving capacity.

### Reducing risks of facial scarring [^116uKtVN]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for the formation of facial scars include skin type, ethnicity, scar location, and certain medical conditions that contribute to poor or delayed healing. Risk of scar can be reduced with appropriate surgical planning, including proper placement and design of incisions, meticulous skin closure, aseptic technique, and wound care to improve healing. Common pathologic scars include hypertrophic scars and keloid scars, each of which has unique approaches to surgical revision and medical treatment due to their respective risks of recurrence. Topical scar therapies, medical therapies, and surgical revision techniques for improvement in final scar appearance are discussed.

### Manual fractional technology with COLaser combined with transdermal drug delivery for hypertrophic scar: a retrospective study [^116XDQTs]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Prepare a mixed solution with normal saline as solvent, 5-FU 4mg/mL + triamcinolone acetonide 10mg/mL. Anesthetic cream was applied to the lesion for one hour. Subsequently, MFT with a CO 2 laser (Incision handpiece, focal length: 100 mm, energy density: 40–60J/cm 2, pulse width: 1–3 ms, frequency: 40–60Hz, spot size: 0.5 mm, spot spacing: 3–5mm) was performed. Post-surgery, the mixture was immediately applied to the wound, allowing for spontaneous absorption over 5–10 minutes, repeated three times. Chlortetracycline hydrochloride was applied to the wound post-treatment until healed. A total of three treatments were administered; Laser therapy was performed by the same plastic surgeon.

Outcome Evaluation

The primary outcome measure was the patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS). The patient scale was self-assessed by the patient before treatment and one month after each treatment session. The observer scale was assessed from photographs by two plastic surgeons not involved in the treatment, with their average score recorded.

Secondary outcome measures included recurrence, adverse reactions, complication and patient satisfaction, gathered retrospectively through online surveys during treatment and six months post-treatment.

Data Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test assessed data normality. For normally distributed measurement data, results were expressed as x ± s and analyzed using the t test; nonnormally distributed data were represented as M (P 25, P 75) and analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Enumeration data were analyzed with the chi square test or Fisher's exact probability test, while ranked data were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was employed to assess the influence of subgroup factors on time to remission. A p value below 0.05 denoted statistical significance.

### Medial epicanthoplasty with the skin-redraping technique: technical refinements for predictable outcomes [^112e9aUT]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

After surgery, the patient is closely followed up. Scar massaging with silicone gel creams is initiated from 2 weeks after the surgery. If early hypertrophic scars are observed to be developing, intralesional injections of a mixture of triamcinolone and 5-fluorouracil is administered to soften the scars. Microbotulinum toxin (1 U each side) may also be a useful additional adjunct to reduce contractile tension of the underlying musculature. In general, if required, the injections should be started 1 month after the surgery, and 1 or 2 treatments are generally sufficient to soften the scars.

Figure 2 and Supplemental Digital Content 3 show the long-term surgical outcomes of this technique. (See Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3, which shows a 38-year-old woman with a previous incision upper blepharoplasty who presented with slight upper eyelid asymmetry [right]. She requested slightly more pretarsal show and a parallel outer-type upper eyelid crease. A revision incision upper blepharoplasty [hinge upper blepharoplasty] and a skin redraping medial epicanthoplasty were performed. In the incision design, point E was not connected to the medial end of the upper eyelid incision, and was positioned 1 mm below it. In the closure of the upper eyelid incision, care was taken to firmly fixate the dermis of the medial upper eyelid crease to the pretarsal tissue to secure the medial crease firmly. [Left] Three years after surgery, a crisp, symmetric, parallel upper eyelid crease is present. The epicanthal fold was effectively corrected and the scars are virtually invisible,.)

### A preliminary report of the biochemical and clinical effects of 1, 4-diaminobutane on prevention of human hypertrophic scars [^115yPzkM]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

A role for topical 1,4 DAB in prophylaxis of hypertrophic scar is supported by the data. Its use is proposed to result in a biochemically altered matrix, which is clinically reduced in mechanical properties as measured by a durometer and modified in its structure to appear more acceptable to patients visually and functionally.

### Long-term improvement in the appearance of hypertrophic scars following a single treatment with acoustic subcision – A single center proof-of-concept study [^1168sYXh]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Improvement in the appearance of scars

Figure 4 provides a graph of the participant scar heights (mm) at baseline, 12‐ and 89‐week. The mean height reduction for participant's scars at 12‐ and 89‐week postsubcision treatment was 1.4 and 1.7 mm, respectively. This represented a 46.3% and 56.8% mean reduction from the baseline scar height. The differences in the scar height represented a statistically significant change from baseline to 12‐week as well as baseline to 89‐week as determined by ANOVA (mixed effects model) ([F [0.9847, 8.863] = 12.63″, p = 0.0065]). There was no statistical difference between scar height from 12 to 89 weeks.

Figure 4
Scar height at baseline (Week 0), 12 and 89

Figure 5 provides a graph of the participant's scar volume (mm 3) at baseline, 12‐ and 89‐week. The mean volume reduction for participant's scars at 12‐ and 89‐week was 384 and 353 mm 3, respectively. This represented a 63.2% and 58.1% mean reduction from the baseline scar volume. The differences in the scar volume represented a statistically significant change from baseline to 12‐week as well as baseline to 89‐week as determined by ANOVA (mixed effects model) [F (1.671, 14.20) = 14.38″, p = 0.0006]. There was no statistical difference between scar volume from 12 to 89 week.

Figure 5
Scar volume at baseline (Week 0), 12 and 89

Finally, Table 5 summarizes the MMSS scores for the participant's scars at baseline and 89‐week. The total MMSS score reduction (mean ± SD) from baseline was 2.9 ± 1.1. This represented a 33.7% mean reduction from the baseline MMSS score and was statistically significant (p < 0.001, t test, two‐tailed, paired).

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^111zwb33]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

LONG-TERM POSTTREATMENT FOLLOW-UP OF HYPERTROPHIC SCARS AND KELOIDS

Treated hypertrophic scar and keloid patients should be educated about scar management and followed-up over the long-term. Close follow-up allows early detection and treatment of small recurrences that respond well to steroid tape, plaster, or injection. Thus, patients should be followed up for greater than 18 to 24 months. Follow-up can stop when the scar is flat and soft.

Hypertrophic scar and keloid patients often experience psychological stress that may aggravate their scars. They may benefit from makeup or camouflage therapies – because they improve cosmetic appearance and promote beneficial physiologic changes.

### Treating scars: addressing surface, volume, and movement to expedite optimal results. part 2: more-severe grades of scarring [^116ktLdk]. Dermatologic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The management of scarring (after acne, surgery, or disease) is an ongoing challenge.

Methods

This is the second of two reviews and will use a grading scale of disease burden to classify scarred patients. Treatment discussion will concentrate on procedures exerting effect on volume and surface changes and the effects of movement.

Results

Treatment relevant to the type and severity of scarring will be discussed and tabulated treatment plans outlined.

Conclusion

Severe grades of scarring often require a combination of filling agents for volume deficit, injectable agents for hypertrophic disease, neurotoxins to effect movement, and fractionated and ablative resurfacing for surface changes.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^111hWy5P]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PAST DECADE

The past decade has seen a remarkable growth in our understanding of how hypertrophic scars and keloids develop and progress. Consequently, hypertrophic scars and keloids are now known to be caused by chronic inflammation in the reticular dermis. Risk factors associated with hypertrophic scar and keloid development and aggravation have been identified, thereby aiding treatment optimization and effectiveness. Several major advancements in preventing and treating hypertrophic scars and keloids have been made, as follows. First, deprodone propionate (a stronger steroid) plaster was found to both prevent and treat hypertrophic scars and keloids very effectively. Second, surgical methods have been optimized for each body region, thereby improving cosmetic and functional outcome, safety, and recurrence rates. Third, the postoperative radiotherapy protocol has been fine-tuned, making it safer while remaining equally effective. The previous algorithm has been greatly improved by the inclusion of these modalities. I anticipate that further high-quality evidence for these modalities, and additional new modalities, will emerge in the next decade.

Clinically Based Assessments

Patient Durometer Testing

Forty-eight breast reduction patients were enrolled and cream treatment randomized blindly to one or the other breast, once per day at night, starting at 1 week postoperatively for a 5-day run in on an intent-to-treat basis. If agreeable and tolerating the treatment at the second-week follow-up, patients were enrolled and photographed with a durometer measured as the average of three readings along the vertical breast scar using a Rex durometer (Rex Gauge Company, Inc. Buffalo Grove, Ill.) at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Duredness is a measurement of hardness recorded in grams by a pressure strain gauge, that produces a set deformational force when applied to the surface of the scar and then is compared to the opposite sham-treated side. Digital readout is compared for three separate areas on the scar and averaged. The model used was the 00, as this is best for skin measurement. The vertical scar was chosen for consistency in measuring hardness, as many of the patients underwent vertical reduction mammaplasty.

Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale

Of the 44 patients evaluated for scar duredness, 27 were assessable by returned completed survey forms at least 1 year postoperatively. The patients reported on seven parameters, rating each from 1 to 10. They were able to compare both scars with each other and the surrounding normal skin for subjective and objective criteria such as pain and itch, color, stiffness, regularity, and subjective hardness.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical methods were by Mann-Whitney U testing and Kolmogorov-Smirnov normal distribution testing on the chart data, as the sample sizes are relatively small. The paired t test was used on some sample testing because the cream and punch biopsy specimens were all taken from the patients used as their own controls, resulting in the power of the study being doubled by doing so. The 95 percent confidence level was chosen, and all the results were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level.

### Topical application of an irreversible small molecule inhibitor of lysyl oxidases ameliorates skin scarring and fibrosis [^112t3wLt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Scar formation associated with wound healing involves increased collagen deposition and crosslinking, leading to abnormal reorganization of the ECM. Aberrant and excessive deposition of type I collagen in the ECM is key to the development and maintenance of hypertrophic scars. Underpinning this is the relative stability of mature cross-linked collagen and its resistance to degradation. Therefore, limiting the extent of crosslinking during scar formation may enhance scar appearance and pliability.

The clear clinical need for therapeutics to ameliorate scarring has driven drug development approaches. Activation of the TGFβ3 pathway (avotermin, discontinued 2011) and inhibition of CTGF signalingdid not provide significant clinical benefits. It is possible that targeting fibrosis in the active wound healing phase, and upstream of the ECM generation, may be less efficacious due to the extensive redundancies in skin repair mechanisms. Targeting of collagen crosslinking, as the final step in stable collagen deposition in the ECM, has the potential to be more successful. Alternative approaches, including microRNA-29, are now currently being trialed for scarring (NCT03601052). However, cutaneous injections such as those required for the delivery of therapeutic in the microRNA-29 study pose significant challenges for effective delivery, especially in the context of larger wounds. These can be overcome with the use of a highly permeable anti-fibrotic cream formulation as demonstrated with PXS-6302.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^111v9Zwt]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Early detection and FIRST-LINE hypertrophic scar and keloid treatment

Hypertrophic scars and keloids should be detected early because they may respond well to conservative therapy. As discussed later, the first-line conservative therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids in the 2019 Japanese guidelineis long-term/continuous steroid tape or plaster application. Strong steroid (deprodone propionate) plaster effectively extinguishes early hypertrophic scars and keloids, but is only available in Japan. Nevertheless, if applied very early and continuously, even weaker fludroxycortide tape can extinguish early hypertrophic scars and keloids.

### Needs assessment for cosmetic dermatologic surgery [^1143zCmS]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Cosmetic procedures have been an integral part of dermatologic surgery for over half a century, with a more recent proliferation of devices to improve skin color and texture and modify subcutaneous fat. Overall, cosmetic dermatologic procedures are extremely safe. However, detailed information about safety and effectiveness, and especially comparative effectiveness, is not available for many procedures. There are few randomized control trials of comparative effectiveness of different procedures for similar indications. Key comparative effectiveness studies are briefly reviewed, and areas of substantial deficiency in such research are highlighted.

### Management of keloids and hypertrophic scars [^112VDHmt]. American Family Physician (2009). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for keloids and hypertrophic scars, more specifically with respect to management of inadequate response, AAFP 2009 guidelines recommend to offer combination therapy (surgery, silicone sheeting, and corticosteroid injections) as a second-line option when first-line treatments for keloids and hypertrophic scars fail.

### Topical silicone gel versus placebo in promoting the maturation of burn scars: a randomized controlled trial [^116yuCDz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Silicone sheets are widely used in the treatment of hypertrophic scars, although application around joints may cause limited adherence and reduced movement. To approach these problems, a topical silicone gel was developed that can be applied easily in a thin layer, and that is nonrestrictive and less apparent. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of topical silicone gel in promoting the maturation of burn scars.

Methods

Forty-six scars on 23 patients were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject comparative, double-blinded, clinical trial and followed for 1 year. The mean age of the scars at inclusion was 4 months. Effectiveness on scar quality was evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale and the DermaSpectrometer. Significance was tested using repeated measures analyses and Wilcoxon paired-sample signed rank tests.

Results

Over all visits, the benefit on surface roughness was statistically significant (p = 0.012). At individual time points, the surface of the topical silicone gel-treated scars showed significantly less roughness (p = 0.014) at 3 months after start of the treatment, and the topical silicone gel-treated scars were significantly less itchy (p = 0.018 and p = 0.013, respectively) at 3 and 6 months.

Conclusion

Topical silicone gel significantly improves the surface roughness of burn scars, and patients experience significantly less itching in the first half year after application.

### Comparison of efficacy of silicone gel, silicone gel sheeting, and topical onion extract including heparin and allantoin for the treatment of postburn hypertrophic scars [^1131khUY]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

We compared the efficacy of silicone gel (Scarfade), silicone gel sheet (Epi-Derm), and topical onion extract including heparin and allantoin (Contractubex) for the treatment of hypertrophic scars. Forty-five postburn scars were included in the study. Patients with scars less than 6 months from injury were assigned at random to three groups each containing 15 scars, and their treatment was continued for 6 months. Scars were treated with Scarfade, Epiderm and Contractubex. Scar assessment was performed at the beginning of the treatment, and at the end of the sixth month when the treatment was completed by using the Vancouver scar scale. The difference between before and after treatment scores for each three groups was statistically significant. The difference between Scarfade group and Epi-Derm group was not significant; however, the differences of the other groups (Scarfade-Contractubex, Epiderm-Contractubex) were significant. Silicone products, either in gel or sheet, are superior to Contractubex in the treatment of the hypertrophic scar. The therapist should select the most appropriate agent according to the patient's need and guidelines of these signs.

### Management of keloids and hypertrophic scars [^117BCCSj]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars represent an exuberant healing response that poses a challenge for physicians. Patients at high risk of keloids are usually younger than 30 years and have darker skin. Sternal skin, shoulders and upper arms, earlobes, and cheeks are most susceptible to developing keloids and hypertrophic scars. High-risk trauma includes burns, ear piercing, and any factor that prolongs wound healing. Keloid formation often can be prevented if anticipated with immediate silicone elastomer sheeting, taping to reduce skin tension, or corticosteroid injections. Once established, however, keloids are difficult to treat, with a high recurrence rate regardless of therapy. Evidence supports silicone sheeting, pressure dressings, and corticosteroid injections as first-line treatments. Cryotherapy may be useful, but should be reserved for smaller lesions. Surgical removal of keloids poses a high recurrence risk unless combined with one or several of these standard therapies. Alternative postsurgical options for refractory scars include pulsed dye laser, radiation, and possibly imiquimod cream. Intralesional verapamil, fluorouracil, bleomycin, and interferon alfa-2b injections appear to be beneficial for treatment of established keloids. Despite the popularity of over-the-counter herb-based creams, the evidence for their use is mixed, and there is little evidence that vitamin E is helpful.

### Updated scar management practical guidelines: non-invasive and invasive measures [^111BcZJw]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic scars and keloids can be aesthetically displeasing and lead to severe psychosocial impairment. Many invasive and non-invasive options are available for the plastic (and any other) surgeon both to prevent and to treat abnormal scar formation. Recently, an updated set of practical evidence-based guidelines for the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids was developed by an international group of 24 experts from a wide range of specialities. An initial set of strategies to minimize the risk of scar formation is applicable to all types of scars and is indicated before, during and immediately after surgery. In addition to optimal surgical management, this includes measures to reduce skin tension, and to provide taping, hydration and ultraviolet (UV) protection of the early scar tissue. Silicone sheeting or gel is universally considered as the first-line prophylactic and treatment option for hypertrophic scars and keloids. The efficacy and safety of this gold-standard, non-invasive therapy has been demonstrated in many clinical studies. Other (more specialized) scar treatment options are available for high-risk patients and/or scars. Pressure garments may be indicated for more widespread scarring, especially after burns. At a later stage, more invasive or surgical procedures may be necessary for the correction of permanent unaesthetic scars and can be combined with adjuvant measures to achieve optimal outcomes. The choice of scar management measures for a particular patient should be based on the newly updated evidence-based recommendations taking individual patient and wound characteristics into consideration.

### Fluocinolone acetonide (Xilapak) [^114po34q]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

For alleviating tension on the scar and its surrounding skin. Tension on a wound and scar is known to increase scar tissue formation.

Because of its adherence, silicone tape reduces tension (e.g. tear and stretch) along the incision line or wound which is known to minimize the degree of scarring in terms of spreading or thickening.

### Cutaneous scarring: pathophysiology, molecular mechanisms, and scar reduction therapeutics part II. strategies to reduce scar formation after dermatologic procedures [^113xDkEe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The evidence base underpinning most traditional scar reduction approaches is limited, but some of the novel strategies are promising and accumulating. We review a number of commonly adopted strategies for scar reduction. The outlined novel agents are paradigmatic of the value of translational medical research and are likely to change the scenery in the much neglected but recently revived field of scar reduction therapeutics.

### Effectiveness and safety of an overnight patch containing allium cepa extract and allantoin for post-dermatologic surgery scars [^1171H8Sh]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Our results agree with other studies showing that the onion extract and allantoin used in the OIP are effective and well tolerated for treating, reducing, and preventing hypertrophic scars and keloids. Mild-to-moderate irritation at or eczema around the treated scar were reported by a few patients, most of whom had allergies. Patients with allergies should therefore be monitored for possible reactions to the OIP.

This study had some limitations. First, this study did not compare the effects of the OIP with occlusion alone or with gel alone, so it did not allow conclusions to be drawn about relative efficacy or safety or about the contributions of each component to overall efficacy. Rather, the study was intended to confirm that the OIP improved scar healing and that it is well accepted and tolerated by patients. A previous study by Hosnuter et al. however, found that optimal results are obtained using the combination of topical onion extract–allantoin gel and a silicone gel sheet. A second limitation is that within-treatment comparisons between post-treatment and baseline measurements could have been biased by the observer's expectations, especially for subjects, who knew which scar had been treated with the OIP. These biases, at least for the investigator's assessments, should have been accounted for by blinding and randomization. A further potential limitation is that the study did not meet the primary objective of showing a significant difference in the observer-blinded POSAS at week 12. However, significant differences were detected at weeks 6 and 24, and according to investigators and subjects, the treated scar was more improved than the untreated scar at all time points. This lack of a significant difference at week 12 in the observer-blinded POSAS could be due to the dynamics of scar healing combined with the limitations of digital imaging.

In conclusion, the current study confirmed that the OIP can be safely used to promote scar healing after minor dermatologic surgery. The device is convenient and comfortable, making it an excellent choice for dermatologists and their patients.

### The use of silicone gel in the treatment of fresh surgical scars: a randomized study [^114Tpaks]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness of a silicone gel in treating surgical wounds compared with a control group of the same phenotype and same scar site for which a placebo was advised.

Methods

This was a randomized controlled trial, carried out in a dermatology department of a university hospital. In total, we studied 110 patients (55 men, 55 women) who had undergone outpatient surgery at the Department of Dermatology, University of Florence, between May and July 2005. The patients were divided into two groups: a treatment group (group A) and a control group (group B). Subjects (n = 65) in group A were prescribed silicone gel to be applied to the wound twice a day for 60 days after the removal of stitches. Subjects (n = 45) in group B were prescribed the use of zinc oxide cream. All subjects, in both study and control groups, were examined by the same dermatologists every month for 3 months after surgery, then every 2 months for a total follow-up of 8 months from the date of surgery.

Results

In the treatment group, only 18 patients (27%) had formation of a nonphysiological scar: diastasic scar in 10 patients (15%), hypertrophic scar in 6 (9%) and atrophic scar in 2 (3%). No keloid scars were recorded. In the control group, 25 (55%) had an altered scar: keloid scars in 5 patients (11%), hypertrophic scar in 10 (22%), diastasic scar in 8 (18%) and atrophic scar in 2 (4%).

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that silicone gel is able to reduce the formation of keloid and hypertrophic scars and the signs/symptoms associated with the healing process (paraesthesia, pulling sensation, alterations in colour).
