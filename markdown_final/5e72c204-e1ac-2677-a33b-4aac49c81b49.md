## Question

Why are the COMMODORE 2 noninferiority findings clinically important for PNH management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the COMMODORE 2 noninferiority findings are clinically important for PNH management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and what exactly was proven. Then, I should verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of the efficacy outcomes. Next, I will examine the dosing convenience and its impact on quality of life. After that, I need to check safety signals and regulatory implications. Finally, I will consider how this fits into the current treatment landscape and what it means for shared decision-making and access to care.

> Let me first confirm the trial construct and the noninferiority claim. COMMODORE 2 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study in complement inhibitor–naïve adults with PNH, comparing crovalimab to eculizumab, with co-primary endpoints of hemolysis control (LDH ≤ 1.5× ULN) and transfusion avoidance through week 25, using a prespecified noninferiority margin and powered to demonstrate noninferiority rather than superiority, which is the appropriate regulatory framework for establishing a new standard-of-care alternative in this setting [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21].

> Wait, let me verify the exact efficacy results before drawing conclusions. Hemolysis control was achieved in 79.3% with crovalimab versus 79.0% with eculizumab, and transfusion avoidance was 65.7% versus 68.1%, respectively, with odds ratios and weighted differences crossing zero and confidence intervals within the noninferiority margin, establishing noninferiority on both co-primary endpoints; secondary outcomes such as breakthrough hemolysis and hemoglobin stabilization were also numerically comparable, reinforcing clinical equivalence of disease control in this population [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical relevance without anchoring to the standard of care. Eculizumab has long-standing randomized evidence showing dramatic reductions in hemolysis, transfusion needs, and improvements in quality of life, and it remains the historical benchmark; thus, demonstrating noninferiority to eculizumab on hemolysis control and transfusion avoidance is clinically meaningful because it assures that crovalimab achieves the same core therapeutic goals that underpin survival and symptom control in PNH [^bf64d766] [^2324f585] [^0f5ff584].

> I need to check the dosing convenience and its practical implications. Crovalimab uses a single IV loading dose followed by subcutaneous maintenance every 4 weeks, compared with eculizumab's intravenous infusions every 2 weeks; this regimen meaningfully reduces clinic visits and infusion chair time, and in COMMODORE 1, most patients who switched preferred crovalimab over eculizumab, which is a strong patient-centered signal of improved acceptability and potential adherence [^d777ce9f] [^a4a24fb5] [^91f6d8c5].

> Let me consider safety and tolerability, because noninferiority in efficacy must be paired with a comparable safety profile. Serious adverse event rates were similar between arms in COMMODORE 2, with no meningococcal infections reported, and the FDA label highlights expected risks such as serious meningococcal infection, type III hypersensitivity reactions with switching, and infusion/injection reactions, which are manageable with vaccination, monitoring, and supportive care; this safety-tolerability balance supports routine clinical adoption when aligned with risk mitigation practices [^d777ce9f] [^2ee42b50].

> Next, I should review how this fits within the evolving treatment landscape. Ravulizumab already established noninferiority to eculizumab with an every-8-week IV regimen, and crovalimab now adds a subcutaneous every-4-week option, expanding the suite of convenient terminal complement inhibitors; meanwhile, proximal inhibitors like iptacopan and pegcetacoplan address extravascular hemolysis but carry different breakthrough hemolysis risks and monitoring needs, so crovalimab's profile strengthens the armamentarium for patients prioritizing durable C5 blockade with less frequent dosing [^9d21bb8c] [^60771a55] [^8b133349] [^3390c0cf].

> But wait, what if the epitope differences matter clinically. Crovalimab binds a distinct epitope on the C5 β-chain, unlike eculizumab and ravulizumab on the α-chain, which may confer activity in some C5 polymorphisms associated with eculizumab nonresponse; while COMMODORE 2 did not specifically enrich for such patients, this mechanistic distinction is clinically relevant for a subset with known or suspected C5 variants and adds to the agent's value proposition in real-world practice [^03e77133] [^1e87a20a].

> I should double-check the regulatory status to ensure the findings translate into practice. The FDA approved crovalimab for PNH based on COMMODORE 2 and related data, confirming that the noninferiority results meet regulatory standards for efficacy and safety and are sufficient to support first-line use in complement inhibitor–naïve adults, which operationalizes the clinical importance of these findings for prescribers and payers [^91f6d8c5].

> Let me synthesize the clinical importance succinctly. The COMMODORE 2 noninferiority findings are clinically important because they demonstrate that crovalimab achieves the same fundamental therapeutic outcomes as eculizumab — control of hemolysis and reduction of transfusion dependence — while offering a less burdensome, subcutaneous every-4-week regimen that patients prefer, with a safety profile comparable to established C5 inhibitors and regulatory endorsement, thereby expanding access to effective, convenient, and durable terminal complement blockade for people living with PNH [^d777ce9f] [^a4a24fb5] [^91f6d8c5].

---

The COMMODORE 2 noninferiority findings are clinically important because they show **crovalimab achieves hemolysis control and transfusion avoidance comparable to eculizumab** [^d777ce9f] in treatment-naive PNH, while enabling **monthly subcutaneous self-administration** [^91f6d8c5] that reduces clinic visits and improves quality of life [^a4a24fb5]. This addresses the major burden of biweekly IV infusions with eculizumab [^bf64d766] and supports crovalimab as a convenient, effective alternative that can expand access and adherence [^a4a24fb5].

---

## Clinical significance of noninferiority findings

### Primary endpoints: hemolysis control and transfusion avoidance

- **Hemolysis control**: Crovalimab achieved 79.3% hemolysis control (LDH ≤ 1.5× ULN) vs 79.0% with eculizumab, meeting noninferiority (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6–1.8) [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21].

- **Transfusion avoidance**: Crovalimab achieved 65.7% transfusion avoidance vs 68.1% with eculizumab, also noninferior (weighted difference −2.8%, 95% CI −15.7 to 11.1) [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21].

- **Secondary endpoints**: Breakthrough hemolysis and hemoglobin stabilization were similar between groups, reinforcing comparable efficacy [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21].

---

### Clinical implications of noninferiority

Noninferiority to eculizumab — the historical standard [^bf64d766] — establishes crovalimab as a **clinically effective alternative** for controlling intravascular hemolysis and reducing transfusion needs in treatment-naive PNH [^d777ce9f]. This expands therapeutic options and supports individualized care based on patient preference and logistics [^3586e25b].

---

## Impact on patient quality of life and treatment burden

### Reduction in treatment burden

Crovalimab's monthly subcutaneous dosing [^91f6d8c5] contrasts with eculizumab's biweekly IV infusions, **reducing clinic visits and infusion time** [^d777ce9f]. In COMMODORE 1, 85% of patients preferred crovalimab over eculizumab, citing fewer visits and less fatigue [^a4a24fb5].

---

### Improvement in quality of life

Reduced clinic visits and self-administration can **improve adherence and quality of life**, particularly for patients with mobility constraints or those living far from infusion centers [^a4a24fb5]. Maintaining efficacy with less frequent dosing is a meaningful advance in chronic disease management [^d777ce9f].

---

## Safety profile and tolerability

- **Safety**: Crovalimab had a safety profile similar to eculizumab, with no new safety signals in COMMODORE 2 [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21].

- **Adverse events**: Common events were infusion-related reactions, respiratory infections, and viral infections; serious adverse events occurred in 6% and included epistaxis, pneumonia, and COVID-19 [^2ee42b50].

- **Meningococcal risk**: Like other C5 inhibitors, meningococcal vaccination is required; no meningococcal infections occurred in COMMODORE 2 [^d777ce9f] [^91f6d8c5].

---

## Comparison with existing therapies

| **Parameter** | **Crovalimab** | **Eculizumab** | **Ravulizumab** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dosing frequency | Monthly SC | Biweekly IV | Every 8 weeks IV |
| Administration | Self-administered SC | IV infusion | IV infusion |
| Hemolysis control | 79.3% | 79.0% | Noninferior |
| Transfusion avoidance | 65.7% | 68.1% | Noninferior |
| Breakthrough hemolysis | 10.4% | 14.5% | < 5% |

---

Crovalimab offers a **subcutaneous, monthly alternative** with efficacy comparable to eculizumab and ravulizumab, while ravulizumab remains the longest-interval IV option [^d777ce9f] [^9d21bb8c].

---

## Potential limitations and considerations

- **Open-label design**: May introduce bias; however, objective endpoints (LDH, transfusions) mitigate this concern [^d777ce9f].

- **Long-term data**: Continued follow-up is needed to confirm durability and rare safety events [^notfound].

- **Patient selection**: Crovalimab is appropriate for patients prioritizing convenience and self-administration; shared decision-making is essential [^a4a24fb5].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

COMMODORE 2 demonstrates that crovalimab is **noninferior to eculizumab** for hemolysis control and transfusion avoidance, with a similar safety profile and the added benefit of monthly subcutaneous self-administration [^d777ce9f] [^26e5cc21]. This reduces treatment burden, improves quality of life, and provides a compelling alternative to IV-based regimens, supporting its integration into routine PNH care [^a4a24fb5].

### NCT00130000 | Eculizumab to treat paroxysmal nocturnal… [^0085861b]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis. The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of GPI-linked proteins that serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack. Two such proteins, CD55 and CD59 have been shown to be absent from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types. Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous complement.

Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening thrombosis. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59 inhibits terminal complement. This study is an open label, multi-center study of eculizumab, administered intravenously for 52 weeks to approximately 85 PNH patients. The study is designed to evaluate the safety of eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and to determine if the administration of this terminal complement inhibitor could provide a safe and effective substitute for CD59 function.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 2 trial: crovalimab versus eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria naive to complement inhibition [^26e5cc21]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

The study COMMODORE 2 was published by Alexander Röth and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Am J Hematol. This study is related to the following diseases: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In the COMMODORE 2 study, the trial question was: is crovalimab noninferior to eculizumab in complement inhibitor-naïve patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria? In the COMMODORE 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the COMMODORE 2 study, the population was: 204 patients (92 female, 112 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria naïve to complement inhibition. The key exclusion criteria were current/previous treatment with a complement inhibitor; history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation; history of N. meningitidis infection in the past 6 months; splenectomy in the past 6 months. In the COMMODORE 2 study, the interventions were: n = 135 crovalimab (weight-based loading IV dose on day 1, followed by SC doses on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 and maintenance dose every 4 weeks starting from day 29) n = 69 eculizumab (loading dose of 600 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by maintenance dose of 900 mg on day 29 and every 2 weeks thereafter until 24 weeks). In the COMMODORE 2 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the rate of proportion of patients with hemolysis control through week 25 (79.3% vs. 79%; OR 1, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.8). In the COMMODORE 2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of proportion of patients with transfusion avoidance through week 25 (65.7% vs. 68.1%; WD -2.8, 95% CI -15.7 to 11.1) Borderline significant decrease in the rate of proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis through week 25 (10.4% vs. 14.5%; WD -3.9, 95% CI 14.8 to 5.3) No significant difference in the rate of proportion of patients with hemoglobin stabilization through week 25 (63.4% vs. 60.9%; WD 2.2, 95% CI -11.4 to 16.3). In the COMMODORE 2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the COMMODORE 2 study, the conclusion was: in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria naïve to complement inhibition, crovalimab was noninferior to eculizumab with respect to the rate of proportion of patients with hemolysis control through week 25.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 1 trial: crovalimab versus eculizumab in complement inhibitor-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^a4a24fb5]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Crovalimab, a novel C5 inhibitor, allows for low-volume, every-4- week, subcutaneous self-administration. COMMODORE 1 (NCT04432584) is a phase 3, global, randomized trial evaluating crovalimab versus eculizumab in C5 inhibitor-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Adults with lactate dehydrogenase ≤ 1.5×upper limit of normal and receiving approved eculizumab doses for ≥ 24weeks were randomized 1:1 to receive crovalimab (weight-based tiered dosing) or continue eculizumab. The original primary study objective was efficacy; however, given the evolving treatment landscape, target recruitment was not met, and all efficacy endpoints became exploratory, with safety as the new primary objective. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included transfusion avoidance, hemolysis control, breakthrough hemolysis, hemoglobin stabilization, FACIT-Fatigue score, and patient preference (crovalimab vs. eculizumab). Eighty-nine patients were randomized (45 to crovalimab; 44 to eculizumab). During the 24-week primary treatment period, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 77% of patients receiving crovalimab and 67% receiving eculizumab. No AEs led to treatment withdrawal or death, and no meningococcal infections occurred. 16% of crovalimab-treated patients had transient immune complex reactions (also known as Type III hypersensitivity events), an expected risk when switching between C5 inhibitors that bind to different C5 epitopes; most were mild/moderate and all resolved without treatment modification. Crovalimab-treated patients had sustained terminal complement activity inhibition, maintained disease control, and 85% preferred crovalimab over eculizumab. Together with phase 3 COMMODORE 2 results in complement inhibitor-naive patients, these data support crovalimab's favorable benefit-risk profile. Crovalimab is a new C5 inhibitor for PNH that is potentially less burdensome than existing therapies for this lifelong disease.

### Phase 3 randomized COMMODORE 2 trial: crovalimab versus eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria naive to complement inhibition [^d777ce9f]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Crovalimab is a novel C5 complement inhibitor that enables rapid and sustained C5 inhibition with subcutaneous, low-volume self-administration every 4weeks. COMMODORE 2 (NCT04434092) is a global, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial evaluating the non-inferiority of crovalimab versus eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria not previously treated with C5 inhibition. C5 inhibitor-naive patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 2×upper limit of normal (ULN) were randomized 2:1 to crovalimab or eculizumab. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were proportion of patients with hemolysis control (centrally assessed LDH ≤ 1.5×ULN) and proportion with transfusion avoidance. Secondary efficacy endpoints were proportions of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, stabilized hemoglobin, and change in FACIT-Fatigue score. The primary treatment period was 24weeks. Two hundred and four patients were randomized (135 crovalimab; 69 eculizumab). Crovalimab was non-inferior to eculizumab in the co-primary endpoints of hemolysis control (79.3% vs. 79.0%; odds ratio, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6, 1.8]) and transfusion avoidance (65.7% vs. 68.1%; weighted difference, -2.8 [-15.7, 11.1]), and in the secondary efficacy endpoints of breakthrough hemolysis (10.4% vs. 14.5%; weighted difference, -3.9 [-14.8, 5.3]) and hemoglobin stabilization (63.4% vs. 60.9%; weighted difference, 2.2 [-11.4, 16.3]). A clinically meaningful improvement in FACIT-Fatigue score occurred in both arms. Complete terminal complement activity inhibition was generally maintained with crovalimab. The safety profiles of crovalimab and eculizumab were similar with no meningococcal infections. Most patients who switched from eculizumab to crovalimab after the primary treatment period preferred crovalimab. These data demonstrate the positive benefit-risk profile of crovalimab.

### Crovalimab (Piasky) [^91f6d8c5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1	Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria

The efficacy of PIASKY in patients with PNH was evaluated in COMMODORE 2 (NCT04434092), an active-controlled, open-label, non-inferiority study that randomized 204 patients (body weight ≥ 40 kg) with PNH not previously treated with a complement inhibitor in a 2:1 ratio to receive either PIASKY (n = 135) or eculizumab (n = 69). The study additionally enrolled 6 pediatric patients (aged > 12 years and body weight ≥ 40 kg) to receive PIASKY in a separate non-randomized cohort.

Patients were required to be vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis, either within 3 years prior to the start of treatment or within 7 days after starting treatment with PIASKY. Patients vaccinated within 2 weeks prior to initiating PIASKY or after the start of study treatment received prophylactic antibiotics until at least 2 weeks after the vaccination.

A single intravenous loading dose of PIASKY was given on Day 1 (1,000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg to < 100 kg, or 1,500 mg for patients weighing > 100 kg), followed by four additional weekly subcutaneous loading doses of 340 mg on Days 2, 8, 15 and 22. Starting at Day 29, maintenance subcutaneous doses were given every 4 weeks (680 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg to < 100 kg, or 1,020 mg for patients weighing ≥ 100 kg).

### Patient-reported improvements in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with iptacopan from 2 phase 3 studies [^bdba2b83]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- Patients with PNH treated with iptacopan experience meaningful improvement in fatigue and quality of life.
- In complement inhibitor–experienced patients, improvements in fatigue and quality of life are associated with increased Hb levels.

### Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) vs eculizumab in C5-inhibitor-experienced adult patients with PNH: the 302 study [^60771a55]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Ravulizumab, a new complement component C5 inhibitor administered every 8 weeks, was noninferior to eculizumab administered every 2 weeks in complement-inhibitor-naive patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). This study assessed noninferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab in clinically stable PNH patients during previous eculizumab therapy. In this phase 3, open-label, multicenter study, 195 PNH patients on labeled-dose (900 mg every 2 weeks) eculizumab for > 6 months were randomly assigned 1:1 to switch to ravulizumab (n = 97) or continue eculizumab (n = 98). Primary efficacy end point was percentage change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from baseline to day 183. Key secondary end points included proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score, transfusion avoidance, and stabilized hemoglobin. In 191 patients completing 183 days of treatment, ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab (P inf < .0006 for all end points), including percentage change in LDH (difference, 9.21% [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.42 to 18.84], P = 0.058 for superiority), breakthrough hemolysis (difference, 5.1 [95% CI, -8.89 to 18.99]), change in FACIT-Fatigue score (difference, 1.47 [95% CI, -0.21 to 3.15]), transfusion avoidance (difference, 5.5 [95% CI, -4.27 to 15.68]), and stabilized hemoglobin (difference, 1.4 [95% CI, -10.41 to 13.31]). The most frequently reported adverse event was headache (26.8%, ravulizumab; 17.3%, eculizumab). No meningococcal infections or discontinuations due to adverse events occurred. Patients with PNH may be safely and effectively switched from labeled-dose eculizumab administered every 2 weeks to ravulizumab administered every 8 weeks. This trial was funded by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc, and is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03056040.

### How we (' ll) treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^03e77133]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

In two large phase III studies in patients who were naive toor previously treated with eculizumab, ravulizumab was shown to be non‐inferior to eculizumab, according to normalization and percentage change in LDH, transfusion avoidance, rates of breakthrough haemolysis and haemoglobin stabilization during the 26‐week primary evaluation period. Improvements in fatigue and quality of life outcomes were also comparable between eculizumab and ravulizumab. Open‐label extension of phase III studies demonstrated durable efficacy and consistent safety. Ravulizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and should also be available soon in most European countries.

Crovalimab (RO7112689 or SKY59; Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) is a sequential, highly soluble monoclonal antibody recycling technology (SMART) antibody, allowing for small injection volumes. Crovalimab was engineered for extended self‐administered subcutaneous dosing of small volumes in diseases eligible for C5 inhibition. Moreover, epitope recognition of C5 by crovalimab is different from eculizumab and ravulizumab, which allow binding on a single missense C5 heterozygous mutation (c.2654G→A, single nucleotide polymorphism) present in ∼3% of the Japanese population and associated with a lack of response to eculizumab.

A three‐part open‐label adaptive phase I/II trial was conducted to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy in healthy volunteers (part 1), as well as in complement blockade‐naive (part 2) and C5 inhibitor‐treated (part 3) PNH patients. Subcutaneous crovalimab was shown to provide complete and sustained terminal complement pathway inhibition in patients with PNH on a monthly injection basis, with no safety concerns, except possible self‐limiting vasculitis‐like symptoms, associated with drug‐target‐drug immune complexes observed in patients switching from eculizumab to crovalimab. Two large phase III studies in patients previously treated with crovalimab (COMMODORE 1; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04432584) and in patients who were naive to standard complement inhibitors (COMMODORE 2; NCT04434092) are ongoing to confirm its efficacy and safety.

### Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) vs eculizumab in adult patients with PNH naive to complement inhibitors: the 301 study [^9d21bb8c]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Ravulizumab (ALXN1210), a new complement C5 inhibitor, provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition. This phase 3, open-label study assessed the noninferiority of ravulizumab to eculizumab in complement inhibitor-naive adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and at least 1 PNH symptom were randomized 1:1 to receive ravulizumab or eculizumab for 183 days (N = 246). Coprimary efficacy end points were proportion of patients remaining transfusion-free and LDH normalization. Secondary end points were percent change from baseline in LDH, change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score, proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, stabilized hemoglobin, and change in serum free C5. Ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab for both coprimary and all key secondary end points (Pinf < .0001): transfusion avoidance (73.6% vs 66.1%; difference of 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), -4.66, 18.14]), LDH normalization (53.6% vs 49.4%; odds ratio, 1.19 [0.80, 1.77]), percent reduction in LDH (-76.8% vs -76.0%; difference [95% CI], -0.83% [-5.21, 3.56]), change in FACIT-Fatigue score (7.07 vs 6.40; difference [95% CI], 0.67 [-1.21, 2.55]), breakthrough hemolysis (4.0% vs 10.7%; difference [95% CI], -6.7% [-14.21, 0.18]), and stabilized hemoglobin (68.0% vs 64.5%; difference [95% CI], 2.9 [-8.80, 14.64]). The safety and tolerability of ravulizumab and eculizumab were similar; no meningococcal infections occurred. In conclusion, ravulizumab given every 8 weeks achieved noninferiority compared with eculizumab given every 2 weeks for all efficacy end points, with a similar safety profile. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02946463.

### Iptacopan monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a 2-cohort open-label proof-of-concept study [^550b68ca]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Currently available clinical data with iptacopan support the strategy of complement alternative pathway inhibition for the treatment of PNH. In addition to the previously reported beneficial effect of iptacopan add-on to standard-of-care eculizumab, the interim results of this study demonstrate that iptacopan monotherapy in treatment-naïve PNH patients with active hemolysis results in normalization of hemolytic markers and in rapid and durable, transfusion-free improvement of Hb levels in the majority of patients, with a well-tolerated safety profile at all doses tested. The phase 3 evaluation of oral iptacopan monotherapy as a potential new standard of care for patients with PNH is ongoing.

### How we (' ll) treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^cc67abd8]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, PNH remains a disease with a pleiotropic clinical presentation and its treatment should be based on the actual clinical presentation: physicians have to assess haemolysis and bone marrow function, as well as the thrombotic complications, before choosing the most appropriate treatment. The hallmark of PNH is complement‐mediated haemolytic anaemia — we should not label any condition as PNH in the absence of meaningful haemolysis. Even if we have to acknowledge that anti‐complement treatment will never be a cure for PNH, it is obvious that anti‐complement treatment is the only aetiologic treatment for PNH. After about 15 years of eculizumab treatment, we know that life expectancy may be almost normal, with major improvement of most disease signs and symptoms.

Nevertheless, very long‐term outcome is required, unmet clinical needs still remain, and room for improvements is vast. We are learning that we can set our bar higher: haemoglobin can be normalized in most PNH patients, even with more convenient treatments that do not require frequent hospitalizations (i.e. orally or subcutaneously available). While clinical trials are on their way to investigate safety and efficacy of individual agents, possibly in head‐to‐head comparison, the message for treating physicians seems obvious: more effective and more convenient treatments will not necessarily mean that everything is solved, since the management of this unique disease will still require specific expertise and continuous efforts to unravel the knowledge of such a mysterious and fascinating illness.

### Eculizumab for treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^0f5ff584]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a chronic, not malignant, disease of the hematopoietic stem cells, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1.3 new cases per one million individuals per year. The treatment of PNH has been largely empirical and symptomatic, with blood transfusions, anticoagulation, and supplementation with folic acid or iron. Eculizumab, a biological agent that inhibits complement cascade, was developed for preventing hemolytic anemia and severe thrombotic episodes.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of eculizumab for treating patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

Search Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search strategy. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to 15 May 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to 25 June 2014), and LILACS (from 1982 to 25 June 2014). We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of their publication status or language. No limits were applied with respect to period of follow-up. We excluded quasi-RCTs. We included trials comparing eculizumab with placebo or best available therapy. We included any patient with a confirmed diagnosis of PNH. Primary outcome was overall survival.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently performed a duplicate selection of eligible trials, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We used a random-effects model for analysis.

Main Results

We identified one multicenter (34 sites) phase III RCT involving 87 participants. The trial compared eculizumab versus placebo, and was conducted in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia with 26 weeks of follow-up. This small trial had high risk of bias in many domains (attrition and selective reporting). It was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. No patients died during the study. By using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicating improvement), the trial showed improvement in health-related quality of life in patients treated with eculizumab (mean difference (MD) 19.4, 95% CI 8.25 to 30.55; P = 0.0007; low quality of evidence). By using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue instrument (scores can range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating improvement in fatigue), the trial showed a reduction in fatigue (MD 10.4, 95% CI 9.97 to 10.83; P = 0.00001; moderate quality of evidence) in the eculizumab group compared with placebo. Eculizumab compared with placebo showed a greater proportion of patients with transfusion independence: 51% (22/43) versus 0% (0/44); risk ratio (RR) 46.02, 95% CI 2.88 to 735.53; P = 0.007; moderate quality of evidence; and withdrawal for any reason: 4.7% (2/43) versus 22.72% (10/44); RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.88; P = 0.03; moderate quality of evidence. Due to the low rate of events observed, the included trial did not show any difference between eculizumab and placebo in terms of serious adverse events: 9.3% (4/43) versus 20.4% (9/44); RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.37; P = 0.16; low quality of evidence. We did not observe any difference between intervention and placebo for the most frequent adverse events. One participant receiving placebo showed an episode of thrombosis. The trial did not assess overall survival, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia, or development or recurrence of aplastic anemia on treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has detected an absence of evidence for eculizumab compared with placebo for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), in terms of overall survival, nonfatal thrombotic events, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia, and development and recurrence of aplastic anemia on treatment. Current evidence indicates that compared with placebo, eculizumab increases health-related quality of life and increases transfusion independence. During the execution of the included trial, no patients died. Furthermore, the intervention seems to reduce fatigue and withdrawals for any reason. The safety profile of eculizumab is unclear. These conclusions are based on one small trial with risk of attrition and selective reporting bias. Therefore, prescription of eculizumab for treating patients with PNH can neither be supported nor rejected, unless new evidence from a large high quality trial alters this conclusion. Therefore, we urge the reader to interpret the trial results with much caution. Future trials on this issue should be conducted according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement by independent investigators, and using the Foundation of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research recommendations.

Crovalimab

Crovalimab, a novel monoclonal antibody that binds to an epitope on the C5 β-chain, in contrast to eculizumab and ravulizumab, that target the C5 α-chain. Crovalimab demonstrates noninferiority to other anti-C5 therapies and provides the convenience of monthly subcutaneous (SC) self-administration after an initial IV infusion (Table 1). In the COMMODORE 1 trial, 84 participants who had been on eculizumab for ≥ 6 months were randomized to either continue eculizumab or switch to crovalimab for 24 weeks; crovalimab was shown to be noninferior to eculizumab in controlling hemolysis, avoiding transfusions, and preventing breakthrough hemolysis for 24 weeks. Crovalimab demonstrated efficacy comparable with that of eculizumab in controlling hemolysis (79.3% vs 79.0%), transfusion avoidance (65% vs 68%), BTH (10.4% vs 14.5%), and hemoglobin stabilization (63% vs 60.9%), offering an effective alternative with more convenient dosing. Both treatments had similar safety profiles, with most reactions being mild to moderate infusion-related events, and no meningococcal infections or deaths were reported. Interestingly, most participants who switched from eculizumab to crovalimab preferred crovalimab because of reduced clinic visits, shorter transfusion times, and improved fatigue scores. Lastly, the phase 3 COMMODORE 3 trial (N = 50) assessed complement inhibitor–naïve patients with PNH, characterized by LDH > 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) and ≥ 4 transfusions in 12 months; crovalimab achieved hemolysis control in 78% of participants, reducing LDH to < 1.5× ULN. Transfusion avoidance was achieved in half of the participants, and those who required transfusions saw an average reduction of 6.1 units of packed red blood cells over the 24-week period. The COMPOSER study was a 3-part, open-label phase 1/2 trial that evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of crovalimab compared with eculizumab as well as the effect of switching from eculizumab to crovalimab. The key findings of COMPOSER 1, 2 and 3 revealed that 79% of the participants experienced a reduction in LDH levels, and 65% of those treated with crovalimab avoided transfusions compared with 68% in the eculizumab group. Crovalimab showed lower rates of BTH than those receiving eculizumab (10.4% vs 14.5%). Overall, both treatments had similar safety profiles, with marginally higher rates of nephrolithiasis and cholecystitis, that did not lead to discontinuation of this drug. These studies confirm crovalimab's noninferiority to eculizumab, with less frequent infusions, but its role in the current treatment landscape remains unclear because of the lack of head-to-head comparisons with ravulizumab.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^5e6289f9]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Ravulizumab is a new long-acting C5 inhibitor developed to reduce the treatment burden associated with eculizumab through an improved dosing regimen and is now approved for treatment of adult patients with PNH in the USA, Japan, and Europe. It is notable that the mean terminal halflife of ravulizumab is approximately four times longer than that of eculizumab, allowing ravulizumab to provide immediate, complete, and sustained terminal C5 inhibition with an 8-week dosing interval.

In the two largest international phase III clinical studies conducted to date in PNH patients, ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab across all key efficacy endpoints in patients naїve to complement inhibitor therapy (study 301) as well as in those on stable eculizumab therapy (study 302). BTH, a key secondary endpoint in both studies, was defined as one or more new or worsening symptoms or signs of intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, anemia [hemoglobin < 10 g/dL], major adverse vascular event [MAVE] including thrombosis, dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after prior LDH reduction to < 1.5xULN while on therapy. Point estimates for proportions of patients with BTH favored ravulizumab in study 301 (4.0% vs. 10.7%, difference, −6.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): −14.21, 0.18]; Pinf < 0.0001) and study 302 (0% vs. 5.1%, difference, −5.1% [95%CI: −8.89, 18.99; Pinf < 0.0004). The purpose of the current analysis was to investigate the causes of and clinical parameters associated with incidents of BTH at the patient level in both studies. Post hoc analyses were also performed to further evaluate BTH in ravulizumab- and eculizumab-treated patients.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^a36b2094]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Eculizumab is first-line treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); however, approximately 11%-27% of patients may experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) on approved doses of eculizumab. Ravulizumab, a new long-acting C5 inhibitor with a four-times longer mean half-life than eculizumab, provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition over 8-week dosing intervals. In two phase 3 studies, ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab (Pinf ≤ 0.0004) for the BTH endpoint; fewer patients experienced BTH with ravulizumab versus eculizumab in both studies (301 [complement inhibitor-naive patients], 4.0% vs 10.7%; 302 [patients stabilized on eculizumab at baseline], 0% vs 5.1%). In the current analysis, patient-level data were evaluated to assess causes and clinical parameters associated with incidents of BTH reported during the 26-week treatment periods in the ravulizumab phase 3 PNH studies. Of the five BTH events occurring in ravulizumab-treated patients across the studies, none were temporally associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition (free C5 ≥ 0.5 μg/mL); four (80.0%) were temporally associated with complement-amplifying conditions (CACs). Of the 22 events occurring in eculizumab-treated patients, eleven were temporally associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition, including three events also associated with concomitant infection. Six events were associated with CACs only. Five events were unrelated to free C5 elevation or reported CACs. These results suggest that the immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition achieved through weight-based dosing of ravulizumab reduces the risk of BTH by eliminating BTH associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition in patients with PNH. Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: Study 301, NCT02946463; Study 302, NCT03056040.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: a phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^69864e0e]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched treatment from high-dose eculizumab to weight-based ravulizumab (N = 18).

Over the treatment period, 12/18 patients (66.7%) avoided transfusion. In previous trials of ravulizumab in patients with PNH, transfusion avoidance levels of 76.6% and 86.5% were reported following 1 year of treatment;, the lower proportion in this study may be due to the smaller sample size, the shorter follow-up, and differences in the patient populations.

The main limitation of this study is the small sample size, which precludes formal statistical comparisons; this was to be expected given that this study was based on a subpopulation of patients with a rare disease receiving a dose above the approved fixed-dose regimen. In addition, the study recruited patients from two referral centers in a single country; consequently, the findings should be interpreted with caution and may not be generalizable to the wider PNH population. Finally, only patients receiving eculizumab 1,200 mg Q2W were included in the study, so findings may not be applicable to the small proportion of patients requiring even higher doses of eculizumab. In summary, switching treatment from high-dose intravenous eculizumab (1,200 mg Q2W) to standard, weight-based intravenous ravulizumab resulted in minimal changes in laboratory measures at an improved dosing interval, with no new safety signals reported. Our findings support the use of weight-based ravulizumab as a suitable and well-tolerated alternative to eculizumab, even for patients who have experienced pharmacokinetic breakthrough hemolysis during standard-dose eculizumab treatment.

### Ravulizumab for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^0960f9a7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Eculizumab, which is indicated to treat patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), is a life-changing, life-saving therapy that decreases intravascular hemolysis and thrombosis and improves survival. Some eculizumab-treated patients, however, experience breakthrough hemolysis; and overall, the burden of the treatment schedule (intravenous infusions every 2 weeks) is substantial. Ravulizumab is a long-acting, second-generation complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor that is administered intravenously every 8 weeks. It is approved in the United States (December 2018), Japan (June 2019), Europe (July 2019), and Canada and Brazil (September 2019). Areas covered: This article reviews data presented in journal articles identified on Medline/PubMed, abstracts presented at hematology meetings, and information posted on ClinicalTrials.gov and Alexion.com. Emphasis is placed on the non-inferiority of ravulizumab compared to eculizumab and the advantages of the 8-week, weight-based, dosing regimen. Expert opinion: In phase 3 trials, ravulizumab has been shown to be as safe and efficacious as eculizumab, to be associated numerically with lower rates of breakthrough hemolysis (p for non-inferiority < 0.0004), and to be preferred over eculizumab by most patients. Ravulizumab is likely to replace eculizumab as the first-line treatment for PNH both in patients who are naive to eculizumab treatment and in patients who are clinically stable on eculizumab.

### Patient-reported improvements in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria treated with iptacopan from 2 phase 3 studies [^ca621c65]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and patient population

APPLY-PNH (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04558918) was an open-label, randomized, multicenter, phase 3 trial investigating iptacopan monotherapy in patients with PNH and persistent anemia despite C5i therapy (eculizumab or ravulizumab). APPOINT-PNH (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04820530) was an open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial investigating iptacopan monotherapy in C5i-naive patients with PNH. Both trials included a 56-day (8-week) screening period, a 168-day (24-week) core treatment period, and a 168-day (24-week) extension period. Iptacopan was self-administered at 200 mg twice daily in both studies. In APPLY-PNH, C5is were administered IV.

Details of the study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and primary analyses have been described previously. Briefly, both trials enrolled adult patients (age of ≥ 18 years) with PNH, mean Hb of < 10 g/dL, and no laboratory evidence of bone marrow failure. In APPLY-PNH, patients were previously treated with a stable regimen of C5i therapy (eculizumab or ravulizumab) for ≥ 6 months before randomization. In APPOINT-PNH, patients were C5i naive and had LDH level of > 1.5 × the upper limit of normal.

The protocols were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating study site.

### Characterizing clinically significant extravascular hemolysis in adults with PNH on ravulizumab or eculizumab treatment [^a1973dd3]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The 301 (NCT02946463) and 302 (NCT03056040) clinical studies were phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, noninferiority, multicenter studies, as previously described. Throughout the 26-week primary evaluation period of the 301 and 302 studies, patients were randomly assigned to receive weight-based ravulizumab dosing (every 8 weeks) or eculizumab maintenance dosing (every 2 weeks) (supplemental Material). The primary evaluation period was followed by an extension period of up to 6 or 4 years (301 and 302 studies, respectively), during which all patients received ravulizumab.

Patients

As previously detailed, patients were aged ≥ 18 years and had a confirmed diagnosis of PNH in both the 301 and 302 studies. In the 301 study, C5 inhibitor–naive patients experienced PNH-related signs or symptoms within 3 months of screening, including fatigue, hemoglobinuria, or anemia. In contrast, patients in the 302 study were clinically stable after receiving eculizumab for ≥ 6 months before enrollment. All participants or their legal representative provided informed consent.

Outcomes

csEVH

This post hoc analysis reports the prevalence of csEVH in patients with PNH who were either naive to C5 inhibitors and experienced PNH symptoms (301 study) or clinically stable after a minimum of 6 months on eculizumab (302 study). Owing to the lack of a universal definition, for the purposes of this analysis, csEVH was defined as symptomatic anemia (hemoglobin levels < 9.5 g/dL) with absolute reticulocyte count ≥ 120 × 10⁹/L at day 183, with or without blood transfusion, a definition used previously in the ALPHA study, a clinical trial in patients with PNH. Additionally, to determine whether the prevalence of csEVH changed over time in patients with stable disease from the 302 study, the proportion of patients who met the hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte count criteria was also evaluated at baseline and week 52 in this population.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: a phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^5d88f286]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, chronic, hematologic disorder characterized by uncontrolled terminal complement activation, intravascular hemolysis, and potentially life-threatening thromboses, leading to early mortality. The complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor eculizumab and its analog ravulizumab (the current standard of care) are approved treatments for PNH. Both treatments inhibit intravascular hemolysis, reduce the incidence of thrombosis, and are associated with improvements in anemia, transfusion dependence, quality of life, and survival when administered at their respective 2-week (eculizumab) and 8-week (ravulizumab) dosing intervals. Some patients treated with eculizumab at the approved fixed-dose regimen of 900 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) experience intravascular hemolysis toward the end of the fixed-dosing interval. This can be managed by shortening the dosing interval, which may increase the treatment burden for both patients and healthcare providers, or by using a higher than approved dose.

### Pegcetacoplan controls hemolysis in complement inhibitor-naive patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^ef5dd3df]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disease characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis. Pegcetacoplan is the first C3-targeted therapy approved for adults with PNH (United States), adults with PNH with inadequate response or intolerance to a C5 inhibitor (Australia), and adults with anemia despite C5-targeted therapy for ≥ 3 months (European Union). PRINCE was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan vs control (supportive care only; eg, blood transfusions, corticosteroids, and supplements) in complement inhibitor-naive patients with PNH. Eligible adults receiving supportive care only for PNH were randomly assigned and stratified based on their number of transfusions (< 4 or ≥ 4) 12 months before screening. Patients received pegcetacoplan 1080 mg subcutaneously twice weekly or continued supportive care (control) for 26 weeks. Coprimary end points were hemoglobin stabilization (avoidance of > 1-g/dL decrease in hemoglobin levels without transfusions) from baseline through week 26 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) change at week 26. Overall, 53 patients received pegcetacoplan (n = 35) or control (n = 18). Pegcetacoplan was superior to control for hemoglobin stabilization (pegcetacoplan, 85.7%; control, 0; difference, 73.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 57.2–89.0; P < .0001) and change from baseline in LDH (least square mean change: pegcetacoplan, -1870.5 U/L; control, -400.1 U/L; difference, -1470.4 U/L; 95% CI, -2113.4 to -827.3; P < .0001). Pegcetacoplan was well tolerated. No pegcetacoplan-related adverse events were serious, and no new safety signals were observed. Pegcetacoplan rapidly and significantly stabilized hemoglobin and reduced LDH in complement inhibitor-naive patients and had a favorable safety profile. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04085601.

### The complement inhibitor eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^bf64d766]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

We tested the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against terminal complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation, in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial. Patients received either placebo or eculizumab intravenously; eculizumab was given at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900-mg dose and then 900 mg every other week through week 26. The two primary end points were the stabilization of hemoglobin levels and the number of units of packed red cells transfused. Biochemical indicators of intravascular hemolysis and the patients' quality of life were also assessed.

Results

Eighty-seven patients underwent randomization. Stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions was achieved in 49% (21 of 43) of the patients assigned to eculizumab and none (0 of 44) of those assigned to placebo (P < 0.001). During the study, a median of 0 units of packed red cells was administered in the eculizumab group, as compared with 10 units in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Eculizumab reduced intravascular hemolysis, as shown by the 85.8% lower median area under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase plotted against time (in days) in the eculizumab group, as compared with the placebo group (58,587 vs. 411,822 U per liter; P < 0.001). Clinically significant improvements were also found in the quality of life, as measured by scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue instrument (P < 0.001) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Of the 87 patients, 4 in the eculizumab group and 9 in the placebo group had serious adverse events, none of which were considered to be treatment-related; all these patients recovered without sequelae.

Conclusions

Eculizumab is an effective therapy for PNH.

### Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a complement-mediated hemolytic anemia [^e99fd796]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is manifests with a chronic hemolytic anemia from uncontrolled complement activation, a propensity for thrombosis and marrow failure. The hemolysis is largely mediated by the alternative pathway of complement. Clinical manifestations result from the lack of specific cell surface proteins, CD55 and CD59, on PNH cells. Complement inhibition by eculizumab leads to dramatic clinical improvement. While this therapeutic approach is effective, there is residual complement activity resulting from specific clinical scenarios as well as from upstream complement components that can account for suboptimal responses in some patients. Complement inhibition strategies are an area of active research.

### FDA report: eculizumab (soliris) for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^9811211f]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

On March 16, 2007, eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Cheshire, CT), a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the human C5 complement protein, received accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) to reduce hemolysis. Eculizumab was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 87 RBC transfusion-dependent adult PNH patients and in a supportive single-arm study in 96 patients. The eculizumab dose was 600 mg as a 35-minute i.v. infusion administered weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 900 mg (week 5) then 900 mg every 14 days thereafter. Hemoglobin stabilized in 21 of 43 (48.8%) eculizumab-treated patients, compared with none of 44 placebo-treated patients. Eculizumab-treated patients required significantly fewer RBC transfusions than placebo-treated patients (median, 0 versus 10 units). There was also a significant reduction in the serum lactate dehydrogenase area under the curve with eculizumab compared with placebo treatment. Results of the phase II supportive study were similar to those of the phase III study. The safety database included 196 adult patients with PNH. Significant findings included the development of human anti-human antibody responses in three patients and serious meningococcal infections in three patients. Patients should undergo meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first eculizumab treatment and have revaccination according to current medical guidelines. Patients must be monitored and evaluated immediately for early signs of meningococcal infections and treated with antibiotics as indicated.

### How we (' ll) treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^3578f976]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

These data demonstrate that pegcetacoplan monotherapy was effective in inhibiting intravascular haemolysis of PNH patients and in preventing the emergence of C3‐mediated extra‐vascular haemolysis, eventually resulting in a better haematological response. With follow‐up extended to 48 weeks, patients randomized to pegcetacoplan maintained a high haemoglobin level (mean haemoglobin level was 113 g/l), while patients randomized to eculizumab who switched to pegcetacoplan during the open‐label period demonstrated a significant improvement compared with the baseline (mean haemoglobin increase was 29 g/l).

During the extension period, the rate of patients who remained transfusion‐independent was overlapping between the two treatment arms (73% vs 72% in pegcetacoplan–pegcetacoplan and eculizumab–pegcetacoplan arms respectively). No safety alert emerged with this longer follow‐up, even if 12 of the 80 patients discontinued pegcetacoplan, of whom six due to breakthrough haemolysis. Pegcetacoplan is now approved by the FDA for patients with PNH who are either treatment‐naive or switching from anti‐C5 monoclonal antibodies.

The first‐in‐class factor D (FD) inhibitor is danicopan, an oral proximal, complement alternative pathway inhibitor, which was investigated in two open‐label, single‐arm, phase II studies in eculizumab‐poor responders and untreated PNH patients. In the poor‐responder study, danicopan was given as an add‐on treatment at the dose of 100–200 thrice daily to 12 transfusion dependent PNH patients on eculizumab. Twelve patients received at least one danicopan dose; one discontinued from a serious adverse event, deemed unlikely related to danicopan. In the 11 patients who completed the treatment (one early discontinuation due to a serious adverse event, unlikely related to danicopan), the addition of danicopan resulted in a mean 24 g/l haemoglobin increase at week 24.

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)

The efficacy of VOYDEYA in adults with PNH and clinically significant EVH was assessed in a multiple-region, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ALXN2040-PNH-301; NCT04469465). Clinically significant EVH was defined by anemia (hemoglobin [Hgb] ≤ 9.5 g/dL) with absolute reticulocyte count ≥ 120 × 10⁹/L with or without transfusion support. The study enrolled patients with PNH who had been treated with a stable dose of ravulizumab or eculizumab for at least the previous 6 months.

VOYDEYA was administered orally at 150 mg three times a day, escalated to 200 mg three times a day depending on the clinical response.

Patients were vaccinated against meningococcal infection prior to or at the time of initiating treatment with VOYDEYA if vaccination status within 3 years could not be verified.

Patients were randomized to VOYDEYA or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for 12 weeks in addition to background ravulizumab or eculizumab treatment. After Week 12, all patients received VOYDEYA in combination with their background ravulizumab or eculizumab treatment up to Week 24. After Week 24, patients could enter a long-term extension period and continue to receive VOYDEYA with background ravulizumab or eculizumab.

### Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: where we stand [^f50d6f2e]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

For the last 20years, therapy of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) relied-up until recently-on antibody based terminal complement inhibitionon. PNH pathophysiology-a mutational defect leading to partial or complete absence of complement-regulatory proteins on blood cells-leads to intravascular hemolysis and consequences such as thrombosis and other sequelae. A plethora of new drugs interfering with the proximal and terminal complement cascade are under recent development and the first "proof-of-pinciple" proximal complement inhibitor targeting C3 has been approved in 2021. "PNH: where we stand" will try to give a brief account on where we came from and where we stand focusing on approved therapeutic options. The associated improvements as well as potential consequences of actual and future treatments as well as their impact on the disease will continue to necessitate academic and scientific focus on improving treatment options as well as on side effects and outcomes relevant to individual patient lives and circumstances in order to develop effective, safe, and available treatment for all hemolytic PNH patients globally.

### Addition of danicopan to ravulizumab or eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and clinically significant extravascular haemolysis (ALPHA): a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial [^e44f9737]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Symptoms of anaemia due to clinically significant extravascular haemolysis can affect patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) treated with C5 inhibitors (ravulizumab or eculizumab). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of danicopan (ALXN2040), an investigational, first-in-class, oral complement factor D inhibitor, as add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab in patients with PNH and clinically significant extravascular haemolysis.

Methods

ALPHA is an ongoing, international, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating danicopan as add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab. Eligible patients were adults (age ≥ 18 years) with PNH and clinically significant extravascular haemolysis (haemoglobin ≤ 9.5 g/dL; absolute reticulocyte count ≥ 120×10⁹/L) on ravulizumab or eculizumab for at least 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to danicopan or placebo added to ravulizumab or eculizumab for 12 weeks using an interactive response technology system. Randomisation was stratified based on transfusion history, haemoglobin, and patients enrolled from Japan. The initial oral danicopan dose was 150 mg three times a day; escalation to 200 mg three times a day was permitted based on clinical response. The infusion dose level of eculizumab (every 2 weeks) ranged from 900 mg to 1500 mg, and for ravulizumab (monthly or every 8 weeks) ranged from 3000 mg to 3600 mg. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin concentration from baseline to week 12. Here we present the protocol-prespecified interim analysis, planned when approximately 75% of participants were randomly assigned to treatment and completed or discontinued at 12 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04469465).

Findings

Individuals were randomly assigned between Dec 16, 2020, and Aug 29, 2022. At data cutoff (June 28, 2022), 73 individuals were randomly assigned, received treatment, and were analysed for safety (danicopan, n = 49; placebo, n = 24). The protocol-prespecified interim efficacy analysis set included the first 63 participants (danicopan, n = 42; placebo, n = 21). At week 12, danicopan plus ravulizumab or eculizumab increased haemoglobin versus placebo plus ravulizumab or eculizumab (least squares mean [LSM] change from baseline: danicopan, 2.94 g/dL [95% CI 2.52 to 3.36]; placebo, 0.50 g/dL [-0.13 to 1.12]; LSM difference, 2.44 g/dL [1.69 to 3.20]; p < 0.0001). Grade 3 adverse events in the danicopan group were increased alanine aminotransferase (two [4%] of 49 patients), leukopenia (one [2%]), neutropenia (two [4%]), cholecystitis (one [2%]), COVID-19 (one [2%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (one [2%]), and increased blood pressure (one [2%]), and in the placebo group were anaemia (one [4%] of 24 patients), thrombocytopenia (one [4%]), and asthenia (one [4%]). The serious adverse events reported in the danicopan group were cholecystitis (one [2%] patient) and COVID-19 (one [2%]) and in the placebo group were anaemia and abdominal pain, both in one (4%) patient. There were no serious adverse events related to study drug or deaths reported in the study.

Interpretation

These primary efficacy and safety results show that danicopan as add-on treatment to ravulizumab or eculizumab significantly improved haemoglobin concentrations at week 12 with no new safety concerns, suggesting an improved benefit-risk profile in patients with PNH and clinically significant extravascular haemolysis.

### Comparative clinical efficacy and safety of biosimilar ABP 959 and eculizumab reference product in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^7700715b]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABP 959 is a biosimilar to the eculizumab reference product (RP), which is approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, two-period crossover study randomized eculizumab RP-treated patients with PNH to one of two treatment sequences (ABP 959/eculizumab RP or eculizumab RP/ABP 959) to evaluate the clinical similarity of ABP 959 when compared with eculizumab RP. This study evaluated the efficacy of ABP 959 when compared with eculizumab RP based on control of intravascular hemolysis as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and by the time-adjusted area under the effect curve of LDH. Secondary outcomes included safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Forty-two patients were randomized (20 in the ABP 959/eculizumab RP group and 22 in the eculizumab RP/ABP 959 group) across 25 centers. Similarity of efficacy was established by a ratio of geometric least squares means of LDH (ABP 959/eculizumab RP) of 1.0628, with a one-sided 97.5% upper CI of 1.1576 at week 27, and a geometric means ratio of time-adjusted area under the effect curve (ABP 959 vs. eculizumab RP) of LDH of 0.981, with a 90% CI of 0.9403–1.0239 from week 13 to 27, week 39 to 53, and week 65 to 79. All secondary efficacy endpoints were comparable between treatment groups. No new safety concerns were identified. The results of this study in patients with PNH, along with previously demonstrated similarity of analytical, nonclinical, and clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 959 and eculizumab RP. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03818607.

### How I treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^ad34e91a]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, clonal, complement-mediated hemolytic anemia with protean manifestations. PNH can present as a hemolytic anemia, a form of bone marrow failure, a thrombophilia, or any combination of the above. Terminal complement inhibition is highly effective for treating intravascular hemolysis from PNH and virtually eliminates the risk of thrombosis, but is not effective for treating bone marrow failure. Here, I present a variety of clinical vignettes that highlight the clinical heterogeneity of PNH and the attributes and limitations of the 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved C5 inhibitors (eculizumab and ravulizumab) to treat PNH. I review the concept of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic breakthrough hemolysis and briefly discuss new complement inhibitors upstream of C5 that are in clinical development. Last, I discuss the rare indications for bone marrow transplantation in patients with PNH.

### Oral iptacopan monotherapy in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: final 48-week results from the open-label, randomised, phase 3 APPLY-PNH trial in anti-C5-treated patients and the open-label, single-arm, phase 3 APPOINT-PNH trial in patients previously untreated with complement inhibitors [^8b133349]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Background

The factor B inhibitor iptacopan improved 24-week outcomes in adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria in the phase 3 APPLY-PNH and APPOINT-PNH trials; the trial extension periods assessed clinical activity and safety up to 48 weeks. Here, we report the final 48-week data from APPLY-PNH and APPOINT-PNH.

Methods

In both APPLY-PNH and APPOINT-PNH trials, patients were aged 18 years or older, with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (red and white blood cell population sizes ≥ 10%) and without laboratory evidence of bone marrow failure. In APPLY-PNH (an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial conducted in 39 centres [38 hospitals, one outpatient research clinic] from 12 countries or regions), patients with haemoglobin concentration lower than 10 g/dL on anti-C5 treatment (stable eculizumab or ravulizumab regimen for ≥ 6 months) were randomly assigned (8:5) via interactive response technology to either receive oral iptacopan 200 mg twice daily (iptacopan group) or to continue their individual intravenous eculizumab or ravulizumab regimen for 24 weeks (anti-C5 group). Randomisation was stratified by type of anti-C5 and receipt of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the preceding 6 months. In APPOINT-PNH (an open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trial conducted in 12 hospitals from eight countries), complement inhibitor-naive patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and with haemoglobin concentration lower than 10 g/dL and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal received iptacopan 200 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. Both trials had 24-week extension periods in which all patients received iptacopan monotherapy. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with an increase from baseline in haemoglobin concentration of 2 g/dL or higher (APPLY-PNH and APPOINT-PNH) and haemoglobin concentration 12 g/dL or higher (APPLY-PNH) between weeks 18 and 24, all in the absence of RBC transfusions between weeks 2 and 24; results for these primary endpoints have been reported previously. We report final activity and safety data at the completion of both trials (week 48). Prespecified endpoints at week 48 included percentage of patients with a haemoglobin increase from baseline of 2 g/dL or higher or haemoglobin 12 g/dL or higher (including post-transfusion data). Efficacy data were analysed per the intention-to-treat principle, and safety was analysed according to the treatment that patients received. APPLY-PNH and APPOINT-PNH are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04558918 and NCT04820530, respectively.

Findings

In APPLY-PNH, between Jan 25, 2021, and April 8, 2022, 62 patients (43 [69%] female, 19 [31%] male; 48 [77%] White, 12 [19%] Asian, two [3%] Black) were randomly assigned to the iptacopan group and 35 patients (24 [69%] female, 11 [31%] male; 26 [74%] White, seven [20%] Asian, two [6%] Black) to the anti-C5 group; 61 (98%) and 34 (97%), respectively, entered the extension period. At trial completion (March 6, 2023), the median duration of iptacopan treatment was 337 days (IQR 168–338). In APPOINT-PNH, 40 patients were enrolled between July 19, 2021, and May 17, 2022, and received iptacopan (17 [43%] female, 23 [58%] male; 12 [30%] White, 27 [68%] Asian, one [3%] Black); all entered the extension period. At trial completion (April 18, 2023), the median duration of iptacopan treatment was 337 days (IQR 337–344). At week 48, irrespective of RBC transfusions, the number of patients who had an increase in haemoglobin concentration of 2 g/dL or higher was 51 (86%) of 59 in the APPLY-PNH iptacopan group, 21 (72%)of 29 in the APPLY-PNH anti-C5-to-iptacopan group, and 38 (97%) of 39 in APPOINT-PNH. The number of patients who had haemoglobin concentration of 12 g/dL or higher at week 48 was 40 (68%)of 59 in the APPLY-PNH iptacopan group, 17 (59%)of 29 in the APPLY-PNH anti-C5-to-iptacopan group, and 31 (79%)of 39 in APPOINT-PNH. There were no treatment discontinuations because of treatment-emergent adverse events or deaths. Across the 48-week trials, clinical breakthrough haemolysis occurred in seven (7%) of 96 iptacopan-treated patients in APPLY-PNH (including both groups) and two (5%) of 40 in APPOINT-PNH, but it was generally mild or moderate with no iptacopan discontinuation. Three major adverse vascular events occurred in APPLY-PNH by trial completion; all were considered unrelated to iptacopan. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was COVID-19 in APPLY-PNH (iptacopan: 18/62 patients [29%]; anti-C5-to-iptacopan: 8/34 [24%]) and headache in APPOINT-PNH (12/40 [30%]). Severe and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were experienced by six (10%) and nine (15%) of 62 patients in the APPLY-PNH iptacopan group, respectively; in APPOINT-PNH, these were experienced by four (10%) and eight (20%) of 40 patients, respectively. The most common serious treatment-emergent adverse event was COVID-19, occurring in one (2%) of 62 patients in the APPLY-PNH iptacopan group and two (5%) of 40 patients in APPOINT-PNH. No severe treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in more than one patient.

Interpretation

Long-term data indicate durable haemolysis control with iptacopan in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, maintained normal or near-normal haemoglobin, and no new safety concerns. We believe that these data support iptacopan as a potential therapy option, suggesting that we are in a new treatment era for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.

### Baseline characteristics and disease burden in patients in the international paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria registry [^87da40d2]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare, acquired disease associated with hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure, thrombosis, and, frequently, poor quality of life. The International PNH Registry is a worldwide, observational, non-interventional study collecting safety, effectiveness, and quality-of-life data from patients with a confirmed paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria diagnosis or detectable paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone, irrespective of treatment. In addition to evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of eculizumab in a global population, the registry aims to improve diagnosis, optimize patient management and outcomes, and enhance the understanding of the natural history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Here we report the characteristics of the first 1610 patients enrolled. Median disease duration was 4.6 years. Median granulocyte paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone size was 68.1% (range 0.01–100%). Overall, 16% of patients had a history of thrombotic events and 14% a history of impaired renal function. Therapies included anticoagulation (31%), immunosuppression (19%), and eculizumab (25%). Frequently reported symptoms included fatigue (80%), dyspnea (64%), hemoglobinuria (62%), abdominal pain (44%), and chest pain (33%). Patients suffered from poor quality of life; 23% of patients had been hospitalized due to paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-related complications and 17% stated that paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was the reason they were not working or were working less. This international registry will provide an ongoing, valuable resource to further the clinical understanding of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

### The importance of controlling terminal complement activity and intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) [^c870c3db]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A focus primarily on hemoglobin does not account for the role that terminal complement activity and IVH play in the development of the serious complications in PNH. Clinical trial experience and real‐world cases are beginning to emerge, underscoring the seriousness of BT‐IVH with proximal inhibitor monotherapy and will continue to demonstrate that if the role of terminal complement in the pathophysiology and progression of PNH is forgotten, patient safety is at risk. Once the primary goal of complete and sustained terminal complement inhibition has been achieved for the safety and survival of patients, and if patients experience symptomatic anemia, this then needs to be investigated and managed appropriately. We agree that improving quality of life is important, but not at the cost of compromising control of terminal complement activity and IVH, to reduce the risk of organ damage and thrombosis, and thereby improving survival.

For the subset of patients who continue to experience symptoms associated with EVH, dual complement inhibition may be considered as an important therapeutic option. Proximal complement inhibition helps address the effects of symptomatic hemolytic anemia, while the terminal complement inhibitor maintains the essential control of terminal complement activity and IVH — the primary goal of treatment that should not be compromised.

### Iptacopan monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a 2-cohort open-label proof-of-concept study [^74ed93a9]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

This study included a dose range of 25 mg to 200 mg twice daily (across 2 cohorts), reflecting the previous observation that iptacopan has an underproportional dose–exposure relationship, with the proposed dose range (eightfold) being larger than the expected exposure range (threefold) (data on file). Although the small patient numbers and significant exposure overlap across doses preclude any definite conclusions, the exposure and related alternative pathway inhibition assessed in this study are in line with unpublished data from previous clinical trials in healthy volunteers and across different indications.

A dose- and exposure-dependent effect of iptacopan was observed across all the efficacy parameters analyzed. The exposure–response analysis after 4 weeks of treatment at each dose level enabled the correlation of iptacopan exposure with each of 6 pharmacodynamic variables. Although some of the variables seemed to reach the maximal effect plateau at relatively low exposures (eg, Bb and C3d deposition), only exposures related to 200 mg twice daily achieved an effect maximization of all pharmacodynamic variables with potentially better disease control in the majority of patients. Longitudinal pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modeling will be done when longer-term data on the higher doses become available.

Confirmatory phase 3 trials have recently been started. The first (APPLY-PNH; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04558918) includes an active comparator arm with an anti-C5 antibody, eculizumab or ravulizumab, in an attempt to demonstrate the superiority of iptacopan (200 mg twice daily) compared with standard of care. The second (APPOINT-PNH; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04820530) assesses the efficacy and safety of iptacopan monotherapy (200 mg twice daily) in patients with PNH who are naive to complement inhibitor therapy. With the phase 3 evaluation pending, iptacopan has the potential to become the first oral standard-of-care complement inhibitor monotherapy for adult patients with PNH.

14.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)

APPLY-PNH: Anti-C5 Treatment Experienced Patients With PNH

The efficacy of FABHALTA administered orally in adults with PNH was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label, 24-week, active comparator-controlled trial (APPLY-PNH; NCT04558918).

The study enrolled adults with PNH and residual anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) despite previous treatment with a stable regimen of anti-C5 treatment (either eculizumab or ravulizumab) for at least 6 months prior to randomization.

Ninety-seven patients were randomized in an 8:5 ratio to switch to FABHALTA 200 mg orally twice daily (n = 62) or to continue anti-C5 treatment (US-approved and non-US-approved eculizumab product n = 23 or US-approved and non-US-approved ravulizumab product n = 12) throughout the duration of the 24-week randomized controlled period. Randomization was stratified based on prior anti-C5 treatment and transfusion history within the last 6 months. Following completion of the 24-week randomized controlled period, all patients were eligible to enroll in a 24-week treatment extension period and receive FABHALTA monotherapy. Subsequently, patients were eligible to enter a separate long-term extension study.

### Multicenter phase 3 study of the complement inhibitor eculizumab for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^6c8eb820]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab was recently shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Here, we extended these observations with results from an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, 52-week, phase 3 clinical safety and efficacy study evaluating eculizumab in a broader PNH patient population. Eculizumab was administered by intravenous infusion at 600 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks; 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later; followed by 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for a total treatment period of 52 weeks. Ninety-seven patients at 33 international sites were enrolled. Patients treated with eculizumab responded with an 87% reduction in hemolysis, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < .001). Baseline fatigue scores in the FACIT-Fatigue instrument improved by 12.2 ± 1.1 points (P < .001). Eculizumab treatment led to an improvement in anemia. The increase in hemoglobin level occurred despite a reduction in transfusion requirements from a median of 8.0 units of packed red cells per patient before treatment to 0.0 units per patient during the study (P < .001). Overall, transfusions were reduced 52% from a mean of 12.3 to 5.9 units of packed red cells per patient. Forty-nine patients (51%) achieved transfusion independence for the entire 52-week period. Improvements in hemolysis, fatigue, and transfusion requirements with eculizumab were independent of baseline levels of hemolysis and degree of thrombocytopenia. Quality of life measures were also broadly improved with eculizumab treatment. This study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of eculizumab treatment in patients with PNH are applicable to a broader population of PNH patients than previously studied. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00130000.

### The importance of controlling terminal complement activity and intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) [^01b717a6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient safety is paramount and ingrained in our mission at Alexion, and with our leadership in complement biology for over 30 years, we strive to provide the most efficacious and safe therapeutic products for patients. It must be remembered that the most significant risks to patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) come from intravascular hemolysis (IVH) and thrombosis, and these are mediated by terminal complement activity.

Risitano et al. details the experience of three patients previously treated with vemircopan monotherapy, who were switched to ravulizumab when the clinical trialwas discontinued. The authors conclude that hemolysis following discontinuation of effective proximal complement inhibitors poses a significant clinical risk that cannot be fully mitigated by switching to C5 inhibitors and recommend pursuing an alternative proximal complement inhibitor. The phenomenon described is expected, having first been seen in the PEGASUS trial where patients were managed supportively with transfusions when necessary. The current correspondence contributes further to the evidence of this phenomenon for patients when they are discontinued from proximal complement inhibition.

### Phase 2 study of danicopan in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with an inadequate response to eculizumab [^de4cdb64]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by uncontrolled terminal complement activation and subsequent intravascular hemolysis (IVH). C5 inhibitors prevent membrane attack complex formation, but patients may experience extravascular hemolysis (EVH) and continue to require blood transfusions. Danicopan, an oral proximal complement inhibitor of alternative pathway factor D (FD), is designed to control IVH and EVH. In a phase 2 dose-finding trial, eculizumab-treated transfusion-dependent patients with PNH (n = 12) received danicopan, 100 to 200 mg thrice daily, in addition to their eculizumab regimen for 24 weeks. End points included hemoglobin (Hgb) change vs baseline at week 24 (primary), reduction in blood transfusions, and patient-reported outcomes. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were measured. Twelve patients received ≥ 1 danicopan dose; 1 patients discontinued from a serious adverse event deemed unlikely related to danicopan. Eleven patients completed the 24-week treatment period. Addition of danicopan resulted in a mean Hgb increase of 2.4 g/dL at week 24. In the 24 weeks prior to danicopan, 10 patients received 31 transfusions (50 units) compared with 1 transfusion (2 units) in 1 patient during the 24-week treatment period. Mean Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score increased by 11 points from baseline to week 24. The most common adverse events were headache, cough, and nasopharyngitis. Addition of danicopan, a first-in-class FD inhibitor, led to a meaningful improvement in Hgb and reduced transfusion requirements in patients with PNH who were transfusion-dependent on eculizumab. These benefits were associated with improvement of FACIT-Fatigue. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03472885.

### Iptacopan monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: a 2-cohort open-label proof-of-concept study [^23ced3e6]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the absence of a placebo response for LDH has previously been demonstrated in this patient population, this proof-of-concept study was designed as a nonplacebo-controlled trial. Iptacopan monotherapy in anti-C5 naive PNH patients with active hemolysis resulted in a rapid and durable reduction of hemolytic markers, including LDH, bilirubin, reticulocytes, and haptoglobin, as well as C3 fragment deposition on RBCs, resulting in stabilization and a dramatic increase in the proportion of PNH-type RBC. Consistently, a more gradual but clinically meaningful and durable increase in Hb levels was observed in most patients, with all but 1 remaining transfusion-free from the start of iptacopan treatment until the data cutoff. These results complement data from a previous phase 2 study in adult PNH patients with persistent hemolysis despite ongoing treatment with eculizumab, where iptacopan add-on resulted in similar hematological improvements that persisted even when eculizumab was discontinued. Together, both studies provide evidence that complement inhibition with iptacopan effectively controls both intra- and extravascular hemolysis and leads to significant, transfusion-free improvement in Hb levels in most patients with PNH. These findings are consistent with results from clinical trials of other proximal complement inhibitors, including pegcetacoplan and the factor D inhibitors, danicopanand BCX9930, which have demonstrated similar inhibition of both intra- and extravascular hemolysis.

Consistent with the previous phase 2 study findings, iptacopan treatment was safe and well-tolerated. Up until the data cutoff, no serious nor severe AEs, including none of infectious nature, were reported, and the majority of AEs suspected by the investigator to be drug-related, affecting roughly one-third of the patients, were transient and of mild intensity. Two patients discontinued iptacopan treatment, 1 due to nonsevere, though suspected-to-be-related headache after 2 days of dosing, the other by patient preference and upon physician decision. Importantly, up until the data cutoff for this interim analysis, no thromboembolic events or breakthrough hemolysis were reported. The absence of significant breakthrough hemolysis to date is particularly notable considering the significant increase in PNH clone size achieved with iptacopan treatment, although this observation remains to be confirmed with more patients, longer-term data, and upon the occurrence of complement-amplifying conditions such as surgical interventions or severe infections.

### Efficacy and safety of HRS-5965 monotherapy in complement inhibitor-naïve patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^8f9bfc0d]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Based on prior studies of other oral selective complement factor B inhibitors in PNH, it was hypothesized that the mean Hb increase from baseline to Week 12 would be ~25 g/L in each treatment group, with an assumed standard deviation of 15 g/L. A sample size of 12 patients per group was estimated to provide 85% power to detect a mean Hb increase greater than 20 g/L at Week 12. A total of 26 patients were ultimately enrolled in this phase II study.

Efficacy was assessed in the full analysis set, comprising all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. The safety set included all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. Data collected after intercurrent events (such as early withdrawal, red‐cell transfusions within 30 days or use of prohibited treatments during the treatment period) were excluded from the efficacy analysis based on the hypothetical strategy.

The primary and continuous secondary end‐points at Week 12 were analysed using a mixed‐effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Baseline values were included as covariates, and treatment group, visit and the treatment‐by‐visit interaction were modelled as fixed effects, with patients as random effects using an unstructured covariance matrix to account for within‐patient variability. Missing data were imputed via the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, and least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each treatment group. The proportions of patients achieving an Hb increase of at least 20 g/L from baseline or reaching Hb levels of ≥ 120 g/L at Week 12 were presented as numbers and percentages, with non‐response imputation applied for missing data or intercurrent events. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.

### How we (' ll) treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^f8519b29]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Response to anti‐complement treatment

The fact that eculizumab has drastically improved the survival of PNH patients, with the control of most severe signs and symptoms of disease, does not mean that eculizumab‐treated PNH patients are cured. Patients still require careful clinical and laboratory assessment to investigate possible changes in disease presentation, which appears to be the rule, rather than the exception, in PNH. This is especially true for bone marrow failure, which remains subtle in most patients, but may eventually become clinically meaningful any time during the disease course.

Periodical bone marrow analysis should be performed (every 18/24 months, or at even longer intervals if blood counts remain stable) to rule out the very low risk of evolution to myeloid malignancies. Similarly, the thrombophilic status characteristic of PNH may account for thromboembolic events, albeit rarely, even during eculizumab treatment. Thus, upon cases of signs or symptoms of such complications, PNH patients should be evaluated for possible thrombotic complications, with the most appropriate methods depending on the site and on clinical presentation.

However, eculizumab treatment has been designed to inhibit complement‐mediated haemolytic anaemia, the hallmark of PNH. The rest of the manuscript will thus aim to dissect the efficacy of eculizumab on haemolytic anaemia, trying to provide a guide for physicians in the forthcoming scenario of alternative anti‐complement agents available in the market or within clinical trials. Our guide is driven by the goal of maximizing therapeutic benefit for each individual PNH patient, based on their own clinical and biological data.

The efficacy of eculizumab has been largely demonstrated based on its effect on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and transfusion requirement, as shown in the pivotal registration trials; irrespective of haematological benefit, eculizumab has been proven biologically effective in reducing intravascular haemolysis in all PNH patients, with the exception of those carrying a rare C5 polymorphism. Nevertheless, the actual haemoglobin levels in PNH patients on eculizumab have not been described in detail, even if it is obvious that many patients remain variably anaemic. Haematological response categories were initially proposed in 2009, but they have not been formally established.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^d186c61f]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Until recently, eculizumab was the only approved treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and since its regulatory approval in 2007, it has changed the paradigm for the treatment of patients with PNH. Longterm experience has established that eculizumab is efficacious and well tolerated; however, approximately 11–27% of patients may experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) on approved dosages of eculizumab during long-term treatment.

Breakthrough hemolysis, characterized by the return of intravascular hemolysis and reappearance of classical PNH symptoms, may occur due to suboptimal C5 inhibitionand/or CAC such as infection, surgery, or pregnancy that may lead to increased complement activation resulting from higher C3b density. In some patients with suboptimal C5 inhibition or CAC, BTH may be ameliorated by shortening the 2-week dosing interval and/or increasing the dose of eculizumab.

Procedures

Patients visited the study clinic every 2 weeks for efficacy and safety assessments through week 26. A central laboratory conducted objective end point laboratory measurements; however, certified local laboratories were used under extenuating circumstances (eg, COVID-19 travel restrictions and medical emergencies). Units and normal ranges for values obtained at certified local laboratories were normalized for consistency with the study's central laboratory (Appendix 2.2).

Patients randomly assigned to the pegcetacoplan group self-administered subcutaneous infusions of pegcetacoplan 1080 mg twice weekly (treatment details in Appendix 2.3). Information required for actual administration of the treatment regimen in practice is provided in the supplemental file. Patients randomly assigned to the control group continued supportive care but could escape to pegcetacoplan treatment if their hemoglobin level decreased ≥ 2 g/dL below their baseline measurement or if they had a qualifying thromboembolic event secondary to PNH. The transfusion eligibility threshold was hemoglobin levels < 7 or ≥ 7 g/dL and < 9 g/dL with signs or symptoms warranting transfusion. Hematologic laboratory values from certified local laboratories were collected before transfusion administration.

### How I treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^d032bdfd]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonal blood disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure, and thrombosis. Many of the clinical manifestations of the disease result from complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the only curative therapy for PNH. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks terminal complement activation, is highly effective in reducing hemolysis, improving quality of life, and reducing the risk for thrombosis in PNH patients. Insights into the relevance of detecting PNH cells in PNH and other bone marrow failure disorders are highlighted, and indications for treating PNH patients with bone marrow transplantation and eculizumab are explored.

14.1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)

The safety and efficacy of eculizumab in PNH patients with hemolysis were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26 week study (PNH Study 1, NCT00122330); PNH patients were also treated with eculizumab in a single arm 52 week study (PNH Study 2, NCT00122304) and in a long- term extension study (E05-001, NCT00122317). Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab was 600 mg study drug every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study duration. Eculizumab was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25–45 minutes.

4 Discussion

This is the first real‐world analysis of BTH frequency among a large cohort of PNH patients treated with different complement inhibitors, outside the setting of clinical trials. BTH occurred with all CIs and in approximately 50% of patients, with a calculated incidence of 0.19 events per patient‐year.

Despite the varying duration of exposure, the exposure‐adjusted incidence was maximal with pegcetacoplan (0.4 events per patient‐year), lower for eculizumab and other anti‐C5 (0.18 per patient‐year), and intermediate for AP inhibitors (0.3 events per patient‐year). This is in line with the data of registration trials reporting an incidence of 0.1–0.2 per patient‐year with eculizumab and < 0.1 per patient‐year with ravulizumab, and of 0.33 per patient‐year with pegcetacoplan.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of ravulizumab in pediatric paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^a579719f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Since their approvals for the treatment of PNH, both eculizumab and ravulizumab have been effective treatment options for patients with the disease owing to their similar efficacy and safety profiles, although ravulizumab has shown to have an improved PK and PD profile. In adult patients with PNH, the improved profile of ravulizumab has been shown to reduce intravascular BTH associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition compared with eculizumab. Another benefit arising from ravulizumab is its dosing regimen, which includes the weight-based dosing and reduced dosing frequency compared with eculizumab. These differences have been found to have a substantially positive impact on the quality of life of patients.

The PK, PD, efficacy, and safety findings of this long-term study support the conclusion that pediatric patients with PNH may initiate ravulizumab and experience improvements in disease outcomes or switch from eculizumab to ravulizumab without loss of efficacy or change in safety. Importantly, this would allow physicians managing pediatric patients with PNH to consider ravulizumab as a treatment option with less impact on the daily lives of patients and their accompanying caregivers compared with eculizumab.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of ravulizumab in pediatric paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^627cc198]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

PNH is caused by the clonal expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins CD55 and CD59 as a result of a somatic PIGA gene mutation, leading to uncontrolled complement-mediated IVH. The only known curative treatment for PNH is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Owing to the complications associated with this procedure, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may not be suitable for all patients. The terminal complement component 5 (C5) inhibitors eculizumab and ravulizumab are the current standards of care for treating adult patients with PNH since their approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2007 and 2018, respectively. The main objective of effective treatment for PNH with targeted therapy is to inhibit terminal complement activity to block IVH and prevent thrombosis. It is therefore important to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of these treatments on complement C5 and to ensure immediate and complete terminal complement blockade in pediatric patients with PNH. The PK, PD, efficacy, and safety profiles of ravulizumab have been demonstrated in adult patients with PNH. In 2 phase 3 studies of adult patients with PNH, ravulizumab demonstrated noninferiority to eculizumab in complement C5 inhibitor-naive and -experienced patients (301 [NCT02946463] and 302 [NCT03056040] studies, respectively). Ravulizumab has been shown to result in immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition and control of IVH, and has an approximately 4-times longer terminal half-life than eculizumab. There are reports of a lower rate of intravascular breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) with ravulizumab compared with eculizumab, owing to its improved PK and PD profile. Moreover, ravulizumab offers weight-based dosing and a less burdensome dosing regimen than eculizumab; intravenous (IV) infusions are required every 8 weeks (Q8W) with ravulizumab (for adult and pediatric patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or every 4 weeks [Q4W] for patients < 20 kg)as opposed to every 2 weeks (Q2W) with eculizumab. In pediatric patients with PNH, the PK, PD, efficacy, and safety profiles for ravulizumab may be different to that seen in adults, and therefore it is important to confirm the response to ravulizumab in this population. Additionally, owing to the rarity of PNH in the pediatric population, the PK/PD profile was chosen as the primary end point of the present study.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^eb99ce4a]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Eculizumab is first-line treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); however, approximately 11–27% of patients may experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) on approved doses of eculizumab. Ravulizumab, a new long-acting C5 inhibitor with a four times longer mean half-life than eculizumab, provides immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition over 8-week dosing intervals. In two phase III studies, ravulizumab was non-inferior to eculizumab (Pinf ≤ 0.0004) for the BTH endpoint; fewer patients experienced BTH with ravulizumab versus eculizumab in both studies (301 [complement inhibitor−naïve patients], 4.0% vs. 10.7%; 302 [patients stabilized on eculizumab at baseline], 0% vs. 5.1%). In the current analysis, patientlevel data were evaluated to assess causes and clinical parameters associated with incidents of BTH reported during the 26-week treatment periods in the ravulizumab phase III PNH studies. Of the five BTH events occurring in ravulizumab-treated patients across the studies, none were temporally associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition (free C5 ≥ 0.5 mg/mL); four (80%) were temporally associated with complement-amplifying conditions (CAC). Of the 22 events occurring in eculizumab-treated patients, 11 were temporally associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition, including three events also associated with concomitant infection. Six events were associated with CAC only. Five events were unrelated to free C5 elevation or reported CAC. These results suggest that the immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition achieved through weight-based dosing of ravulizumab reduces the risk of BTH by eliminating BTH associated with suboptimal C5 inhibition in patients with PNH.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: a phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^13f820b4]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Ravulizumab offers immediate, complete, and sustained inhibition of complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis at 8-week dosing intervals. In clinical trials, weight-based doses of ravulizumab demonstrated non-inferiority and a comparable safety profile to approved fixed-dose eculizumab in patients with PNH, with durable efficacy and tolerance for up to 4 years following a switch from fixed-dose eculizumab. Although a single case describing treatment switch from high-dose eculizumab to standard weight-based ravulizumab has been reported, there are currently no clinical trial data reporting the feasibility and safety of this switch in patients with PNH.

Here, we report findings from study 401 (NCT04320602), a phase IV, single-arm, two-center trial conducted in the UK between April 2021 and December 2022 that was designed to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of switching treatment from high-dose intravenous eculizumab (1,200 mg Q2W) to weight-based intravenous ravulizumab Q8W in patients with PNH. Included patients were aged ≥ 18 years with a documented diagnosis of PNH, who had received high-dose intravenous eculizumab for ≥ 3 months prior to screening and had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≤ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN; 281.0 U/L, central laboratory assessment) at screening. All patients had received meningococcal vaccines A/C/Y/W-135 conjugate and B within 3 years prior to the start of the study. Key exclusion criteria were body weight < 40 kg at screening, history of major adverse vascular events within 6 months prior to enrollment, bone marrow transplantation, malignancy within 5 years prior to enrollment, platelet count < 30×10⁹/L, and neutrophil count < 0.5×10⁹/L. Ethical approval for this study was received from Yorkshire and the Humber - Leeds East Research Ethics Committee (reference: 20/YH/0105). Patients consented to participation in the study and could withdraw at any time.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest clinical trial to date in pediatric patients with PNH treated with complement C5 inhibitors. PK and PD data from the PEP and the 4-year EP, with mean treatment durations of 868.0 and 1022.6 days in the treatment-naive and treatment-experienced groups, respectively, showed that ravulizumab provided immediate, complete, and sustained terminal complement inhibition, irrespective of prior treatment with eculizumab. Similar to the clinical trials of ravulizumab in adults with PNH (301 and 302 studies), there were differences in the clinical characteristics between the 2 patient cohorts at baseline, because eculizumab-experienced patients had previously benefited from C5 inhibitor therapy.

Elevated IVH, measured by LDH levels ≥ 1.5 × ULN, is an indicator of disease severity in patients with PNH. In eculizumab-naive patients, ravulizumab treatment resulted in decreased LDH levels from baseline. However, in eculizumab-experienced patients, LDH levels were already generally maintained within the normal range that was achieved during prior treatment with eculizumab. In addition, the proportion of patients who had normalized LDH levels increased from baseline except in 1 visit for each group (eculizumab-naive, day 911; eculizumab-experienced, day 15). Eculizumab-naive patients also experienced small improvements in fatigue from baseline, whereas levels were generally maintained from baseline in the eculizumab-experienced cohort. These results are consistent with those from the 301 and 302 studies, in which eculizumab-naive adult patients with PNH experienced improvements in LDH levels and fatigue, whereas in eculizumab-experienced patients, ravulizumab maintained the improvement already achieved with eculizumab treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of vemircopan as monotherapy in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^3328f453]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, complement-mediated hematologic disease. We present the results of a phase 2, open-label clinical trial of vemircopan monotherapy in patients with PNH (NCT04170023) to explore whether inhibiting the complement alternative pathway via factor D is safe and effective for patients with PNH. Adults (≥ 18 years) with PNH who were treatment-naive, switched from eculizumab with hemoglobin (Hgb) < 10 g/dL, or rolled over from danicopan monotherapy (ACH471-103 trial; NCT03181633) were enrolled. The trial comprised a 60-day screening period, 12-week treatment period, and 148-week long-term extension. Participants received vemircopan 120 mg twice daily (bid), with potential escalation to 180 mg bid. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 12 in Hgb (g/dL). Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious AEs. Twenty-nine participants were enrolled (treatment-naive, n = 12; eculizumab-switch, n = 11; danicopan-rollover, n = 6); all completed the 12-week treatment period, and 1 danicopan-rollover participant completed the long-term extension. Clinically meaningful improvements from baseline to week 12 in mean (SD) Hgb (change of ≥ 2 g/dL) were reported in the treatment-naive (3.6 [1.5]) and eculizumab-switch (3.3 [2.0]) cohorts and maintained through the end of the trial. Eighty-two breakthrough intravascular hemolysis (BT-IVH) events in 25 participants were reported. Twenty-eight participants reported TEAEs, and 14 reported serious AEs; most were unrelated to vemircopan. No deaths occurred. This trial evaluating vemircopan monotherapy in patients with PNH met its primary efficacy endpoint; however, concerns regarding BT-IVH risk and suboptimal, inconsistent control of IVH emerged, leading to early trial termination. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04170023) and EudraCT (2019-003830-17).

### Eculizumab to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria… [^d97ca7a5]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

Participants have an electrocardiogram and blood and urine tests, and are vaccinated against Neisseria meningitides, a common bacteria that can cause a disabling or fatal type of meningitis. They then enter an observation phase of the study, with monthly visits during which they complete a questionnaire; update their health status, transfusion record, and medication use; have their vital signs checked and PNH symptoms evaluated; have blood and urine tests; and receive a transfusion, if necessary. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis. The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of the GPI-linked proteins that serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack.

Two such proteins, CD55 and CD59 have been shown to be absent from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types. Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous complement. Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening thrombosis. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59 inhibits terminal complement. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study of eculizumab or placebo administered intravenously to approximately 75 PNH patients.

The study is designed to evaluate the safety of eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and to determine if the administration of this terminal complement inhibitor could provide a safe and effective substitute for CD59 function. Drug: Eculizumab

### Sustained response and long-term safety of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^c9411ec7]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hematologic disorder characterized by clonal expansion of red blood cells (RBCs) lacking the ability to inhibit complement-mediated hemolysis. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the C5 complement protein, blocks serum hemolytic activity. This study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 11 patients with PNH during an open-label extension trial. After completion of an initial 12-week study, all patients chose to participate in the 52-week extension study. Eculizumab, administered at 900 mg every 12 to 14 days, was sufficient to completely and consistently block complement activity in all patients. A dramatic reduction in hemolysis was maintained throughout the study, with a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels from 3110.7 IU/L before treatment to 622.4 IU/L (P = 0.002). The proportion of PNH type III RBCs increased from 36.7% at baseline to 58.4% (P = 0.005). The paroxysm rate of days with gross evidence of hemoglobinuria per patient each month decreased from 3.0 during screening to 0.2 (P < .001) during treatment. The median transfusion rate decreased from 1.8 U per patient each month before eculizumab treatment to 0.3 U per patient each month (P = 0.001) during treatment. Statistically significant improvements in quality-of-life measures were also maintained during the extension study. Eculizumab continued to be safe and well tolerated, and all patients completed the study. The close relationship between sustained terminal complement inhibition, hemolysis, and symptoms was demonstrated.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sustained eculizumab treatment in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^1cf6a212]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Reduction in the incidence of TE and CKD, the two major causes of death in PNH, by administration of eculizumab would be expected to lead to improved patient survival. In the current prospective, multinational study in a large cohort of 195 patients, we demonstrated a patient survival of 97.6% (95% CI, 93.7%–99.1%) at 3 years, which was maintained over 66 months of eculizumab treatment. This result is similar to the 5-year survival rate of 95.5% observed in a single-centre, retrospective analysis of 79 patients (Kelly et al). These survival rates seen with eculizumab therapy are a substantial improvement over historical 5-year survival rates of approximately 65% in PNH patients with evidence of haemolysis (Hillmen et al; Kelly et al,) and are similar to survival rates of age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (Kelly et al). These results further emphasize the role of uncontrolled complement activation in the pathophysiology of PNH-related mortality.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of ravulizumab in pediatric paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^de34d4cb]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare hematologic disease of uncontrolled terminal complement activation leading to intravascular hemolysis, thrombotic events and increased morbidity and mortality. This phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluated ravulizumab treatment in eculizumab-naive or -experienced pediatric patients (aged < 18 years) with PNH over a 26-week primary evaluation period (PEP) and 4-year extension period (EP). Patients included in the study received weight-based intravenous ravulizumab dosing. Primary end points were pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters to confirm complement component 5 (C5) inhibition by ravulizumab; secondary end points assessed the efficacy (including percentage change in lactate dehydrogenase levels over time) and safety of ravulizumab. Thirteen patients, 5 (38.5%) eculizumab-naive and 8 (61.5%) eculizumab-experienced, were enrolled. Ravulizumab Ctrough levels were above the pharmacokinetic threshold of 175 μg/mL in the PEP and EP except in 1 patient. At the end of the study, pre- and post-infusion mean ± standard deviation serum ravulizumab concentrations were 610.50 ± 201.53 μg/mL and 518.29 ± 109.67 μg/mL for eculizumab-naive and eculizumab-experienced patients, respectively. After the first ravulizumab infusion, serum-free C5 concentrations were < 0.5 μg/mL in both cohorts until the end of the study (0.061 ± 0.021 μg/mL and 0.061 ± 0.018 μg/mL for eculizumab-naive and eculizumab-experienced patients, respectively). Compared with baseline, ravulizumab improved and maintained efficacy outcomes in both groups. Ravulizumab had an acceptable safety profile with no new safety signals identified, and provided immediate, complete, and sustained terminal complement inhibition, translating to clinical benefit for pediatric patients with PNH. This trial was registered at www. ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT03406507.

Discussion

In patients with PNH receiving complement inhibitor therapy, a BTH event represents loss of disease control. BTH is manifested by classical PNH symptoms and can require blood transfusion, but more critically it can be associated with the return of the morbidity associated with PNH, including potentially life-threatening thromboembolic events. A consensus definition of BTH derived after a literature review and interviews with PNH experts, and prospectively accepted by regulatory authorities, was used in the two phase III studies of ravulizumab to evaluate the incidence and causality of BTH in patients who were naїve to complement inhibitor therapy as well as those who were previously stabilized on eculizumab. In both studies, ravulizumab was shown to be non-inferior to eculizumab on the assessment of BTH, and treatment with ravulizumab was associated with numerically fewer episodes of BTH compared with eculizumab in each of these studies.

Table 3.
Eculizumab breakthrough hemolysis events and narratives: study 301.

The current analysis showed that no BTH events in patients treated with weight-based dosing of ravulizumab were associated with elevations in free C5 levels. In contrast, several patients treated with eculizumab across both studies had BTH events that were temporally associated with elevations in free C5 levels (C5 ≥ 0.5 mg/mL), suggesting these patients may have had suboptimal C5 control. In such cases, it has been shown that BTH can be successfully managed in some patients by adjusting the dosing amount and/or frequency of eculizumab administration that differs from the approved regimen of eculizumab. However, in both studies (301 and 302), patients required maintenance with the approved eculizumab dosing (900 mg every 2 weeks); no changes to the dose levels or dosing regimen were permitted during the study, and if any such changes were made, these patients were excluded from the studies.

### Effect of the complement inhibitor eculizumab on thromboembolism in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^740b9be1]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Hemolysis and hemoglobinemia contribute to serious clinical sequelae in hemolytic disorders. In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients, hemolysis can contribute to thromboembolism (TE), the most feared complication in PNH, and the leading cause of disease-related deaths. We evaluated whether long-term treatment with the complement inhibitor eculizumab reduces the rate of TE in patients with PNH. Clinical trial participants included all patients in the 3 eculizumab PNH clinical studies, which recruited patients between 2002 and 2005 (n = 195); patients from these studies continued treatment in the current multinational open-label extension study. Thromboembolism rate with eculizumab treatment was compared with the pretreatment rate in the same patients. The TE event rate with eculizumab treatment was 1.07 events/100 patient-years compared with 7.37 events/100 patient-years (P < .001) prior to eculizumab treatment (relative reduction, 85%; absolute reduction, 6.3 TE events/100 patient-years). With equalization of the duration of exposure before and during treatment for each patient, TE events were reduced from 39 events before eculizumab to 3 events during eculizumab (P < .001). The TE event rate in antithrombotic-treated patients (n = 103) was reduced from 10.61 to 0.62 events/100 patient-years with eculizumab treatment (P < .001). These results show that eculizumab treatment reduces the risk of clinical thromboembolism in patients with PNH. This study is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (study ID no. NCT00122317).

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^623ffed4]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, weight-based dosing of ravulizumab administered every 8 weeks was associated with numerically fewer episodes of BTH versus eculizumab administered 900 mg every 2 weeks over 26 weeks of complement inhibitor therapy in PNH patients with high disease activity. The observed differences in BTH rates for ravulizumab versus eculizumab may be attributable to the ability of ravulizumab to completely inhibit free C5 over the entire 8-week dosing interval. Furthermore, no BTH events in the ravulizumab group were associated with free C5 concentrations ≥ 0.5 mg/mL. In contrast, some patients treated with eculizumab experienced multiple BTH events that were temporally associated with elevations in free C5 (one resulting in hospitalization). Similar numbers of patients receiving ravulizumab or eculizumab experienced CAC-related BTH, possibly due to proximal complement activation. Overall, results from these two studies demonstrate that ravulizumab achieved immediate and complete inhibition of free C5 over the entire 26-week treatment period, reducing the overall risk of BTH by eliminating free C5-associated BTH.

### Safety and efficacy of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria evolving from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia… [^b181259c]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 7033 Background: Myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia have been reported to be associated with the development of the acquired clonal hemolytic and bone marrow failure disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Two recent phase 3 clinical studies have demonstrated significant benefit of the complement inhibitor eculizumab in a heterogeneous population of patients with PNH. Methods: To investigate whether eculizumab was safe and effective in PNH patients with a history of MDS or AA, efficacy parameters were examined in the MDS/AA patient subpopulation. Anemia was improved as packed RBC transfusion requirements were substantially reduced with eculizumab in these patients from a median of 8 units per patient in the 6 months before treatment to 0 units per patient during eculizumab treatment.

Despite history of bone marrow failure, eculizumab treatment markedly improved fatigue with an 11. 6 point increase over baseline using the FACIT-Fatigue instrument. Fatigue was similarly improved with the fatigue scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument. Eculizumab appeared to be well tolerated when administered to PNH patients with a history of MDS or AA. The significant clinical improvements in hematologic and quality of life outcomes with eculizumab treatment in PNH patients with a history of MDS or AA were similar to the clinical improvements demonstrated the overall PNH patient population. Conclusions: These analyses show that eculizumab treatment may provide important clinical benefit when administered to PNH patients with a history of bone marrow failure.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis events observed in the phase 3 randomized studies of ravulizumab versus eculizumab in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^8fe9799b]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Breakthrough hemolysis: patient narratives

Patient narratives on BTH in study 301 are shown in Table 2 for the ravulizumab group and in Table 3 for the eculizumab group. BTH events occurring in the eculizumab group in study 302 are summarized in Table 4. Overall, the majority of patients with BTH (70% [16 of 23]) exhibited one or two PNH-related signs or symptoms; the most commonly reported PNH-related signs and symptoms were anemia, dyspnea, hemoglobinuria, and fatigue. With respect to red blood cell transfusion, 8 patients (3 in the ravulizumab group and 5 in the eculizumab group) experiencing BTH required transfusion in study 301 (Tables 2 and 3) and 3 patients experiencing BTH in the eculizumab group required transfusion in study 302 (Table 4).

Additional analyses

Lactate dehydrogenase excursion only - an analysis assessing the prevalence of excursions of LDH ≥ 2xULN after reduction below 1.5xULN without regard to symptoms (i.e. the LDH portion of the BTH definition) showed treatment with ravulizumab to be superior to eculizumab with significantly fewer ravulizumab-treated patients experiencing LDH excursions compared with eculizumab-treated patients in both study 301 (8.8% [95%CI: 3.8, 13.8] vs. 20.7% [95%CI: 13.5, 27.9], respectively; treatment difference −11.7% [95%CI: −20.7, −2.7]; P = 0.012) and study 302 (5.2% [95%CI: 0.8, 9.6] vs. 16.3% [9.0, 23.6], respectively; treatment difference, −11.2% [95%CI: −20.3, −2.4]; P = 0.015).

### Cost-effectiveness of iptacopan for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^59073c3e]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Model overview

We built a base-case Markov cohort model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of iptacopan monotherapy compared with the SOC treatment with C5 inhibition (ie, eculizumab and/or ravulizumab). Our model was based on the clinical data from APPLY-PNH, the open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial that examined the efficacy of oral iptacopan therapy in patients with PNH with residual anemia despite SOC with anti-C5 therapy. In our model, anti-C5–treated patients with PNH were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms paralleling the trial: oral iptacopan monotherapy or ongoing SOC with anti-C5 therapy (Figure 1). Patients in each arm entered the model at a median age of 51 years, with 69% being of female sex to reflect patient characteristics in APPLY-PNH. In the iptacopan arm, patients received 200 mg of oral iptacopan twice daily, following APPLY-PNH's protocol. Reflecting trial baseline characteristics (as well as current treatment patterns) in the SOC arm in our model, 66% of patients received eculizumab and 34% of patients received ravulizumab. Patients received 900 mg of eculizumab every 2 weeks or 3300 mg of ravulizumab every 8 weeks IV, following the US Food and Drug Administration package insert and based on the trial population's baseline characteristics. The cycle length of our model was 1 month, chosen to both reflect the clinical tempo of the disease and to be consistent with prior cost-effectiveness analyses in the PNH arena. In the base-case model, we assumed that patients stayed in their initial health states (ie, transfusion-required or transfusion-avoidant states) through the model time-horizon and compared model output with an additional model structure that incorporated adjusted, aggregated individual-level trial-specific patient transition probability matrix, allowing for the transition of individual patients between different health states (Figure 1 A-B). In each cycle, patients in both arms could experience breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) and transfusion-related adverse events. Patients had risks of death because of transfusion-related adverse events and, separately, because of background mortality. Although severe adverse events including major adverse vascular events and infection were reported in a few cases, none of them resulted in treatment discontinuation or death during the 24-week observation period. Therefore, in our model, treatment-associated complications did not result in treatment discontinuation. We conducted the analysis over a lifetime time-horizon across the range of accepted willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds in the United States. TreeAge Pro Healthcare 2024 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA) was used to build the model and conduct the analysis. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards reporting guideline was implemented as applicable.

### How we (' ll) treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: diving into the future [^8d5a7446]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis, severe thrombophilia and bone marrow failure. While for patients with bone marrow failure the treatment follows that of immune-mediated aplastic anaemia, that of classic, haemolytic PNH is based on anti-complement medication. The anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab has revolutionized treatment, resulting in control of intravascular haemolysis and thromboembolic risk, with improved long-term survival. Novel strategies of complement inhibition are emerging. New anti-C5 agents reproduce the safety and efficacy of eculizumab, with improved patient convenience. Proximal complement inhibitors have been developed to address C3-mediated extra-vascular haemolysis and seem to improve haematological response.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of danicopan as add-on therapy to ravulizumab or eculizumab in PNH with significant EVH [^77d71482]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Complement C5 inhibitor treatment with ravulizumab or eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) improves outcomes and survival. Some patients remain anemic due to clinically significant extravascular hemolysis (cs-EVH; hemoglobin [Hb] ≤ 9.5 g/dL and absolute reticulocyte count [ARC] ≥ 120 × 109/L). In the phase 3 ALPHA trial, participants received oral factor D inhibitor danicopan (150 mg 3 times daily) or placebo plus ravulizumab or eculizumab during the 12-week, double-blind treatment period 1 (TP1); those receiving placebo switched to danicopan during the subsequent 12-week, open-label TP2 and continued during the 2-year long-term extension (LTE). There were 86 participants randomized in the study, of whom 82 entered TP2, and 80 entered LTE. The primary end point was met, with Hb improvements from baseline at week 12 (least squares mean change, 2.8 g/dL) with danicopan. For participants switching from placebo to danicopan at week 12, improvements in mean Hb were observed at week 24. Similar trends were observed for the proportion of participants with ≥ 2 g/dL Hb increase, ARC, proportion of participants achieving transfusion avoidance, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale scores. Improvements were maintained up to week 72. No new safety signals were observed. The breakthrough hemolysis rate was 6 events per 100 patient-years. These long-term data demonstrate sustained efficacy and safety of danicopan plus ravulizumab/eculizumab for continued control of terminal complement activity, intravascular hemolysis, and cs-EVH in PNH. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04469465.

### Management of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: a personal view [^87f5129b]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a serious form of acquired haemolytic anaemia with several features that make it unique, including the fact that it is caused by clonal expansion, in the context of bone marrow failure, of a haematopoietic stem cell that has a somatic mutation in a gene crucial for the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors; and that this also produces a life-threatening acquired thrombophilic state. Until recently, the two only main options for patients with PNH were either allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or supportive management, including blood transfusion: both options require some skill and good patient-doctor collaboration. Since the start of this millennium a major advance has been the introduction of eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the C5 protein of the complement system: blockade of C5 prevents activation of the complement distal pathway, and thus abrogates the complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis that severely plagues patients with PNH. This review outlines an approach to the management of all three major components of the clinical picture of PNH — namely haemolysis, thrombosis and bone marrow failure — based on the literature and on personal experience. We consider specifically how the use of eculizumab has modified other aspects of the management of PNH, and even the pathophysiology itself of this disease. Finally, we develop a treatment algorithm which others might find helpful.

### The complement inhibitor eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^af9ac378]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study TRIUMPH was published by Hillmen P and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In the TRIUMPH study, the trial question was: what is the effect of eculizumab in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria? In the TRIUMPH study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TRIUMPH study, the population was: 87 patients (52 female, 35 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The key exclusion criteria were complement deficiency, an active bacterial infection, or a history of meningococcal disease and receipt of bone marrow transplantation. In the TRIUMPH study, the interventions were: n = 43 eculizumab (IV at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900-mg dose and then 900 mg every other week through week 26) n = 44 placebo (matching placebo). In the TRIUMPH study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions (49% vs. 0%; ARD 49, 95% CI 19.93 to 78.07). In the TRIUMPH study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in units of packed red cells transfusion (0 vs. 10; MD -10, 95% CI -15.93 to -4.07) Significant increase in change in the QoL during treatment, global health status scale (10.9 points vs. -8.5 points; MD 19.4, 95% CI 7.89 to 30.91). In the TRIUMPH study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in serious adverse events (9% vs. 20%). In the TRIUMPH study, the conclusion was: in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, eculizumab was superior to placebo with respect to stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions.

### Understanding pharmacological complement inhibition in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^c0033465]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, a plethora of novel anti-complement agents have entered into preclinical and clinical development, especially for PNH, the prototypic example of a purely complement-mediated hemolytic anemia. Even if, clinically speaking, the most promising results are coming from the so-called proximal inhibitors, the development of novel terminal complement inhibitors is shedding light on our understanding of pharmacological complement inhibition. In this setting, well-conducted phase II studies are essential to investigate subtle differences among agents targeting even the same complement component, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of individual inhibitors which ultimately influence their clinical efficacy and safety profile even more than their actual target. Therapeutic C5 inhibition has been well-established for more than 15 years, making the interpretation of novel observations much easier than that for novel proximal inhibitors.

In the small phase II study by Kulasekararaj et al. PNH patients who had not received previous treatment with eculizumab had significant benefits in terms of LDH decrease and transfusion avoidance when treated with zilucoplan, even if, according to the authors, changes in more meaningful clinical parameters (e.g. hemoglobin level) and other biomarkers of hemolysis were small or variable. Even more interestingly, PNH patients switching from eculizumab to zilucoplan consistently exhibited some increase in LDH level, with the largest increase seen in patients who were transfusion-dependent on eculizumab treatment (whose LDH levels were marginally increased at baseline). Collectively, these findings suggest that the C5 inhibition obtained with zilucoplan is obviously clinically meaningful (in comparison to no treatment, in eculizumab-naïve patients), but possibly less efficient than that of eculizumab (in patients switching from eculizumab). Notably, this somehow suboptimal inhibition was seen despite apparently complete complement inhibition (as assessed by functional assays measuring residual complement activity, suggesting that such assays are only partially informative as a pharmacodynamic measurement during anti-complement therapies), and despite the postulated dual mechanism of action of zilucoplan (likely because the effects on C5 cleavage and on subsequent C6 binding both rely on direct binding to C5, one being the effect of the other instead of two independent events). As a possible mechanism of reduced efficacy in patients switched from eculizumab, the authors propose the accumulation of high-density C3b on PNH erythrocytes, enabling non-enzymatic cleavage of C5 (i.e. conformational change), claiming that this residual efficacy is a kind of iatrogenic effect due to a transiently combined effect of the two C5 inhibitors at the time of the switch. The authors built their hypothesis on some in vitro data, which showed that combined exposure to eculizumab and zilucoplan results in a larger proportion of C3b-opsonized PNH erythrocytes. However, their theory is not convincing for a number of reasons.

### Management of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in the era of complement inhibitory therapy [^4e389b9d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of safe, effective targeted therapy that controls intravascular hemolysis, the management of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) remains complicated because of disease heterogeneity and close association with BM failure syndromes. The purpose of this review is to provide a framework for individualizing treatment based on disease classification. According to the recommendations of the International PNH Interest Group, patients can be placed into one of the following 3 categories: (1) classic PNH, (2) PNH in the setting of another BM failure syndrome, or (3) subclinical PNH. The PNH clone in patients with subclinical disease is insufficiently large to produce even biochemical evidence of hemolysis, and consequently, patients who fit into this category require no PNH-specific therapy. Patients with PNH in the setting of another BM failure syndrome (usually aplastic anemia or low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome) have at least biochemical evidence of hemolysis, but typically the PNH clone is small (< 10%) so that hemolysis does not contribute significantly to the underlying anemia. In these cases, the focus of treatment is on the BM failure component of the disease. Intravascular hemolysis is the dominant feature of classic PNH, and this process is blocked by the complement inhibitor eculizumab. The thrombophilia of PNH also appears to be ameliorated by eculizumab, but the drug has no effect on the BM failure component of the disease. Low-grade extravascular hemolysis due to complement C3 opsonization develops in most patients treated with eculizumab, and in some cases is a cause for suboptimal response to treatment. Allogeneic BM transplantation can cure classic PNH, but treatment-related toxicity suggests caution for this approach to management.

### Progress in the use of biological therapies to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: focus on patient profiling [^3586e25b]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complement inhibition has revolutionized paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) treatment. While eculizumab, the first anti-C5 antibody, reduced intravascular hemolysis (IVH) and thrombotic risk, it required fortnightly infusions and left a significant percentage of patients with persistent anemia. New terminal complement inhibitors, such as long-acting ravulizumab and subcutaneous crovalimab, have allowed for better control of IVH and demonstrated efficacy in patients with specific C5 genetic polymorphisms (crovalimab). Proximal complement inhibitors, including the small molecule pegcetacoplan (C3 inhibitor), the recently approved orally administered iptacopan (factor B inhibitor), and danicopan (factor D inhibitor, in combination with anti-C5), efficiently control C3-mediated extravascular hemolysis. However, these treatments come with an increased risk of serious breakthrough hemolysis events due to reduced half-life and increased sparing of PNH erythrocytes.

Areas Covered

In this review, we summarize phase III trials and real-world data to support patient-tailored treatment strategies and offer practical guidance for patient profiling and optimal complement inhibitor selection.

Expert Opinion

In this evolving landscape, treatment choice has become increasingly complex. PNH specialists must now balance multiple factors beyond efficacy alone. Disease characteristics such as previous thrombotic events or transfusion needs, as well as drug administration routes, patient preferences toward oral or parenteral administration and expected compliance, will all influence clinical decisions.

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: an international multicenter experience [^4e38fc42]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding clinical severity, the median Hb drop was 1.6 g/dL overall, and approximately 40% had a decrease of more than 2 g/dL, while the remaining patients had only minor fluctuations in Hb levels. Severity was almost comparable among eculizumab‐ and ravulizumab‐treated patients with the exception of a more profound drop of Hb with the former (which could be easily related to PK BTH with standard dose eculizumab in 20%); though transfusions were required in 40% of subjects in both groups. This compares favorably with reported data of eculizumab and ravulizumab, were Hb drops ≥ 2 g/dL occurred in ~20%–40% of BTH episodes. Among patients treated with pegcetacoplan and AP inhibitors, the majority experienced Hb drops ≥ 2 g/dL, which was accompanied by an LDH increase > 3 × ULN in most cases. However, the transfusion need reached 86% with the former and 31% with the latter, likely in keeping with higher baseline Hb levels in patients treated with AP inhibitors. This higher drop of Hb in patients treated with proximal inhibitors has been related to the higher PNH red cell clone, protected from hemolysis, observed with these treatments. Pegcetacoplan and AP inhibitors were those with the highest PNH red blood cell clone as well as with a higher rate of complete response pre‐BTH in our series. These data are in line with the PEGASUS trial, where factors such as high baseline LDH levels and frequent transfusions were identified as predictors for BTH risk.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ravulizumab and eculizumab on complement component 5 in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: results of two phase 3 randomised, multicentre studies [^de7a89ee]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ravulizumab, a novel long-acting complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor administered every 8 weeks (q8w), was non-inferior to eculizumab for all efficacy outcomes in two randomised, open-label, phase 3 trials in C5 inhibitor-naïve (Study 301) and eculizumab-experienced (Study 302) adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). This pre-specified analysis characterised ravulizumab pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD; free C5 levels), and PD differences between medications (Study 301, n = 246; Study 302, n = 195). Ravulizumab PK parameters were determined using non-compartmental analysis. Serum free C5 was quantified with a Gyros-based fluorescence assay (ravulizumab) and an electrochemiluminescence ligand-binding assay (eculizumab). Ravulizumab PK parameters were numerically comparable in both studies; the median time to maximum concentrations ranged from 2.3 to 2.8 and 2.3 to 2.6 h in studies 301 and 302, respectively. Ravulizumab steady-state serum concentrations were achieved immediately after the first dose and sustained throughout treatment. For ravulizumab, the mean (SD) post hoc terminal elimination half-life was 49.7 (8.9) days. Serum free C5 concentrations < 0.5 µg/ml were achieved after the first ravulizumab dose and sustained throughout treatment in both studies. In a minority of patients, free C5 concentrations < 0.5 µg/ml were not consistently achieved with eculizumab in either study. Ravulizumab q8w was more consistent in providing immediate, complete, sustained C5 inhibition than eculizumab every-2-weeks in patients with PNH.

### Danicopan: an oral complement factor D inhibitor for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^00f6ee45]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis due to the absence of complement regulators CD55 and CD59 on affected erythrocytes. Danicopan is a first-in-class oral proximal, complement alternative pathway factor D inhibitor. Therapeutic factor D inhibition was designed to control intravascular hemolysis and prevent C3-mediated extravascular hemolysis. In this open-label, phase II, dose-finding trial, ten untreated PNH patients with hemolysis received danicopan monotherapy (100–200 mg thrice daily). Endpoints included changes in the concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at day 28 (primary endpoint), of LDH at day 84, and of hemoglobin. Safety, pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics, and patient-reported outcomes were assessed. Ten patients reached the primary endpoint; two later discontinued treatment: one because of a serious adverse event (elevated aspartate aminotransferase/ alanine aminotransferase coincident with breakthrough hemolysis, resolving without sequelae) and one for personal reasons unrelated to safety. Eight patients completed treatment. Intravascular hemolysis was inhibited, as demonstrated by a mean decrease of LDH (5.7 times upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline vs. 1.8 times ULN at day 28 and 2.2 times ULN at day 84; both P < 0.001). Mean baseline hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL, increased by 1.1 (day 28) and 1.7 (day 84) g/dL (both P < 0.005). No significant C3 fragment deposition occurred on glycosylphosphatidylinositol- deficient erythrocytes. Mean baseline Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue score, 34, increased by 9 (day 28) and 13 (day 84) points. The most common adverse events were headache and upper respiratory tract infection. These phase II, monotherapy data show that proximal inhibition with danicopan provides clinically meaningful inhibition of intravascular hemolysis and increases hemoglobin concentration in untreated PNH patients, without evidence of C3-mediated extravascular hemolysis. This trial was registered at(#NCT03053102).

### Characterization of breakthrough hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: an international multicenter experience [^55097fb9]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare and heterogeneous disorder that has greatly benefited from the advent of complement inhibitors (CIs). These innovative therapies have significantly controlled intravascular hemolysis and reduced PNH‐related thrombotic risk, improved hemoglobin (Hb), decreased transfusion dependence, and nearly normalized patient survival. However, certain challenges persist with their chronic use, including the risk of infections, which is managed through vaccination protocols and patient education, as well as the occurrence of intercurrent hemolytic episodes known as breakthrough hemolysis (BTH).

BTH is highly variable, ranging from mild alteration of hemolytic markers without clinical manifestations (subclinical BTH) to massive increase in LDH associated with rapid declines in Hb levels, leading to severe anemia, transfusion need, and the re‐emergence of thrombotic risk.

Several factors can precipitate BTH, such as insufficient drug plasma levels (pharmacokinetic BTH) or conditions that enhance complement activation (pharmacodynamic BTH), including infections, trauma, and surgery, despite therapeutic drug concentration. Early identification and management of these complement activating conditions (CACs), along with supportive measures to mitigate the clinical severity of BTH, such as transfusions, anticoagulant prophylaxis, and intravenous hydration, with additional doses of background CI and/or giving a rescue dose of eculizumab, is of paramount importance.

Currently, there are no guidelines for defining BTH and its severity; clinical management is not standardized. Additionally, several terminal and proximal CIs are now licensed, potentially exposing patients to different risks of BTH with diverse clinical presentations.

This study aimed to analyze a large cohort of PNH patients treated with either terminal or proximal complement inhibitors, focusing on the frequency of BTH episodes, their triggers, clinical severity, management strategies, and the occurrence of thrombotic complications.

### Ravulizumab (Ultomiris) [^a964a4bf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1	Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)

The safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in adult patients with PNH was assessed in 2 open-label, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority Phase 3 studies: PNH Study 301 and PNH Study 302. Study 301 enrolled patients with PNH who were complement inhibitor naïve and had active hemolysis. Study 302 enrolled patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months. The safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in pediatric patients with PNH was assessed in PNH Study 304, an open-label, Phase 3 study conducted in eculizumab-experienced and complement inhibitor treatment naïve pediatric patients with PNH.

In Study 301 and Study 302, adults with PNH were dosed with ULTOMIRIS administered intravenously in accordance with the weight-based dosing described in Section 2.3 (4 infusions of ULTOMIRIS over 26 weeks) above. Eculizumab was administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by maintenance treatment with 900 mg of eculizumab on Day 29 and every 2 weeks (q2w) thereafter for a total of 26 weeks of treatment, according to the approved dosing regimen of eculizumab which was the standard-of-care for PNH at the time of the studies.

Patients were vaccinated against meningococcal infection prior to or at the time of initiating treatment with ULTOMIRIS or eculizumab, or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics beyond 2 weeks after vaccination was at the discretion of the provider.

### Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: results of 2 phase 1b / 2 studies [^313fa295]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Ravulizumab (ALXN1210), a humanized monoclonal antibody to complement component C5, was engineered from eculizumab to have a substantially longer terminal half-life, permitting longer dosing intervals for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) treatment. Two phase 1b/2 multicenter open-label studies evaluated efficacy and safety of multiple doses and regimens of ravulizumab in PNH patients naive to complement-inhibitor treatment. Patients in study 103 (n = 13) received ravulizumab 900 mg (lower trough exposure) or 1800 mg every 4 weeks (higher trough exposure); those in study 201 (n = 26) received 1000 mg every 4, 1600 mg every 6, 2400 mg every 8, or 5400 mg every 12 weeks. Trough exposure levels with study 201 dosing regimens were similar to the study 103 900-mg every-4-weeks regimen. Rapid sustained reduction of plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) occurred across all cohorts (73%-90% at end point vs baseline). A greater proportion of patients had normalized LDH (< 234 U/L) at least once from days 29 to 253 in the higher- (85.7%) vs lower-trough-exposure (50.0%-83.3%) cohorts; the weighted average of the proportion of instances of LDH normalization from days 29 to 253 was highest in higher- vs lower-trough-exposure cohorts (62.3% vs 31.4%-54.5%). No patients in the higher-trough-exposure cohort, but 1 to 2 patients in all lower-trough-exposure cohorts, experienced breakthrough hemolysis. Ravulizumab improved quality of life (QoL) measures in all cohorts. Two patients experienced meningococcal infections; both recovered and continued in the study. In summary, ravulizumab provided rapid and sustained reduction in complement-mediated hemolysis and improved QoL at dosing intervals up to 12 weeks. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02598583 (study 103) and NCT02605993 (study 201).

Other Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Infusion- and Injection-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Patients Who are Complement Inhibitor-Naïve

The data described below reflect exposure of 204 patients with PNH who were complement inhibitor-naïve and who were randomized in COMMODORE 2 to receive PIASKY (n = 135) or eculizumab (n = 69) at the recommended dosing regimen for 24 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients receiving PIASKY in the COMMODORE 2 study, including epistaxis and pneumonia, which occurred in 2 patients each, and infusion related reaction, pyelonephritis, COVID-19, and hypovolemic shock which were reported in 1 patient each.

Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 5% or more among patients randomized to PIASKY treatment for 24 weeks in the COMMODORE 2 study. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) in patients treated with PIASKY were infusion related reaction, respiratory tract infection, and viral infection.

### Pegcetacoplan controls hemolysis in complement inhibitor-naive patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^244b0532]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies of eculizumab and ravulizumab in complement inhibitor–naive patients with PNH showed improved LDH levels and better recovery from fatigue, and hemoglobin stabilized to avoid a ≥ 2-g/dL decrease from baseline. However, normalized hemoglobin, an important parameter for assessing PNH treatment response, was not directly assessed for patients who received C5i treatment, although the hemoglobin levels reported suggest that hemoglobin normalization was not common for these patients. Additionally, a recent survey-based study found C5i treatment associated with high rates of persistent anemia, fatigue, and poor QoL (decreased work productivity and impaired ability to perform daily activities). Potential PNH treatments that target factor D and factor B are being studied.

This study was limited by the small sample size of the control group. More than half of patients in the control group receiving only supportive care escaped to the pegcetacoplan group, limiting direct comparisons for safety and some efficacy end points between treatment groups. The post hoc analyses of the pegcetacoplan group showed statistically significant CFBs in all mean hematologic parameters and QoL and fatigue scores, increasing our confidence in the accuracy of our primary analyses. An extension study (APL2-307; NCT03531255) enrolling patients from PRINCE and 4 other pegcetacoplan studies is underway to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of pegcetacoplan for up to 4 years. The current study could not assess the effects of pegcetacoplan on thrombosis risk in treatment-naive patients with PNH because no AEs of thrombosis were reported in either treatment group.

Overall, the PRINCE trial showed that pegcetacoplan comprehensively controlled hemolysis in complement inhibitor–naive patients and rapidly stabilized and normalized hematologic parameters, decreased fatigue, and improved QoL compared with the control treatment. These findings show that pegcetacoplan is a better alternative for existing C5i therapies that stabilize but cannot normalize hematologic parameters.

### Characterizing clinically significant extravascular hemolysis in adults with PNH on ravulizumab or eculizumab treatment [^559d1691]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The approval of ravulizumab was supported by 2 pivotal studies. The phase 3 clinical study 301 (NCT02946463) compared ravulizumab vs eculizumab in patients with PNH who were previously naive to C5 inhibitors. Meanwhile, the phase 3 clinical study 302 (NCT03056040) enrolled stable, eculizumab-experienced adults with PNH who were then treated with either ravulizumab or eculizumab. Both studies demonstrated that ravulizumab was noninferior to eculizumab. Four-year data from the 302 study demonstrated effective long-term control of terminal complement activity and IVH, along with maintained patient survival, with a 98.4% survival rate (0.6 deaths per 100 patient-years). Outcomes from another clinical study and a real-world registry, have provided evidence for the efficacy of ravulizumab or eculizumab for the treatment of patients with PNH and improvements in morbidity and mortality.

### Terminal complement inhibition and control of hemolysis in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who switched from high-dose eculizumab to ravulizumab: a phase IV, single-arm clinical trial [^2f7d5c85]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

This clinical trial was the first to investigate the feasibility of switching treatment from high-dose eculizumab to weight-based ravulizumab in patients with PNH who required a higher than approved dose of eculizumab for complete C5 inhibition over the 14-day dosing interval. Switching treatment to weight-based ravulizumab Q8W maintained complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity and complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Free C5 concentrations were < 0.5 µg/mL at all study timepoints, indicating appropriate suppression of C5 activity, thereby satisfying the primary outcome for this study. Hemoglobin levels were also well controlled, with the majority of patients avoiding transfusion during the study. Therefore, despite needing a higher dose of eculizumab, approved weight-based dosing of ravulizumab was sufficient for PNH disease control in these patients, and there was no need to shorten the 8-week dosing interval. No new ravulizumab-associated safety signals were identified and adverse events were comparable to those previously reported in adults with PNH. Importantly, there were no meningococcal infections or major adverse vascular events, and no treatment-emergent adverse events that led to death or study withdrawal. The subclavian vein thrombosis reported after the study occurred in a patient whose weight was at the upper limit of the 60–100 kg weight range for the patient's ravulizumab dose, suggesting that a higher weight-based dose of ravulizumab may have been required. However, as the patient had sufficient disease control during the study period, further investigation is required.

14.1	Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria

The efficacy and safety of EMPAVELI in patients with PNH were assessed in two open-label, randomized-controlled Phase 3 studies: Study APL2-302 (NCT03500549) and Study APL2-308 (NCT04085601). All patients who completed the studies were eligible to enroll in a separate long-term extension study.

In both studies, patients were vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), either within 2 years prior to Day 1 or within 2 weeks after starting treatment with EMPAVELI. Patients vaccinated after initiation of treatment with EMPAVELI received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In addition, prophylactic antibiotic therapy was administered at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local treatment guidelines for patients with PNH receiving treatment with a complement inhibitor.

A dose of 1,080 mg twice weekly was used for patients randomized to the EMPAVELI group of each study. If required, the dose of EMPAVELI could be adjusted to 1,080 mg every 3 days. EMPAVELI was administered as a subcutaneous infusion; the infusion time was approximately 20 to 40 minutes.

### Eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, improves anaemia in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^50a35d25]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), chronic destruction of PNH red blood cells (RBCs) by complement leads to anaemia and other serious morbidities. Eculizumab inhibits terminal complement-mediated PNH RBC destruction by targeting C5. In the phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, TRIUMPH study, eculizumab reduced haemolysis, stabilized haemoglobin levels, reduced transfusion requirements and improved fatigue in patients with PNH. Herein, we explored the effects of eculizumab on measures of anaemia in patients from the TRIUMPH study and the open-label SHEPHERD study, a more heterogeneous population. Eculizumab reduced haemolysis regardless of pretreatment transfusion requirements and regardless of whether or not patients became transfusion-dependent during treatment (P < 0.001). Reduction in haemolysis was associated with increased PNH RBC counts (P < 0.001) while reticulocyte counts remained elevated. Eculizumab-treated patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of haemoglobin as compared with placebo in TRIUMPH and relative to baseline levels in SHEPHERD (P < 0.001 for each study). Eculizumab lowered transfusion requirement across multiple pretreatment transfusion strata and eliminated transfusion support in a majority of both TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD patients (P < 0.001). Patients who required some transfusion support during treatment with eculizumab showed a reduction in haemolysis and transfusion requirements and an improvement in fatigue. Eculizumab reduces haemolysis and improves anaemia and fatigue, regardless of transfusion requirements.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sustained eculizumab treatment in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [^4253722b]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is characterized by chronic, uncontrolled complement activation resulting in elevated intravascular haemolysis and morbidities, including fatigue, dyspnoea, abdominal pain, pulmonary hypertension, thrombotic events (TEs) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The long-term safety and efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits terminal complement activation, was investigated in 195 patients over 66 months. Four patient deaths were reported, all unrelated to treatment, resulting in a 3-year survival estimate of 97.6%. All patients showed a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase levels, which was sustained over the course of treatment (median reduction of 86.9% at 36 months), reflecting inhibition of chronic haemolysis. TEs decreased by 81.8%, with 96.4% of patients remaining free of TEs. Patients also showed a time-dependent improvement in renal function: 93.1% of patients exhibited improvement or stabilization in CKD score at 36 months. Transfusion independence increased by 90.0% from baseline, with the number of red blood cell units transfused decreasing by 54.7%. Eculizumab was well tolerated, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity and a decreasing occurrence of adverse events over time. Eculizumab has a substantial impact on the symptoms and complications of PNH and results a significant improvement in patient survival.

### Biosimilars in rare diseases: a focus on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^8d87eeee]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Once structural, functional, and pharmacologic similarity has been established, developers can proceed to an evaluation of comparative clinical efficacy and safety. The goal is to demonstrate that the biosimilar candidate has no clinically meaningful differences compared with the RP. The extent of the clinical program is determined by any residual uncertainty and the degree of similarity demonstrated in analytical and non-clinical testing. In light of the fact that no biosimilar candidates have ever been rejected for approval due to efficacy differences from their respective RP, it should be noted that regulatory agencies are beginning to question whether comparative efficacy trials are routinely necessary if a biosimilar candidate has been wellcharacterized and has demonstrated a highly similar clinical pharmacology profile.

Assessment of similarity between a candidate biosimilar and its RP in a comparative clinical trial is based on the null hypothesis. Using a two-sided test that demonstrates that efficacy lies within prespecified equivalence margins, the assessment must be able to detect any clinically meaningful difference in efficacy. The results are typically expressed as the risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) in efficacy between the candidate biosimilar and its RP. Clinical equivalence is established based on a predetermined two-sided 90%or 95%CI of the RR or RD since the studies are designed to determine both non-inferiority and non-superiority of the candidate biosimilar. If the CI of the RR or RD lies within the equivalence margin, then a biosimilar candidate can be considered to be clinically equivalent to its RP.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ravulizumab and eculizumab on complement component 5 in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: results of two phase 3 randomised, multicentre studies [^36210bff]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

In two phase 3 randomised, open‐label, multicentre clinical trials that compared q8w administration of ravulizumab with standard of care q2w administration of eculizumab in patients with PNH, ravulizumab was shown to be non‐inferior to eculizumab on all primary and key secondary outcomes assessed. 4, 5 Study 301 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02946463) 5 was carried out in complement inhibitor‐naïve patients with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and one or more PNH‐related signs or symptoms at screening. In that trial, ravulizumab was non‐inferior to eculizumab on the co‐primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and LDH normalisation (LDH ULN = 246 u/l). 5 Ravulizumab was also non‐inferior to eculizumab on all four key secondary endpoints: percentage change from baseline in LDH levels, change from baseline in quality of life (QoL) assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)‐Fatigue scale, proportion of patients with breakthrough haemolysis (BTH) and proportion of patients with stabilised haemoglobin levels. 5

Study 302 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03056040) 4 included complement inhibitor‐experienced patients who were stable for ≥ 6 months on eculizumab treatment, with LDH levels ≤ 1.5 × ULN at screening. In that trial, ravulizumab was shown to be non‐inferior to eculizumab on the primary endpoint of the percentage change from baseline in LDH levels. 4 Ravulizumab was also non‐inferior on all four key secondary endpoints: the proportion of patients with BTH, change from baseline in QoL assessed by the FACIT‐Fatigue scale, proportion of patients with transfusion avoidance and proportion of patients with stabilised haemoglobin levels. 4

The objectives of the present analysis were to characterise the relationship between plasma drug levels [pharmacokinetics (PK)] on corresponding plasma free and total C5 levels [pharmacodynamics (PD)] associated with ravulizumab q8w versus eculizumab q2w in adult patients with PNH in these clinical trials.

Abstract

Ravulizumab, a novel long‐acting complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor administered every 8 weeks (q8w), was non‐inferior to eculizumab for all efficacy outcomes in two randomised, open‐label, phase 3 trials in C5 inhibitor‐naïve (Study 301) and eculizumab‐experienced (Study 302) adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). This pre‐specified analysis characterised ravulizumab pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD; free C5 levels), and PD differences between medications (Study 301, n = 246; Study 302, n = 195). Ravulizumab PK parameters were determined using non‐compartmental analysis. Serum free C5 was quantified with a Gyros‐based fluorescence assay (ravulizumab) and an electrochemiluminescence ligand‐binding assay (eculizumab). Ravulizumab PK parameters were numerically comparable in both studies; the median time to maximum concentrations ranged from 2.3 to 2.8 and 2.3 to 2.6 h in studies 301 and 302, respectively. Ravulizumab steady‐state serum concentrations were achieved immediately after the first dose and sustained throughout treatment. For ravulizumab, the mean (SD) post hoc terminal elimination half‐life was 49.7 (8.9) days. Serum free C5 concentrations < 0.5 µg/ml were achieved after the first ravulizumab dose and sustained throughout treatment in both studies. In a minority of patients, free C5 concentrations < 0.5 µg/ml were not consistently achieved with eculizumab in either study. Ravulizumab q8w was more consistent in providing immediate, complete, sustained C5 inhibition than eculizumab every‐2‐weeks in patients with PNH.

### Effect of eculizumab on hemolysis and transfusion requirements in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^2324f585]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) arises from a somatic mutation of the PIG-A gene in a hematopoietic stem cell and the subsequent production of blood cells with a deficiency of surface proteins that protect the cells against attack by the complement system. We tested the clinical efficacy of eculizumab, a humanized antibody that inhibits the activation of terminal complement components, in patients with PNH.

Methods

Eleven transfusion-dependent patients with PNH received infusions of eculizumab (600 mg) every week for four weeks, followed one week later by a 900-mg dose and then by 900 mg every other week through week 12. Clinical and biochemical indicators of hemolysis were measured throughout the trial.

Results

Mean lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased from 3111 IU per liter before treatment to 594 IU per liter during treatment (P = 0.002). The mean percentage of PNH type III erythrocytes increased from 36.7 percent of the total erythrocyte population to 59.2 percent (P = 0.005). The mean and median transfusion rates decreased from 2.1 and 1.8 units per patient per month to 0.6 and 0.0 units per patient per month, respectively (P = 0.003 for the comparison of the median rates). Episodes of hemoglobinuria were reduced by 96 percent (P < 0.001), and measurements of the quality of life improved significantly.

Conclusions

Eculizumab is safe and well tolerated in patients with PNH. This antibody against terminal complement protein C5 reduces intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and the need for transfusion, with an associated improvement in the quality of life in patients with PNH.

Emerging questions in the era of proximal complement inhibitors

The introduction of eculizumab for the treatment of PNH led to the description of C3‐mediated extra‐vascular haemolysis as a novel mechanism of disease in PNH, unmasked by anti‐C5 therapy (Box 1). Now the clinical use of proximal complement inhibitors is raising different questions about our understanding of complement biology in PNH, eventually identifying possible pitfalls of this novel treatment strategy (Box 2).

Box 2
Pitfalls and caveats of novel anti‐complement therapies in PNH

Novel anti‐C5 agents seem as effective as eculizumab, with possible advantages related to longer dosing intervals and easier administration routes (i.e. subcutaneous), which result in more convenient treatment options for patients and care providers.
Novel anti‐C5 agents may have better pharmacological properties, possibly allowing for a deeper C5 inhibition; some data suggest that in some cases this may reduce the risk of pharmacokinetic breakthrough haemolysis, while episodes of pharmacodynamic breakthrough haemolysis associated with complement‐amplifying conditions seem unaffected.
The safety profile of novel anti‐C5 agents seems consistent with that of eculizumab, with the exception of transient auto‐immune manifestations, due to drug‐target‐drug immune complexes in patients switching from eculizumab to other anti‐C5 antibodies targeting different C5 epitopes.
Novel anti‐C5 agents, intrinsically, cannot address the unmet clinical need of C3‐mediated extra‐vascular haemolysis.
Proximal complement inhibitors targeting different complement components (Factor B, Factor D and C3) have been safely used in PNH patients; they have easy administration routes (oral or subcutaneous), but a short half‐life, requiring daily or bi‐weekly administration.
The safety profile of proximal complement inhibitors is consistent with that of anti‐C5 agents, even if longer follow‐up is needed to rule out possible impact on the risk of infectious complications, auto‐immune diseases, as well as cancer.
Given the broader impairment of the complement cascade associated with proximal complement inhibitors, anti‐infectious risk mitigation strategies include a broader vaccination schedule, as well as possible pharmacological anti‐microbial prophylaxis.
Once added to anti‐C5 therapies, all proximal complement inhibitors were proven effective in preventing C3‐mediated extra‐vascular haemolysis, eventually leading to a higher haematological benefit in PNH patients.
Proximal complement inhibitors, again added to anti‐C5 therapies, also improved the depth of the control of intravascular haemolysis (likely reducing the activation of the terminal pathway through the inhibition of the complement amplification loop).
The efficacy of proximal complement inhibitors may vary depending on pharmacological properties of the specific agent, likely due to the capability of achieving sustained and full inhibition of their specific molecular targets.
For some proximal complement inhibitors, available data seem to support that they can be used even in monotherapy; however, further data are needed to understand whether in monotherapy the efficacy remains as high as in combination treatment with anti‐C5.
The tremendous efficacy of proximal complement inhibitors is demonstrated not only by improvements in all biomarkers of haemolysis, but also by the large increase of the proportion of erythrocytes with the PNH phenotype.
PNH with such large PNH erythrocyte populations is a novel condition, which might be characterized by a peculiar clinical course and possible complications.
The risk of breakthrough haemolysis emerges as an obvious concern during treatment with proximal complement inhibitors, especially in monotherapy. Such a risk seems highly different among the agents in clinical development, depending on their pharmacological properties, which shape the risk of possible leakage in their inhibition. Current data seem to demonstrate that proximal complement inhibitors may successfully prevent haemolysis, even with such a large PNH erythrocyte population, but breakthrough episodes may develop both in the case of subtherapeutic drug level, or in the presence of complement‐amplifying conditions. Indeed, the inhibitors with the most favourable therapeutic window and with the deepest inhibition of their target, allowing full and sustained inhibition, seem to have the highest chance to be used in monotherapy. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to describe the risk and the mechanisms of breakthrough haemolysis during treatment with proximal complement inhibitors, as well as to establish adequate risk mitigation strategies for its management or prevention.

### Bone marrow failure syndromes: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^43407205]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article discusses the etiology of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and its relationship to marrow hyperplasia. The author posits that the defining clinical pathology of PNH (ie, complementmediated intravascular hemolysis) is an epiphenomenon that is a consequence of an orchestrated response (ie, natural selection of PIGA-mutant stem cells) to a specific type of bone marrow injury (ie, immune mediated). Management of PNH is discussed also.

During the 3-month pre-baseline period, patients continued to receive stable doses of eculizumab 1,200 mg Q2W; LDH, free C5, and hemoglobin levels were measured on day -85 (LDH and hemoglobin only), day -57, and day -15, immediately before eculizumab infusion. On day 1 (baseline), patients switched treatment to ravulizumab, receiving an initial loading dose (patients weighing ≥ 40- < 60 kg: 2,400 mg; patients weighing ≥ 60- < 100 kg: 2,700 mg; patients weighing ≥ 100 kg: 3,000 mg), followed by a maintenance dose on day 15 and Q8W thereafter (patients weighing ≥ 40- < 60 kg: 3,000 mg; patients weighing ≥ 60- < 100 kg: 3,300 mg; patients weighing ≥ 100 kg: 3,600 mg) up to day 351 (end of study). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced free C5-associated intravascular hemolysis (also called breakthrough hemolysis). Breakthrough hemolysis was defined as the presence of at least one new or worsening PNH symptom or sign of intravascular hemolysis, with LDH ≥ 2×ULN and free C5 concentration ≥ 0.5 μg/mL. Secondary endpoints included LDH percentage change, proportion of patients who received a transfusion, and proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin (avoidance of a ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentration in the absence of transfusion). Safety endpoints included the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events and serious treatment-emergent adverse events, and proportion of patients who developed antidrug antibodies to ravulizumab.

### Phase II trials of zilucoplan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^6b59db91]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, chronic, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. Uncontrolled complement activation is central in the pathogenesis of PNH. Approved first-line treatments of PNH are eculizumab and ravulizumab, which inhibit the activity of complement component 5 (C5).

Zilucoplan, a novel C5 inhibitor, is a small (3.5 kDa), 15-amino acid macrocyclic peptide that binds to C5 with high affinity and specificity. Zilucoplan inhibits complement via a dual mechanism in that it prevents cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b and binds to the domain of C5 corresponding to C5b, thereby blocking the binding of C5b to C6. Zilucoplan prevents activation of the terminal complement pathway and assembly of the membrane attack complex that results in lysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein-deficient red blood cells (RBC) in PNH.

The efficacy, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of zilucoplan were evaluated in adult patients with PNH in two phase II 12-week studies (Study 201, NCT03078582; Study 203, NCT03030183) and a long-term extension study (NCT03225287) (Figure 1A, B). Eligibility criteria are summarized in Online Supplementary Table S1. The primary endpoint of the 12-week studies was change from baseline in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. This analysis included ten eculizumab-naïve patients and 19 who had received prior eculizumab treatment (eculizumab-switch cohort) (Figure 1B). All ten eculizumab-naïve patients entered the extension study, two (20.0%) of whom discontinued. In the switch cohort, eight of 19 (42.1%) patients discontinued and 11 (57.9%) entered the extension study; two (10.5%) patients discontinued and nine (47.4%) were still receiving zilucoplan treatment at data cutoff (November 2020).

### Breakthrough hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria throughout clinical trials: from definition to clinical practice [^3390c0cf]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Breakthrough hemolysis (BTH) is the hemolytic exacerbation occurring in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) on treatment with anti-complement therapies. In this review article we analysed the definition, frequency and severity of BTH events across phase 3 clinical trials with terminal (anti-C5 ravulizumab and crovalimab) and complement inhibitors upstream C5 (anti-C3 pegcetacoplan, alternative-pathway inhibitors iptacopan and danicopan), as well as from real-world reports. Furthermore, we reviewed the impact of the various compounds on quality of life and patients reported outcomes. In particular, BTH may occur with all complement inhibitors, with a frequency of 10–15% over 6 months with eculizumab, crovalimab, and pegcetacoplan, and < 5% with ravulizumab, iptacopan, and danicopan plus anti-C5. By prolonging the follow-up, the frequency of BTH appeared increased in pegcetacoplan treated patients (nearly 24% at 1 year) as compared to both anti-C5, iptacopan, and double inhibition with danicopan plus anti-C5. BTH risk appears associated with patients' features, particularly suboptimal response/failure of previous complement inhibitor. Transfusions were required in about half of cases and modifications of anti-complement therapy included anticipation of the next anti-C5 dose and addition of eculizumab in patients on proximal inhibitors. Breakthrough thromboses were rare, though anti-coagulant prophylaxis should be considered during severe episodes. Complement amplifying conditions were observed in about half of cases and were more frequently infections. Treatment adherence, optimization of the administration schedule, anticoagulant prophylaxis, as well as education of patients and physicians remain important factors to prevent BTH and its complications.

### Crovalimab (Piasky) [^fd9789dd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Population with PNH Treated with PIASKY

Efficacy was evaluated in 12 pediatric patients (with body weight ≥ 40 kg) treated with PIASKY in COMMODORE 2 (n = 7; 13–17 years old), COMMODORE 1 (n = 2, 13–16 years old) and in a single arm study in patients who were complement-inhibitor naïve, COMMODORE 3 (NCT04654468; n = 3; 15–17 years old).

Nine pediatric patients were treatment-naïve, two patients switched from standard dose eculizumab and one patient switched from ravulizumab. Six pediatric patients were females and six were males. Nine patients were Asian, two were White and for one pediatric patient the race was unknown. The proportion of patients with a history of transfusions in the prior 12 months was 58%, with a median number of 1.3 pRBC units (range: 0–40.5) transfused, and a baseline median LDH of 6.4 × ULN (range 1.1–26.6). Aplastic anemia was reported in 50% of patients. All pediatric patients received the same dosing as adult patients based on body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Hemolysis control (defined as LDH ≤ 1.5 × ULN) from baseline to Week 25 was achieved in 7 of the 9 patients who were treatment-naïve, and the 3 patients switching from eculizumab or ravulizumab to PIASKY maintained hemolysis control through 24 weeks of PIASKY treatment. Nine (six patients who were treatment-naïve and three patients who switched from eculizumab or ravulizumab) out of the 12 pediatric patients achieved transfusion avoidance and hemoglobin stabilization, and no patients had a breakthrough hemolysis event during the 24-week treatment period.

Overall, the treatment effect of PIASKY in pediatric patients with PNH was consistent with that observed in adults with PNH.
