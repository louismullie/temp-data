## Question

What is the incidence of death in individuals who take opioids in combination with anxiolytics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the incidence of death in individuals who take opioids in combination with anxiolytics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which anxiolytics are most relevant and whether the evidence centers on benzodiazepines. Then, I should verify the highest-quality cohort data that quantify all-cause mortality with opioid–benzodiazepine co-use. Next, I will extract absolute mortality rates and relative risks, and I should double-check age-stratified effects. After that, I will review corroborating studies and FDA-labeled risk statements to contextualize magnitude. Finally, I will consider dose, timing, and special populations, and then synthesize a cautious, clinically useful estimate with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the scope. When people ask about "anxiolytics" with opioids, the dominant evidence base and clinical concern is benzodiazepines, which are repeatedly linked to increased overdose and mortality risk when combined with opioids; non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics like buspirone are not implicated in the same way, so I should focus on benzodiazepines and explicitly state that limitation to avoid overgeneralization [^6a87131a] [^8565b512].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality cohort. The JAMA Network Open NHANES-linked cohort (1999–2015) provides propensity-weighted estimates of all-cause mortality for benzodiazepine–opioid co-use versus an SSRI comparator. I need to check the exact numbers and confidence intervals, and I should confirm the age-stratified results before quoting them [^e2c751ff] [^a630c408].

> I will now examine absolute mortality rates. In that NHANES analysis, the crude death rate was 33.0 per 1,000 person-years with benzodiazepine–opioid co-use versus 20.2 per 1,000 person-years in the SSRI comparator, and after propensity score weighting, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 2.04 (95% CI, 1.65–2.52), indicating roughly a doubling of mortality risk with co-use compared with a low-risk antidepressant reference group [^3f33e594] [^e2c751ff].

> Hold on, I should verify age effects because they can modify risk. The same study found that the increased mortality risk was concentrated in participants aged 65 years or younger, with an adjusted HR around 3.27 (95% CI, 2.40–4.47), whereas there was no significant increase in those older than 65 years, suggesting age-related vulnerability and possibly competing risks or tolerance phenomena in older adults [^a630c408] [^5f80cee9].

> Let me consider corroborating evidence to ensure consistency. A large Veterans Affairs case-cohort study showed that current benzodiazepine prescriptions with opioids were associated with a 3.86-fold higher risk of overdose death versus no benzodiazepine prescription, with a clear dose–response relationship; this aligns directionally with the NHANES all-cause mortality signal, though it isolates overdose death rather than all-cause mortality [^c5bff283]. Similarly, a Medicare cohort demonstrated a 5-fold increase in opioid-related overdose risk during the first 90 days of concurrent use, attenuating thereafter, which underscores early hazard and the need for close monitoring if co-prescribed [^f93a04d8].

> I should confirm regulatory and guideline positions to contextualize magnitude. Multiple FDA boxed warnings state that concomitant benzodiazepine–opioid use can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death, and they advise reserving co-prescribing for cases where alternatives are inadequate, using the lowest effective doses and minimum durations, and monitoring closely; the CDC's 2022 guideline similarly urges particular caution and shared decision-making when combining opioids with benzodiazepines [^0ed35b3c] [^e18189b0] [^8565b512].

> But wait, what about dose and timing nuances that could change risk estimates. Observational data suggest dose-related risk for both benzodiazepines and opioids, and the early period of concurrent use carries the highest overdose risk; in severe respiratory disease, higher-dose combinations were associated with increased mortality, whereas lower-dose combinations were not, reinforcing a dose-dependent signal and the importance of minimizing exposure and reassessing need frequently [^ed95cf55] [^f93a04d8] [^c5bff283].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In patients with opioid use disorder receiving buprenorphine, benzodiazepine co-use is associated with higher overdose and all-cause mortality, yet medication-assisted treatment should not be withheld solely due to benzodiazepine use; instead, clinicians should coordinate care, consider tapering benzodiazepines, and provide naloxone, which reflects a harm-reduction approach rather than a categorical prohibition [^630ddb75] [^257a5ea8].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically usable estimate. For adults using opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently, all-cause mortality is approximately 2-fold higher than a low-risk antidepressant comparator, with an absolute excess around 13 deaths per 1,000 person-years in the NHANES cohort; in younger adults, the relative increase appears larger, approaching a 3-fold elevation, and overdose-specific risks can be even higher in some datasets, particularly early in co-therapy and at higher doses [^e2c751ff] [^a630c408] [^c5bff283] [^f93a04d8].

> I should double-check that I am not overstating causality. These are observational data with robust adjustment, but confounding by indication and disease severity remains possible; nonetheless, the consistency across populations, the dose–response pattern, and the mechanistic plausibility of additive CNS depression support a causal interpretation for increased mortality risk, even if the exact incidence estimate varies by cohort and follow-up [^e2c751ff] [^c5bff283] [^8565b512].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical guidance. Clinicians should avoid routine co-prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines, use the lowest effective doses and shortest durations if co-use is unavoidable, monitor closely for sedation and respiratory depression, consider naloxone, and reassess the ongoing need for both agents regularly; in older adults, while the relative mortality increase may be smaller, falls and cognitive harms still argue for deprescribing when feasible [^8565b512] [^0ed35b3c] [^15b44cfb].

The incidence of death is significantly higher in individuals who combine opioids with anxiolytics, especially benzodiazepines. The **relative risk of death is about 2-fold** versus opioids alone in large cohort studies, with even higher risks at higher doses or in vulnerable groups [^e2c751ff] [^c5bff283]. In a North Carolina cohort, overdose mortality was **10 times higher** with co-dispensed benzodiazepines than with opioids alone (7.0 vs 0.7 per 10,000 person-years) [^ed8a93d7]. Benzodiazepine–opioid co-involvement is common in overdose deaths, and risk rises with dose and duration; guidelines advise avoiding co-prescribing when possible and using the lowest effective doses with close monitoring if unavoidable [^0b15221c] [^8565b512] [^0ed35b3c].

---

## Epidemiological evidence on mortality risk

Several large-scale studies have quantified the **increased mortality risk** associated with concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use:

- **NHANES cohort (1999–2015)**: Benzodiazepine–opioid co-use was associated with a 2.04-fold increased all-cause mortality versus low-risk antidepressants (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.65–2.52) [^e2c751ff].

- **Veterans Health Administration study**: Current benzodiazepine prescriptions with opioids were associated with a 3.86-fold increased overdose death risk versus no benzodiazepine prescription (HR 3.86, 95% CI 3.49–4.26) [^c5bff283].

- **North Carolina cohort**: Overdose mortality was 10 times higher with co-dispensed benzodiazepines than with opioids alone (7.0 vs 0.7 per 10,000 person-years) [^ed8a93d7].

---

## Factors influencing mortality risk

Several factors modulate the **magnitude of risk** associated with combined opioid and benzodiazepine use:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher benzodiazepine doses and longer concurrent use increase mortality risk in a dose–response fashion [^c5bff283] [^f93a04d8].

- **Patient characteristics**: Younger adults, those with psychiatric comorbidities, and individuals with substance use disorders face higher risks [^a630c408] [^6977e2fd].

- **Medication specifics**: Short-acting benzodiazepines (e.g. alprazolam) may carry greater risk than long-acting agents, though data are mixed [^9b22c27b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the substantial risks, major guidelines and regulatory bodies **advise against routine co-prescribing**:

- **CDC guideline (2022)**: Recommends particular caution and shared decision-making when co-prescribing opioids and benzodiazepines; avoid concurrent use when possible [^8565b512].

- **FDA boxed warnings**: Both opioids and benzodiazepines carry warnings about profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death when combined; reserve co-prescribing for cases where alternatives are inadequate, use the lowest effective doses, and monitor closely [^0ed35b3c] [^e18189b0].

- **ASIPP guidelines**: Emphasize elevated respiratory depression risk with benzodiazepine–opioid co-use and recommend behavioral health consultation and careful monitoring when co-prescribing is necessary [^8e3d0368].

---

## Clinical implications and risk mitigation strategies

Clinicians should **implement risk-mitigation strategies** when co-prescribing is unavoidable:

- **Screening and monitoring**: Assess for psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorders, and respiratory risk factors; monitor for sedation and respiratory depression [^0ed35b3c].

- **Dose minimization**: Use the lowest effective doses and shortest duration, with planned reassessment and tapering when feasible [^0ed35b3c].

- **Patient education**: Counsel patients and caregivers on overdose risk, signs of respiratory depression, and avoidance of alcohol and other CNS depressants [^0ed35b3c].

- **Naloxone provision**: Consider prescribing naloxone for overdose reversal, especially in high-risk patients [^0ed35b3c].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study/cohort** | **Risk estimate** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|
| NHANES (1999–2015) | HR 2.04 (95% CI 1.65–2.52) | All-cause mortality |
| Veterans Health Administration | HR 3.86 (95% CI 3.49–4.26) | Overdose death |
| North Carolina cohort | 10-fold increase | Overdose mortality |

---

Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines is associated with a **significantly increased risk of death**, with relative risks ranging from about 2- to 10-fold depending on the population and outcome. Clinicians should avoid co-prescribing when possible and, if necessary, use the lowest effective doses with close monitoring and patient education.

Key Points

Question

Is benzodiazepine use, with or without opioid use, an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality or a marker for underlying conditions associated with death?

Findings

In this cohort study of 5212 individuals from a large, nationally representative data set, it was found that benzodiazepine use, with or without opioid use, was associated with a doubling in all-cause mortality risk in comparison with the use of low-risk antidepressants. These findings persisted even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables and comorbidity burden.

Meaning

This study suggests that benzodiazepine and opioid cotreatment may confer an increased long-term mortality risk; targeted interventions are needed to decrease overprescribing.

---

### Association between benzodiazepine use with or without opioid use and all-cause mortality in the United States, 1999–2015 [^49f59584]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment and use of benzodiazepines without opioids are associated with long-term all-cause mortality in comparison with individuals who used low-risk antidepressants. We also found that benzodiazepine use (with or without opioids) was associated with increased mortality risk only among those 65 years or younger. Amid very few opioid prescribing guidelines targeting patients receiving sedative-hypnotics, benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment poses a therapeutic dilemma for physicians. Concerted efforts by physicians, scientists, and policymakers are warranted to decrease overprescribing of these medications, identify patients at elevated risk, and ultimately implement targeted interventions.

Importance

Although overall rates of opioid use have been plateauing, coprescriptions of benzodiazepines and opioids have increased greatly in recent years. It is unknown whether this combination is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality as opposed to being more frequently used by persons with a baseline elevated risk of death.

Objective

To evaluate whether benzodiazepine use, with or without opioid use, is associated with increased all-cause mortality relative to the use of low-risk antidepressants.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used a large, nationally representative US data set (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys [NHANES]) from 1999 to 2015. Eight cycles of NHANES data were used, spanning 37 610 person-years of follow-up time among 5212 individuals. Statistical analysis was performed from August 24, 2019, through May 23, 2020.

Exposures

The primary exposure variable was benzodiazepine and opioid coprescriptions. Individuals taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) served as an active comparator reference group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality was obtained via linkage of NHANES to the National Death Index. Propensity scores were calculated from covariates associated with sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and medication use for more than 1000 prescription types. Propensity score-weighted mortality hazards were calculated from Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results

Of 5212 participants aged 20 years or older (1993 men [38.2%]; mean [SD] age, 54.8 [16.9] years) followed up for a median of 6.7 years (range, 0.2–16.8 years), 101 deaths (33.0 per 1000 person-years) occurred among those receiving cotreatment, 236 deaths (26.5 per 1000 person-years) occurred among those receiving only benzodiazepines, and 227 deaths (20.2 per 1000 person-years) occurred among SSRI recipients taking neither opioids nor benzodiazepines. After propensity score weighting, a significant increase in all-cause mortality was associated with benzodiazepine and opioid cotreatment (hazard ratio, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.65–2.52]) and benzodiazepines without opioids (hazard ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.33–1.92]). Subgroup analyses revealed an increased risk of mortality for individuals receiving cotreatment who were 65 years or younger but not for those older than 65 years; similar findings were observed for those receiving benzodiazepines without opioids.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found a significant increase in all-cause mortality associated with benzodiazepine use with or without opioid use in comparison with SSRI use. Benzodiazepine and opioid cotreatment, in particular, was associated with a 2-fold increase in all-cause mortality even after taking into account medical comorbidities and polypharmacy burden.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines are among the most widely used medications worldwide and are prescribed for common problems such as anxiety and insomnia. Up to 13% of US adults have reported benzodiazepine use in the last year, with ambulatory benzodiazepine prescriptions more than doubling in the last decade.

Increasing benzodiazepine prescriptions have clinical relevance amid declining life expectancies and a global epidemic of opioid overdoses. When benzodiazepines are taken alone, long-term use is associated with falls, cognitive impairment, and life-threatening withdrawal. When taken together with opioids, benzodiazepines can further suppress breathing, a common cause of death from opioid overdose. The danger of benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment is thus a timely issue, as 20% to 30% of all benzodiazepine recipients in the US are estimated to have an opioid coprescriptionand more than 30% of opioid overdose deaths are found to involve benzodiazepines. Despite a recent plateau in overall opioid use in the US, benzodiazepine-opioid coprescriptions continue to increase. It is tempting to infer elevated mortality risk attributable to benzodiazepines alone or in combination with opioids, but this topic has proven challenging to study. To date, it is not well understood if benzodiazepine use — whether with or without opioids — is associated directly with mortality, as opposed to serving as a marker for unmeasured underlying conditions that are the true factors associated with excess deaths.

In the case of benzodiazepine use without opioids, data on its long-term mortality risks are marked by inconsistent findings. Although some studies have found substantial mortality associated with benzodiazepine use without opioids, such that the hazards of taking benzodiazepines more than 30 times per month were akin to smoking 1 to 2 packs of cigarettes per day, other studies have not supported these findings, with several analyses suggesting that benzodiazepine-associated mortality may vary based on age or follow-up time. Furthermore, these studies have often been limited to employed, middle-aged populations in commercial insurance databases, which may exclude individuals with a heavier comorbidity burden who initiate benzodiazepines.

In the case of benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment, the literature base is similarly limited. Although recent data have depicted an increased risk of emergency department visitsand opioid overdose deaths in patients with such coprescriptions, these findings have often been limited to patients surviving opioid overdoses, subpopulations such as veterans, and short-term follow-up.

Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses

We observed an increased risk of mortality associated with benzodiazepine-opioid coprescriptions among younger but not older participants (adjusted HR, 3.27 [95% CI, 2.40–4.47] vs 1.21 [95% CI, 0.86–1.70]), with similar findings among those receiving benzodiazepines without opioids (adjusted HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.29–2.54] vs 0.84 [95% CI, 0.67–1.05]) (Table 2). Among those older than 65 years in age-stratified analyses, we consistently observed no increased risk of death associated with cotreatment across all adjusted comparisons. Analyses were also repeated across participants of different follow-up periods, using the 50th percentile as a threshold between short-term and long-term follow-up strata. Among those receiving benzodiazepines without opioids, weighted analyses showed an increased risk of death in those with longer (≥ 50th percentile) but not shorter follow-up times (HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.59–2.98] vs 1.17 [95% CI, 0.92–1.50]). Weighted analyses showed similarly elevated hazards of death among those receiving benzodiazepine and opioid cotreatment regardless of follow-up time (< 50th percentile: HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.04–1.76] vs ≥ 50th percentile: HR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.29–2.88]).

In further sensitivity analyses, we calculated propensity scores that excluded non-CNS agents, with largely similar effect sizes across all comparisons (eTable 4 in the Supplement). In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that included participants who survived fewer than 12 months after recruitment, with similar findings as in our analyses that excluded those who died within 1 year (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

Discussion

This study illustrates that benzodiazepines, both by themselves and in combination with opioids, significantly increase the risk of all-cause mortality in comparison with SSRIs alone. In particular, the benzodiazepine-opioid coprescription group continued to show a nearly 2-fold increase in all-cause mortality even after taking into account medical comorbidities and polypharmacy burden in adjusted analyses.

Although benzodiazepines without opioids were associated with an overall increase in all-cause mortality in weighted analyses, these hazards of death were negligible among those with shorter as opposed to longer amounts of follow-up time. This finding may be consistent with existing literaturesuggesting that benzodiazepine use without opioids is more of a proxy for elevated short-term mortality risk than a factor directly associated with death. Furthermore, recent findings — focusing largely on acute as opposed to chronic benzodiazepine and opioid exposures — have suggested that fatalities associated with pure benzodiazepine overdose are rare and that the combination of sedative-hypnotic agents with opioids may be an important and understudied factor associated with mortality.

We also conducted age-stratified analysis to clarify the burden of psychotropic medications in the elderly, particularly since earlier studies have found that older adults were more likely to receive benzodiazepines and opioids. Most studies that have identified a positive association between benzodiazepines and all-cause mortality were conducted in predominantly adult or young adult populations, which makes the mortality risk associated with benzodiazepine use in older adults a poorly understood area. We found no evidence of increased all-cause mortality stemming from benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment in participants aged 65 years or older, which parallels similar null findings among elderly patients receiving benzodiazepines without opioids. There was a consistently elevated mortality risk in participants younger than 65 years, which may be associated with surging drug poisoning–related mortality that disproportionately affects younger US populations.

Survival Analysis

The median time to death or censoring was 6.7 years (range, 0.2–16.8 years) for all participants (eTable 3 in the Supplement). A total of 1423 of 5212 participants (27.3%) had follow-up times exceeding 10 years, with 37 610 person-years of follow-up time among all participants. Of 892 deaths that occurred in total (23.7 events per 1000 person-years), 101 (33.0 per 1000 person-years) occurred among those receiving cotreatment, 236 (26.5 per 1000 person-years) occurred among those using only benzodiazepines, 328 (22.8 per 1000 person-years) occurred among those using only opioids, and 227 (20.2 per 1000 person-years) occurred in the active comparator group of SSRI recipients taking neither benzodiazepines nor opioids (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

Figure 2 illustrates unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves for survival probability at the start of follow-up, for which unadjusted log-rank tests showed that all-cause mortality was significantly elevated in the benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment group in comparison with those taking benzodiazepines only, opioids only, and SSRI recipients taking neither (χ 2 = 22.41; P < .001). Among those who were 65 years or younger, we calculated an event rate of 10.3 per 1000 person-years in comparison with 59.9 per 1000 person-years among their peers older than 65 years (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^3b5e522a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department discharge — concomitant opioids with benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics: In adult patients with an acute episode of pain being discharged from the ED, Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: Do not routinely prescribe, or knowingly cause to be co-prescribed, a simultaneous course of opioids and benzodiazepines (as well as other muscle relaxants/sedative-hypnotics) for treatment of an acute episode of pain in patients discharged from the ED (Consensus recommendation). Potential benefits of implementing the recommendations include reducing the severity of toxicity when opioids are combined with other centrally acting drugs and preferential use of safer therapeutic alternatives, whereas potential harms include limited therapeutic options for patients receiving longer term opioids or muscle relaxants/sedative-hypnotics. Methods detail that searches included January 1, 2007, to the search dates of March 9, 2017, and August 8, 2018; Four hundred articles were identified in the searches, Twenty-five articles were selected from the search results as potentially addressing this question and were candidates for further review, and after grading none of the 25 articles were classified as Class I, II, or III; therefore, zero studies were included for this critical question. Benzodiazepines are relatively safe when prescribed alone, but a trend of increased mortality associated with the increased prescribing of benzodiazepines has been identified that resembles the trend of escalating overdose.

### Trends in the concomitant prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines, 2002–2014 [^682e803d]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although many clinical guidelines caution against the combined use of opioids and benzodiazepines, overdose deaths and emergency department visits involving the co-ingestion of these drugs are increasing.

Methods

In this ecologic time series study, the IMS Health Total Patient Tracker was used to describe nationally projected trends of patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines in the U.S. outpatient retail setting between January 2002 and December 2014. The IMS Health Data Extract Tool was used to examine trends in the concomitant prescribing of these two medication classes among 177 million individuals receiving opioids during this period. The annual proportion of opioid recipients who were prescribed benzodiazepines concomitantly was calculated and stratified by gender, age, duration of opioid use, immediate-release versus extended-release/long-acting opioids, and benzodiazepine molecule. The proportion of patients with concomitancy receiving opioids and benzodiazepines from the same prescriber was also analyzed. Analyses were conducted from April to June 2015.

Results

The nationally projected number of patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines increased by 8% and 31%, respectively, from 2002 to 2014. During this period, the annual proportion of opioid recipients dispensed a benzodiazepine concomitantly increased from 6.8% to 9.6%, which corresponded to a relative increase of 41%. Approximately half of these patients received both prescriptions from the same prescriber on the same day. Concomitancy was more common in patients receiving opioids for ≥ 90 days, women, and the elderly.

Conclusions

Concomitant prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines is increasing and may play a growing role in adverse patient outcomes related to these medications.

4.2. Conclusions

In this international multicohort study that included patients newly initiated on an opioid, significant differences in risk of death between opioids were observed. Compared with codeine, stronger opioids, such as morphine, fentanyl, buprenorphine, oxycodone, and combination opioids, were associated with a higher risk of death. Mortality risk was higher in patients on 50MME/day or more, in the UK and US cohorts specifically. Certain drug classes used concomitantly with opioids particularly antipsychotics (in United Kingdom/United States), benzodiazepines (United Kingdom), and gabapentinoids (United States) also conferred a higher risk of death.

### Trends in nonfatal and fatal overdoses involving benzodiazepines-38 States and the district of columbia, 2019–2020 [^adcd68fa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Increases in benzodiazepine overdose ED visits throughout 2020, coupled with increases in illicit benzodiazepine deaths since 2019, highlight the need to enhance efforts to mitigate harm from simultaneously using benzodiazepines and opioids and monitor the magnitude and persistence of increases in illicit benzodiazepine deaths. Persons who co-use opioids and benzodiazepines might be less likely to receive medications for opioid use disorder than persons using opioids only; therefore, efforts to increase treatment access should be enhanced. Expansion of naloxone availability and rapid naloxone administration should be encouraged for overdoses involving benzodiazepines and opioids because naloxone reverses opioid overdoses irrespective of benzodiazepine presence. However, educational efforts should emphasize the dangers of using illicit benzodiazepines, especially in combination with opioids, and the importance of calling 9-1-1 even after naloxone administration, because benzodiazepine overdose symptoms are unaffected by naloxone and might require additional medical treatment. These efforts, complemented by broader primary prevention of drug use and misuse, could prevent drug overdose morbidity and mortality.

### Benzodiazepine discontinuation and mortality among patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine therapy [^15e1934c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Over 10% of US adults reported past-year prescription benzodiazepine use from 2015–2016, with the prevalence and total volume of prescribing having grown over the prior 2 decades. After opioids, benzodiazepine are the medication most involved in prescription overdose (OD) deaths; by 2020, the US had the highest ever number of benzodiazepine-involved OD deaths. The growth in use and associated harms may account for increased attention from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a 2016 warning related to coprescribing with opioids; a 2020 class-wide boxed warning regarding "the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions"; and an Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline for the Safe Tapering of Benzodiazepines in progress.

The FDA guideline development announcement is focused on reducing long-term benzodiazepine use in a manner that is consistent with expert opinion and professional guidelines, which suggest that short-term or intermittent benzodiazepine use has a more favorable risk-benefit profile. While extensive evidence characterizes the risks associated with benzodiazepine use, no studies have focused explicitly on discontinuation risks. Conventional wisdom might suggest benzodiazepine discontinuation would reduce risk of adverse events, yet this has not been the case with long-term prescription opioid discontinuation. In fact, cessation of treatment may be particularly fraught for benzodiazepine: psychologically, because many patients find the prospect of discontinuation distressing, and physiologically, because of physical dependence and the potential for withdrawal, including seizures.

To inform benzodiazepine policy and guidelines, we sought to determine the cumulative risks or benefits associated with benzodiazepine discontinuation. We did so using an emulated target trial approach in national claims databy identifying a population of patients receiving stable long-term benzodiazepine treatment and estimating the association of discontinuation with all-cause mortality and other potential associated harms. Given the increased mortality associated with coprescribed opioids and benzodiazepine, we stratified analysis by opioid use to inform decision-making for patients coprescribed opioids. We hypothesized that prescription benzodiazepine discontinuation would be associated with reduced risk of mortality and other adverse events.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^f6d6c7e9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department opioid co-prescribing with benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics — evidence and guidance emphasize overdose risk and avoidance: Emergency physicians have observed increasing rates of overdoses and drug-related deaths related to the combination of opioids and benzodiazepines, and population-based studies have identified a substantial increased risk of death when these agents are co-prescribed, with rates of death 3- to 10-fold higher compared with opioids alone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a black box warning in 2016 to both opioids and benzodiazepines recommending against co-prescribing these agents. Although the literature search yielded no directly applicable primary research study of at least a Class III level of evidence assignment, the committee reached consensus to develop the recommendation against routinely combining these therapies for patients being discharged from the emergency department (ED) after being treated for an acute episode of pain, and the summary states that co-prescribing of these 2 classes of medications should be done with caution, and, when possible, avoided.

### Association between benzodiazepine use with or without opioid use and all-cause mortality in the United States, 1999–2015 [^8c5337cb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, patients receiving benzodiazepines, both with and without opioids, exhibited an elevated risk of death compared with SSRI recipients receiving neither opioids nor benzodiazepines (cotreatment group: hazard ratio [HR], 1.71 [95% CI, 1.34–2.19]; benzodiazepines without opioids group: HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13–1.64]) (Table 2). After propensity score weighting, hazards of death remained elevated in those receiving cotreatment (HR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.65–2.52]). A smaller but nonetheless significant increase in all-cause mortality was associated with benzodiazepine use without opioids in adjusted analyses (HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.33–1.92]).

### Trends in intentional abuse or misuse of benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics and the associated mortality reported to poison centers across the United States from 2000 to 2014 [^3e23d35f]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Prior works demonstrates an increased risk of death when opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines are used concomitantly to gain a high. Using poison center data, we described trends in abuse or misuse of benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics. We quantified mortality risk associated with abuse or misuse of benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics and the combination of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of data from the National Poison Data System which collects information from 55 poison centers located across the United States. We identified reported cases of "intentional abuse or misuse" of benzodiazepine and/or opioid analgesic exposures. Poisson regression was used to compare the number of cases from each year between 2001 and 2014 to the year 2000. Logistic regression was used to determine whether cases exposed to both benzodiazepines and opioids had greater odds of death relative to cases exposed to opioid analgesics alone.

Results

From 2000 to 2014, there were 125,485 benzodiazepine exposures and 84,627 opioid exposures among "intentional abuse or misuse" cases. Of the benzodiazepine exposures, 17.3% (n = 21,660) also involved an opioid. In 2010, exposures involving both opioids and benzodiazepines were 4.26-fold (95% CI: 3.87–4.70; p < .001) higher than in 2000. The risk of death was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.01–2.37; p = .04) times greater among those who used both an opioid and a benzodiazepine compared to opioids alone. This association held after adjusting for gender and age.

Conclusion

Intentional abuse or misuse of benzodiazepines and opioids in combination increased significantly from 2000 to 2014. Benzodiazepine abuse or misuse far exceeded cases of opioid abuse or misuse. Death was greater with co-abuse or misuse of benzodiazepines and opioids. Population-level campaigns to inform the public about the risk of death with co-abuse or misuse of benzodiazepines and opioids are urgently needed to address this overdose epidemic.

3.4. Other factors associated with an increased risk of death including concomitant medications

Age was significantly associated with higher mortality risk in the ≥ 35 years groups (United Kingdom and United States) and ≥ 45 groups (Canada). Female patients had slightly lower HRs compared with male patients (United Kingdom, all patients: HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.81–0.84]); however, the results were not statistically significant across other cohorts and subgroups (Tables 3 and 4). A higher burden of comorbidities measured using Charlson index was associated with a higher risk of death across all cohorts (United Kingdom: HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.23–1.24]; United States: HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.20–1.31]; Canada: HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.20–1.32]). A history of depression and prior substance abuse were also associated with an increased risk of death across all cohorts and in most subgroups (Tables 2–4). In the UK cohort, the use of concomitant antipsychotics and benzodiazepine medication was associated with higher risk of death across all 3 subgroups (all patients, HR, 2.57 [95% CI, 2.47–2.68]; HR, 2.23 [95% CI, 2.15–2.32], respectively) as presented in Table 2. Use of antipsychotics and additionally gabapentinoids were associated with a higher mortality risk in the US cohort (all patients, HR, 2.75 [95% CI, 2.0–3.76]; HR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.64–2.62] respectively) but not in the Canadian cohort.

### Opioid toxicity-related deaths in the US before and during the COVID-19 pandemic… [^23a5be78]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this cross-sectional study of 422 605 unintentional deaths due to opioid toxicity, the years of life lost increased more than 3-fold, from 777 597 to 2 922 497, between 2011 and 2021. By 2021, 1 of every 22 deaths in the US was attributable to unintentional opioid toxicity. Similarly, the percentage of all deaths that were attributed to opioid toxicity increased from 1. 8% in 2011 to
4. 5% in 2021. By 2021, opioid toxicity was responsible for
10. 2% of all deaths among those aged 15 to 19 years, 21. 7% of deaths among those aged 20 to 29 years, and
21. 0% of deaths among those aged 30 to 39 years. The YLL due to opioid toxicity increased 276% over the study period, from 777 597 in 2011 to 2 922 497 in 2021. While YLL plateaued between 2017 and 2019, it increased by
62. 9% between 2019 and 2021 coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 11. 7 YLL per 1000 population.

This relative increase was similar across all age groups and sexes with the exception of those aged 15 to 19 years, in whom the YLL nearly tripled, from 1. 5 to
3. 9 YLL per 1000 population. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, deaths due to opioid toxicity increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, 1 of every 22 deaths in the US was attributable to unintentional opioid toxicity, underscoring the urgent need to support people at risk of substance-related harm, particularly men, younger adults, and adolescents. In the US, the number of deaths due to opioid toxicity has increased from 21 088 in 2010 to nearly 70 000 in 2020, with the increase due primarily to fentanyl and its analogues. 1, 2 Younger adults represent a disproportionate number of these deaths, 3 with early. In the sensitivity analysis excluding COVID-19–related deaths from the denominator, the percentage of deaths attributable to opioid toxicity increased to 5. 3% in 2021.

### Benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths in the USA: 2000–2019 [^0b15221c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the focus on overdose deaths co-involving opioids and benzodiazepines, little is known about the epidemiologic characteristics of benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths in the USA.

Objective

To characterize co-involved substances, intentionality, and demographics of benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths in the USA from 2000 to 2019.

Design

Cross-sectional study using national mortality records from the National Vital Statistics System.

Subjects

US residents in the 50 states and District of Columbia who died from a benzodiazepine-involved overdose from 2000 to 2019.

Main Measures

Demographic characteristics, intention of overdose, and co-involved substances KEY RESULTS: A total of 118,208 benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths occurred between 2000 and 2019 (median age, 43 [IQR, 32–52]; male, 58.6%; White, 93.3%; Black, 4.9%; American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.9%; Asian American and Pacific Islander, 0.9%; Hispanic origin, 6.4%). Opioids were co-involved in 83.5% of the deaths. Nine percent of benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths did not involve opioids, cocaine, other psychostimulants, barbiturates, or alcohol. Overdose deaths were classified as suicides in 8.5% of cases with benzodiazepine and opioid co-involvement and 36.2% of cases with benzodiazepine but not opioid involvement. Rates of benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths increased from 0.46 per 100,000 individuals in 2000 to 3.55 per 100,000 individuals in 2017 before decreasing to 2.96 per 100,000 individuals in 2019. Benzodiazepine-involved overdose mortality rates increased from 2000 to 2019 among all racial groups, both sexes, and individuals of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin. Rates of benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths decreased among White individuals, but not Black individuals, from 2017 to 2019.

Conclusions

Interventions to reduce benzodiazepine-involved overdose mortality should consider the demographics of, co-involved substances in, and presence of suicides among benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths.

Covariates and Confounders

To account for confounding medical and psychiatric comorbidities that may be associated with increased mortality in the population of individuals receiving benzodiazepines, we developed propensity score weights based on the estimated probability of benzodiazepine prescription status, using covariates found to be prevalent among persons receiving benzodiazepines; these covariates spanned sociodemographic factors, health care use variables, psychiatric comorbidities, and medication use data for more than 1000 unique prescriptions. Full details are described in the eMethods in the Supplement.

To increase overlap of measured characteristics between benzodiazepine-opioid users and nonusers, we used an active comparator group of participants who were not taking benzodiazepines or opioids and had an active prescription for SSRIs. This is a validated approach taken to address unobserved confounding factors given SSRIs' overlapping indications with benzodiazepines without any known association with all-cause mortality in adults. We selected SSRIs as our active comparator rather than non-SSRI antidepressants owing to substantial heterogeneity in non-SSRIs' indications for use in comparison with benzodiazepines (ie, tricyclic antidepressants for headache and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for neuropathic pain)as well as increased morbidity and mortality associated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants.

### Methadone hydrochloride [^1e1abc83]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, and other opioids).

For Patients Being Treated for Pain

Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

### The growing problem of co-treatment with opioids and benzodiazepines [^6a87131a]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Concern about concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines led two US government agencies to act in 2016. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on opioid prescribing urge clinicians to avoid concurrent prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now requires black box warnings (the highest level of alert) on product labels and patient focused medication guides for opioids and benzodiazepines, recognizing the adverse outcomes associated with their concurrent use.

Warnings and guidelines, while important to defining problematic practice, are not likely to change clinical behavior, at least not quickly. Performance metrics used by payers could prove a key lever for change. In the US and the UK, payers hold clinicians and facilities accountable for basic quality. But we found no example of performance metrics targeting hazardous drug combinations. Optimal use of safety alerts in electronic health records could prove effective, but only if they appropriately notify prescribers of hazardous combinations and only if prescribers are held accountable for over-riding warnings. Guidelines provide explicit definitions of best practice, but, as with all else in healthcare, the challenge is in effective implementation and incentives sufficient to motivate changes in the system.

Although implementation of expanded quality metrics, incentives, and systems that facilitate safer prescribing practice around drug combinations will take time, Sun and colleagues provide evidence that can be of immediate use. For example, the risk of overdose was 71% higher in chronic users who concurrently used a benzodiazepine compared with chronic users who did not (5.36% v 3.13%). Clinicians caring for patients using opioids chronically need to be especially cautious. Research shows that opioids are prescribed by multiple providers, a situation more common in deaths from overdose when both opioids and benzodiazepines were being taken. Providers can incorporate such evidence into practice rapidly with the right systems in place.

Unless systems are set up to push information to providers, however, busy clinicians will struggle to keep up with their patients' use of different prescriptions. For example, current state monitoring programs for prescription drugs in the US require separate computers with separate authentication, one of many reported barriers to use.

A multi-pronged effort from both regulators and experts writing clinical guidelines, along with extensive expansion in warnings about the hazards of drug-drug interactions, are essential to reduce low value, potentially dangerous care.

### Rates of physician coprescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines after the release of the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines in 2016 [^6fbccfe5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Rates of opioid prescribing and deaths attributed to prescription opioid overdose have quadrupled in the United States over the past 20 years. One-quarterto one-halfof opioid-related deaths also involve a benzodiazepine, which is consistent with the known risks of adverse events when these 2 drug classes are used concomitantly. In particular, the risk of overdose increases when people take opioids and benzodiazepines at the same time. Coprescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines in the United States has previously been shown to be common. One studyfound that, in 2013, 17% of prescription opioid users also used a benzodiazepine. Recognizing the risk of coprescribing, in 2016 the US Food and Drug Administrationissued a warning to patients and clinicians about the potential risks of combined opioid and benzodiazepine use.

In March 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelinesintended to help primary care clinicians treat patients with chronic non–cancer-related pain. These guidelines specifically included a category A recommendation to avoid coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines "whenever possible". The panel writing the guidelines noted that there may be clinically appropriate situations where the drugs may be used together, giving the example of a person taking a stable low dose of a benzodiazepine who experiences acute pain. However, the overall recommendation in the context of long-term opioid use was to avoid benzodiazepines if possible, given patient needs.

To better understand the association of the CDC opioid guidelines with coprescribing, changes in extent of coprescribing of benzodiazepines among patients newly initiating long-term opioid therapy were compared before and after release of the guidelines in a large population of commercially insured patients and Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries. The primary outcomes were the extent and intensity of coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines. Because of the well-recognized racial differences in opioid prescribing practices, changes in coprescribing by race and ethnicity were also analyzed.

### Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US veterans receiving opioid analgesics: case-cohort study [^ae42fa7e]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Although the design of this study does not allow for the determination of the extent to which benzodiazepines cause deaths from overdose, it does indicate a need for clinicians to be aware of the increased risk among patients currently receiving benzodiazepines and opioids and that the risk might be higher among those receiving higher doses of either or both drugs. This risk might be due to risks inherent to those prescribed benzodiazepines, such as the presence of an anxiety condition and/or to the benzodiazepine itself. Thus, clinicians should be cautious when prescribing benzodiazepines to this group. Although it is unknown whether patients with comorbid pain and anxiety who use opioids and benzodiazepines would benefit from the same interventions to reduce risk of death from overdose as patients using opioids alone, clinicians might consider including this group in overdose prevention efforts, such as naloxone training for caregivers.

3. Results

3.1. Study population and baseline characteristics

Across the 3 jurisdictions in the study, a total of 1,062,653 patients were included (UK: n = 993,294; Boston, US: n = 43,243, Montreal, Canada: n = 26,116). The age distribution of new opioid users varied across the cohorts, with the highest proportions falling between ages of 25 and 54 years in the US and UK cohorts. In the Canadian cohort, 42.8% of patients on opioids were 65 years and older, due to how insurance is covered. More details about the descriptive prescribing differences between cohorts have been published previously.

Variations were observed between the cohorts in relation to baseline comorbidities. In the Canadian cohort, depression was most prevalent (20.2%). The proportion of patients with a history of substance abuse before their first opioid prescription ranged from 3.3% in the United Kingdom to 6.8% in Canada (Table 1). The proportion of a high Charlson comorbidity score was similar across the 3 cohorts ranging between 3.2% and 4.4%. Concurrent prescriptions of benzodiazepines with opioids at the date of first opioid prescription were most common in the US (18.7%), Canadian (16.7%), and UK (5.7%) cohorts. Antidepressant use varied from 11.4% (UK), 21.6% (US), and 32.3% (Canada). Gabapentinoid use ranged from 1.0% to 6.5% and antipsychotic use between 1.8% and 7.9% (United Kingdom and Canada, respectively).

Baseline characteristics of people on opioids by centre.

Among the new opioid users without cancer, the proportion of patients presenting with a pain problem at baseline varied across the cohorts. In the US cohort, 39% of patients (n = 16,699) reported having a pain problem, whereas in the United Kingdom, this was 46% (n = 453,601), and in Montreal, this was 51% (n = 13,363) (Table 1). Of patients with a pain problem, those patients with back pain ranged between 51% (n = 8548; Boston) and 69% (n = 315,608; United Kingdom) respectively (Table 1). The baseline characteristics of patients on index date by their opioid at initiation are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

### Comparative risk of mortality in new users of prescription opioids for noncancer pain: results from the international pharmacosurveillance study [^df8034ad]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings from our study are consistent with the US Food and Drug Adminstration black box warning against the coprescription of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and opioids due to the risk of respiratory depression. The use of concomitant antipsychotics with opioids was consistently associated with a higher risk of mortality in both the US and UK cohorts (Tables 2 and 3). A recent population-based cohort study supports these findings and also reported that sedating antipsychotics (such as quetiapine, olanzapine) were associated with higher risk of overdose when coprescribed with opioids compared with nonsedating antipsychotics. Coprescription of benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids with opioids were associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk in the UK and US cohorts, respectively, in all pain subgroups. This is consistent with previous work that have also highlighted risk of death with these classes of drugs. The results for benzodiazepines and gabapentinoids were not consistently replicated across all 3 cohorts, however. One possible reason may be that the effect of these drug classes on opioids is dose dependent. It is likely that prescribed doses of these drug classes are different on a population level across countries, which we were not able to adjust for.

### Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US veterans receiving opioid analgesics: case-cohort study [^d246e47f]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Deaths from drug overdose, particularly involving opioid analgesics, have increased steadily over the past two decades and are now one of the leading causes of mortality from injury in the United States. Of the deaths from overdose related to pharmaceuticals, which constituted 58% of total deaths from drug overdose in 2010, 75% involved opioid analgesics. Thirty percent of overdose deaths related to opioid analgesics involved benzodiazepines, drugs commonly prescribed concurrently for patients who receive opioid analgesics. Although the toxicity of benzodiazepines used in isolation is generally considered mild in young and middle aged adults, the risks from oversedation are believed to be magnified when they are combined with other substances with sedating properties, such as opioids. Also, receipt of benzodiazepines could be a marker of the presence of a severe anxiety disorder, which carries its own risk for death from intentional and unintentional overdose.

Trends in deaths from overdose have been connected to patterns of opioid prescribing, an increasingly common treatment for pain. On a population level, increasing rates of opioid prescribing have been linked to an increased rate of death from overdose; on an individual level, the risk of death from overdose is higher among those receiving higher doses of opioids. One study generated the hypothesis that receipt of benzodiazepines might be associated with increased risk of death from overdose in patients receiving opioid analgesics. To our knowledge, no large nationwide study has focused on death from drug overdose and receipt of benzodiazepines and their prescribing patterns, such as the daily benzodiazepine dose, the type of benzodiazepine prescribed, or the dosing schedule of the prescription, among those receiving opioids for pain.

We investigated the relation between the receipt of concurrent benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics and death from drug overdose in patients receiving prescription opioids for the treatment of acute or chronic pain and pain associated with cancer. Quantification of the magnitude of risk associated with these patterns might help to identify individuals at particularly high risk for death from drug overdose and could potentially inform risk reduction approaches in this population. We hypothesized that receipt of concurrent benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics would be associated with death from drug overdose and that this association would be dose dependent and vary by type of benzodiazepine and dosing schedule. We used a case-cohort study design to examine the relation between history of benzodiazepine prescription, dose, type, and schedule and risk of death from drug overdose over a six year period among a nationwide sample of patients who received treatment with opioid analgesics in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

### Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines: evaluation of prescription drug monitoring by a United States laboratory [^df1d8d01]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Since 2000, the rate of opioid deaths in the United States has tripled. Drug overdose deaths rose to the highest level ever recorded in 2015 and may have risen since. Over 63% of the 52,404 drug overdose deaths in 2015 involved heroin and opioid pain reliever medications, and nearly half of these deaths involved prescription medications. A number of risk factors have been identified that increase the risk of adverse events related to opioids, including concurrent use of benzodiazepine medications and other central nervous system depressants. The cumulative and synergistic drug effects from combining benzodiazepines and opioids depress the central nervous system's medullary controls for respiration; benzodiazepines through the gamma-aminobutyric-acid receptors and opioids through mu (μ) and delta (δ) receptors. Some patients and individuals with substance use disorder may combine opioid and benzodiazepine drugs to increase the subjective peak strength of drug effects and sedation, whereas others may use each drug therapeutically. In 2010, over 30% of opioid-related deaths in the United States also involved benzodiazepines. Of interest, among United States military veterans who were prescribed opioids and who subsequently died of a drug overdose, approximately half involved concurrent prescriptions for benzodiazepines.

Federal agencies in the United States continue to make efforts to combat the opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. In August 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a "boxed warning" on both prescription opioids and benzodiazepines alerting prescribers to the dangers of concurrent use. In March 2016, the CDC released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016. Two key recommendations are that clinicians "should use urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs". Drug testing prior to starting therapy with a controlled substance provides baseline information of current drug use. Subsequent drug tests monitor for both adherence with prescribed medications and abstinence from use of non-prescribed or illicit drugs. Drug testing patients who are prescribed opioids can reveal potentially dangerous drug combinations, including concurrent use of benzodiazepines, which can inform and affect clinicians' treatment decisions.

5.1	Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe XANAX concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of XANAX than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking XANAX, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when XANAX is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including XANAX, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing XANAX and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of XANAX, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of XANAX along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### Physician prescribing of opioids to patients at increased risk of overdose from benzodiazepine use in the United States [^a7e1a510]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recent increases in US opioid-related deaths underscore the need to understand drivers of fatal overdose. The initial prescription of opioids represents a critical juncture because it increases the risk of future opioid use disorder and is preventable.

Objective

To examine new opioid prescribing patterns in US patients at increased risk of overdose from benzodiazepine use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study used publicly available data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2015, to identify adults 20 years or older receiving new opioid prescriptions and concurrently using a benzodiazepine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Population-based rates of new opioid prescriptions stratified by use of benzodiazepines.

Results

This study analyzed 13 146 visits, representing 214 million visits nationally, with a new opioid prescription. Rates of new opioid prescriptions among adults using a benzodiazepine increased from 189 to 351 per 1000 persons between 2005 and 2010 (rate difference, 162; 95% CI, 29–295; P = 0.02) and decreased to 172 per 1000 persons by 2015 (rate difference, -179; 95% CI, -310 to -48; P = 0.008). New opioid prescriptions in the general population not using benzodiazepines increased nonsignificantly from 78 to 93 per 1000 US persons between 2005 and 2010 (rate difference, 15; 95% CI, -3 to 33; P = 0.10) and decreased nonsignificantly to 79 per 1000 persons by 2015 (rate difference, -14; 95% CI, -38 to 11; P = 0.28). The likelihood of receiving a new opioid prescription during an ambulatory visit remained higher for patients concurrently using benzodiazepines compared with the general population after adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and diagnoses associated with pain (adjusted relative risk, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.56–2.15; P < .001). Naloxone was coprescribed in less than 1% of visits when a patient concurrently used a benzodiazepine.

Conclusions and Relevance

In 2010, new opioid prescriptions for US adults stopped increasing and began to decrease among higher-risk patients who used benzodiazepines. These patterns suggest that the recent increase in opioid-related deaths may be associated with factors other than physicians writing new opioid prescriptions. Nevertheless, prescribing among higher-risk patients still occurred at rates higher than rates in the general population, representing an important opportunity to improve quality of care for patients experiencing pain.

2.3. Exposure and outcome assessment

We conducted the primary analysis using time-varying exposure to opioids. We prepared opioid exposure data using a transparent drug preparation algorithm. Episodes of opioid use were defined using the decisions made to prepare the data described in Supplementary figure 1. We created mutually exclusive categories for each drug, starting with the first opioid prescription and ending with the last day of supply. We accounted for changes in opioid drug or dose by creating a new patient interval on the date of therapy change. We assigned patients on combinations of opioids a separate category. We used the Anatomic Therapeutic Classification system to map opioid names and identification numbers to a common drug nomenclature in each country. A complete list of opioids included in each country is available in eTable1 in Supplementary 1. We excluded injectable drugs from the analysis. We calculated morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs)/day for each patient to allow direct comparisons of opioid potency and daily dose across different formulations. We defined MME/day by multiplying the daily dose for each prescription by the analgesic ratio of the opioid type, using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specified ratios, as described previously. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, with death dates available from each jurisdiction's death registration data. We attributed deaths to the drug if they occurred while the patient was "on drug" rather than using an "intention-to-treat" analysis given the research question.

2.4. Potential confounders

We characterized the study population at the index date of the first opioid prescription, considering the following potential confounders: sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and concurrent drug use. We grouped age into 6 categories (18–34; 35–44; 45–54; 55–64; 65–74; ≥ 75 years). We used the Charlson comorbidity index to measure multimorbidity and disease burden at baseline. We further evaluated specific comorbidities associated with opioid-related harms, such as depression, substance abuse, and illicit drug use as defined previously. We measured concurrent drug use associated with serious harm or mortality as time-varying covariates, including benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and gabapentinoids. We used the Anatomic Therapeutic Classification nomenclature to identify and map local drugs names within these classes to a common data structure and created 4 binary variables to indicate the presence or absence of an active prescription in the follow-up period.

5.5 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of DSUVIA with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

### Association between benzodiazepine and opioid prescription and mortality among patients in a large healthcare system [^6977e2fd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines (BDZ) is associated with adverse outcomes, including greater healthcare utilization and overdose risk. This study aims to examine opioid and BDZ coprescription, dosing, and mortality among patients with and without opioid use disorder (OUD) in a large healthcare system.

Methods

Using data from the California state Prescription Drug Monitoring Program during 2010 to 2014 linked with a large healthcare system electronic health record database and mortality records from the Centers for Disease Control National Death Index, this study examined 5202 patients (1978 with OUD, 3224 controls). Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships between most recent BDZ and opioid prescription, and their interaction with respect to mortality.

Results

About 10.5% of the sample died on or before December 31, 2014. About 17.7% were prescribed BDZ during the final month of observation. Individuals with OUD were prescribed higher average BDZ and opioid doses than those without OUD. After adjusting for covariates, increased prescribed doses of BDZ (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.15–1.55 per 10mg/d increment) and opioids (OR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.02–1.05 per 10mg/d increment) were positively associated with mortality. Non-OUD patients who received both BDZ and opioid prescriptions had a higher mortality than those who received only BDZ or opioids (The ratio of odds ratio (ROR) = 3.83, 95%CI: 1.78–8.21).

Conclusions

Study findings highlight significant mortality associated with the coprescription of opioids and BDZ in a general healthcare setting. Further research is needed to elucidate factors associated with mortality among non-OUD patients who are co-prescribed opioids and BDZ.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose).

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs.

### Alcohol or benzodiazepine Co-involvement with opioid overdose deaths in the United States, 1999–2017 [^416aec8d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We found that alcohol and benzodiazepine co-involvement in opioid overdose deaths is common, and the prevalence and mortality rates of each co-involved substance has increased during the past 2 decades. Notably, prevalence of benzodiazepine co-involvement in OODs peaked in 2010 and has decreased as OOD increases have become attributable to first heroin and then illicitly sourced fentanyl. At the same time, the prevalence of alcohol co-involvement has remained steady. By 2017, alcohol and benzodiazepine co-involvement in all opioid deaths occurred at similar frequencies. Data from 2015 to 2017 show alcohol co-involvement was relatively higher in the heroin and synthetic (largely illicit fentanyl) subtypes compared with the prescription opioid subtype, and conversely, benzodiazepine co-involvement was higher in the prescription opioid subtype. Alcohol co-involvement was more prevalent in men across all subtypes, whereas benzodiazepine co-involvement was more common in women, consistent with known use patterns of those substances.

When analyzed by opioid subtype, the co-involvement prevalence has changed over time. Alcohol co-involvement was stable from 2013 to 2017 for all OODs; however, subtype trends showed alcohol co-involvement decreasing in the heroin subtype and increasing in the synthetic subtype during this time period. Alcohol co-involvement in OODs for all opioid subtypes increased since 1999, although changes in reporting of deaths and underreportingof alcohol use may explain this trend. Benzodiazepine co-involvement for all OODs appears to have decreased since 2010, possibly driven by the decreasing prevalence in the synthetic opioid subtype, which as an involved subtype has increased in mortality incidence. Benzodiazepine co-involvement remains prevalent in nearly one-third of deaths involving prescription opioids.

We specifically looked at alcohol and benzodiazepines because they are respiratory depressants and have been targets of public health campaigns. Benzodiazepines and alcohol both suppress the respiratory drive and have synergistic effects with opioids that likely increase the risk of a fatal overdose when substances are used concurrently. Despite black box warnings on benzodiazepine and opioid prescriptions cautioning against combination use and consumption with alcohol, our study demonstrates that co-use is common. Access to benzodiazepines, unlike opioids and alcohol, remains largely under the control of physicians, and benzodiazepine and opioid co-prescribing rates have quadrupled from 2003 to 2015, mainly occurring in the primary care setting. Addressing co-prescribing by physicians remains an important policy initiative, although prescription opioids make up a minority of overdose deaths.

### The impact of combined use of opioids, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics on survival in the hospice setting [^a7362874]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Opioids and sedatives are the cornerstone of symptom management in the end-of-life patients, but undertreatment is a common problem. Although several studies explored the individual effect of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics on survival, not much is known regarding their combined use. As these drugs share similar and potentially fatal side effects, primarily respiratory depression which occurs more often during night-hours, it is crucial to explore whether their interaction poses a danger for fragile hospice patients.

Objectives

To analyze the relationship of a combination of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics on survival and the change of night-time death percentage.

Methods

A retrospective study of 765 consecutive patients admitted to hospice in Croatia over the period of four years (2013–2017). The main outcome was the total length of survival of hospice patients regarding different drug combination, along with night-time death percentage.

Results

Different combinations of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics were associated with longer survival in hospice compared with patients using no such drugs. When we included different parameters which affected overall survival into a multivariate analysis, only the patients who had the combination of both opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics in their regular therapy were associated with longer survival in hospice (11 vs. five days, hazard ratio 0.54, P < 0.001). No combination of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics significantly changed the night-time death percentage.

Conclusion

This research supports the safety of opioids, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics in the hospice setting when used both individually as well as in combination.

### Commentary on Lo-ciganic et al.: the importance of evidence-based clinical and policy approaches to reduce opioid harms [^b74938a6]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

The study also demonstrates the value of group‐based trajectory modeling (GBTM) as a tool to improve understanding of longitudinal treatment characteristics and outcomes in clinical and epidemiological research. GBTM is a flexible approach for analyzing time‐varying treatment measures that minimizes individual differences within a given trajectory group. By capturing real rather than chance variation in estimated treatment classes, GBTM can also facilitate applications of causal inference methods in observational studies, enhancing its usefulness for research on treatment safety and effectiveness. Lo‐Ciganic et al. used propensity score weighting to balance characteristics across co‐prescribing trajectories and estimate the association of treatment patterns with risk of subsequent opioid or benzodiazepine overdose. Elevated overdose risk was observed for groups with at least moderate opioid dosages (> 50 MME) or high benzodiazepine dosages (> 40 DME), comprising less than one‐third of patients, but most overdoses (70%). These findings further stress the importance of considering treatment nuances in efforts to prevent adverse opioid outcomes, with strategies that grant clinical judgment to tailor prescribing to patients' needs.

Growing evidence suggests that prescribing interventions may be overly broad, creating barriers to care for patients who could benefit from medication treatment for pain and related conditions (e.g. anxiety, insomnia). Public health measures addressing opioid and benzodiazepine co‐prescribing, such as national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prescribing guidelines expected to be updated this year, have relied largely on epidemiologic data showing high rates of benzodiazepine involvement in opioid overdose deaths and select observational studies lacking causal interpretations. As the original CDC guidelines significantly influenced prescribing practices, the revision aims to respond to concerns about the negative impact and integrate current evidence. The draft guidance is more moderate, suggesting extreme caution rather than avoiding co‐prescribing altogether and downgrading the recommendation to acknowledge variation in patient needs and preferences that warrant greater treatment flexibility. New details also specify that risks may be larger for certain treatment regimens, such as concurrent high‐dosage use.

### New coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines and mortality among veterans affairs patients with posttraumatic stress disorder [^d398ede8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioids and benzodiazepines are commonly coprescribed medications. The mortality risk associated with their concurrent use is unknown.

Objective

To estimate the all-cause mortality risk for patients newly prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently relative to patients prescribed benzodiazepines only, opioids only, or neither medication.

Methods

This propensity score-matched, retrospective, cohort study included 17,476 patients receiving Veterans Affairs (VA) health care between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2011, and diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder identified using ICD-9-CM code 309.81. One-year total and cause-specific mortality was assessed by hazard ratios and subhazard ratios, adjusted for propensity score, age, baseline psychiatric and medical comorbidity, and daily medication dose.

Results

Concurrent users (n = 4,369) were propensity score matched 1:1 with benzodiazepine-only users, opioid-only users, and nonusers. One year after medication start, the concurrent cohort had higher rates of all-cause mortality (116 deaths) relative to benzodiazepine-only (75 deaths; adjusted hazard ratio = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14–2.03), opioid-only (67 deaths; 1.76; 95% CI, 1.32–2.35), and nonuser (60 deaths; 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30–2.64) cohorts. Risk of overdose death was greater among patients in the concurrent cohort relative to patients in the benzodiazepine-only (adjusted subhazard ratio = 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00–6.66), opioid-only (2.58; 95% CI, 1.09–6.11), and nonuser (9.16; 95% CI, 2.27–37.02) cohorts. For circulatory disease-related deaths, the adjusted subhazard ratio for concurrent medication users was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.01–3.24) relative to nonusers.

Conclusions

New coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines was associated with increased all-cause mortality and overdose death compared with new prescription of benzodiazepines only, opioids only, or neither medication and increased circulatory disease-related death relative to neither medication.

### FDA warns about serious risks and death when combining… [^e477ed52]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

1
- Combining opioid pain or prescription opioid cough medicines with medicines called benzodiazepines, which are used for anxiety, insomnia, and seizures, can result in extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, coma, or death. These serious side effects result because both opioids and benzodiazepines impact the central nervous system. The CNS controls most of the functions of the brain and body. FDA conducted two studies that showed an increasing trend in concomitant dispensing of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines, and an increasing frequency of combined benzodiazepine and prescription opioid misuse, abuse, and overdose, as measured by national emergency department visit and overdose death rates. A prospective observational cohort study conducted in North Carolina found the rates of overdose death among patients co-dispensed opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines were 10 times higher:

6. 3–7. 8) than among patients dispensed opioid analgesics alone. Compared to patients taking opioid analgesics with no history of a benzodiazepine prescription, patients taking opioid analgesics with a history of a benzodiazepine prescription had an increased risk of fatal overdose = 2. 33), and those with a current benzodiazepine prescription had a similarly increased risk) for fatal overdose. In addition, the risk of drug overdose death increased as the daily benzodiazepine dose increased.
4. Concomitant use of opioids and other central nervous system depressants Recent studies in the literature show that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and CNS depressants other than benzodiazepines, including alcohol, is also associated with serious adverse events.

One study reported that opioid analgesics contributed to 77 percent of deaths where benzodiazepines were determined to be a cause of death, and benzodiazepines contributed to 30 percent of deaths where opioid analgesics were determined to be a cause of death.

### Cohort study of the impact of high-dose opioid analgesics on overdose mortality [^ed8a93d7]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous studies examining opioid dose and overdose risk provide limited granularity by milligram strength and instead rely on thresholds. We quantify dose-dependent overdose mortality over a large spectrum of clinically common doses. We also examine the contributions of benzodiazepines and extended release opioid formulations to mortality.

Design

Prospective observational cohort with one year follow-up.

Setting

One year in one state (NC) using a controlled substances prescription monitoring program, with name-linked mortality data.

Subjects

Residential population of North Carolina (n = 9,560,234), with 2,182,374 opioid analgesic patients.

Methods

Exposure was dispensed prescriptions of solid oral and transdermal opioid analgesics; person-years calculated using intent-to-treat principles. Outcome was overdose deaths involving opioid analgesics in a primary or additive role. Poisson models were created, implemented using generalized estimating equations.

Results

Opioid analgesics were dispensed to 22.8% of residents. Among licensed clinicians, 89.6% prescribed opioid analgesics, and 40.0% prescribed ER formulations. There were 629 overdose deaths, half of which had an opioid analgesic prescription active on the day of death. Of 2,182,374 patients prescribed opioids, 478 overdose deaths were reported (0.022% per year). Mortality rates increased gradually across the range of average daily milligrams of morphine equivalents. 80.0% of opioid analgesic patients also received benzodiazepines. Rates of overdose death among those co-dispensed benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics were ten times higher (7.0 per 10,000 person-years, 95 percent CI: 6.3, 7.8) than opioid analgesics alone (0.7 per 10,000 person years, 95 percent CI: 0.6, 0.9).

Conclusions

Dose-dependent opioid overdose risk among patients increased gradually and did not show evidence of a distinct risk threshold. There is urgent need for guidance about combined classes of medicines to facilitate a better balance between pain relief and overdose risk.

### The association between receipt of guideline-concordant long-term opioid therapy and all-cause mortality [^8285a6ba]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

For patients receiving long-term opioid therapy (LtOT), the impact of guideline-concordant care on important clinical outcomes — notably mortality — is largely unknown, even among patients with a high comorbidity and mortality burden (e.g. HIV-infected patients). Our objective was to determine the association between receipt of guideline-concordant LtOT and 1-year all-cause mortality.

Methods

Among HIV-infected and uninfected patients initiating LtOT between 2000 and 2010 through the Department of Veterans Affairs, we used Cox regression with time-updated covariates and propensity-score matched analyses to examine the association between receipt of guideline-concordant care and 1-year all-cause mortality.

Results

Of 17,044 patients initiating LtOT between 2000 and 2010, 1048 patients (6%) died during 1 year of follow-up. Patients receiving psychotherapeutic co-interventions (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.75; P < 0.001) or physical rehabilitative therapies (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67–0.98; P = 0.03) had a decreased risk of all-cause mortality compared to patients not receiving these services, whereas patients prescribed benzodiazepines concurrent with opioids had a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.12–1.66; P < 0.001). Among patients with a current substance use disorder (SUD), those receiving SUD treatment had a lower risk of mortality than untreated patients (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.32–0.68; P = < 0.001). No association was found between all-cause mortality and primary care visits (HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.90–1.26; P = 0.32) or urine drug testing (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78–1.17; P = 0.67).

Conclusions

Providers should use caution in initiating LtOT in conjunction with benzodiazepines and untreated SUDs. Patients receiving LtOT may benefit from multi-modal treatment that addresses chronic pain and its associated comorbidities across multiple disciplines.

### Relationship between concomitant benzodiazepine-opioid use and adverse outcomes among US veterans [^445c8902]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines and opioids are commonly used among veterans suffering from mental health disorders and pain conditions. The objective of this study is to determine whether concomitant benzodiazepine-opioid use increases the incidence of adverse outcomes above the baseline risk of nonacute opioid-only use. The dataset contained all veterans who filled at least 1 opioid prescription during the years 2008 to 2012. Nonacute opioid use was defined as having opioid prescriptions greater than or equal to 20 days within a 60-day period. Concomitant use was defined as having opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions that overlapped for at least 7 days. Nonacute opioid-only users were matched to concomitant opioid-benzodiazepine users based on propensity scores. A 365-day observation period was used to identify adverse outcomes. The primary outcome examines the existence of one or more of the following outcomes: opioid-related accidents and overdoses, alcohol- and nonopioid drug-related accidents and overdoses, self-inflicted injuries, violence-related injuries, wounds/injuries overall, and death. A logistic propensity score adjusted regression controlling for propensity toward concomitant use was used to determine the association of concomitant use with adverse outcomes. The final matched sample consisted of 396,141 nonacute opioid-only using veterans and 48,971 concomitant benzodiazepine-opioid users. Receiving opioids and benzodiazepines concomitantly increased the risk of experiencing an adverse outcome with an odds ratio of 1.359 (95% confidence interval: 1.320–1.400; P < 0.0001). Among veterans receiving opioids, concomitant benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes when compared to the baseline risk of opioid-only using veterans.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: national prospective study [^ed95cf55]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Mortality

During a median follow-up of 1.1 years (interquartile range 0.6–2.0 years), 138 (6%) patients withdrew from long term oxygen therapy mainly because of improved oxygenation, and 1129 (50%) patients died.

The figure shows the adjusted mortality estimates. Benzodiazepines were associated with increased adjusted mortality (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.39). There was a trend of a dose relation between higher benzodiazepine doses and increased mortality (1.01, 1.00 to 1.03; P = 0.082) for each increment in dose of 0.1 defined daily dose/day.

Opioids showed a linear dose-response association with increased mortality (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.03; P = 0.038) for each dose increment of 0.1 defined daily dose/day. Lower dose opioids (≤ 30 mg of oral morphine equivalents/day) were not associated with increased mortality (1.03, 0.84 to 1.26) (table 3). Among opioid naive patients with comorbid injury (n = 175), opioid treatment was not associated with increased mortality (0.93, 0.43 to 2.02).

In a detailed analysis of the adjusted risks for each dose level of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid, high dose treatments were associated with increased mortality, while lower dose treatments were not associated with increased risk of death (table 4).

*Categorised as none (untreated), low dose (≤ 0.3 defined daily dose/day), and high dose (> 0.3 defined daily dose/day).

†Rates of admission and mortality adjusted for covariates listed in table 3.

‡Admission analysis included fewer patients, as patients who were in hospital during entire follow-up were excluded (n = 35).

There was no evidence that the effects of benzodiazepines and opioids were modified by concurrent use (P = 0.400), the presence of hypercapnia (benzodiazepines P = 0.26; opioids P = 0.15), being naive to these drugs (benzodiazepines P = 0.22; opioids P = 0.25), having comorbid anxiety/depression (benzodiazepines P = 0.34) or previous injury (opioids P = 0.53).

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (nalocet) [^c11c5a34]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).

If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose].

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride [^b9445de4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of oxymorphone hydrochloride with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Concomitant
use of benzodiazepines, including ONFI, and opioids may result in profound
sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks,
reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational
studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines
increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If
a decision is made to prescribe ONFI concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression
and sedation when ONFI is used with opioids [see
Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including ONFI, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing ONFI and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of ONFI, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of ONFI along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### One-year mortality after emergency department visit for nonfatal opioid poisoning: a population-based analysis [^ed9dd31e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We aim to characterize the incidence and risk factors for opioid-related and all-cause mortality in the year after an emergency department (ED) visit for nonfatal opioid poisoning by conducting a population-based study.

Methods

We used linked health care databases in Ontario, Canada, to identify individuals who attended an ED for nonfatal opioid poisoning between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2016. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined predictors of mortality in the year after discharge (ED or hospital, if admitted).

Results

In this cohort (n = 6,140), 327 individuals (5.3%) died of any cause and 118 (1.9%) died of opioid-related causes within 1 year. Adjusting for other covariates, we found that health service use in the first week was not protective for opioid-related death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47 to 1.06) or all-cause mortality (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.24). In exploring other covariates, predictors of opioid-related mortality included male sex (HR 1.98; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.97) and using opioid agonist therapy (HR 1.79; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.80) or benzodiazepine (HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.31) in the 12 months before the index event. Assessment by a family physician in the previous 12 months was associated with a lower risk of opioid-related and all-cause mortality (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.86; and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82, respectively).

Conclusion

We identified predictors of opioid-related and all-cause mortality after ED presentation for opioid poisoning. Several predictors of mortality may facilitate targeted interventions.

### Triazolam (Halcion) [^4f8a49b5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Halcion, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Halcion concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Halcion than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Halcion, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.

Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Halcion is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including Halcion, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].

Before prescribing Halcion and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of Halcion, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of Halcion along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^257a5ea8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, and other opioids) increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent, as is recommended for all patients on buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US veterans receiving opioid analgesics: case-cohort study [^eab4ddd5]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Findings in context

The findings of this study were largely consistent with studies that have suggested that there are risks associated with concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use. Dunn and colleagues found an association between receipt of sedative-hypnotic drugs and increased risk of combined fatal and non-fatal overdoses. Other studies have looked at smaller subgroups of patients taking opioid analgesics. In a study limited to patients with severe respiratory disease, receipt of concurrent benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics was associated with increased risk of total mortality. In a study of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, receipt of concurrent benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, combined with antidepressants, was found to be associated with increased risk of adverse events. Our study extends this literature in several ways. We studied a much larger nationwide sample focusing exclusively on benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and their association with fatal overdoses. We found a dose-dependent relation between benzodiazepine dose and death from overdose and were also able to more rigorously deal with issues of confounding in our analysis because of the larger sample size.

Because benzodiazepines were more likely to be prescribed to those with substance misuse and other psychiatric disorders, conditions that carry their own risk for death from overdose, the association between receipt of benzodiazepines and death from overdose might be partially explained by these underlying conditions or the severity of those conditions. We attempted to examine this possibility in two ways. We adjusted for baseline characteristics of patients, including demographic information, medical and mental health diagnoses, and the daily opioid dose, in a multivariable model. Additionally, by distinguishing between periods of current and former receipt of benzodiazepines, we dealt with some unmeasured confounding. Nonetheless, because those with current receipt of benzodiazepines might have had more severe conditions for which benzodiazepines were prescribed than those with former receipt, some residual confounding could exist. Patients with more severe addiction or more severe psychiatric morbidity could be more likely to take any drugs in greater quantities than prescribed, as well as illicit drugs, leading to an increased risk of death from overdose. Additionally, it is unclear through our analysis the degree to which benzodiazepines contributed to the actual cause of death from overdose. Half of such deaths occurred during periods when benzodiazepines were not prescribed, and, although the risk of death from overdose increased in a benzodiazepine dose-response fashion, this could reflect an effect of greater psychiatric severity, or other differences between patients who did and did not receive benzodiazepines, rather than the benzodiazepine itself. Thus it is important to note that within the present study, benzodiazepines might be better conceptualized as a marker of risk with unknown direct causal links to death from overdose.

Assessment for co-occurring substance use — screening, risks, and treatment approach in opioid use disorder are emphasized as follows: "Opioid use disorder often co-occurs with alcohol, nicotine, and other substance use disorders", so "evaluation of co-occurring alcohol, nicotine, or substance use (including prescription medication misuse) is recommended", and "Clinicians should assess signs and symptoms of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication or withdrawal". "Alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may result in seizures, hallucinosis, or delirium, and may represent a medical emergency", and "concomitant use of alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with opioids may contribute to respiratory depression". Patients with more severe co-use may need escalated care: "Patients with significant co-occurring substance use disorders, especially severe alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use, may require a higher level of care". Regarding gabapentinoids, "A 2017 systematic review reported that increasing numbers of patients are self-administering higher than recommended doses of gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) to achieve euphoric highs", and "Among opioid users the reported prevalence of gabapentinoid misuse ranged from 3% to 68%". Prognosis and treatment access are addressed: "Evidence suggests that individuals who are actively using other substances during opioid use disorder treatment may have a poorer prognosis", yet "The Guideline Committee cautioned against excluding patients from treatment for their opioid use disorder because they are using cannabis or other psychoactive substances". Initiation of care should not be delayed in most cases: "In most cases, co-occurring substance use will not represent a medical emergency. In such cases, patients can begin treatment for both their opioid use disorder and co-occurring alcohol or substance use disorders". The guideline also warns that "Suspension of opioid use disorder treatment may increase the risk for death from overdose, accidents, or other health problems", and that "Continued use of cannabis or other psychoactive substances may impede treatment for opioid use disorder".

### Opioid and benzodiazepine substitutes: impact on drug overdose mortality in Medicare population [^4c246056]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gabapentinoids (GABAs) and serotonergic drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]/serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]) are increasingly being prescribed as potential substitutes to opioids and benzodiazepines (benzos), respectively, to treat co-occurring pain and anxiety disorders. The toxicities of these drug classes and their combinations are not well understood.

Methods

We conducted a matched case-control study using 2013–2016 Medicare files linked to the National Death Index. Cases were enrollees who died from drug overdose. Controls were enrollees who died from other causes. Cases and controls were matched on patient characteristics and prior chronic conditions. Possession of any opioids, GABAs, benzos, and SSRIs/SNRIs in the month prior to death was defined as drug use. Combination drug use was defined as possessing at least 2 types of these prescriptions for an overlapping period of at least 7 days in the month prior to death.

Results

Among 4323 matches, benzo possession was associated with twice the risk for drug overdose death in cases vs controls. Compared with opioid-benzo co-prescribing, combinations involving SSRIs/SNRIs and opioids (or GABAs) were associated with decreased risk (adjusted odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–0.69 for opioids and SSRIs/SNRIs; adjusted odds ratio 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–0.79 for GABAs and SSRIs/SNRIs). Fatal drug overdose risk was similar in users of GABA-opioid, GABA-benzo, and opioid-benzo combinations.

Conclusions

Benzodiazepines, prescribed alone or in combination, were associated with an increased risk of drug overdose death. SSRIs/SNRIs were associated with lower risk of overdose death vs benzodiazepines. GABAs were not associated with decreased risk compared with opioids, raising concerns for GABAs' perceived relative safety.

5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, and other opioids) increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent, as is recommended for all patients on buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Respiratory events associated with concomitant opioid and sedative use among Medicare beneficiaries with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5024debf]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Background

Opioids and sedatives are commonly prescribed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for symptoms of dyspnoea, pain, insomnia, depression and anxiety. Older adults are advised to avoid these medications due to increased adverse events, including respiratory events. This study examines respiratory event risks associated with concomitant opioid and sedative use compared with opioid use alone in older adults with COPD.

Methods

A 5% nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries with COPD and opioid use between 2009 and 2013 was used for this retrospective cohort study. Current and past concomitant use were identified using drug dispensed within 7 days from the censored date: at respiratory event, at death, or at 12 months post index. Concomitant opioid and sedative use were categorised into no overlap (opioid only), 1 to 10, 11 to 30, 31 to 60 and > 60 days of total overlap. The primary outcome was hospitalisation or emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory events (COPD exacerbations or respiratory depression). Propensity score matching was implemented and semi-competing risk models were used to address competing risk by death.

Results

Among 48 120 eligible beneficiaries, 1810 (16.7%) concomitant users were matched with 9050 (83.3%) opioid only users. Current concomitant use of 1 to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 60 days was associated with increased respiratory events (HRs (95% CI): 2.8 (1.2 to 7.3), 9.3 (4.9 to 18.2) and 5.7 (2.5 to 12.5), respectively), compared with opioid only use. Current concomitant use of > 60 days or past concomitant use of ≤ 60 days was not significantly associated with respiratory events. Consistent findings were found in sensitivity analyses, including in subgroup analysis of non-benzodiazepine sedatives. Additionally, current concomitant use significantly increased risk of death.

Conclusion

Short-term and medium-term current concomitant opioid and sedative use significantly increased risk of respiratory events and death in older COPD Medicare beneficiaries. Long-term past concomitant users, however, demonstrated lower risks of these outcomes, possibly reflecting a healthy user effect or developed tolerance to the effects of these agents.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide (Librax) [^fb1e94fb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Risks From Concomitant Use with Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Librax, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs - in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Librax concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Librax is used with opioids (see PRECAUTIONS).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

The use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of Librax, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

### Emergency department visits and overdose deaths from combined use of opioids and benzodiazepines [^79cea4fc]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines are the prescription drugs most commonly associated with drug overdose deaths. This study was conducted to assess trends in nonmedical use-related emergency department (ED) visits and drug overdose deaths that involved both opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines in the U.S. from 2004 to 2011.

Methods

Opioid analgesic and benzodiazepine nonmedical use-related ED visits from the Drug Abuse Warning Network and drug overdose deaths from the National Vital Statistics System were analyzed for 2004–2011 to determine trends and demographic-specific rates. Data were analyzed from March 2014 to June 2014.

Results

From 2004 to 2011, the rate of nonmedical use-related ED visits involving both opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increased from 11.0 to 34.2 per 100,000 population (p-trend < 0.0001). During the same period, drug overdose deaths involving both drugs increased from 0.6 to 1.7 per 100,000 (p-trend < 0.0001). Statistically significant increases in ED visits occurred among males and females, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics, and all age groups except 12- to 17-year-olds. For overdose deaths, statistically significant increases were seen in males and females, all three race/ethnicity groups, and all age groups except 12- to 17-year-olds. Benzodiazepine involvement in opioid analgesic overdose deaths increased each year, increasing from 18% of opioid analgesic overdose deaths in 2004 to 31% in 2011 (p-trend < 0.0001).

Conclusions

ED visits and drug overdose deaths involving both opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increased significantly between 2004 and 2011. Interventions to improve the appropriate prescribing and use of these medications are needed.

### Pain management, prescription opioid mortality, and the CDC: is the devil in the data? [^a6071686]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

In order to more accurately assess the actual number of prescription opioid analgesic deaths, it was necessary for the first author (MES) to go to individual states' Departments of Health (DOH). Looking at the data from Illinois, what were listed as deaths due to "Opioid Analgesics" reportedly increased from 589 to 1233 between 2015 and 2016. This 107% increase appeared extremely curious given the aforementioned decrease in opioid prescribing. In speaking to one of DOH's statisticians, he confirmed our suspicion: This dramatic increase was almost completely driven by illicit fentanyl and its potent analogs, not by legitimate pharmaceutical opioids used to treat pain. Furthermore, he noted that irrespective of the number of dangerous substances that are found in toxicology reports, the state's death certificate data categorize any death in which even an iota of a prescription opioid (or a nonpharmaceutical fentanyl product) is found as a "prescription opioid death" (J Tharp, personal communication, September 22, 2017). A number of other states (eg, Maryland, New Hampshire) have recently taken the initiative to delineate between fentanyl (generally illicit) and other prescription opioid deaths. So, for example, New Hampshire's Department of Health data characterizes opioid deaths as attributable to specific legitimate prescription opioids, prescription opioids in combination with other licit and illicit drugs (including benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamine and alcohol; methadone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, tramadol, and oxymorphone) (S Watkins, personal communication, September 22, 2017). A total of 59 deaths involving a legitimate prescription opioid were recorded, with 32 involving oxycodone. However, 72% of the deaths involving oxycodone included alcohol, a benzodiazepine (or both alcohol and a benzodiazepine), kratom, methamphetamine, or another prescription opioid (which may or may not have been prescribed concurrently). These data strongly suggest not a "prescription opioid crisis" but rather a "polypharmacy crisis".

### Exposure-response association between concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use and risk of opioid-related overdose in Medicare part D beneficiaries [^f93a04d8]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

How does the risk of overdose change with the number of days with concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use?

Findings

In this cohort study of US Medicare data, the overdose risk associated with concurrent benzodiazepine use changed over time. Concurrent benzodiazepine use was associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of opioid-related overdose during the initial 90 days and an increase of 1.87 times on days 91 to 180.

Meaning

Policy interventions should focus on preventing concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use in the first place instead of reducing the length of concurrent use. Patients using both medications should be closely monitored, particularly during the first days of concurrent use.

### Morphine sulfate (Mitigo) [^9971a57f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-relatedhypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.4 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from concomitant use of MITIGO®with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Use of neuroleptics in conjunction with neuraxial morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Benzodiazepines and risk of all cause mortality in adults: cohort study [^1007dbe0]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Results from this large cohort study based on an intention-to-treat approach suggest either no increase or a small increase in the risk of all cause mortality associated with benzodiazepine initiation. If a detrimental effect on all cause mortality exists, it is likely to be much lower than previously stated and to have only modest clinical relevance, given its magnitude from both an absolute and a relative perspective. The direction and the extent of the attenuation in the point estimates with increasing levels of adjustment, suggest that residual confounding likely explains at least part of the small increase in mortality risk observed in selected analyses.

### Contributions of prescribed and non-prescribed opioids to opioid related deaths: population based cohort study in Ontario, Canada [^96e55aa6]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The North American opioid overdose crisis has been attributed, in part, to the widespread use of prescription opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain over the past two decades. In particular, long term and high dose opioid prescribing has been associated with serious adverse events, including risks of developing an opioid use disorder, overdose, and death. Furthermore, combined use of opioids with other depressants of the central nervous system, most commonly benzodiazepines, has been highlighted as an important risk factor for death due to overdose. Despite recent evidence of decreasing rates of opioid prescribing across Canada, the prevalence of exposure to opioids remains high with an opioid being prescribed to one in eight Ontarians to manage pain in 2016. Similarly, more than 42 000 opioid related deaths (13.1 per 100 000 population) are estimated to have occurred in the United States and nearly 3000 in Canada (8.1 per 100 000 population) in that year. The burden of this early loss of life is clear. In Ontario, the most populous province in Canada, 1 in 133 deaths in 2015 were opioid related, leading to nearly 30 000 years of life lost. Since this time, the policy response has primarily focused on improving the care of people with opioid use disorders, reducing diversion of prescribed opioids, and promoting safe, appropriate opioid prescribing, as evidenced by new clinical practice guidelines for opioids in chronic non-cancer pain published for both the US and Canada in 2016 and 2017.

Intersection of benzodiazepines (BZDs) with the opioid overdose epidemic — co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids; given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose.

### Association of benzodiazepine treatment for sleep disorders with drug overdose risk among young people [^eefe3821]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Young people initiating benzodiazepines for common sleep conditions had an increased risk of drug overdose during the 6 months after initiation compared with those prescribed alternative pharmacologic treatments. The risk was highest for young people starting benzodiazepine treatment with a recent opioid prescription. Given the availability of alternative pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for sleep disorders, our results suggest that using nonbenzodiazepine treatments may reduce drug overdoses in this population.

Concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use is associated with increased overdose and mortality risks, including among adolescents and young adults. We observed an elevated drug overdose risk for youths with sleep disorders treated with benzodiazepines and recent opioid prescriptions compared with those without opioid prescriptions, as well as for youths prescribed alternative treatments. For young people with insomnia who have not responded to nonpharmacologic interventions, nonbenzodiazepine sleep medication should be strongly considered for those with recent opioid prescriptions. Because of heightened overdose risks among opioid users concomitantly using Z-drugs, cautious prescribing is warranted for current prescription opioid users seeking insomnia treatment.

An association of benzodiazepine treatment with drug overdose was observed for young adults aged 18 to 29 years but was less clear for younger individuals aged 10 to 17 years. The stronger association for young adults may be due to access to and use of substances that, when taken with benzodiazepines, increase drug overdose risk. For example, past-year opioid misuse was higher among individuals aged 18 to 25 years (5.3%) than among individuals aged 12 to 17 years (2.3%). Physicians may be more cautious in prescribing sleep medications to adolescents given the lack of evidence for sleep medications for this age group. This approach may result in pharmacologic treatment for insomnia prescribed to adolescents with higher severity of sleep disorders or comorbidities, which could be associated with their observed higher drug overdose incidence. The heterogeneity in treatment practices and drug overdose risk among people aged 10 to 29 years calls for further investigation to explore benzodiazepine treatment and drug overdose risk within narrow age strata.

### Prescription of long-acting opioids and mortality in patients with… [^faa16423]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

For out-of-hospital deaths other than unintentional overdose, the HR was 1. 72 with a risk difference of
47. 4 excess deaths per 10 000 person-years. Patients in the long-acting opioid group had 185 deaths during 11 070 person-years of follow-up, whereas patients in the control medication group had 87 deaths during 8066 person-years of follow-up. For both low and high doses of study drugs, total mortality for long-acting opioid patients was greater than that for comparable patients in the control medication group. Although long-acting opioids increase the risk of unintentional overdose, 1–3, 5 their overall safety relative to other medications commonly prescribed to treat noncancer pain has not been previously well quantified.

This study found that patients prescribed therapy for a long-acting opioid had a risk of all-cause mortality that was 1. 64 times greater than that for matched patients starting an analgesic anticonvulsant or a low-dose cyclic antidepressant, corresponding to 69 excess deaths per 10 000 person-years of therapy. This difference was explained by a 1. 90 times greater risk of out-of-hospital deaths. More than two-thirds of the excess deaths were due to causes other than unintentional overdose; of these, more than one-half were cardiovascular deaths. The increased risk was confined to the first 180 days of prescribed therapy but was present for long-acting opioid doses of 60 mg or less of morphine-equivalents. The increased risk of cardiovascular death could be related to adverse respiratory effects of long-acting opioids. Opioids can cause or exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing, including both obstructive and central sleep apnea.

35–37 Patients with sleep-disordered breathing have increased incidence of nocturnal arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or infarction, and sudden death. 7 Study findings are consistent with those of Solomon and colleagues, 38 who found that older adults with arthritis prescribed opioids had nearly twice the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac death as did comparable patients prescribed nonselective NSAIDs.

### Alcohol or benzodiazepine Co-involvement with opioid overdose deaths in the United States, 1999–2017 [^8584092f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Poisoning deaths have become the leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States, killing more than 70 000 people in 2017. This surge in poisoning deaths is largely made up of opioid overdoses. Increases in opioid overdose deaths (OODs) have been accompanied by the increasing involvement of more potent opioids: first prescription opioids, then heroin, and later illicit fentanyl, now referred to as the triple wave. Characterizing and understanding the effects of and potential solutions for increases in opioid-related mortality have attracted substantial attention; however, polysubstance use among cases of OOD needs further characterization. Specifically, information about the co-involvement of respiratory depressants such as alcohol and benzodiazepines in OODs, overall and by various opioid subtypes, have not been well characterized to date.

Opioid overdose becomes lethal when the central nervous system respiratory drive is suppressed enough to cause hypoxic respiratory failure. Sedating substances such as alcohol and benzodiazepines can have additive or synergistic effects with opioids on respiratory depression and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Almost half of opioid overdoses in 2016 included alcohol, cocaine, or benzodiazepines. Polysubstance use is common and often underrecognized but comes with additional health and psychiatric risks, including accidental overdose. Polysubstance use that includes opioids can take the form of medical co-prescribing, polypharmacy, nonmedical experimentation, or unintentional contamination. Limited prevention efforts have been aimed at prescribers and users alike regarding the harms of combining opioids and other substances.

To address the knowledge gaps around the concurrent use of other respiratory depressants with opioids, we characterized the burden of alcohol and benzodiazepine co-involvement in OODs in the United States from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017. Moreover, because the predominant opioid subtypes have shifted over timeand may be differentially associated with other substance use, we also assessed differences in co-involvement of alcohol or benzodiazepines among the various opioid subtypes. Finally, we determined correlations of alcohol co-involvement with state-level binge drinking prevalence and of benzodiazepine co-involvement with state-level benzodiazepine prescribing to explore whether population-based prevention strategies might influence co-involvement of respiratory depressants in OODs.

5.3 Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication‐assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Long-term psychoactive medications, polypharmacy, and risk of suicide and unintended overdose death among midlife and older women veterans [^43e4f516]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rates of death by suicide and unintended overdose have risen dramatically among midlife and older women, but little is known about potential and preventable drivers of increased risk during this vulnerable period in the lifespan. Our findings from national VHA data suggest that among midlife and older women, long-term opioids, benzodiazepines, and psychoactive polypharmacy are important indicators of suicide risk, and long-term opioids, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and psychoactive polypharmacy are important indicators of overdose mortality risk. These medications are commonly prescribed and co-prescribed among midlife and older women, highlighting the importance of monitoring, routine screening and mitigation for suicide and overdose risks, and deprescribing as appropriate for safe and effective comprehensive care for this vulnerable population.

### Co-prescription of opioids with benzodiazepine and other co-medications among opioid users: differential in opioid doses [^d5d52f82]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Majority of opioid users in this study were prescribed with the combination of opioid with one co-medication in which opioid and anticonvulsant were the most frequently combined. The co-prescriptions of opioid with benzodiazepine were prescribed to 12.3% of patients. The findings from other studies reported that 18–44% of patients with chronic non-cancer pain were concurrently prescribed opioids with benzodiazepines. A study using a national database in Norway that was conducted in persistent opioid users reported that 60% of these patients were dispensed a benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-related hypnotic, whereas a similar study using American prescription database reported a significantly lower prevalence of 30%.

This study evaluated the co-prescriptions among opioid users at an outpatient tertiary hospital setting, making it difficult to compare the findings directly with those of other studies that evaluated the large population or a national level of opioid co-prescriptions using large health care databases. Nevertheless, the finding is inconsistent with the recent guidelines for the treatment of chronic pain, which recommended that the concurrent prescribing of opioid pain medication with benzodiazepines should be avoided whenever possible.

The safety concerns were raised with the concurrent use of benzodiazepines with opioids because it may increase the risk of severe adverse events and problematic opioid use among opioid users including opioid overdose death. Previous research has shown that the presence of additional central nervous system-depressant drugs, which include benzodiazepine, was one of the contributing factors to the opioid overdose death apart from physician knowledge deficit, non-adherence to the prescribed medications and substance use disorders. It was also reported that the risk of overdose death was increased 15-fold in patients filling both opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions compared with those filling neither prescription. This alarming finding indicates that vigilance is required when opioids and benzodiazepines are co-prescribed to patients. It is important to identify and monitor patients who are at increased risk for adverse outcomes and to taper off the benzodiazepine. In view of this, it is also suggested for the health care providers to review the necessity of keeping benzodiazepines on board.

### Are prescription opioids driving the opioid crisis? Assumptions vs facts [^f543b9cf]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Table 2
Opioid analgesic overdose fatalities: Nonintentional (GAO: 2003–2008) vs all-cause (CDC: 2003–2014)

Importantly, within-state trends can diverge from nationwide trends discussed in this paper. Utah is an example, where fatal opioid analgesic overdoses began increasing in 2011, persisting into 2016.

Opioid Analgesics as Causative Agent in Overdose Fatalities

Misperception: Fatal ODs reflect the inherent lethality of opioid analgesics.

Fact: Opioid analgesics are infrequently the sole cause of fatal overdose.

Recent data demonstrate that fatal opioid analgesic ODs primarily result from either methadone or the combination of opioids and benzodiazepines of other CNS depressants. The extent that co-ingested agents have driven overdose rates is little reported in the media. Data from 2011, when prescription opioid analgesic deaths peaked, is used as a reference point when relevant. Primary contributors to fatal opioid analgesic overdose are the following.

Methadone prescribing for pain began in the late 1990s, and overdose fatalities increased from 784 in 1999 to 5,518 in 2007, decreasing to 4,418 in 2011 and 3400 in 2014. Methadone accounted for a disproportionately large share of fatal prescription opioid analgesic toxicities in 2007 (38%), decreasing in 2011 (26%) and 2014 (24%). Fatal methadone overdoses were fueled by prescriber inexperience with the complex pharmacology, and its designation as the firstline chronic pain opioid by insurer/third-party payers on the sole basis of cost savings. For example, methadone 5-mg tablets, taken three times daily, cost an average of $17 per month in 2012, compared with $306 per month for branded oxycodone (ER 40 mg taken twice daily).

Although co-prescriptions of opioid with other medications may assist in the management of chronic pain, certain co-prescribing patterns increase potential harm and are associated with high risk of drug interactions and adverse events. A report from the US demonstrated that the rate of death from opioid overdose has quadrupled in the last 15 years, and the most common additional agents found among the opioid overdose death were benzodiazepines, followed by antidepressants, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics.

Benzodiazepines, apart from being the main additional agent in the opioid overdose death, were also associated with increased rates of sedation, respiratory depression, cognitive dysfunction and sleep apnea.–Patients who were co-prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines for chronic pain were also reported to be prescribed with a high dose of opioid for long term. This increases the risk of opioid overdose, specifically with opioid doses of > 100 mg morphine equivalents per day. The practice of combining benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics has been recognized as both ubiquitous and substantial. The extent to which clinicians have cautioned patients against the concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opiates is unclear, but their co-prescribing presents a serious safety concern and is not well characterized.

Given these uncertainties, this study was prompted to address the patterns of opioid co-prescribing with benzodiazepine and other co-medications among opioid users. The daily opioid dose per patient in each type of opioid co-prescribing was also examined. We believe that this study will be an important first step to better understand opioid co-prescribing at an outpatient tertiary hospital setting in Malaysia and will help to improve the safety of opioid prescribing.

5.5 Managing Risks From Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants With Buprenorphine

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use with buprenorphine. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Associations between prescribed benzodiazepines, overdose death and buprenorphine discontinuation among people receiving buprenorphine [^630ddb75]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed to patients with opioid use disorder receiving buprenorphine treatment, yet may increase overdose risk. However, prescribed benzodiazepines may improve retention in care by reducing buprenorphine discontinuation and thus may prevent relapse to illicit opioid use. We aimed to test the association between benzodiazepine prescription and fatal opioid overdose, non-fatal opioid overdose, all-cause mortality and buprenorphine discontinuation.

Design and Setting

This was a retrospective cohort study using five individually linked data sets from Massachusetts, United States government agencies.

Participants

We studied 63389 Massachusetts residents aged 18 years or older who received buprenorphine treatment between January 2012 and December 2015.

Measurements

Filled benzodiazepine prescription during buprenorphine treatment was the main independent variable. The primary outcome was time to fatal opioid overdose. Secondary outcomes were time to non-fatal opioid overdose, all-cause mortality and buprenorphine discontinuation. We defined buprenorphine discontinuation as having a 30-day gap without another prescription following the end date of the previous prescription. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazards ratios that tested the association between receipt of benzodiazepines and all outcomes, restricted to periods during buprenorphine treatment.

Findings

Of the 63345 individuals who received buprenorphine, 24% filled at least one benzodiazepine prescription during buprenorphine treatment. Thirty-one per cent of the 183 deaths from opioid overdose occurred when individuals received benzodiazepines during buprenorphine treatment. Benzodiazepine receipt during buprenorphine treatment was associated with an increased risk of fatal opioid overdose adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.10–4.06, non-fatal opioid overdose, adjusted HR = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.68–2.50, all-cause mortality, adjusted HR = 1.90, 95% CI, 1.48–2.44 and a decreased risk of buprenorphine discontinuation, adjusted HR = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.85–0.89.

Conclusions

Benzodiazepine receipt appears to be associated with both increased risk of opioid overdose and all-cause mortality and decreased risk of buprenorphine discontinuation among people receiving buprenorphine.

### Association between preoperative opioid and benzodiazepine prescription patterns and mortality after noncardiac surgery [^5d66f395]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The number of patients prescribed long-term opioids and benzodiazepines and complications from their long-term use have increased. Information regarding the perioperative outcomes of patients prescribed these medications before surgery is limited.

Objective

To determine whether patients prescribed opioids and/or benzodiazepines within 6 months preoperatively would have greater short- and long-term mortality and increased opioid consumption postoperatively.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, single-center, population-based cohort study included all patients 18 years or older, undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures at a national hospital in Iceland from December 12, 2005, to December 31, 2015, with follow-up through May 20, 2016. A propensity score-matched control cohort was generated using individuals from the group that received prescriptions for neither medication class within 6 months preoperatively. Data analysis was performed from April 10, 2018, to March 9, 2019.

Exposures

Patients who filled prescriptions for opioids only, benzodiazepines only, both opioids and benzodiazepines, or neither medication within 6 months preoperatively.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Long-term survival compared with propensity score-matched controls. Secondary outcomes were 30-day survival and persistent postoperative opioid consumption, defined as a prescription filled more than 3 months postoperatively.

Results

Among 41 170 noncardiac surgical cases in 27 787 individuals (16 004 women [57.6%]; mean [SD] age, 56.3 [18.8] years), a preoperative prescription for opioids only was filled for 7460 cases (17.7%), benzodiazepines only for 3121 (7.4%), and both for 2633 (6.2%). Patients who filled preoperative prescriptions for either medication class had a greater comorbidity burden compared with patients receiving neither medication class (Elixhauser comorbidity index > 0 for 16% of patients filling prescriptions for opioids only, 22% for benzodiazepines only, and 21% for both medications compared with 14% for patients filling neither). There was no difference in 30-day (opioids only: 1.3% vs 1.0%; P = 0.23; benzodiazepines only: 1.9% vs 1.5%; P = 0.32) or long-term (opioids only: hazard ratio [HR], 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01–1.24]; P = 0.03; benzodiazepines only: HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.98–1.26]; P = 0.11) survival among the patients receiving opioids or benzodiazepines only compared with controls. However, patients prescribed both opioids and benzodiazepines had greater 30-day mortality (3.2% vs 1.8%; P = 0.004) and a greater hazard of long-term mortality (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22–1.64; P < .001). The rate of persistent postoperative opioid consumption was higher for patients filling prescriptions for opioids only (43%), benzodiazepines only (23%), or both (66%) compared with patients filling neither (12%) (P < .001 for all).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that opioid and benzodiazepine prescription fills in the 6 months before surgery are associated with increased short-and long-term mortality and an increased rate of persistent postoperative opioid consumption. These patients should be considered for early referral to preoperative clinic and medication optimization to improve surgical outcomes.

### Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US veterans receiving opioid analgesics: case-cohort study [^c5bff283]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To study the association between benzodiazepine prescribing patterns including dose, type, and dosing schedule and the risk of death from drug overdose among US veterans receiving opioid analgesics.

Design

Case-cohort study.

Setting

Veterans Health Administration (VHA), 2004–09.

Participants

US veterans, primarily male, who received opioid analgesics in 2004–09. All veterans who died from a drug overdose (n = 2400) while receiving opioid analgesics and a random sample of veterans (n = 420,386) who received VHA medical services and opioid analgesics.

Main Outcome Measure

Death from drug overdose, defined as any intentional, unintentional, or indeterminate death from poisoning caused by any drug, determined by information on cause of death from the National Death Index.

Results

During the study period 27% (n = 112,069) of veterans who received opioid analgesics also received benzodiazepines. About half of the deaths from drug overdose (n = 1185) occurred when veterans were concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids. Risk of death from drug overdose increased with history of benzodiazepine prescription: adjusted hazard ratios were 2.33 (95% confidence interval 2.05 to 2.64) for former prescriptions versus no prescription and 3.86 (3.49 to 4.26) for current prescriptions versus no prescription. Risk of death from drug overdose increased as daily benzodiazepine dose increased. Compared with clonazepam, temazepam was associated with a decreased risk of death from drug overdose (0.63, 0.48 to 0.82). Benzodiazepine dosing schedule was not associated with risk of death from drug overdose.

Conclusions

Among veterans receiving opioid analgesics, receipt of benzodiazepines was associated with an increased risk of death from drug overdose in a dose-response fashion.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^15b44cfb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite potential harms, long-term use of BZDs (i.e. ≥ 120 days) is common. Long-term BZD use is associated with an increased risk of physical dependence and withdrawal and ongoing risk of adverse events such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, and cognitive impairment.– Evidence also suggests that use of BZDs is associated with increased suicide risk, although the mechanism for this association is not well understood. The risk–benefit balance for continued BZD use may shift over time, and stopping can be challenging because physical dependence develops with regular use. It should be noted that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with the use of prescribed BZDs and is distinct from substance use disorders (SUDs; see Box 1). Older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years old) have the highest BZD prescription rates and are at higher risk of experiencing adverse events related to BZD use. Some older adults have taken BZDs continuously for decades. In some instances, use has been so prolonged that the original reason for the BZD prescription may be unclear.

Box 1
Physical Dependence Versus Substance Use Disorder

Safe tapering of BZDs can be clinically complex because rapid dosage reductions may precipitate acute withdrawal, which can be life-threatening. Patients are also at risk of recurrence and exacerbation of the symptoms for which BZDs were initially prescribed (e.g. anxiety, seizures, insomnia) and destabilization. This Guideline was motivated, in part, by patients reporting harms associated with too rapid tapering/discontinuation of BZD medications. Inadequate tapering strategies may push patients to the illegal drug market, where counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSOs) are common, presenting an increased risk of overdose and overdose death. This Guideline aims to help clinicians in diverse practice settings determine whether and how to taper BZD medications.

Intersection with the Opioid Overdose Epidemic

Co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids. In addition, some individuals may concomitantly take BZDs and opioids to augment the effects of both substances.

Given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose. – In 2021, 13.7% of overdose deaths in the USA involving opioids also involved BZDs, and nearly 88% of overdose deaths involving BZDs also involved opioids.

### Mortality risk for individuals with cannabis use disorders in relation to alcohol use disorders: results of a follow-up study [^b278ed10]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are few studies on mortality on individuals entering treatment for cannabis use disorders.

Objectives

To estimate mortality risk for individuals treated for cannabis use disorders comparing patients with concomitant alcohol use disorders to those with only cannabis use disorders.

Methods

Follow-up study on 1136 residents in Northern Italy who turned to health services following problems caused by cannabis use disorders between 2009 and 2019. Individuals with concomitant use of opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, or injecting drugs were excluded. Crude mortality rates per 1000 Person Years (CMR), and standardized mortality ratios adjusted for age, sex and calendar year (SMR) were calculated.

Results

Elevated CMRs (CMR 4.4, 3–6.4), higher among patients with concomitant alcohol use disorders (CMR 10.2, 6.6–15.6) compared to those with only cannabis use disorders (CMR 1.8, 0.9–3.6) were found. Regarding excess mortality with respect to the general population, SMRs were higher and statistically significant (SMR 5.4, 3.7–7.8), both among patients with concomitant alcohol use disorders (SMR 10.2, 6.6–15.6) and among those with only cannabis use disorders (SMR 2.3, 1.1–4.5).

Conclusions

The results of this study show that individuals with only cannabis use disorders have a lower mortality risk compared to those with both cannabis and alcohol use disorders.

### Exposure-response association between concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use and risk of opioid-related overdose in Medicare part D beneficiaries [^ab3619bd]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Our study fills these gaps in the literature. We used Medicare claims data from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014, to evaluate the association between concurrent use of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines and the risk of opioid-related overdose (including fatal and nonfatal overdoses) while controlling for a comprehensive list of patient demographic characteristics, insurance, clinical characteristics, and, more interestingly, the number of unique clinicians who prescribed opioids or benzodiazepines for each patient. We further examined the exposure-response association between the number of days with overlapping supply of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines and the risk of opioid-related overdose.

### Alcohol or benzodiazepine Co-involvement with opioid overdose deaths in the United States, 1999–2017 [^06bc6b1d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that the proportion and rates of OODs involving alcohol and benzodiazepines have increased during the past 20 years. Proportions of co-involvement vary by opioid subtype recently and over time, highlighting changing aspects of the ongoing epidemic. Alcohol remains an important and underrecognized cointoxicant in overdose deaths. Benzodiazepines remain especially prevalent in prescription OODs, and their changing involvement in heroin and synthetic OODs warrants further evaluation. Associations between OODs, binge drinking, and benzodiazepine prescribing rates may help identify risk factors and prevention strategies for opioid overdoses and OODs on a population level.

### Alcohol or benzodiazepine Co-involvement with opioid overdose deaths in the United States, 1999–2017 [^38dbf723]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Analytical Strategy

Data were analyzed from July 10, 2018, to May 16, 2019. Using descriptive statistics, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis of annual OODs and the proportion with benzodiazepine and alcohol co-involvement, stratified by opioid subtype. We then performed a geographic subanalysis of alcohol and benzodiazepine co-involvement for all OODs in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia using combined 2015–2017 data (the 3 most recent years of available mortality data). A Pearson correlation test was used to compare the co-involvement prevalence rates of alcohol and benzodiazepines in each state. We also ran correlation testing between the state-level prevalence of alcohol co-involvement in OODs and state-level prevalence of binge drinking in 2015 to 2017 using data from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, which defines binge drinking as 5 or more standard drinks on 1 occasion for men and 4 or more for women, self-reported in the last month. Finally, we assessed the correlation between benzodiazepine co-involvement in all OODs in 2012 and state-level benzodiazepine prescribing rates (the most recent data available) in 2012. All analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel (Professional Plus, version 2013). One-sided P < .05 indicated significance.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^8e3d0368]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing guidelines — patients with mental health conditions and concurrent benzodiazepine use: Patients with mental health conditions may require therapy of comorbidities with anti-anxiety medications as well as antidepressants, but patients taking benzodiazepines for anxiety should be warned of the elevated risks for respiratory depression with concomitant opioid use, and physicians should be judicious with opioid initiation and monitoring in these patients. Due to established risks with the combination of opioids and benzodiazepines and psychiatric instability including suicide risk, clinicians should cautiously provide chronic opioid therapy with or without benzodiazepines and antidepressant therapy in this group, and clinicians should consider behavioral health consultations, specifically in those with uncontrolled psychological disorders and suicide risk. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be useful in patients on long term opioid therapy to reduce opioid exposure and associated risks to patients, families, and communities while offering patients an alternative for managing pain.

### Benzodiazepines, codispensed opioids, and mortality among patients initiating long-term in-center hemodialysis [^9b22c27b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mortality from benzodiazepine/opioid interactions is a growing concern in light of the opioid epidemic. Patients on hemodialysis suffer from a high burden of physical/psychiatric conditions, which are treated with benzodiazepines, and they are three times more likely to be prescribed opioids than the general population. Therefore, we studied mortality risk associated with short- and long-acting benzodiazepines and their interaction with opioids among adults initiating hemodialysis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The cohort of 69,368 adults initiating hemodialysis (January 2013 to December 2014) was assembled by linking US Renal Data System records to Medicare claims. Medicare claims were used to identify dispensed benzodiazepines and opioids. Using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated the mortality risk associated with benzodiazepines (time varying) and tested whether the benzodiazepine-related mortality risk differed by opioid codispensing.

Results

Within 1 year of hemodialysis initiation, 10,854 (16%) patients were dispensed a short-acting benzodiazepine, and 3262 (5%) patients were dispensed a long-acting benzodiazepine. Among those who were dispensed a benzodiazepine during follow-up, codispensing of opioids and short-acting benzodiazepines occurred among 3819 (26%) patients, and codispensing of opioids and long-acting benzodiazepines occurred among 1238 (8%) patients. Patients with an opioid prescription were more likely to be subsequently dispensed a short-acting benzodiazepine (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.59 to 1.74) or a long-acting benzodiazepine (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.20). Patients dispensed a short-acting benzodiazepine were at a 1.45-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.35 to 1.56) higher mortality risk compared with those without a short-acting benzodiazepine; among those with opioid codispensing, this risk was 1.90-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.65 to 2.18; P interaction < 0.001). In contrast, long-acting benzodiazepine dispensing was inversely associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.99) compared with no dispensing of long-acting benzodiazepine; there was no differential risk by opioid dispensing (P interaction = 0.72).

Conclusions

Codispensing of opioids and short-acting benzodiazepines is common among patients on dialysis, and it is associated with higher risk of death.

### Non-fatal overdose risk associated with prescribing opioid agonists concurrently with other medication: cohort study conducted using linked primary care, secondary care and mortality records [^505c6d04]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

An apparently protective effect of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) on all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk has been widely reported. Non-fatal overdose (NFO) often precedes subsequent drug-poisoning deaths. We hypothesized that benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, antipsychotics, antidepressants, Z-drugs or opioids increase the NFO risk when co-prescribed with OAT.

Design

We conducted a cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD and Aurum databases. The cohort was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics admitted patient care data (HES-APC), neighbourhood- and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles and mortality records from the Office for National Statistics.

Setting

Primary care in England.

Participants

We studied patients with opioid use disorder, aged 18–64 years, who were prescribed OAT (15155 methadone and 5743 buprenorphine recipients) between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 2017.

Measurements

The main outcome examined was NFO risk during co-prescription of OAT with benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, antidepressants, Z-drugs or opioids. Overdose was defined according to International Classification of Diseases codes from the HES-APC data set. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate weighted rate ratios (wRR) for NFO during co-prescription of OAT and benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, antidepressants, Z-drugs or opioids with periods of exclusive OAT usage.

Findings

Among 20898 patients observed over 83856 person-years, we found an elevated overdose risk that resulted in hospital admission during co-prescription of OAT with benzodiazepines [wRR: 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26–1.67], gabapentinoids (wRR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.77–2.79), Z-drugs (wRR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.31–1.96), antipsychotics (wRR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.53–2.25) and opioids (wRR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.02–1.60). The risk ratio for antidepressant co-prescriptions was below unity (wRR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.79–1.02) but this result was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Elevated risk of non-fatal overdose among opioid agonist treatment recipients is associated with concurrent use of medication prescribed for other reasons.

### Alcohol or benzodiazepine Co-involvement with opioid overdose deaths in the United States, 1999–2017 [^c8078e8c]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Although co-involvement prevalence is high in prescription OODs, fentanyl-involved OODs made up nearly half of all OODs in the last 3 years of available data. Additional studies are needed to understand polysubstance use trends, including alcohol, among those who use fentanyl, because illicitly manufactured fentanyl remains the driving force in overdose deaths and is responsible for the sharp increase in deaths since 2013. Fentanyl causes respiratory depression and death more rapidly than other common opioids, possibly decreasing the importance of additional respiratory depressants as a contributor to death.

Both alcohol use and benzodiazepine use are modifiable risk factors for overdose. We believe confronting unhealthy alcohol use and access to alcohol is an important state and national policy initiative because the disease burden of alcohol use is greater than that of opioids. Examples of effective population-based strategies to reduce binge drinking include increasing alcohol taxes, maintaining restrictions on alcohol outlet density and hours of sale, and enforcing minimum drinking age laws. Innovations to decrease benzodiazepine co-prescribing are needed. One study of electronic medical alertsdemonstrated a modest effect, but more work is needed on this front. On a population level, we observed a correlation between state binge drinking prevalence and alcohol co-involvement prevalence in OODs. Individuals who binge drink are nearly twice as likely to misuse prescription opioids, and higher frequency of binge drinking corresponds to higher prevalence of opioid misuse. The co-use of alcohol and illicit opioids, specifically heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, deserves further research at the individual and population level. Further understanding alcohol consumption patterns and benzodiazepine use among individuals who use opioids may refine harm reduction messaging and provide promising avenues for prevention of overdoses.

### Opioid and benzodiazepine Co-prescribing trends from the emergency department from 2012 to 2019: a national analysis [^2abc8cd0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its strongest safety warning ("Black Box Warning") for concomitant use of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines due to overdose deaths.

Objective

Our objective was to look at trends of opioid and benzodiazepine co-prescribing in the emergency department (ED) using national data, because recent data are sparse.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of data collected by the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey between 2012 and 2019. Our primary outcome was to determine whether there was a trend in ED visits when opioids and benzodiazepines were co-prescribed at discharge. We also compared the rate of visits when co-prescribing occurred before (2012–2015) and after (2017–2019) the 2016 FDA warning. We identified commonly co-prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids, and the rate of naloxone co-prescribing. We used descriptive statistics and bivariate tests to describe data.

Results

Between 2012 and 2019, there were 4,489,613 ED visits (0.41% of ED visits) when benzodiazepines and opioids were co-prescribed. There was no trend in the rate of co-prescribing overall, but a decrease in visits after the 2016 FDA Black Box Warning (2012–2015: mean 0.49%; 2017–2019: mean 0.29%; p < 0.0001). There were 7980 ED visits (0.18%) when naloxone was co-prescribed for these visits within this time frame and an increase over time (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our study found that between 2012 and 2019, there was no overall reduction in co-prescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines across EDs nationwide, but a decrease after the 2016 Black Box Warning.
