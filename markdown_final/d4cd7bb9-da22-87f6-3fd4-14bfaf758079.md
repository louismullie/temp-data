## Question

Which blood pressure medication has the most side effect of orthostatic hypotension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which blood pressure medication has the most side effect of orthostatic hypotension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how orthostatic hypotension is defined and measured in trials and practice. Then, I should verify which antihypertensive classes are most consistently implicated in causing or worsening orthostatic hypotension. Next, I will compare across classes and identify the highest-risk agents. After that, I need to check for modifiers such as age, comorbidities, and dose timing. Finally, I will reconcile this with guideline positions and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor on a misleading premise: orthostatic hypotension is typically defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg and/or diastolic of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or during head-up tilt, and it can be neurogenic or non-neurogenic depending on the heart rate response and etiology, which matters when interpreting drug effects.

> Next, I should review which antihypertensive classes repeatedly show up as high risk for orthostatic hypotension. Wait, let me verify the consistent signals: multiple sources converge on alpha-1 blockers, centrally acting agents, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and diuretics as the principal culprits, with beta-blockers also contributing in some contexts, whereas ACE inhibitors and ARBs are generally less likely to worsen orthostatic hypotension and may even be protective in some analyses [^111xYkNw] [^112haZGA] [^112vR4vZ].

> Hold on, I should verify which single class rises above the rest. Alpha-1 blockers repeatedly carry the strongest and most specific warning in contemporary guidelines and drug tables, with explicit statements that they are associated with orthostatic hypotension, particularly in older adults and with a prominent first-dose effect; this is reflected in both ACC/AHA and AHA/ACC/AANP guidance and in drug-class summaries, which repeatedly flag doxazosin, prazosin, and terazosin for this risk [^111MDKA1] [^113sVBHz] [^114ZpCFE].

> I need to check comparative data to ensure I'm not overstating this. In ALLHAT, amlodipine showed a transient increase in falls early after initiation, but there was no long-term difference in falls, syncope, or orthostatic hypotension across randomized first-line classes; importantly, that analysis did not isolate alpha-1 blockers, which were not first-line in ALLHAT, so it doesn't contradict the higher risk signal seen with alpha-1 antagonists in other literature and guidelines [^115983Vy]. Let me reconsider: this means the relative risk ranking still favors alpha-1 blockers as the highest-risk class for orthostatic hypotension among commonly used antihypertensives, even if other classes can occasionally contribute, especially early after initiation or in vulnerable patients [^115983Vy] [^111MDKA1].

> But wait, what if patient-specific factors change the hierarchy? I should double-check modifiers: older age, autonomic failure, volume depletion, and polypharmacy amplify orthostatic hypotension risk across classes, and the first-dose phenomenon with alpha-1 blockers is particularly salient; conversely, improving overall blood pressure control can reduce orthostatic hypotension prevalence over time, which helps explain why intensive therapy trials often show no increase in orthostatic hypotension and sometimes a reduction, even though individual agents may unmask underlying autonomic impairment in susceptible patients [^1121VX2b] [^113fpocK] [^117TEE2q].

> Next, I should review guideline direction so my recommendation aligns with best practice. Contemporary guidance advises avoiding or switching agents that worsen orthostatic hypotension when feasible, with explicit mention of alpha-1 blockers as problematic; in patients with coexisting supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension, strategies include using short-acting antihypertensives at bedtime, prioritizing classes less likely to aggravate orthostatic hypotension, and employing nonpharmacologic measures and, if needed, pressor therapy for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, rather than simply de-intensifying blood pressure control [^116iWimA] [^112haZGA] [^115z8urw].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: among blood pressure medications, alpha-1 blockers have the most consistent and clinically important association with orthostatic hypotension, with a pronounced first-dose effect and heightened risk in older adults; therefore, if orthostatic hypotension is present or likely, alpha-1 blockers should be avoided or switched when possible, and if used for benign prostatic hyperplasia, consider alternatives or use the lowest effective dose with careful counseling and orthostatic vital sign monitoring after dose changes [^111MDKA1] [^113sVBHz] [^114ZpCFE].

---

Alpha-1 blockers (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) are the **antihypertensive class most associated with orthostatic hypotension** [^111MDKA1], especially in older adults and with first-dose effects [^113sVBHz]. Centrally acting agents (clonidine, methyldopa) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) also increase risk, whereas ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics have a lower risk. To minimize orthostatic hypotension, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor orthostatic vitals — especially after dose changes or in older adults [^112pDiC8].

---

## Medication classes associated with orthostatic hypotension

Several **antihypertensive classes** are linked to orthostatic hypotension, but the risk varies by mechanism and patient factors:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Risk of orthostatic hypotension** |
|-|-|-|
| Alpha-1 blockers | - Doxazosin <br/> - Prazosin <br/> - Terazosin | High; especially first-dose effect [^111MDKA1] [^113sVBHz] |
| Centrally acting agents | - Clonidine <br/> - Methyldopa | Moderate; dose-dependent [^notfound] |
| Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers | - Verapamil <br/> - Diltiazem | Moderate; more with higher doses [^notfound] |
| Beta-blockers | - Metoprolol <br/> - Carvedilol | Low-moderate; more with non-selective or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity [^notfound] |
| ACE inhibitors | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril | Low; rarely cause orthostatic hypotension [^notfound] |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | Low; rarely cause orthostatic hypotension [^notfound] |
| Diuretics | - Hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Furosemide | Low-moderate; risk rises with volume depletion [^notfound] |

---

## Alpha-1 blockers: highest risk

Alpha-1 blockers are the **class most strongly associated with orthostatic hypotension**, particularly in older adults and with first-dose effects [^111MDKA1]. They reduce peripheral vascular resistance and impair baroreflex-mediated vasoconstriction, causing marked postural drops in blood pressure [^notfound]. Guidelines advise caution and recommend monitoring orthostatic vitals when initiating or adjusting these agents [^111MDKA1].

---

## Centrally acting agents and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers

Centrally acting agents (clonidine, methyldopa) reduce sympathetic outflow and can cause **dose-dependent orthostatic hypotension**, particularly in older adults or those with autonomic dysfunction [^notfound]. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) can also cause orthostatic hypotension, especially at higher doses or when combined with other vasodilators [^notfound].

---

## Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics

Beta-blockers have a lower risk but can still cause orthostatic hypotension, particularly non-selective agents or those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity [^notfound]. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are **rarely associated with orthostatic hypotension** and are often preferred in patients at risk [^notfound]. Diuretics can contribute indirectly through volume depletion, increasing susceptibility to orthostatic drops [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient characteristics increase susceptibility to **orthostatic hypotension**:

- **Age**: Older adults have higher prevalence and severity [^115EHL5J].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, autonomic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, and cardiovascular disease increase risk [^115w65E6].
- **Polypharmacy**: Multiple antihypertensives or interacting drugs compound risk [^115eUUrh].
- **Volume status**: Dehydration or volume depletion exacerbate orthostatic drops [^114DPCJ5].

---

## Clinical management strategies

To minimize orthostatic hypotension risk:

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at low doses and titrate gradually [^notfound].
- **Monitor orthostatic vitals**: Check supine and standing blood pressure at initiation and after dose changes, especially in older adults [^112pDiC8].
- **Patient education**: Teach slow positional changes, hydration, and recognition of symptoms [^116Nd1Z9].
- **Medication adjustment**: Consider switching or discontinuing high-risk agents if symptomatic [^116iWimA].

---

Alpha-1 blockers carry the **highest risk of orthostatic hypotension** among antihypertensives, with centrally acting agents and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers also contributing. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics are lower-risk options. Risk is amplified by age, comorbidities, and polypharmacy, so careful selection, slow titration, and orthostatic monitoring are essential.

Introduction

Hypertension is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Current guidelines, e.g. European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guideline, recommend blood pressure management with a target systolic blood pressure range of 130–139 mm Hg in older adults (≥ 65 years). The decision to initiate antihypertensive therapy in older adults, and the choice of blood pressure target in this cohort, requires a trade-off between efficacy and safety (e.g. adverse events such as falls). A particularly challenging cohort of hypertensive patients to manage are those with concomitant orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension affects approximately 20% of adults, with prevalence increasing with age, and is an independent risk factor for injurious falls, as well as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Given the prevalence of both conditions and the ageing population, the overlap of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is likely to become an increasingly common dilemma for clinicians.

In some randomised controlled trials, individuals with orthostatic hypotension were excluded, either based on clinical history or objective measurement of orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Generalising findings from clinical trials to patients in routine clinical practice requires an understanding of whether such exclusion criteria alter treatment estimates of safety, especially among potentially vulnerable patients.

We sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy with adverse events, such as falls, fracture or syncope differed by exclusion of participants with orthostatic hypotension in randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found no significant difference in the odds of adverse events including falls, syncope, fracture or hypotension associated with antihypertensive therapy between groups by orthostatic hypotension exclusion. However, the event rates of hypotension were significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (P -value ≤ 0.01). The event rates of falls and fracture were also numerically lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension, although the difference was not statistically significant.

In 2019, the Global Burden of Disease collaboration estimated that age-standardised prevalence rates of hypertension were 32% for women and 34% for men aged 30–79 years. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia and mortality. Previous meta-analyses have shown that blood pressure lowering is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, mortality and dementia. Orthostatic hypotension has also been reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. It is estimated that approximately 10% of hypertensive individuals attending specialist clinics have co-existing orthostatic hypotension. Clinicians may be more cautious initiating antihypertensive therapy in those with co-existing orthostatic hypotension; however, the risk of orthostatic hypotension is higher in those with uncontrolled hypertension. Blood pressure management in those with both supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is a common and challenging dilemma for clinicians and patients.

Based on the results of randomised controlled trials, such as SPRINT, lower blood pressure targets have been recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, these guidelines suggest caution in older adults with multimorbidity and advise that clinicians consider the risk and benefits of a particular therapy or target and tailor the decision to the individual patient. As highlighted in our study, a large proportion of clinical trials evaluating blood pressure lowering excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension. Exclusion criterion are applied to clinical trial recruitment on the basis of medical conditions, such as orthostatic hypotension, where the condition may pose an increased risk of adverse events which may compromise the safety of the participant. However, where this comorbidity commonly co-exists with the condition of interest, e.g. hypertension, the impact of this exclusion criterion on the external validity of results should be considered. The exclusion of this cohort from clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy poses challenges to shared decision making where the true risk-benefit of an intervention or blood pressure target is not known, rather extrapolated from a different population cohort.

Background and Purpose

Management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy and adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope), differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure lowering medications to placebo, or different blood pressure targets on falls or syncope outcomes and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude patients with orthostatic hypotension, and tested P for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

Results

46 trials were included, of which 18 trials excluded orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P < 0.001) but not incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P = 0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89–1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88–1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension (P for interaction = 0.90).

Conclusions

The exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension does not appear to affect the relative risk estimates for falls and syncope in antihypertensive trials.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Management of antihypertensive therapy is challenging in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a population often excluded from randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy and adverse events (e.g. falls, syncope), differed among trials that included or excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing blood pressure lowering medications to placebo, or different blood pressure targets on falls or syncope outcomes and cardiovascular events. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect overall in subgroups of trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension and trials that did not exclude patients with orthostatic hypotension, and tested P for interaction. The primary outcome was fall events.

Results

46 trials were included, of which 18 trials excluded orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials did not. The incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in trials that excluded participants with orthostatic hypotension (1.3% versus 6.2%, P < 0.001) but not incidences of falls (4.8% versus 8.8%; P = 0.40) or syncope (1.5% versus 1.8%; P = 0.67). Antihypertensive therapy was not associated with an increased risk of falls in trials that excluded (OR 1.00, 95% CI; 0.89–1.13) or included (OR 1.02, 95% CI; 0.88–1.18) participants with orthostatic hypotension (P for interaction = 0.90).

Conclusions

The exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension does not appear to affect the relative risk estimates for falls and syncope in antihypertensive trials.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166KqmB]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Exclusion of patients with orthostatic hypotension from antihypertensive trials did not alter relative effects of treatment, with respect to falls or syncope. However, clinicians should be cognisant when counselling individuals with orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension, regarding the potential side-effects of antihypertensive therapy, that trials which excluded those with orthostatic hypotension may under-estimate the absolute risk of adverse effects such as symptomatic hypotension and possibly falls/syncope, as event rates were lower in trials that excluded this population.

Results

The systematic search of articles published between 14 April 2020 and 26 May 2022 identified 2,042 records. Following title and abstract screening, 14 were considered potentially relevant. After the application of eligibility criteria to full text review of studies included in the prior meta-analysis by Albrasi et al. and potentially relevant studies identified in the updated search, 46 trials (n = 233,357) were included (eFigure S2). The 46 trials had a mean follow-up duration of 34.9 months, and included 18 trials (n = 97,976) that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension and 28 trials (n = 135,381) that did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension. Characteristics of trials and participants by OH exclusion categories are outlined in Table 1. There was no difference in the mean age of participants by OH exclusion categories. The baseline systolic BP and diastolic BP were similar in both groups. Characteristics of individual trials are outlined in Table 2.

Individual trial characteristics

Antihypertensive treatment and falls events

13 trials (n = 94,222) reported falls, and there were 3,002 falls events during the follow-up. The baseline incidence of falls in the control group was 4.8% in trials that excluded orthostatic hypotension compared with 8.8% in trials which did not exclude participants with orthostatic hypotension (P -value = 0.40) (Figure 1). The association of antihypertensive treatment and falls was similar for trials that excluded those with orthostatic hypotension (OR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89–1.13) and trials which did not exclude those with orthostatic hypotension (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88–1.18) (P -interaction = 0.90) (Figure 2).

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114Xmwv]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines. The meta-analysis was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO identifier: CRD42022337669).

Data sources and search strategy

To reduce research waste, we extracted data from a recent meta-analysis of antihypertensive therapy by Albrasi et al. which we considered of sufficiently high quality. We limited our search to dates not included in this review (14 April 2020 onwards). We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases from 14 April 2020 to 26 May 2022. The search terms included are outlined in the Supplementary Appendix (eMethods I). Two reviewers (CR and RM) screened titles and abstracts using the Rayyan web application. The reference lists of included studies were also reviewed. Full texts of remaining articles (and where applicablerecords) were independently assessed by two reviewers (CR and RM), with eligibility based on the pre-determined criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, where a resolution was not reached by discussion, a consensus was reached through a third reviewer (MOD).

Eligibility criteria

Studies were considered eligible if they were (i) randomised controlled trials, (ii) included adults greater than 18 years, (iii) evaluated antihypertensives compared with placebo, combination of antihypertensive agents compared to fewer antihypertensives, or higher compared to lower blood pressure targets, (iv) reported at least one of the following adverse events; falls, syncope, fracture, orthostatic hypotension or hypotension, and (v) had at least 650 patient years of follow-up. Similar to the prior search by Albasri et al. we specified an a priori limit on patient years of follow-up to ensure that included studies were large enough to accrue outcome events.

Data extraction

Data were extracted independently by two authors (CR and CH) using a standardised pre-determined data collection form. For each study, we extracted the title, year of publication, follow-up duration, antihypertensive regime/agent/target, intervention and control participant numbers, inclusion/exclusion of orthostatic hypotension (and criterion applied), baseline blood pressure, falls, syncope, fracture, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension events, primary outcome of individual studies, and all-cause mortality. Data were compared for inconsistencies and merged into a pre-final dataset which was checked independently by a third reviewer (RM).

Limitations of our study

This study has a number of limitations. First, the definition of orthostatic hypotension differed between trials with some studies (e.g. SPRINT) employing a systematic exclusion criterion at screening, whereas other studies excluded participants based on a patient-reported history of orthostatic hypotension. Both methods may be prone to misclassification, given the challenges in reproducibility of blood pressure measurements in orthostatic hypotension. Trials that excluded patients due to symptomatic hypotension were combined with trials that excluded patients with orthostatic hypotension, due to the low incidence of orthostatic hypotension in these trials. Secondly, as this review focused on adverse events, findings may be confounded by the selective outcome reporting bias. Thirdly, we limited our search to large randomised controlled trials that reported pre-specified adverse events. Finally, this study did not include patient and public involvement that may have provided valuable insights.

### Orthostatic hypotension in adults with hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1121VX2b]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Although orthostatic hypotension (OH) has long been recognized as a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction, a growing body of literature has identified OH as a common comorbidity of hypertension. This connection is complex, related to pathophysiology in blood pressure regulation and the manner by which OH is derived as the difference between 2 blood pressure measurements. While traditional therapeutic approaches to OH among patients with neurodegenerative disorders focus on increasing upright blood pressure to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion, the management of OH among patients with hypertension is more nuanced; resting hypertension is itself associated with adverse outcomes among these patients. Although there is substantial evidence that intensive blood pressure treatment does not cause OH in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, some classes of antihypertensive agents may unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic impairment. Practical steps to manage OH among adults with hypertension start with (1) a thorough characterization of its patterns, triggers, and cause; (2) review and removal of aggravating factors (often pharmacological agents not related to hypertension treatment); (3) optimization of an antihypertensive regimen; and (4) adoption of a tailored treatment strategy that avoids exacerbating hypertension. These strategies include countermaneuvers and short-acting vasoactive agents (midodrine, droxidopa). Ultimately, further research is needed on the epidemiology of OH, the impact of hypertension treatment on OH, approaches to the screening and diagnosis of OH, and OH treatment among adults with hypertension to improve the care of these patients and their complex blood pressure pathophysiology.

### Morbidity and mortality of orthostatic hypotension: implications for management of cardiovascular disease [^115FLRn5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is the failure of cardiovascular reflexes to maintain blood pressure on standing from a supine or sitting position. Although OH may cause symptoms of dizziness or syncope, asymptomatic OH (AOH) is far more common and is an independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prevalence of AOH increases with age, the presence of hypertension or diabetes and the use of antihypertensive or other medications. The implications of AOH for the treatment of CVD and hypertension are not well defined. This review provides an overview of the current information on this topic and recommends the more frequent assessment of OH in clinical practice and in future clinical trials.

### Orthostatic hypotension in hypertensive adults: harry goldblatt award for early career investigators 2021 [^116gunid]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension affects roughly 10% of individuals with hypertension and is associated with several adverse health outcomes, including dementia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and death. Among adults with hypertension, orthostatic hypotension has also been shown to predict patterns of blood pressure dysregulation that may not be appreciated in the office setting, including nocturnal nondipping. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension are at particular risk of orthostatic hypotension and may meet diagnostic criteria for the condition with a smaller relative reduction in blood pressure compared with normotensive individuals. Antihypertensive medications are commonly de-prescribed to address orthostatic hypotension; however, this approach may worsen supine or seated hypertension, which may be an important driver of adverse events in this population. There is significant variability between guidelines for the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension with regards to timing and position of blood pressure measurements. Clinically relevant orthostatic hypotension may be missed when standing measurements are delayed or when taken after a seated rather than supine position. The treatment of orthostatic hypotension in patients with hypertension poses a significant management challenge for clinicians; however, recent evidence suggests that intensive blood pressure control may reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension. A detailed characterization of blood pressure variability is essential to tailoring a treatment plan and can be accomplished using both in-office and out-of-office monitoring.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116iWimA]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to switch BP-lowering medications worsening orthostatic hypotension to an alternative BP-lowering therapy and do not simply de-intensify therapy for the management of orthostatic hypotension in patients with supine HTN.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117EdaHs]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To date, little published literature is available on a "standardized approach" to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition. The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used, but not approved, for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### New horizons in orthostatic hypotension [^113XPiuX]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common disabling condition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Much of the evidence available is derived from younger populations with chronic neurological disease leading to uncertainty for the diagnosis and management of older people.

Objective

to provide an overview of recent and emerging evidence for the diagnosis, management and prognosis of OH in older persons.

Methods

a narrative review of recent studies, emerging therapies and relevant regulatory updates.

Findings

revisions to the diagnostic criteria for OH include the duration of the blood pressure drop, specific criteria for initial and delayed OH and OH with hypertension. Non-drug therapies remain the first-line treatment option and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment appears to result in lower rates of OH. Recent evidence concerning withdrawal of causative medication is inconsistent. Midodrine has recently become the only licenced medication for OH in the UK. Other emerging treatments include atomoxetine and droxidopa but these require further evaluation. Many other agents may be used but are not supported by high-quality evidence. The increase in mortality associated with OH is less apparent in older people.

Summary

OH remains common in older people, the new diagnostic criteria address some of the previous uncertainty but evidence concerning withdrawal of antihypertensives is conflicting. Midodrine is now the only licenced medication for OH in the UK, but non-drug therapies remain first line and fludrocortisone may be considered before midodrine. We may see other agents such as droxidopa becoming increasingly used over the coming years.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113fpocK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH).

Purpose

To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

5 trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

Limitations

Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available.

Conclusion

Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH. Orthostatic hypotension, before or in the setting of more intensive BP treatment, should not be viewed as a reason to avoid or de-escalate treatment for hypertension.

### Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension treatment, and cardiovascular disease: an individual participant meta-analysis [^117TEE2q]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are ongoing concerns about the benefits of intensive vs standard blood pressure (BP) treatment among adults with orthostatic hypotension or standing hypotension.

Objective

To determine the effect of a lower BP treatment goal or active therapy vs a standard BP treatment goal or placebo on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or all-cause mortality in strata of baseline orthostatic hypotension or baseline standing hypotension.

Data Sources

Individual participant data meta-analysis based on a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases through May 13, 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) with orthostatic hypotension assessments.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual participant data meta-analysis extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Effects were determined using Cox proportional hazard models using a single-stage approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were CVD or all-cause mortality. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of at least 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg after changing position from sitting to standing. Standing hypotension was defined as a standing systolic BP of 110 mm Hg or less or standing diastolic BP of 60 mm Hg or less.

Results

The 9 trials included 29 235 participants followed up for a median of 4 years (mean age, 69.0 [SD, 10.9] years; 48% women). There were 9% with orthostatic hypotension and 5% with standing hypotension at baseline. More intensive BP treatment or active therapy lowered risk of CVD or all-cause mortality among those without baseline orthostatic hypotension (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76–0.86) similarly to those with baseline orthostatic hypotension (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–1.00; P = 0.68 for interaction of treatment with baseline orthostatic hypotension). More intensive BP treatment or active therapy lowered risk of CVD or all-cause mortality among those without baseline standing hypotension (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75–0.85), and nonsignificantly among those with baseline standing hypotension (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75–1.18). Effects did not differ by baseline standing hypotension (P = 0.16 for interaction of treatment with baseline standing hypotension).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population of hypertension trial participants, intensive therapy reduced risk of CVD or all-cause mortality regardless of orthostatic hypotension without evidence for different effects among those with standing hypotension.

Treating nOH

Once a patient is diagnosed with nOH, the goal of treatment should not be to normalize standing blood pressure, but the principal treatment goals should serve to reduce the burden of symptoms (especially falls), prolong standing time, and improve the physical capabilities of the patient to restore independence in activities of daily living. A treatment algorithm for nOH that encompasses a 4-step hierarchical process is proposed (Fig. 2): (1) assessing and adjusting pre-existing medications, (2) utilizing non-pharmacologic approaches, (3) implementing single-agent pharmacologic treatment, and (4) with great caution, combining pharmacologic treatments. At each step, it is recommended that the patient undergo a 2-week assessment to establish whether sufficient symptomatic benefit has been achieved before moving onto successive steps. Each facet of the algorithm is described in detail below.

Fig. 2
A 4-step process for treating nOH

Treating nOH — step 1: review and adjust current medications

After establishment of a diagnosis of symptomatic nOH, it is imperative to first consider pharmacologic simplification by reducing or discontinuing medication that exacerbate nOH. One of the keys to initial success is to complete a comprehensive medication review so that adjustments in regimens can be made as needed. Many medications (including those commonly used for treatment of PD, hypertension, or bladder symptoms) can lower blood pressure and exacerbate the symptoms of nOH (Table 3). Discontinuation or dose reduction of medications which can potentially aggravate orthostatic symptoms such as diuretics, vasodilators, and medications with negative chronotropic properties such as beta blockers may be sufficient to resolve symptoms of nOH in some patients.

Once a medication review has been conducted, it is recommended that any planned changes be discussed with the prescribing clinician such as: taking the patient off a particular drug, lowering current doses, or changing the dosing schedule. While there is limited published literature supporting this recommendation there is strong expert opinion underlying this approach. Following each adjustment to medication, changes to symptoms of nOH should be assessed, and this can be accomplished by asking the patient to respond to the screening questions listed in Table 1.

### Orthostatic hypotension: management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^115w65E6]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common, often overlooked, disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, approach to arrive at an appropriate underlying diagnosis that is causing OH, treating accompanying conditions, and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. We propose a novel streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH; review the relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH; discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage; provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision making and patient care; identify current gaps in knowledge and try to define future research directions. Using a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented highlighting various presentations of OH to provide a practical guide to evaluate and manage patients who have OH.

### Management… [^113FTKnQ]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

|Psychoactive medications: antipsychotics, sedative hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants| Antihypertensives can exacerbate orthostatic hypotension symptoms because they reduce intravascular volume, trigger vasodilation, and have negative chronotropic effects. 22, 24 Nighttime dosing of antihypertensives should be considered to reduce orthostatic hypotension symptoms. 22, 24, 49 Use of a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor may be helpful in guiding this decision. 22, 45, 49. Midodrine, a short-acting alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that acts via vasoconstriction, has been shown to alleviate symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and elevate blood pressure in multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials. 56 Midodrine can cause supine hypertension and should be avoided within three to five hours of bedtime. 2, 22, 24, 66 Other common adverse effects include piloerection, scalp itching, and urinary retention.

2, 22, 24, 64, 66 Droxidopa, a short-acting norepinephrine precursor, is another first-line medication approved by the U. S. Food and Drug administration for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Based on validated symptom scores, this medication increases standing systolic blood pressure and alleviates orthostatic hypotension symptoms. 2, 24, 59, 66 Droxidopa should also be avoided before bedtime because it can cause supine hypertension. 2, 24, 59 The most common adverse effects are headaches and nausea. Falls, dizziness, and urinary tract infections have also been reported. 65 Patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension secondary to Parkinson disease who are treated with droxidopa have a reduced risk of falls.

### Orthostatic hypotension in a cohort of hypertensive patients referring to a hypertension clinic [^111xYkNw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in hypertensive patients ranges from 3 to 26%. Drugs are a common cause of non-neurogenic OH. In the present study, we retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 9242 patients with essential hypertension referred to our Hypertension Unit. We analysed data on supine and standing blood pressure values, age, sex, severity of hypertension and therapeutic associations of drugs, commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. OH was present in 957 patients (10.4%). Drug combinations including α-blockers, centrally acting drugs, non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers and diuretics were associated with OH. These pharmacological associations must be administered with caution, especially in hypertensive patients at high risk of OH (elderly or with severe and uncontrolled hypertension). Angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) seems to be not related with OH and may have a potential protective effect on the development of OH.

### Orthostatic hypotension in the hypertensive patient [^117EUNHa]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is an important and common medical problem, particularly in the frail elderly with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. OH is an independent risk factor for falls and overall mortality. Hypertension is among the most common comorbidities associated with OH, and its presence complicates the management of these patients because treatment of one can worsen the other. However, there is evidence that uncontrolled hypertension worsens OH so that both should be managed. The limited data available suggest that angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers are preferable antihypertensives for these patients. Patients with isolated supine hypertension can be treated with bedtime doses of short-acting antihypertensives. Treatment of OH in the hypertensive patients should focus foremost on the removal of drugs that can worsen OH, including ones that are easily overlooked, such as tamsulosin, tizanidine, sildenafil, trazodone, and carvedilol. OH and postprandial hypotension can be prevented with abdominal binders and acarbose, respectively, without the need to increase baseline blood pressure. Upright blood pressure can be improved by harnessing residual sympathetic tone with atomoxetine, which blocks norepinephrine reuptake in nerve terminals, and pyridostigmine, which facilitates cholinergic neurotransmission in autonomic ganglia. Oral water bolus acutely but transiently increases blood pressure in autonomic failure patients. If traditional pressor agents are needed, midodrine and droxidopa can be used, administered at the lowest dose and frequency that improves symptoms. Management of OH in the hypertensive patient is challenging, but a management strategy based on understanding the underlying pathophysiology can be effective in most patients.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypertension: individual level meta-analysis [^112RvteD]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our study used a definition of orthostatic hypertension that mirrored the one for orthostatic hypotension, used in previous work. However, discussion is ongoing as to how orthostatic hypertension should be defined. Unlike with orthostatic hypotension, which focuses on changes in blood pressure alone, recent guidelines have advocated for a definition that includes both an increase in systolic blood pressure on standing and an elevated standing threshold (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg). This definition was proposed for a general population, not necessarily a hypertensive population. When we used this definition, the prevalence of orthostatic hypertension was substantially lower in our population. Nevertheless, the effects of treatment were even more pronounced. This is due in part to our observation that antihypertensive agents, particularly the longer acting agents used in many of the trials in our study, lower blood pressure in all body positions. As a result, standing hypertension would also be reduced with more intensive treatment. From the perspective of studying mechanisms of injury related to orthostatic hypertension, we caution against the use of this joint definition as it may make identifying and evaluating treatment response to the rise in blood pressure, which itself may be pathologic and occur below the 140 mm Hg threshold, more difficult. Some authors have also questioned whether diastolic blood pressure should be included in definitions of orthostatic hypertension, as diastolic blood pressure usually increases with standing. However, given that systolic and diastolic blood pressure are known to be correlated in both seated and standing positions, their change would be expected to correlate as well, and thus some patients with a rise in diastolic blood pressure would also have a rise in systolic blood pressure. Whether thresholds of change in systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure are optimal for identifying risk with cardiovascular disease should be the focus of subsequent work. Nevertheless, the effects of treatment on orthostatic increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as defined in this study, using thresholds that mirrored those for orthostatic hypotension, were quite consistent.

We did not identify compelling evidence that the effects of treatment differed by demographic or medical characteristics. Although a strong interaction between black and non-black populations was apparent, this information was not uniformly collected by trials outside of the US, reducing our sample for this analysis. We also observed that effects were attenuated among adults with diabetes. Mechanisms are beyond the scope of this study, but we speculate that this lack of effects among black adults and those with diabetes may reflect known challenges in achieving blood pressure control. Additional research should probe these associations further.

### Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic disorders in the hypertension clinic [^1151Afwy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertension specialists are consulted regarding orthostatic hypotension (OH) or the combination of OH with supine hypertension. These clinical presentations are often associated with a variety of underlying autonomic disorders. A comprehensive medical history and clinical examination with attention to autonomic signs and the neurological system may suggest the possible etiology or a differential diagnosis. At times, drug therapy for hypertension or other diseases such as Parkinson's is temporally associated with the onset of OH. At other times, no definitive association can be made. Most hypertension specialists can initiate basic evaluation and treatment. Treatment approaches to OH must be targeted primarily to alleviate symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion and also be cognizant of supine hypertension. Several lifestyle and drug therapies can ameliorate symptoms of OH. Short-acting antihypertensive therapy may be useful in controlling nocturnal supine hypertension.

### Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension and associated factors among older people with hypertension in Northern Ethiopia [^114DPCJ5]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease, with a global prevalence of approximately 1.3 billion, with the vast majority of these people(82%) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hypertension is a common problem in older adults, reaching a prevalence of 70 to 80% in high- income countries (HICs). Orthostatic hypotension (OH) commonly occurs in patients taking antihypertensive medications. OH has been defined as a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg, when assuming a standing position or during a head-up tilt test of at least 60 o. OH occurs when either cardiac output is reduced, the vasoconstrictor response is insufficient, or both. Causes of OH can be classified as neurogenic or non-neurogenic, with patients exhibiting either symptomatic or asymptomatic presentations. Common symptoms include lightheadedness, weakness, difficulty concentrating, blurred vision, pre-syncope, syncope, falls, and headache.

Several risk factors have been identified for the development of OH. Medications such as antihypertensive drugs, antidepressants, any potential cause of dehydration or hypovolemia, and relevant comorbidities such as Parkinson disease, and diabetes mellitus are all factors that can be associated with OH. Aging itself, even in a relatively healthy person is associated with a significant increased risk of OH with prevalence rates in older population ranging from 6 to 35% in high income countries. OH in this population can result from any or combination of normal age-related changes, comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, renal, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as medications used to treat these conditions.

OH has been associated with all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, transient ischemic attack, and stroke. OH can significantly reduce quality of life and increase the risk of fall and subsequent fractures. There is not always an effective treatment for OH, but managing factors like medications, dehydration, patient education, early recognition, fall prevention, avoiding triggers, and increasing salt and water intake can often help.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^114faSc3]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations for initiating nOH treatment

There have been no head-to-head comparison studies to guide the initial choice of nOH treatments. An individualized treatment regimen should consider severity, co-morbid disease (especially cardiac or renal failure), and treatment goals. Midodrine has an FDA-approved indication for the treatment of symptomatic OH; FDA approval was based on studies showing an improvement in upright blood pressure as a surrogate for symptom relief. In contrast, the FDA-approved droxidopa with an orphan designation for the treatment of nOH based on studies showing improvement in symptoms of nOH. Patients receiving droxidopa reported a decrease in dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling as if they might black out compared with those receiving placebo. There have been no long-term studies on the durability of the treatment effect for either midodrine or droxidopa. However, a long-term study is underway to study durability of effectiveness with droxidopa (NCT02586623) in patients with nOH for up to 36 weeks of treatment.

Recommendations for changing nOH treatment

Once initial therapy has begun, symptomatic benefit, including impact on activities of daily living, and changes in blood pressure need to be assessed frequently. If symptoms do not improve after reaching maximum labeled dose, it is recommended that the treatment be changed and symptomatic benefit be assessed once more. This process is iterative until either symptomatic benefit is achieved or maximum tolerable dose of the therapy is reached.

Treating nOH — step 4: combination pharmacotherapy

Little data exists to determine efficacy and safety of different combinations of therapy compared to monotherapy for nOH. Based on the experience of the consensus panel, the recommendation is to appropriately titrate to maximum tolerable dose of a single agent and then, if symptomatic benefit is not obtained, consider switching to a different therapy or adding a second agent and titrate from its lowest starting dose.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) epidemiology and treatment intensity — OH affects an estimated 7% to 10% of community-dwelling adults with hypertension, and institutionalized older adults (age ≥ 65 years) have a much higher prevalence; despite concerns about intensive BP treatment, evidence from randomized clinical trials demonstrates no association between OH and intensive BP treatment using first-line antihypertensive medication classes; because antihypertensive agents may sometimes unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic or other impairment, thoughtful assessment is warranted.

### Orthostatic hypotension, cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events: results from SPRINT [^115WqAa5]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is frequently observed with hypertension treatment, but its contribution to adverse outcomes is unknown. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) was a randomized trial of adults, age ≥ 50 years at high risk for cardiovascular disease with a seated systolic blood pressure (BP) of 130 to 180 mm Hg and a standing systolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to a systolic BP treatment goal of either < 120 or < 140 mm Hg. OH was defined as a drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg 1 minute after standing from a seated position. We used Cox models to examine the association of OH with cardiovascular disease or adverse study events by randomized BP goal. During the follow-up period (median 3years), there were 1170 (5.7%) instances of OH among those assigned a standard BP goal and 1057 (5.0%) among those assigned the intensive BP goal. OH was not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome: hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78–1.44]). Moreover, OH was not associated with syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, or acute renal failure. OH was associated with hypotension-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits (hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.11–2.82]) and bradycardia (hazard ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.19–3.15]), but these associations did not differ by BP treatment goal. OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, and BP treatment goal had no effect on OH's association with hypotension and bradycardia. Symptomless OH during hypertension treatment should not be viewed as a reason to down-titrate therapy even in the setting of a lower BP goal.

### Benefits and risks of antihypertensive medications in the elderly [^1118pTmi]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is highly prevalent in older age and accounts for a large proportion of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality worldwide. Isolated systolic hypertension is more common in the elderly than younger adults and associated with poor outcomes such as cerebrovascular disease and acute coronary events. International guidelines are inconsistent in providing recommendations on optimal blood pressure targets in hypertensive elderly patients as a result of the limited evidence in this population. Evidence from clinical trials supports the use of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive elderly patients due to benefits in reducing CV disease and mortality. However, elderly participants in these trials may not be typical of elderly patients seen in routine clinical practice, and the potential risks associated with use of antihypertensive drugs in the elderly are not as well studied as younger participants. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive summary of the benefits and risks of the use of antihypertensive drugs in elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years), highlighting landmark clinical trials and observational studies. We will focus on specific outcomes relating to the benefits and risks of these medications in hypertensive elderly patients, such as CV disease, cognitive decline, dementia, orthostatic hypotension, falls, fractures, cancer and diabetes, in order to provide an update of the most relevant and current evidence to help inform clinical decision-making.

### Management of hypertension in older persons [^111dvKAv]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in older patients with elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressures. This benefit appears to persist in patients older than 80 years, but less than one third of older patients have adequate blood pressure control. Systolic blood pressure is the most important predictor of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure measurement in older persons should include an evaluation for orthostatic hypotension. Low-dose thiazide diuretics remain first-line therapy for older patients. Beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are second-line medications that should be selected based on comorbidities and risk factors.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension associated with nOH

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both nOH and supine hypertension and the associated risks of each when they manage patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is associated with loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically have nOH and supine hypertension. In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Because OH/nOH and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension. There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some clinicians may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-PD patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made in multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

Limitations and strengths of study

Our study has limitations. Firstly, we identified only nine trials, which differed with respect to their interventions, frequency of follow-up, duration, blood pressure measurement procedures, and study populations. These differences might have influenced our results. Despite these differences, our findings were relatively consistent and our sample was sufficiently large that additional trials are not likely to alter our pooled observation. Secondly, generalizability to clinical practice may be limited owing to the strict entry criteria used by these trials, differences in prescribing regimens that might not reflect real world drug choices, and careful monitoring and drug titration protocols that may affect titration patterns. Thirdly, subgroup analyses relied on covariate definitions that were based on self-report and at times differed in definition across studies. Any resulting misclassification could weaken contrasts across subgroups, reducing our ability to detect differences. Moreover, we pre-specified our subgroups. Whether associations might differ across different categories (for example, younger age) should be examined in dedicated studies. Fourthly, we did not examine antihypertensive drug class in this study, which should be a focus of subsequent work. Fifthly, assessments of orthostatic hypertension were based on seated-to-standing protocols, which may not be interchangeable with supine-to-standing maneuvers. In the case of orthostatic hypotension, some authors have proposed modified thresholds for identifying adults with orthostatic hypotension (that is, a drop in systolic blood pressure of 15 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 7 mm Hg). In our own work, we have observed a net increase in blood pressure with standing from the seated position. Thus, whether a seated-to-standing protocol should have a higher or lower threshold compared with supine-to-standing to establish orthostatic hypertension remains unclear. Moreover, aside from SYST-EUR, none of the major outcome trials examined in our study measured supine blood pressure. The manner by which starting position might underestimate or overestimate orthostatic hypertension should be the focus of future work. Sixthly, although both lower treatment goals and active therapy lowered the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension, the effect of active therapy was greater in magnitude. Whether different goals might alter the observed effect is beyond the scope of this study. Seventhly, temporal effects of treatment on orthostatic hypertension should be interpreted cautiously, as different populations contributed to visits at different time points. We attempted to include all available data to preserve the trials' randomized contrasts. However, as some trials (for example, ACCORD) assessed orthostatic blood pressure after starting, some of these participants did not have a pre-randomization assessment, which could influence estimates of orthostatic hypertension at baseline. This would not affect the pooled contrast overall but could affect the proportion with orthostatic hypertension over time. Finally, our analysis did not examine the effects of treatment on clinical events among adults with orthostatic hypertension. This has been questioned in previous work and represents an important focus for subsequent research.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) considerations during intensive BP treatment: In trials assessing intensive BP control, there was no evidence for harm among those with standing hypotension (SBP < 110 mm Hg). In a post-hoc NAILED study analysis, the population (n = 814, 35% experiencing OH at least once) showed that intensification of BP control was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or death in this stroke/TIA population. Systematic titration of antihypertensive treatment did not increase the prevalence of OH compared with usual care, and there is emerging evidence that OH does not reduce the gains of intensive antihypertensive treatment. For practice, an assessment for OH in symptomatic patients, particularly after initiation of treatment or adding a new class of antihypertensive medication, is acceptable to detect unmasked autonomic system dysfunction or other acute or chronic conditions.

Orthostatic hypotension is a common condition among older adults and is associated with a range of deleterious outcomes. Recently, interest has developed in hypovitaminosis D (defined as low 25 hydroxiyvitamin D levels) as a potential risk factor for orthostatic hypotension. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association of orthostatic hypotension between study participants with and without hypovitaminosis D, including the adjustment of potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, renal function, comorbidities, seasonality, use of antihypertensive medications, and supplementation with cholecalciferol).

Methods

A systematic literature search of major electronic databases from inception until 09/2015 was made for articles providing data on orthostatic hypotension and hypovitaminosis D. A random effects meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies investigating orthostatic hypotension prevalence comparing participants with vs. those without hypovitaminosis D was undertaken, calculating the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Of 317 initial hits, five cross-sectional studies were meta-analysed including 3646 participants (1270 with hypovitaminosis D and 2376 without). The participants with hypovitaminosis D had a higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.25–2.84; I = 68%) that was not affected by adjusting for a median of five potential confounders (OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.13–3.68; I = 73%). People with orthostatic hypotension had significantly reduced serum vitamin D concentrations (standardized mean difference = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.12). One longitudinal study confirmed the association between hypovitaminosis D and orthostatic hypotension.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis highlights that hypovitaminosis D is associated with orthostatic hypotension, independent of potential confounders. Further longitudinal studies and clinical trials are required to confirm these findings.

Assessing nOH treatment success

Assessment of treatment success needs to be a multifaceted approach involving predominantly the measurement of symptomatic improvements as well as ongoing blood pressure measurements. It is critical that patients are educated on the various symptoms and about how to keep a diary of symptoms. Similarly, it is necessary for the patient to conduct a period of home monitoring of blood pressure after implementing new or additional non-pharmacologic measures or after a change in treatment or dose. We recommend that patients check their blood pressures at home in the supine head-up position (at bedtime, prior to arising in the morning, and while the patient is in their normal head-up sleeping position). Patients taking pressor medications such as midodrine or droxidopa should avoid the supine position during the 4–5 h after taking medication), and check blood pressure after 3 min of standing. We recommend checking blood pressures first thing in the morning prior to taking any morning medications, when symptomatic, and at bedtime for several days. The blood pressure diary should be evaluated by the healthcare provider 2 weeks after any therapeutic change to determine the need for further adjustments. (An example patient diary for blood pressure and heart rate monitoring is provided in Appendix I). If blood pressure measurements have been stable, a reduction in monitoring frequency can be considered, but reinstituted if symptoms worsen or if medications are changed. Lastly, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be considered so that there is an ongoing record of the impact of treatment on blood pressure. Additional clinical assessments will be largely driven by symptom frequency and severity. However, re-assessment of the clinical condition should occur at every visit via symptom review and orthostatic blood pressure measurements.

Referring the nOH patient

With appropriate education, the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH are well within the purview of both primary and specialist clinicians. With a diagnosis of nOH, the clinician can assign an OH severity Grade based on blood pressure changes, symptoms, and impact on activities of daily living. Once diagnosis is established, the clinician can take the patient through steps 1, 2, and 3 of the treatment algorithm. However, if the patient experiences pharmacotherapy failure, it may be useful to refer the patient to a specialist who is experienced in treating patients with nOH. Additionally, if the clinician is at any time uncomfortable with treating a patient with nOH of high severity (Grades 3 to 4), they should refer the patient to a specialist with expertise in the treatment of nOH.

### Acceptability of non-drug therapies in older people with orthostatic hypotension: a qualitative study [^113Ymp6o]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) results from a sustained reduction in blood pressure (BP, ≥ 20 mmHg systolic or ≥ 10 mmHg diastolic) within 3 min of standing. It is highly prevalent in the older population, affecting up to 20% of community-dwelling older people. It is a disabling condition, resulting in reduced quality of life and an increased risk of cognitive impairment and death. Much of the evidence to support existing treatment options for OH is of poor quality and largely based on cohorts with autonomic failure, creating uncertainty for its management in older populations. Non-drug treatments are recommended as first line therapy and older people have a preference for these therapies over pharmacologic agents due to their existing medication burden. However, non-drug interventions are often more complex to deliver, have lower levels of adherence and the evidence for their use is scanty at best.

As the older population is rapidly expanding we can expect a growing demand for evidence in this area. However, if an intervention is deemed unacceptable, its effectiveness becomes irrelevant.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants are presented here along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with the primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### Management of orthostatic hypotension in the hospitalized patient: a narrative review [^1145X5yH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a frequent cause of falls and syncope, impairing quality of life. It is an independent risk factor of mortality and a common cause of hospitalizations, which exponentially increases in the geriatric population. We present a management plan based on a systematic literature review and understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and relevant clinical pharmacology. Initial treatment measures include removing offending medications and avoiding large meals. Clinical assessment of the patients' residual sympathetic tone can aid in the selection of initial therapy between norepinephrine "enhancers" or "replacers". Role of splanchnic venous pooling is overlooked, and applying abdominal binders to improve venous return may be effective. The treatment goal is not normalizing upright blood pressure but increasing it above the cerebral autoregulation threshold required to improve symptoms. Hypertension is the most common associated comorbidity, and confining patients to bed while using pressor agents only increases supine blood pressure, leading to worsening pressure diuresis and orthostatic hypotension. Avoiding bedrest deconditioning and using pressors as part of an orthostatic rehab program are crucial in reducing hospital stay.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) prevalence and treatment safety — OH "affects an estimated 7% to 10% of community-dwelling adults with hypertension, especially older adults", and "Institutionalized older adults (age ≥ 65 years) have a much higher prevalence of OH and are not included in the scope of these recommendations, nor are persons with neurologic etiologies of OH, such as Parkinson disease and other autonomic neuropathies". Although "OH is also associated with antihypertensive medication and specific classes of medication use", evidence from RCTs shows "no association between OH and intensive BP treatment using first-line antihypertensive medication classes", and "Because antihypertensive agents may sometimes unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic or other impairment, thoughtful assessment is warranted".

### Clinostatic hypertension and orthostatic hypotension [^115z8urw]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The association of clinostatic hypertension (CH) and orthostatic hypotension (OH) is described as the "Hyp-Hyp phenomenon", and it has been found in about 5.5% of hypertensive patients and in up to 50% of patients with OH. The importance of CH/OH in clinical practice is mainly due to the presence of troublesome symptoms, end-organ damage, and difficulties in its clinical management.

Hypothesis

The review focuses on the clinical problem of CH and review the international literature for the best management, including the diagnostic work-up and the taylored treatment for this kind of patients.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was conducted through MEDLINE research to focus the main controversial issues about CH/OH. Included topics: (1) the diagnostic work-up, (2) the association with dysautonomic failure and syncope, and (3) the treatment options and prevention of end-organ damage.

Results

Current standard reference for OH diagnosis includes functional assessment of the cardiac vagal nervous system and the sympathetic adrenergic system. The association with dysautonomic failure and with syncope needs further investigation. Pharmacologic treatment of OH is aimed at controlling symptoms rather than restoring normotension. Midodrine is the only medication that has been put to multicenter placebo-controlled trial and subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OH treatment. Short-acting oral antihypertensive agents at bedtime should be considered in patients with severe, sustained CH.

Conclusions

Data obtained from the literature review showed that clinical diagnosis of the Hyp-Hyp phenomenon is relatively simple, but it remains more difficult to establish the causal disease. In our opinion, it is advisable to define simple diagnostic standards for the selection of patients at risk of dysautonomic impairment so that a subsequent highly specific diagnostic work-up could be initiated.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in haemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies, and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualised, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (eg, counterpressure manoeuvres), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

At-home monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate

In addition to in-clinic blood pressure monitoring, patients should be asked to check their blood pressure and heart rate at home and record the values in a diary. We recommend that patients or their caregivers check blood pressures at home in the supine position (at least 15 min after laying down at bedtime or prior to arising from bed in the morning) and after 3 min of standing (with assistance as necessary) after arising from bed in the morning. The following timings are our recommendations for at-home blood pressures and heart rate monitoring: (1) first thing in the morning before taking morning medications, (2) when a patient feels symptomatic, and (3) at bedtime for several days. We recommend that patients keep a blood pressure and heart rate diary for at least 7 days preceding a clinic visit, but after having a clinic visit patients should not need to measure blood pressure and heart rate on a continuous daily basis unless a change in therapy occurs. With any change in therapy, an additional week of blood pressure monitoring is required to determine the effectiveness of the change. (An example patient diary for blood pressure and heart rate is provided in Appendix I.)

Medication review

There are numerous medications that can diminish the normal compensatory postural increase in heart rate, (e.g. beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, combined beta-/alpha-blockers such as carvedilol, central alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine or guanfacine, and antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone).

### Antihypertensive therapy and orthostatic hemodynamic responses in acute stroke [^112SHRDm]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It is not known whether antihypertensive medications affect orthostatic blood pressure (BP) regulation in the early period after stroke. Knowledge of this may have implications for clinical practice.

Methods

A total of 40 acute ischemic stroke patients (mild-to-moderate severity) taking antihypertensive drugs, and 40 patients with acute stroke of similar severity not receiving such drugs were studied. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured while supine, and then for 5 min while sitting up and for 5 min in the standing posture. This was performed ≤ 3 days poststroke (day 1) and 1 week after the first study (week 1).

Results

In both groups of patients on day 1 and week 1, there was no significant fall in mean arterial pressure and heart rate after sitting up and standing up. Logistic regression analysis showed that only cardiac dysfunction was associated with orthostatic hypotension on univariate analysis (odds ratio 4.0, P = 0.02) and multivariate analysis when age, hypertension, stroke severity, and treatment were included (odds ratio 3.5, P = 0.05). Use of antihypertensive therapy was not associated with orthostatic hypotension on univariate or multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Use of antihypertensive drugs in the early period poststroke is not detrimental to postural BP regulation. Antihypertensive therapy may therefore be used when indicated in acute stroke, without having to restrict early mobilization; but the results cannot be extrapolated to the postacute phase.

### Effects of antihypertensive class on falls, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension in older adults: the ALLHAT trial [^115983Vy]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension treatment has been implicated in falls, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension (OH), common events among older adults. Whether the choice of antihypertensive agent influences the risk of falls, syncope, and OH in older adults is unknown. ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) was a randomized clinical trial that compared the effects of hypertension first-step therapy on fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction (1994–2002). In a subpopulation of ALLHAT participants, age 65 years and older, we determined the relative risk of falls, syncope, OH, or a composite based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Veterans Affairs claims, using Cox regression. We also determined the adjusted association of self-reported atenolol use (ascertained at the 1-month visit for indications other than hypertension) on outcomes in Cox models adjusted for age, sex, and race. Among 23964 participants (mean age 69.8 ± 6.8 years, 45% women, 31% non-Hispanic black) followed for a mean of 4.9 years, we identified 267 falls, 755 syncopes, 249 OH, and 1157 composite claims. There were no significant differences in the cumulative incidences of events across randomized drug assignments. However, amlodipine increased risk of falls during the first year of follow-up compared with chlorthalidone (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 2.24 [1.06–4.74]; P = 0.03) or lisinopril (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 2.61 [1.03–6.72]; P = 0.04). Atenolol use (N = 928) was not associated with any of the 3 individual or composite claims. In older adults, the choice of antihypertensive agent had no effect on risk of fall, syncope, or OH long-term. However, amlodipine increased risk of falls within 1 year of initiation. These short-term findings require confirmation. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00000542.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH

If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should be focused on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Table 2 lists recommended tests to conduct when evaluating a patient for OH/nOH. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc.) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review (as noted above) should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and current medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, clinical scenario and specific presentation need to be considered.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypertension: individual level meta-analysis [^112v3S9b]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of individual participant data from 31 124 adults with elevated blood pressure and hypertension, more intensive treatment (that is, a lower blood pressure treatment goal or active therapy) modestly reduced the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension on the basis of measurements from 315 497 visits. This effect was consistent regardless of trial type or definition of orthostatic hypertension. Moreover, these effects were generally consistent across demographic characteristics and medical comorbidities.

Comparison with other studies

Blood pressure is highly regulated by the autonomic nervous system in healthy adults such that blood pressure remains relatively constant across body positions. Whereas substantial focus has been directed toward falls in blood pressure on standing (that is, orthostatic hypotension), little attention has been given to orthostatic hypertension. Recent epidemiological evidence has identified increases in blood pressure on standing as potentially pathologic, linking orthostatic hypertension with a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney disease, and cognitive impairment. These long term associations with adverse health outcomes contribute to a growing belief that orthostatic hypertension may represent a form of unrecognized or masked hypertension that may require monitoring of adults in the standing position and adjusting drug treatment accordingly.

This study confirms that orthostatic hypertension is common among adults with hypertension, but it also shows that more intensive blood pressure treatment might attenuate orthostatic hypertension over time. This is an important observation. Our previous work showed that more intensive treatment caused a net increase in the difference in blood pressure in response to standing. However, this study suggests that this effect may be short term and dissipate with chronic treatment. This observation, if replicated, may be important for treating clinicians, who might be dissuaded from treating hypertension because of short term orthostatic hypertension. Physiologic mechanisms for this observation are unclear. The short term increase may be secondary to autonomic over-response to valsalva, cardioacceleration after leg muscle contraction, or mobilization of excess lower extremity fluid. In the long term, we speculate that the resolution of orthostatic hypertension may be related to healthy remodeling of the vasculature with tighter blood pressure control. Further study of mechanisms should be evaluated in future work, particularly with repeat standing measurements. This may also be related to measurement error and additionally to more controlled blood pressure in general, such that blood pressure and fluctuation in blood pressure measurement is also lower, reducing risk for orthostatic hypertension.

### Droxidopa for orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116crto9]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the efficacy and safety of droxidopa in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, following its recent approvals in the United States.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Web of Science, ProQuest, and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry were searched. Studies were included if they randomized adults with orthostatic hypotension to droxidopa or to control, and outcomes related to symptoms, daily activity, blood pressure, or adverse events. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Risk of bias was judged against the Cochrane risk of bias tool and quality of evidence measured using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. A fixed-effects model was used for pooled analysis.

Results

Of 224 identified records, four studies met eligibility, with a pooled sample size of 494. Study duration was between 1 and 8 weeks. Droxidopa was effective at reducing dizziness [mean difference -0.97 (95% confidence interval -1.51, -0.42)], overall symptoms [-0.52 (-0.98, -0.06)] and difficulty with activity [-0.86 (-1.34, -0.38)]. Droxidopa was also effective at improving standing SBP [3.9 (0.1, 7.69)]. Rates of adverse events were similar between droxidopa and control groups, including supine hypertension [odds ratio 1.93 (0.87, 4.25)].

Conclusion

Droxidopa is well tolerated and effective at reducing the symptoms associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension without increasing the risk of supine hypertension.

### Orthostatic hypotension: epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment [^115EHL5J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cardiovascular disorder, with or without signs of underlying neurodegenerative disease. OH is diagnosed on the basis of an orthostatic challenge and implies a persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure decrease of at least 20/10 mm Hg upon standing. Its prevalence is age dependent, ranging from 5% in patients < 50 years of age to 30% in those > 70 years of age. OH may complicate treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease; cause disabling symptoms, faints, and traumatic injuries; and substantially reduce quality of life. Despite being largely asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, the presence of OH independently increases mortality and the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, we outline the etiology and prevalence of OH in the general population, summarize its relationship with morbidity and mortality, propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, and delineate current challenges and future perspectives.

### Orthostatic hypotension in genetically related hypertensive and normotensive individuals [^1131cN1q]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Prevalence and determinants of orthostatic hypotension remain largely unexplored in younger individuals without significant burden of chronic diseases.

Methods

We investigated frequency and main associations of impaired orthostatic response in a cohort of 469 middle-aged hypertensive patients and 453 of their normotensive first-degree relatives.

Results

13.4% of hypertensive and 5.5% of normotensive study participants were found to have orthostatic hypotension. In a backward logistic regression the following determinants of orthostatic hypotension were identified: sex [female, odds ratio (OR) 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–5.25, P = 0.022], reduced glomerular filtration rate [OR (per ml/min/1.73 m2) 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99, P = 0.002], systolic [OR (per mmHg) 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.05, P = 0.047] and diastolic blood pressure [OR (per mmHg) 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09, P = 0.033], and antihypertensive treatment (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18–0.93, P = 0.034). In hypertensive patients use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was related to lower orthostatic hypotension frequency. Percentage of orthostatic hypotension-positive patients in the highest blood pressure stratum (≥ 160 mmHg) decreased from 20.2 to 7.6, when diagnostic criteria of orthostatic hypotension were adjusted for mean systolic orthostatic reaction (2 SD value: 30 mmHg). During follow-up (t = 6.6 years) individuals with impaired orthostatic response showed a trend towards increased total mortality (OR 2.16, 95% CI 0.97–4.80, P = 0.06) in a crude model.

Conclusion

Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in hypertensive patients is higher than in their normotensive first-degree relatives. Independently of age, sex, and elevated blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension may be additionally determined by impaired renal function. Antihypertensive treatment seems to protect from orthostatic hypotension, in particular, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertensive patients. The diagnostic criteria of orthostatic hypotension may need adjustment for initial supine systolic blood pressure to increase clinical accuracy. The prognostic value of impaired orthostatic response regarding risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality remains uncertain and requires further studies.

### Efficacy of treatments for orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review [^1128JS1i]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) affects up to 30% of adults over 65 and frequently contributes to falls and syncopal episodes. Current guidelines suggest a wide range of treatments, but systematic reviews of the evidence base for such recommendations are lacking.

Methods

we performed a systematic review to assess the evidence for all non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for OH. Our search included the following databases: MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; and the Cochrane library. We searched grey literature and references from included studies and other reviews. We included randomised, placebo-controlled trials, which measured postural drop as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using pre-specified measures of bias.

Results

overall, 36 trials (21 interventions) were included. We identified a heterogeneous population and a wide variety of study methods, precluding meta-analysis. Most trials were of poor quality with high risk of bias. Changes in postural drop and symptoms were frequently inconsistent. Compression bandages, indomethacin, oxilofrine, potassium chloride and yohimbine improved the postural drop. Several vasoactive drugs-including midodrine and pyridostigmine-improved the standing blood pressure, but overall worsened the postural drop.

Conclusions

many commonly recommended interventions for OH have a limited evidence base supporting their use. High quality, randomised, controlled trials are needed to underpin clinical practice for this condition.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) and antihypertensive treatment — effects and assessment: The impact of OH on the CVD and mortality benefit from intensive BP control in the SPRINT trial found no difference in the risk reduction for CVD or all-cause mortality, regardless of OH status, and no evidence for harm among those with standing hypotension (SBP < 110 mm Hg); a post-hoc analysis of the NAILED study population (n = 814, 35% experiencing OH at least once) showed that intensification of BP control was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or death in this stroke/TIA population, and systematic titration of antihypertensive treatment did not increase the prevalence of OH compared with usual care; assessment for OH prior to initiation of treatment is equitable and an assessment for OH in symptomatic patients, particularly after initiation of treatment or adding a new class of antihypertensive medication, is acceptable to detect unmasked autonomic system dysfunction or other acute or chronic conditions.

Other age-related impairments in BP regulation — Polypharmacy

Medications are the commonest cause of OH-related hospital admission, with multiple medications associated with higher OH risk. A recent meta-analysis found that β-blockers are associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 7.76 for falls, tricyclic antidepressants with OR of 6.3, and α-blockers, antipsychotics and SGLT2 inhibitors also conferring increased risk. No agent for control of hypertension is exempted. Other studies have shown increased risk with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and benzodiazepines.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals. A more complete list of questions to use when screening patients for OH/nOH is presented in Table 1. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered as being at risk for OH/nOH and a more complete evaluation including orthostatic vital signs needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10 "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 min of standing and get better when you sit or lay down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

### Effect of discontinuation of antihypertensive medication on orthostatic hypotension in older persons with mild cognitive impairment: the DANTE study Leiden [^116Latxn]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Background

the relationship between antihypertensive medication and orthostatic hypotension in older persons remains ambiguous, due to conflicting observational evidence and lack of data of clinical trials.

Objective

to assess the effect of discontinuation of antihypertensive medication on orthostatic hypotension in older persons with mild cognitive impairment.

Methods

a total of 162 participants with orthostatic hypotension were selected from the Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Treatment in Elderly people (DANTE) Study. This randomised clinical trial included community-dwelling participants aged ≥ 75 years, with mild cognitive impairment, using antihypertensive medication and without serious cardiovascular disease. Participants were randomised to discontinuation or continuation of antihypertensive treatment (ratio 1:1). Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop of at least 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and/or 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure on standing from a seated position. Outcome was the absence of orthostatic hypotension at 4-month follow-up. Relative risks (RR) were calculated by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

Results

at follow-up, according to intention-to-treat analyses, of the 86 persons assigned to discontinuation of antihypertensive medication, 43 (50%) were free from orthostatic hypotension, compared with 29 (38%) of the 76 persons assigned to continuation of medication [RR 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–1.87); P = 0.13]. Per-protocol analysis showed that recovery from orthostatic hypotension was significantly higher in persons who completely discontinued all antihypertensive medication (61%) compared with the continuation group (38%) [RR 1.60 (95% CI 1.10–2.31); P = 0.01].

Conclusion

in older persons with mild cognitive impairment and orthostatic hypotension receiving antihypertensive medication, discontinuation of antihypertensive medication may increase the probability of recovery from orthostatic hypotension.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113REeYF]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Even this appropriate testing of blood pressure will not identify all patients with OH, since variability in meals, hydration, time of day, and medications can affect the orthostatic change in blood pressure. Additionally, there is a subgroup of patients who manifest symptoms of OH beyond the 3-min interval, defined as delayed OH, which may be a manifestation of early autonomic failure. Further discussion of this group is outside the scope of this paper.

Upon standing from a supine or seated position, healthy, normally volume-replete individuals will typically experience a modest decline in systolic blood pressure (< 10 mmHg), a very slight increase in diastolic blood pressure (approximately 2.5 mmHg) and a modest increase in heart rate (10–20 beats per minute [bpm]). These compensatory changes are induced primarily by augmentation of norepinephrine output by sympathetic autonomic peripheral nerve endings. Measuring the heart rate change from the supine (and/or seated) to standing may aid in differentiating between nOH and OH. If an individual develops OH upon standing, an increase in heart rate of < 15 bpm suggests a diagnosis of nOH. In contrast, individuals with non-neurogenic OH will typically demonstrate an increase in heart rate of > 15 bpm within 3 min of standing. The heart rate information is acquired during the measurement of orthostatic vital signs as described above. It should be noted that without a fall in blood pressure, the heart rate criteria for nOH do not apply. In addition, monitoring of postural heart rate changes for diagnostic purposes requires that there is no confounding medication effect (e.g. beta blockers, alpha–beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers; see below) or intrinsic cardiac rhythm disturbances (e.g. sick sinus syndrome, complete heart block, dependence on a mechanical pacemaker) that prevent a compensatory heart rate increase upon standing. In a similar fashion, volume depletion (e.g. diuretics) in healthy individuals can be associated with OH, but should not be confused with nOH because there will still be an exaggerated increase in heart rate upon standing (≥ 20 bpm) in OH, contrasted with an expected failure to increase heart rate in nOH.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115wkfzb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) are characterized as follows: Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy". Initial combination therapy "is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control", and "in general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that "low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together" reduce BP more than monotherapy "over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". Observational data note that "SPCs have fewer cardiovascular events and all-cause deaths than those on equivalent multiple-pill combination therapy", and in older patients "BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored… because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop". Supportive text also states that, for appropriate candidates, "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence".

Results

Socio-demographic characteristics

A total of 250 older people with hypertension who met our study criteria were approached, and 240 responded positively (response rate = 94.4%). The mean (SD) age of the participants was 68.8 (SD7.1) years with a range of 60–92 years. Just over half of the participants (n = 132 [55.2%]) were female, and the majority (n = 190 [79.8%]) reported urban residency. For the most part, our subjects had low educational attainment, with only 22 (9.2%) participants holding a university diploma and beyond. See Table 1.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypertension: individual level meta-analysis [^114XNA4b]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

This study has notable strengths. Firstly, this systematic review and meta-analysis represents one of the largest data collections of orthostatic hypertension in the context of drug treatment for hypertension. Secondly, doing an individual participant meta-analysis allowed for greater harmonization of data and examination of under-represented subgroups that were not feasible within individual trials. Thirdly, whereas data on orthostatic hypertension have been presented from various trials with respect to outcomes, to our knowledge this is the only patient level meta-analysis of the risk of orthostatic hypertension in treated hypertensive patients. Finally, the associations between treatment and orthostatic hypertension across trials were similar, suggesting that the effects of more intensive hypertension treatment on orthostatic hypertension are quite reproducible.

Implications

Our study potentially has clinical implications. Orthostatic hypertension has received increasing attention as a novel and distinct presentation of hypertension. This carries the suggestion that distinct pharmacologic strategies are needed for its treatment. Some authors have suggested that β blockers may be more effective for treating orthostatic hypertension by blunting the β adrenergic response to standing, and evidence also shows that peripheral α blockers may be effective. However, neither of these classes is preferred for initial treatment of hypertension on the basis of the experience from hypertension outcome trials. Nevertheless, if either is superior to other classes in reducing orthostatic hypertension, it might be of value as add-on therapy in the presence of residual orthostatic hypertension. Although more work is needed to evaluate specific drug classes with respect to orthostatic hypertension, our data provide reassurance that focusing on seated blood pressure control and treating seated hypertension among adults with hypertension can modestly reduce orthostatic hypertension. At this time, no trials are assessing whether treating standing blood pressure levels to some goal provides additional benefit to the traditional seated approach.

Conclusions

In this large, individual participant data meta-analysis of blood pressure treatment trials, more intensive blood pressure treatment, especially with active treatment (versus placebo), modestly reduced the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension regardless of its definition or baseline demographic and medical characteristics. Future research should examine orthostatic hypertension in relation to clinical outcomes as well as whether specific classes of antihypertensive drugs or lower treatment goals might better prevent orthostatic hypertension and its sequelae.

### Insights into the clinical management of the syndrome of supine hypertension – orthostatic hypotension (SH-OH): the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA) [^113ERzmL]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

As in the previous pilot MOH investigation, there was an increasing gradient in baseline SBP across clusters, but only MOH-3 had a mean baseline SBP in the hypertension range (i.e. ≥ 140 mmHg). Indeed, MOH-3 resembles the syndrome of supine hypertension–orthostatic hypotension (SH-OH), as applied to beat-to-beat orthostatic blood pressure data. We agree with previous recommendations that, of all patients with SH‒OH, those who have OI require the most clinical attention. In patients with SH-OH, the avoidance of medications that may exacerbate OH and OI and the judicious use of antihypertensive classes that are less likely to aggravate postural blood pressure changes may be safe and adequate approaches to the treatment of this challenging condition.

Interestingly, antihypertensive types that have shown consistent benefits in the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly (e.g. ACE-i and diuretics, as in the HYVET trial) were not linked with any of our adverse outcomes (i.e. MOH-3, OI, history of faints). Several other studies (e.g. SYST-EUR, CONVINCE, VALUE) have demonstrated the benefits of treating aged hypertensive patients with cardiovascular medications that were not associated with adverse outcomes (e.g. angiotensin receptor antagonists), or seemed even protective (i.e. peripheral CCB) in our study. A Cochrane systematic review established that treating healthy older persons with hypertension is highly efficacious, and that benefits of treatment with low dose diuretics or beta-blockers were clear for persons in their 60s to 70s with either diastolic or systolic hypertension. However, this Cochrane review concluded that differential treatment effects based on patient risk factors, pre-existing cardiovascular disease and competing co-morbidities could not be established from the published trial data. Our study sheds light into the latter limitation and supports the overall conclusion that, in treating older and frailer hypertensive patients, the evidence of benefit does not necessarily have to conflict with the evidence of potential harm.

### Blood pressure lowering with nilvadipine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease does not increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension [^113wrDrR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with mild‐to‐moderate AD, with or without hypertension, 78‐week treatment with 8 mg of the calcium‐channel blocker nilvadipine did not significantly increase the risk of OH, fractures, falls, syncope, and dizziness. We provide evidence that starting or adding a low dose of antihypertensive treatment is safe with respect to OH and clinical outcomes. Trials that are primarily designed to investigate patient‐relevant beneficial as well as adverse outcomes of antihypertensive treatment are required to elicit the full benefit‐to‐risk balance in this quickly growing patient group.

4 Antihypertensive therapy needs to be individualized in cancer patients, given considerations for the effects of cancer and cancer therapies

In addition to adhering to ACC/AHA guidelines, clinicians should be aware that cancer patients are at higher risk for orthostatic hypotension after initiation of antihypertensive medications and may warrant short-interval assessment of symptoms and orthostatic vitals. One can tailor antihypertensive therapy to cancer patients allowing for "sick-day protocol": withholding these medications for 24 to 48 h during symptomatic episodes to prevent risk of volume depletion. Consideration of medication interactions from oncology therapeutics is necessary, including the avoidance of hypertensive agents that are metabolized by cytochrome p450 3A4 (i.e. verapamil and diltiazem) given many cancer therapies also interact with this pathway. The investigators recommend an individualized discussion of goals of care, prognosis, comorbidities, and pain control before antihypertensive therapy initiation and/or modification.

### Risks associated with continuation of potentially inappropriate antihypertensive medications in older adults receiving hemodialysis [^117HPvpx]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence suggests that antihypertensive PIMs may be risky for older adults. Both central alpha agonists and alpha blockers frequently cause orthostatic hypotension which can be exacerbated if relative volume depletion is present after dialysis. Central alpha agonists can also cause sedation. Both hypotension and sedation increase the risk of falls and fall-related complications, including hospitalizations or death. For an older adult starting dialysis, hypotension during dialysis may further increase the risk of falls and injury. Conversely, older adults on dialysis also have an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. There is also a U-shaped association of blood pressure and mortality in dialysis patients. Therefore, the relative risks versus benefits of using antihypertensive PIMs in older adults receiving dialysis is an important unanswered question.

Because hemodialysis can impact blood pressure, dialysis initiation often presents an important transition in clinical care when antihypertensives are reviewed or changed (e.g. discontinuation of diuretics). However, some antihypertensives are not changed at all, perhaps due to clinical inertia or lack of evidence to inform clinical decision-making. Evidence to inform the use of antihypertensive PIMs is therefore needed. The aims of this study were to (1) describe prescribing patterns of antihypertensive PIMs before and after dialysis initiation, and (2) quantify the potential risk of hospitalization and death associated with continuation of these medications after dialysis initiation.

### Risperidone [^116Dpxpu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension

Risperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.2% (6/2607) of risperidone-treated patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies in adults with schizophrenia. The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 2 mg total (either once daily or 1 mg twice daily) in normal adults and 0.5 mg twice daily in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients for whom this is of concern. A dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Risperidone should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia, and in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered if hypotension occurs. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of risperidone and antihypertensive medication.

5.8 Falls

Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including risperidone, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

### Aging and antihypertensive medication-related complications in the chronic kidney disease patient [^1179QS7h]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We have reviewed the recent literature to describe the potential medication errors and adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with antihypertensives among older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

Overall, few studies have been published describing ADEs in older adults with CKD. Several examined hyperkalemia associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), diuretic (potassium-sparing), and β-blocker use. Additional studies described acute kidney injury (AKI) most commonly with ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy. Finally, orthostatic hypotension was evaluated in those taking ACE-inhibitor/ARB, β-blocker, or calcium-channel blocker therapy. In the absence of robust literature examining these events in this understudied population, one must consider age-related antihypertensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles concomitantly with the patient's comorbidities and other medications in order to minimize the risk for potential medication errors, drug-drug interactions, and ADEs.

Summary

Some of the most common ADEs associated with antihypertensive use in older adults with CKD include hyperkalemia, AKI, and orthostatic hypotension. Diligent monitoring of laboratory data, vital signs, and potential drug-drug interactions may mitigate serious ADEs caused by antihypertensives in this high-risk patient population.

### Mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension in parkinson disease [^111c44V5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Non-motor aspects of Parkinson disease (PD) are now recognized to be important both clinically and scientifically. Among these facets are abnormalities in blood pressure regulation. As much as 40% of PD patients have orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is usually associated with supine hypertension (SH). Symptoms of OH range from light-headedness to falls with serious trauma. SH, while typically asymptomatic, poses a significant increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Neuroimaging, neurochemical, and neuropharmacological studies indicate cardiac and extra-cardiac sympathetic noradrenergic denervation and baroreflex failure in virtually all PD patients with OH, and cardiac sympathetic denervation has been confirmed histopathologically. Mechanisms of SH in PD+OH remain poorly understood. The diurnal blood pressure profile shows increased variability that is correlated with decreased baroreflex gain and with increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment should be individually tailored according to the timing of OH or SH, using primarily short-acting sympathomimetic medications in the daytime for OH and short-acting antihypertensive in the nighttime for SH. Future research is needed to understand better and attenuate blood pressure fluctuations through manipulations that improve baroreflex function.

### Orthostatic hypotension: a practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or on assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms are due to inadequate physiologic compensation and organ hypoperfusion and include headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain. Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community setting is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in all age groups. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, and up to a 50% increase in relative risk of all-cause mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which consists of blood pressure and heart rate measurements after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient is unable to stand safely or the clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension is high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended. Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or nonneurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals for orthostatic hypotension are reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment focuses on the underlying cause and adjusting potentially causative medications. Nonpharmacologic strategies include dietary modifications, compression garments, physical maneuvers, and avoiding environments that exacerbate symptoms. First-line medications include midodrine and droxidopa. Although fludrocortisone improves symptoms, it has concerning long-term effects.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^116Rr3CK]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 chronic kidney disease (CKD) blood pressure — safety and clinical events with intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) target: The SBP target of < 120 mm Hg is described as generally safe and, in most adults, beneficial and not associated with increased significant adverse events. In the SPRINT CKD subgroup, there was no significant difference in serious adverse events or adverse events associated with hypotension, bradycardia, and injurious falls between the intensive (< 120 mm Hg SBP) and standard (< 140 mm Hg SBP) arms. Among participants aged ≥ 75 years or ≥ 80 years at baseline, approximately 44% and 50% had an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the adverse event risk profile with intensive BP lowering remained favorable, with no differences in serious adverse events and injurious falls. Orthostatic hypotension was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, falls, or syncope; however, it is reasonable to consider a change in medications or less-intensive therapy if the patient is symptomatic or BP is excessively low (e.g. SBP < 100 mm Hg). In severe carotid stenosis, an SBP < 120 mm Hg may be insufficient to maintain cerebral perfusion, and even an SBP of 150 mm Hg may be insufficient.

### Outcomes of treated hypertension at age 80 and older: cohort analysis of 79, 376 individuals [^115RGQey]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

These results reflect outcomes of individuals aged 80 and older receiving ongoing treatment for hypertension under currently recommended targets; at the time the data were recorded in electronic clinical records, intensive treatment to reduce SBP below 140 mmHg in individuals aged 80 and older was not indicated. Observational studies of prognosis in the above context are not comparable with studies that randomize participants to intensive treatment to achieve lower target BP. If intensive treatment were instituted to achieve SBP substantially lower than 150 mmHg, those with low SBP might be expected to be taking more antihypertensive medications than those with higher attained BP, but the group with lower attained SBP (< 125 mmHg) had slightly fewer prescribed medications (mean 1.84) than the reference group (mean 1.99 for SBP 145–154 mmHg). Also, the participants being in routine care, the medications prescribed may have differed from those used in recent trials aiming to achieve lower SBP. This analysis has other limitations, including inaccuracies in routine data recording. Although routine practice is to measure BP more than once for each clinical review, the available data contain only one recorded BP at each consultation, although it seems likely that the BPs recorded in clinical records are those used as a basis for management. Inaccuracies in estimated BPs were minimized by using median of recorded BPs across consultations during a 3‐year lead‐in period, avoiding "outliers" (perhaps recorded during acute events) that might distort mean values, and the mean number of measurements studied varied from 7.2 for the group with SBP less than 125 mmHg to 13.4 for those with SBP of 165 to 174 mmHg (Table S3). The studied BPs were used in monitoring antihypertensive treatment and thus have validity for the purpose of estimating prognosis in routine practice. Other aspects of BP, including orthostatic hypotension, have been associated with adverse events and may have contributed to the results observed, 19 alghouth no data are available on orthostatic hypotension in the dataset. Although assessment of orthostatic hypotension is thought to be common, the lack of specific data on these measures limits this analysis. Given the "typical care" rather than etiological context, BP measured during follow‐up (e.g. accounting for regression dilution) 20 was not accounted for because subsequent BP measurement were not available at treatment review in practice. Antihypertensive medication data are from real‐time prescribing records; no measure of adherence was available, 8 although nonadherence should be associated with higher BP and was unlikely to bias estimates of greater mortality at low SBP. Cause‐specific mortality was not studied, because death certification is thought to lack precision in the oldest adults, especially for cardiac outcomes. Records of lower SBP were more common in the later part of the period (2000–2014), with shorter mean follow‐up times for individuals with low SBP (Table 1). This may have been the result of incentive payments to improve hypertension management introduced from 2004, but adjusting for year of baseline BP measurement did not significantly alter results. 21 Elaborate adjustment of models was also avoided, with potentially confounding conditions excluded instead and easily interpretable estimates of prognosis in routine primary care provided. It is also possible that there was some undiagnosed disease at baseline that reduced BP and increased mortality, but low SBP was associated with excess mortality even in the 8 years to the end of follow‐up (ignoring the first 8 years of follow‐up), making this explanation less likely. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to account for comorbidities, but this does not fully capture functional status or frailty in this population; better measurement of functional status or frailty (e.g. gait speed) might correlate with the poor outcomes in the lower SBP group, although the study subjects were selected to be free of dementia, cancer, stroke, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and end‐stage renal disease, and adjustment for Charlson comorbidities altered the results only slightly, as did any of the other sensitivity analyses.

### Blood pressure lowering with nilvadipine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease does not increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension [^112FJDEa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

With an estimated prevalence of 45%, hypertension is a common comorbidity among patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). 1 Despite this high prevalence, this patient group has not been represented in hypertension trials, leading to uncertainty regarding the benefit‐to‐risk ratio of antihypertensive treatment in these patients. 2 This same discussion concerns frail, older people in general. 3 In the absence of evidence, current guidelines advise being cautious when starting antihypertensive treatment in these groups. 4, 5, 6

A widely voiced concern among physicians is that older people develop orthostatic hypotension (OH) following antihypertensive treatment. 7 The prevalence of OH increases with age, 8 and has been associated with cognitive decline, 9 possibly caused by AD pathology. OH is an independent risk factor for future falls. 10 Therefore, if antihypertensive treatment increases the risk of OH, it could unintentionally lead to increased frailty, institutionalization, or mortality, 11 especially in AD, where cerebral hypoperfusion following OH could accelerate cognitive decline. 12

Evidence about antihypertensive treatment and OH has mainly emanated from observational studies, 13, 14, 15, 16 while results from randomized clinical trials in healthy older people showed that improved control of blood pressure (BP) did not result in a larger difference between sitting and standing BP. 17, 18 Whether this also holds for frail populations, such as patients with AD, is currently unknown.

The Nilvad trial was designed to investigate the putative anti‐amyloid properties of the calcium‐channel blocker nilvadipine in mild‐to‐moderate AD. 19 The trial result was negative for cognitive and functional outcomes. 20 However, nilvadipine's antihypertensive properties are comparable to other, more commonly used, calcium‐channel blockers. 21, 22 Therefore, preplanned monitoring of BP throughout the study allowed us to explore the effect of starting an antihypertensive drug on the prevalence of OH in AD. Specifically, the aim of this study was to investigate whether BP lowering with nilvadipine increased the prevalence of OH and OH‐related clinical outcomes in patients with mild‐to‐moderate AD.

### Fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension [^111dQi2u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Orthostatic hypotension is an excessive fall in blood pressure (BP) while standing and is the result of a decrease in cardiac output or defective or inadequate vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that increases blood volume and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone is considered the first- or second-line pharmacological therapy for orthostatic hypotension alongside mechanical and positional measures such as increasing fluid and salt intake and venous compression methods. However, there has been no Cochrane Review of the benefits and harms of this drug for this condition.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 11 November 2019: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. We also searched trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included all studies evaluating the benefits and harms of fludrocortisone compared to placebo, another drug for orthostatic hypotension, or studies without comparators, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and observational studies. We included studies in people with orthostatic hypotension due to a chronic peripheral neuropathy, a central autonomic neuropathy, or autonomic failure from other causes, but not medication-induced orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic hypotension from acute volume depletion or blood loss.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane methodological procedures for most of the review. We developed and used a tool to prioritize observational studies that offered the best available evidence where there are gaps in the evidence from RCTs. We assessed the certainty of evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 13 studies of 513 participants, including three cross-over RCTs and 10 observational studies (three cohort studies, six case series and one case-control study). The included RCTs were small (total of 28 participants in RCTs), short term (two to three weeks), only examined fludrocortisone for orthostatic hypotension in people with two conditions (diabetes and Parkinson disease), and had variable risk of bias (two had unclear risk of bias and one had low risk of bias). Heterogeneity in participant populations, comparators and outcome assessment methods prevented meta-analyses of the RCTs. We found very low-certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone versus placebo on drop in BP in people with diabetes (-26 mmHg versus -39 mmHg systolic; -7 mmHg versus -11 mmHg diastolic; 1 cross-over study, 6 participants). For people with Parkinson disease, we found very-low certainty evidence about the effects of fludrocortisone on drop in BP compared to pyridostigmine (-14 mmHg versus -22.1 mmHg diastolic; P = 0.036; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) and domperidone (no change after treatment in either group; 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). For orthostatic symptoms, we found very low-certainty evidence for fludrocortisone versus placebo in people with diabetes (4 out of 5 analyzed participants had improvements in orthostatic symptoms, 1 cross-over study, 6 participants), for fludrocortisone versus pyridostigmine in people with Parkinson disease (orthostatic symptoms unchanged; 1 cross-over study, 9 participants) or fludrocortisone versus domperidone (improvement to 6 for both interventions on the Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale-Orthostatic Domain (COMPASS-OD); 1 cross-over study, 13 participants). Evidence on adverse events was also very low-certainty in both populations, but indicated side effects were minimal. Observational studies filled some gaps in evidence by examining the effects in larger groups of participants, with more diverse conditions, over longer periods of time. One cohort study (341 people studied retrospectively) found fludrocortisone may not be harmful in the long term for familial dysautonomia. However, it is unclear if this translates to long-term improvements in BP drop or a meaningful improvement in orthostatic symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of fludrocortisone on blood pressure, orthostatic symptoms or adverse events in people with orthostatic hypotension and diabetes or Parkinson disease. There is a lack of information on long-term treatment and treatment of orthostatic hypotension in other disease states. There is a need for standardized reporting of outcomes and for standardization of measurements of blood pressure in orthostatic hypotension.

### The effect of perindopril on postural instability in older people with a history of falls-a randomised controlled trial [^115qSTfc]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

One in three community-dwelling individuals over 65 fall at least once per year with resultant injury, disability, loss of confidence, dependence on others and poor quality of life. Postural instability, a major risk for falls, increases with age. Exercise is the single most effective intervention for falls prevention, and both lower limb strength and balance training and tai chi programmes can reduce falls risk — primarily through a reduction in postural instability.

Although antihypertensive medication are commonly thought to cause falls, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) might in fact have a number of effects that could lead to a reduction in falls risk. ACEi can improve 6-min walking distance in older people to a similar extent as 6 months of an exercise programme that reduced falls and is associated with a slower decline in muscle strength and walking speed with ageing.

Other effects include beneficial effects on nerve function, central postural control and orthostatic hypotension (OH) related to baroreceptor sensitivity. Population based studies in older people have variously reported an increased, unchanged or a reduced risk of falls, especially injurious ones, with cardiovascular medications like ACEi.

Randomised controlled trials are required to resolve this uncertainty; we therefore tested the effect of the long-acting ACEi perindopril on postural instability as an intermediate phenotype that reflects falls risk in older people.

Predisposing factors

Orthostatic hypotension is influenced by a range of factors; cross-sectional analysis not only suggests an influence of age, but also drug effects and orthostatic stress in neurological disorders, particularly PD, DLB and MSA as well as autonomic neuropathies. The association between OH and advanced age may be explained by a number of predisposing factors that occur along with aging, including changes in baroreflex function, inadequate vasoconstrictor responses, reduced cardiac and vascular compliance, reduced blood volume and impaired efficiency of the skeletal muscle pump. In addition, dehydration, deconditioning and poor nutrition contribute to the development of OH in the elderly population.

Another factor massively influencing OH prevalence is the effect of medication. Elderly subjects commonly require medications altering blood pressure, such as diuretics or antihypertensives, which are well known to either cause or exacerbate OH. In addition, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, tricyclic antidepressants, vasodilatators, sympatholytics, and antiparkinsonian agents can increase risk of OH by impairing sympathetic tone or reducing peripheral vascular resistance. Further, increased orthostatic stress in patients with parkinsonian conditions may be observed early in the morning, with a rise in core temperature, in activities which increase intrathoracic pressure (e.g. defecation, coughing), prolonged standing, exertion, alcohol or carbohydrate ingestion. A structured list of OH causes is presented in Table 2.

### Orthostatic hypotension in older persons is not associated with cognitive functioning, features of cerebral damage or cerebral blood flow [^116ioNEL]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Particularly in old age, orthostatic hypotension has been related to worse cognitive functioning, possibly caused by reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). This study investigates whether orthostatic hypotension in older people is associated with cognitive dysfunction and, if so, whether this association is mediated by cerebral vascular damage and/or decreased CBF.

Methods

Four hundred and twenty participants of the Discontinuation of ANtihypertensive Treatment in Elderly People (DANTE) Study Leiden (mean age 81 years, all using antihypertensive medication and with mild cognitive deficits), and MRI data from 214 participants of the nested DANTE MRI sub-study. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as either a SBP decrease at least 20mmHg and/or a DBP decrease of at least 10mmHg within 3min of standing up. Cognitive functioning was assessed using a battery of six cognitive tests covering global cognition, memory function, executive function and psychomotor speed. Cerebral vascular damage and CBF were assessed using MRI.

Results

The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 47% (n = 199). Compared with the group without orthostatic hypotension, participants with orthostatic hypotension showed no differences in any of the cognitive functions, features of cerebral small vessel disease, microstructural integrity or CBF.

Conclusion

In this population of older persons, the presence of orthostatic hypotension was not associated with decreased cognition. In addition, no differences were found in the supposedly underlying cerebral vascular mechanisms.
