## Question

Guidelines for anemia screening in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for anemia screening in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching screening principles that determine when screening is justified. Then, I should verify how anemia is defined across populations and contexts. Next, I will examine condition-specific screening recommendations for chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, perioperative care, and inflammatory bowel disease. After that, I need to check the approach to iron deficiency anemia, including ferritin thresholds and when to pursue gastrointestinal evaluation. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the screening framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Screening is warranted when the condition is an important health problem, management differs by test result, there is a detectable latent or early symptomatic stage, effective treatment improves outcomes if applied early, benefits outweigh harms, and there is adequate test accuracy and feasibility; these principles underpin USPSTF and hematology guidance and should anchor any recommendation I make [^85c5484d].

> I need to verify how anemia is defined because thresholds vary by population and purpose. For adults, WHO defines anemia as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in nonpregnant women, while pregnancy uses less than 11.0 g/dL in the second and third trimesters; CKD guidelines align with these sex-specific cutoffs for patients aged 15 years and older, and some perioperative sources advocate a uniform less than 13.0 g/dL threshold for both sexes to capture risk, so I should keep context in mind when applying definitions [^d503dd2f] [^7b660aec] [^657b5b6c].

> Hold on, let's not conflate screening with diagnosis. I should confirm that screening refers to testing asymptomatic individuals to detect disease earlier, whereas diagnosis follows symptoms or incidental findings; this distinction matters because some guidelines recommend universal screening in specific high-risk states (for example, pregnancy or CKD), while others advise against routine screening in low-risk, asymptomatic adults due to insufficient evidence of net benefit [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine chronic kidney disease, where screening is consistently recommended. I should double-check the cadence: KDIGO advises measuring hemoglobin at least annually in CKD stage 3, twice yearly in stages 4–5 not on dialysis, and every 3 months in dialysis patients; UK Kidney Association guidance mirrors this, and AAFP recommends at least annual hemoglobin in stage 3 or higher, so I can confidently endorse risk-based screening in CKD with these intervals [^ce8a3339] [^e995e1f0] [^582f9dd0] [^03c085b3].

> Wait, let me verify pregnancy guidance because it is often contested. ACOG recommends universal screening with CBC in the first trimester and again at 24–28 weeks, whereas USPSTF 2024 concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for iron deficiency or IDA in asymptomatic pregnant persons; reconciling this, many clinicians still screen per ACOG given the high prevalence and potential impact, but I should acknowledge the evidence gap and individualize decisions, especially outside routine prenatal care pathways [^429102e1] [^d78a9eef] [^2f5c1cc9].

> I will now examine perioperative care, where screening is increasingly emphasized. The British Society for Haematology recommends screening for anemia with CBC in patients undergoing major surgery and treating when hemoglobin is less than 130 g/L, ideally beginning evaluation at least 4 weeks preoperatively; cardiac surgery societies similarly endorse preoperative anemia screening and treatment to reduce transfusions and complications, so I should recommend preoperative screening for major elective surgery and early correction of anemia or iron deficiency when found [^2dc35fee] [^0e8c8605] [^657b5b6c] [^e5a9f54b].

> Let me consider inflammatory bowel disease, where anemia is common and multifactorial. ECCO recommends routine screening for anemia in all patients with IBD, with periodic labs every 6–12 months in remission or mild disease and at least every 3 months in active disease; this is a strong, condition-specific indication for ongoing surveillance rather than one-time screening [^faadeaad] [^7bda54a5].

> But wait, what about the general adult population without specific risk factors. I should confirm that routine universal screening is not recommended in low-risk, asymptomatic adults; indeed, outside pregnancy, CKD, perioperative pathways, and IBD, major guidelines do not endorse universal screening, and primary care surveys highlight variability and potential low-yield testing, so case-finding based on symptoms or risk factors is preferred [^85c5484d].

> Next, I should review iron deficiency anemia evaluation because screening often uncovers IDA. The AGA strongly recommends using a ferritin threshold of 45 ng/mL to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia, noting 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity; in inflammatory states or CKD, transferrin saturation and CRP help distinguish absolute from functional iron deficiency, and a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks of iron therapy strongly supports absolute iron deficiency even if ferritin is equivocal [^44a745d9] [^b091a7ae] [^07c4d638] [^80df5a00].

> Hold on, I should verify when to pursue gastrointestinal evaluation for occult blood loss. In men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, bidirectional endoscopy is recommended; in premenopausal women, individualized decisions are reasonable unless anemia is severe, recurrent, or disproportionate to menstrual losses, and celiac disease serology should be considered in all IDA given its prevalence and reversibility [^b091a7ae] [^e7d7baee] [^3fc7db85].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and nuances. In older adults, anemia is common and often multifactorial; a systematic approach is advised even though a discernible cause may not always be found, and transfusion thresholds in chronic anemia are generally conservative, around 7–8 g/dL in stable, asymptomatic patients, with symptom-guided adjustments. In adolescents and young adults, iron deficiency is prevalent and frequently missed by risk-factor–based screening, suggesting a lower threshold for testing in those with fatigue or heavy menses. In sickle cell disease, routine hematologic surveillance is standard within comprehensive care models, though this extends beyond generic adult screening guidance [^a3cf1342] [^9c204979] [^f500cf99] [^fd883635].

> Let me reconsider the practical synthesis so I don't overgeneralize. Adults should be screened for anemia when risk is elevated: with CKD stage 3 or higher, in pregnancy per obstetric standards, before major elective surgery, or with IBD; in these settings, use WHO sex-specific hemoglobin cutoffs to define anemia and proceed with cause-directed evaluation, especially for iron deficiency. In low-risk, asymptomatic adults, avoid routine screening and instead use clinical judgment for case-finding based on symptoms, risk factors, or incidental findings, recognizing that evidence for universal screening is insufficient outside defined high-risk contexts [^d503dd2f] [^429102e1] [^2dc35fee] [^faadeaad].

---

Routine anemia screening is recommended for **high-risk adults** [^5d44325d], including those with CKD (stage 3 or higher) [^03c085b3] [^e995e1f0], pregnancy [^429102e1], and before major surgery [^2dc35fee] [^657b5b6c]. For the **general adult population**, routine screening is not advised; instead, test based on symptoms or risk factors [^85c5484d]. Use CBC to screen, and confirm iron deficiency with ferritin [^44a745d9]; in inflammatory states, interpret ferritin with transferrin saturation or CRP [^44a745d9] [^07c4d638]. If IDA is found, evaluate for gastrointestinal causes, especially in men and postmenopausal women [^b091a7ae] [^e7d7baee].

---

## Populations recommended for routine anemia screening

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

- **CKD stage 3**: Screen at least annually [^03c085b3] [^e995e1f0].
- **CKD stages 4–5 (non-dialysis)**: Screen at least twice yearly [^ce8a3339] [^582f9dd0].
- **Dialysis patients**: Screen every 3 months [^ce8a3339].

---

### Pregnancy

Obtain screening at the **first prenatal visit** and again at **24–28 weeks** [^429102e1] [^f269704b].

---

### Preoperative patients

Screen all patients undergoing **major surgery** [^2dc35fee] [^657b5b6c], ideally at least 4 weeks preoperatively [^657b5b6c].

---

## General adult population

Routine screening is **not recommended**; test based on symptoms or risk factors [^85c5484d].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for anemia

| **Population** | **Hemoglobin threshold** |
|-|-|
| Adult males | < 13.0 g/dL [^d503dd2f] [^8fd5db6f] |
| Adult females (non-pregnant) | < 12.0 g/dL [^d503dd2f] [^8fd5db6f] |
| Pregnant females (2nd–3rd trimester) | < 11.0 g/dL [^7b660aec] |

---

## Recommended screening tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Initial test to detect anemia [^notfound].
- **Ferritin**: Primary test to confirm iron deficiency; use 45 ng/mL cutoff in anemia [^44a745d9] [^e89b763a].
- **Transferrin saturation**: Use when ferritin is equivocal or in inflammatory states [^44a745d9] [^07c4d638].

---

## Follow-up and diagnostic evaluation

Confirm low hemoglobin with **repeat testing** before initiating a workup [^fc3a58d4]. Evaluate for **gastrointestinal causes** in men and postmenopausal women with IDA [^b091a7ae] [^e7d7baee]. Consider **celiac disease testing** in unexplained IDA [^3fc7db85] [^15bd4570].

---

## Special considerations

In inflammatory conditions, interpret ferritin with **transferrin saturation or CRP** [^44a745d9] [^07c4d638]. In older adults, anemia is common and often multifactorial; use a **systematic approach** [^a3cf1342] [^69b79037].

---

Routine anemia screening is targeted to **high-risk groups** (CKD, pregnancy, preoperative) [^03c085b3] [^429102e1] [^2dc35fee], while the general population is screened based on symptoms or risk factors [^85c5484d]. Use CBC for detection and ferritin to confirm iron deficiency, with further evaluation guided by clinical context [^44a745d9].

Rationale for clinical practice guidelines for anaemia of CKD

Guideline 1.1 - Evaluation of chronic anaemia - Screening for anaemia

We suggest that haemoglobin (Hb) levels should be routinely measured to screen for anaemia:

At least annually in people with CKD G3
At least twice a year in people with CKD G4-5 not on kidney replacement therapy (2B)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Guideline 1.2 - Evaluation of anaemia - Haemoglobin level

We recommend that all people with chronic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease should be investigated for the cause and possible treatment, irrespective of the grade of kidney disease or requirement for kidney replacement therapy if:

Their haemoglobin (Hb) levels are less than 110 g/L (less than 105 g/L if younger than 2 years), or they develop symptoms attributable to anaemia. This is to ensure the correct diagnosis and management of anaemia. (1 A)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Guideline 1.3 - Evaluation of anaemia - Kidney function

We suggest that CKD should be considered as a possible cause of anaemia when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². It is more likely to be the cause if the GFR is < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (< 45 ml/min/ 1.73 m² in people with diabetes) and no other cause, e.g. blood loss, folic acid or vitamin B₁₂ deficiency, is identified. (2B)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Guideline 1.4 - Evaluation of anaemia - Erythropoietin measurement

We recommend that measurement of erythropoietin levels should NOT routinely be considered for the diagnosis or management of anaemia for people with CKD. (1 A)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to diagnose anemia in adult and adolescent patients aged ≥ 15 years with CKD based on the hemoglobin concentration < 13.0 g/dL in males and < 12.0 g/dL in females.

### Noninvasive testing… [^b091a7ae]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA.
- Video capsule endoscopy is not recommended in asymptomatic adults with IDA. From the AFP Editors Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. It affects 3% of adults and is slightly more common in women younger than 50 years. The American Gastroenterological Association developed guidelines for the evaluation of IDA in adults. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia.

Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain. Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive.

The AGA also suggests endoscopy in premenopausal women with IDA because malignancy is diagnosed in 1% of this population. In younger patients who might have a plausible nonmalignant cause of anemia, iron replacement can be offered without further exploration. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, routine gastric biopsies are not recommended. Although autoimmune atrophic gastritis can be diagnosed by gastric biopsy, it has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

---

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^b2a65e65]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

USPSTF recommendation — screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months has insufficient evidence for benefit or harm, with no direct studies of screening effects, treatment effects on development, or linkage of iron status change to improved outcomes, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

---

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^5d44325d]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Screening justification criteria — general principles for deciding when screening is warranted emphasize that the condition should be an important health problem; management should differ by positive vs negative test; the condition should have an understood natural history with a latent or early symptomatic stage; there should be an effective treatment/prevention that improves outcomes if applied before clinical presentation; outcome improvements from management based on screening should outweigh harms of screening; there should be high- or moderate-quality evidence for sufficient test accuracy; and screening should be cost-effective, acceptable to patients, and feasible to implement.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^d78a9eef]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy states that for asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults, the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons and the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation in pregnant persons. This recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults and does not apply to pregnant persons who are severely malnourished, have symptoms of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, or have specific hematologic conditions (eg, sickle cell disease) or nutritional deficiencies that may increase their need for iron. This recommendation is consistent with the 2015 recommendation statement on screening and supplementation for iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, and the USPSTF notes that clinical decisions should be individualized to the specific patient or situation.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^a3cf1342]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2f5c1cc9]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — net benefit assessment for screening and supplementation in pregnancy concludes that due to lack of available data, the current evidence is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms for both screening and iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined (I statement), and this recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults.

---

### Blood transfusion in obstetrics [^f811ce6e]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, pregnancy, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for anemia in pregnant females at 28 weeks of gestation. Obtain an additional CBC at 20–24 weeks in patients with multiple pregnancies.

---

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^5be29d57]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Celiac disease testing in asymptomatic adult patients with iron deficiency anemia — In asymptomatic adult patients with iron deficiency anemia and plausible celiac disease, the AGA suggests initial serologic testing, with small bowel biopsy only if positive, over routine small bowel biopsies to diagnose celiac disease. Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence. Patients with symptoms suggestive of celiac disease should be evaluated appropriately. A strategy of serologic testing for celiac disease, followed by small bowel biopsies only if positive, would diagnose the large majority of patients with celiac disease with minimal short-term harm and overall cost savings.

Importance

Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia during pregnancy. According to survey data from 1999 to 2006, overall estimated prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is near 18% and increases across the 3 trimesters of pregnancy (from 6.9% to 14.3% to 28.4%). An estimated 5% of pregnant persons have iron deficiency anemia.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with and without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

Population

Asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined. The USPSTF also concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^657b5b6c]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Supporting Evidence: Screening

The most commonly used criteria for defining anemia are the WHO definitions (Hb < 12.0 g/dL for women or < 13.0 g/dL for men). However, it has been suggested that these should be updated. A range of Hb cutoff levels for anemia has been used in studies. In an observational study of > 4000 adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a preoperative Hb concentration < 13.0 g/dL was reported as the optimal threshold in women. Similarly, in a review by Muñoz et al, a Hb level < 13.0 g/dL for both men and women was advocated for preoperative anemia, whereas the WHO criteria were considered acceptable for postoperative anemia. This approach was echoed in international consensus guidelines on the management of surgery-related anemia. Adoption of the 13.0 g/dL threshold in both sexes has also been suggested in recent reviews of perioperative anemia and PBM. Therefore, the panel supports defining anemia by a Hb level < 13.0 g/dL in both men and women. To allow time for a response to therapy, at least 4 weeks before surgery has been suggested as the optimal time frame for evaluation. However, treatment as little as 1 day before surgery [intravenous (IV) iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B₁₂, and oral folic acid) has been shown to be effective in reducing transfusion of allogeneic blood products in cardiac surgery patients with preoperative anemia.

Opinions of the Panel: Screening

The panel agreed that the optimal time before surgery to screen for anemia is at least 4 weeks. However, shorter time frames such as in the case of urgent or emergent surgery should not preclude evaluation. The results of tests performed shortly before surgery may enable treatments with a rapid onset of action (eg, IV iron) to be administered preoperatively, and they may also help define the need for anemia treatment postoperatively.

Minor procedures such as cataract surgery or other surgeries where testing requirements are waived because of no blood loss can be undertaken in patients with anemia, therefore there is no requirement for this population to be screened. However, because of the high frequency of anemia in the general population, patients undergoing all other types of surgery should be screened preoperatively. Screening may be beneficial by providing an opportunity to treat previously undiagnosed anemia, regardless of the setting. The importance of screening is heightened in those undergoing major surgery with at least moderate risk of clinically significant blood loss, those with risk factors for anemia or poor tolerance of anemia, and those unable to receive blood products.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^761ab40c]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^69b79037]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

With the global growing older adult population, clinicians face the common, yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this population. Older age predisposes to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because anemia may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. We believe a systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative and enhanced recovery after surgery-cardiac society consensus statement on the management of preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in adult cardiac surgery patients [^e5a9f54b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Preoperative anemia is common in patients presenting for cardiac surgery, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4, and has been associated with worse outcomes including increased risk of blood transfusion, kidney injury, stroke, infection, and death. Iron deficiency, a major cause of anemia, has also been shown to have an association with worse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, even in the absence of anemia. Although recent guidelines have supported diagnosing and treating anemia and iron deficiency before elective surgery, details on when and how to screen and treat remain unclear. The Eighth Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI 8) consensus conference, in conjunction with the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery-Cardiac Surgery Society, brought together an international, multidisciplinary team of experts to review and evaluate the literature on screening, diagnosing, and managing preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and to provide evidence-based recommendations in accordance with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for evaluating biomedical literature.

### Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^0571cd22]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is usually based on a combination of various genetic or phenotypic criteria. Decisions regarding screening are difficult because of the variable penetrance of mutations of the HFE gene and the absence of any definitive trials addressing the benefits and risks of therapeutic phlebotomy in asymptomatic patients or those with only laboratory abnormalities. The purpose of this guideline is to increase physician awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly the variable penetrance of genetic mutations; aid in case finding; and explain the role of genetic testing. This guideline provides recommendations based on a review of evidence in the accompanying background paper by Schmitt and colleagues. The target audience for this guideline is internists and other primary care physicians. The target patient population is all persons who have a probability or susceptibility of developing hereditary hemochromatosis, including the relatives of individuals who already have the disease.

Initial clinical assessment

We recommend taking a detailed history, as it may provide important clues as to the cause(s) of IDA in the individual case (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that initial investigation of confirmed IDA should include urinalysis or urine microscopy, screening for coeliac disease (CD) and in appropriate cases, endoscopic examination of the upper and lower GI tract (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).
CD is found in 3%–5% of cases of IDA, and we recommend that it should be routinely screened for serologically, or on small bowel biopsy at the time of gastroscopy (evidence quality — high, consensus — 84%, statement strength — strong).
Age, sex, Hb concentration and mean cell volume are all independent predictors of risk of GI cancer in IDA, and need to be considered as part of a holistic risk assessment. It follows that the cancer risk in iron deficiency without anaemia is low (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
There are insufficient grounds at present to recommend faecal immunochemical testing for risk stratification in patients with IDA. The evidence base is evolving rapidly, however, and on that basis, this guidance may therefore change (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — weak).
We recommend that in men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, gastroscopy and colonoscopy should generally be the first-line GI investigations. In those not suitable for colonoscopy, CT colonography is a reasonable alternative (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Follow-up and recurrent IDA

Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^af100707]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Implementation — screening and supplementation during pregnancy should reflect the evidence gap and clinical judgment, as there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or supplementation during pregnancy for iron deficiency with or without anemia, and in the absence of evidence, clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and whether to provide routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Screening often includes measurement of hematologic indices (eg, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values as proxies of iron deficiency anemia), and an abnormal screening test result may be followed by treatment with iron therapy; supplementation refers to routine provision of low-dose supplemental iron or intake of iron-fortified foods without specifically measuring hematologic indices. Other organizations' guidelines vary, and screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with or without anemia during pregnancy are common.

### National alliance of sickle cell centers consensus recommendations on sickle cell disease health maintenance: a consensus statement [^fd883635]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The most common inherited blood disorder in the world, sickle cell disease (SCD) is a known global health concern. While survival of children into adulthood has improved significantly over the last few decades in high-resource countries, substantial gaps in care standards and limited practice harmonization persist.

Objective

To provide up-to-date recommendations for preventive care and treatment of all people living with SCD and its related comorbidities.

Evidence Review

As part of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers (NASCC), 41 pediatric and adult sickle cell disease experts developed consensus standards and recommendations based on available evidence and expert consensus garnered during an in-depth review of the literature. For these recommendations, there were 3 separate consensus panels (0–2 years, 2–18 years, and > 18 years]) held in 2022. The initial expert panels included representation from 41 NASCC-recognized SCD centers (during the first 2 votes) and the third and final vote in 2023 included representatives from 81 NASCC-recognized centers. The primary focus was on: (1) preventative care including screening recommendations, (2) management of acute complications, and (3) treatment options.

Findings

In this modified Delphi consensus statement, the experts developed consensus standards and recommendations for the clinical care of people living with SCD throughout the lifespan, as well as identified gaps in current evidence that need additional research. Standards and recommendations included routine screening and education, management of acute complications, as well as disease-modifying treatments such as hydroxyurea.

Conclusions and Relevance

People with SCD require coordinated and consistent care starting soon after birth in an SCD center and throughout their lives; SCD is a chronic condition with a highly heterogenous phenotype necessitating lifelong care through an SCD center in collaboration with clinicians in multiple areas of medicine including primary care. Future work should prioritize the management of timing of initiation and precision use of disease-modifying therapies, infection management and prevention, and discussion on transformative therapies.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^5f7de556]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

### Endocrine disorders in Fanconi anemia: recommendations for screening and treatment [^7c59ef59]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Endocrine problems are common in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA). About 80% of children and adults with FA have at least one endocrine abnormality, including short stature, GH deficiency, abnormal glucose or insulin metabolism, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism, pubertal delay, hypogonadism, or impaired fertility. The goal of this report is to provide an overview of endocrine abnormalities and guidelines for routine screening and treatment to allow early diagnosis and timely intervention.

Evidence Acquisition

This work is based on a comprehensive literature review, including relevant articles published between 1971 and 2014, and proceedings of a Consensus Conference held by the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund in 2013.

Evidence Synthesis

The panel of experts collected published evidence and discussed its relevance to reflect current information about the endocrine care of children and adults with FA before the Consensus Conference and through subsequent deliberations that led to the consensus.

Conclusions

Individuals with FA should be routinely screened for endocrine abnormalities, including evaluation of growth; glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism; thyroid function; puberty; gonadal function; and bone mineral metabolism. Inclusion of an endocrinologist as part of the multidisciplinary patient care team is key to providing comprehensive care for patients with FA.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^8224b445]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Iron deficiency can lead to several adverse health outcomes. Widely available blood biomarkers and dietary interventions, nonprescription iron supplements, and, if necessary, prescription oral and intravenous iron products are available to manage iron deficiency. Prior studieshave shown that iron deficiency affects a large proportion of children and younger women (especially in low-income regions), but the prevalence of iron deficiency, especially functional iron deficiency, outside these groups remains unknown in the US. This cross-sectional study indicates that both absolute and functional iron deficiency affect a large proportion of adults in the US, especially among those without conditions often screened for iron deficiency. Moreover, iron supplement use was infrequent among adults with iron deficiency. Absolute and functional iron deficiency may be a widespread, underrecognized public health problem.

Prevalence studies, of absolute iron deficiency in the US have focused primarily on populations who are at high risk of developing iron deficiency or anemia, such as infants, pregnant women, and individuals of childbearing age. We, therefore, examined the prevalence of both absolute and functional iron deficiency among women and men older than 18 years with and without known risk factors for iron deficiency. We found that absolute and functional iron deficiency affect 14% and 15%, respectively, of the US adult general population, even those without risk factors. Our findings agree with results from studies, of generally healthy populations in Europe, which also reported high rates of absolute iron deficiency. Together, these studies indicate that the general population has considerable risk for absolute and functional iron deficiency.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, on the screening and prevention of iron deficiency provide recommendations for high-risk groups, but lack clear recommendations for iron deficiency surveillance in the general population. Current screening recommendationsmay miss 70% of iron deficiency cases among children and during pregnancy. Our study extends those findings by demonstrating high rates of absolute and functional iron deficiency among adult women and men in the general population, even those without anemia, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Studies to determine the optimal absolute iron deficiency screening strategy among adults in the US are needed.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^d9d50c24]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes, as well as screening for and treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral iron formulations, in children ages 6 to 24 months.

Population

This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia. It does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 24 months. (I statement).

### Prevalence and predictors of iron deficiency in adolescent and young adult outpatients: implications for screening [^f500cf99]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Current screening guidelines may not be adequate to identify iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in adolescent and young adults. Adolescent and young adult outpatients from 4 hospital-based clinics (N = 493) reported on diet, health, and bleeding, and had phlebotomy for iron and hematologic tests. We examined sex-specific factors associated with ID and IDA and ability of universal and risk factor-based screening using hemoglobin and hemoglobin plus ferritin to detect ID and IDA. Among females (n = 350), 34.6% had ID and 6.3% had IDA. Nearly 1 in 3 females with ID had no risk factors. Among males, 12.6% had ID; none had IDA. More than 1 in 3 males with ID did not have risk factors. Current screening approaches would have missed ID in 47% to 82% of females and 95% to 100% of males. ID was prevalent in both male and female adolescents and young adult outpatients. New approaches to screening for ID are needed to accurately evaluate iron status in this population.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^7b660aec]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^984ab28b]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for iron deficiency anemia — children ages 6 to 24 months: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 24 months (I statement). This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia and does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. The rationale notes that the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 1 to 5 years in the United States is ~1% to 2%.

KDIGO ungraded statements — purpose and examples: 'This category was designed to allow the Work Group to issue general advice', and an ungraded statement 'provides guidance based on common sense; it provides reminders of the obvious; it is not sufficiently specific to allow application of evidence to the issue and therefore it is not based on systematic evidence review'. Examples include 'recommendations about frequency of testing, referral to specialists, and routine medical care' and also 'recommendations regarding monitoring intervals, counseling, and referral to other clinical specialists'. Such statements 'are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations', and 'We strove to minimize the use of ungraded recommendations'.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a classic early diagnostic sign of gastrointestinal (GI) tract malignant neoplasm. Between 1% and 10% of adult patients with IDA may have undiagnosed GI tract cancer. Prompt and thorough evaluation of IDA is essential. However, retrospective studies have reported that delays in diagnostic evaluation of IDA are common, and can lead to a delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer. This problem is of increasing importance given the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients outside the age range for which routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, for whom IDA may be the first diagnostic sign of malignant neoplasm.

Clinical practices related to identification and evaluation of IDA likely vary substantially, with at least 30 different guidelines from 10 specialty societies. However, variation related to testing practices, interpretation of laboratory test results, and diagnostic evaluation of IDA among physicians is not well studied even though these factors may be associated with diagnostic delays, missed cancer diagnoses, and low-value care. For instance, because of a low diagnostic yield, anemia screening is not recommended for adults except during pregnancy, and recommendations about screening during pregnancy are mixed. Inappropriate screening may be associated with health care waste and potential unintended harm (eg, additional downstream diagnostic tests). Inaccurate test interpretation of iron studies (eg, serum ferritin level and iron saturation) can also lead to medical error, with misclassification of patients' iron level. Interpretation can be complicated because the ferritin level may be elevated in the context of an inflammatory process, potentially masking underlying iron deficiency. Guidelines consistently recommend that men with IDA and postmenopausal women, in the absence of obvious causes, should be evaluated for potential occult GI tract blood loss with colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, older guidelines, which predated the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients observed over the past decade, recommended against initial endoscopic evaluation for premenopausal women with IDA given the more common cause of iron deficiency secondary to menstrual blood loss. Together, these issues introduce ambiguity and complexity to the evaluation of IDA.

Our objective was to understand how primary care physicians (PCPs) approach testing and evaluation of patients for IDA. To do this, we conducted a survey study consisting of a vignette-based assessment of PCPs to examine their practices related to IDA testing and evaluation for male and female patients of different ages. A better understanding of current PCP evaluation and referral patterns for GI endoscopy in the context of IDA may reveal potential opportunities to intervene and promote earlier diagnosis of GI tract cancers.

### Not so benign haematology: anaemia of the elderly [^f76a00ce]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

Chronic anemia and transfusion thresholds — commentary highlights conservative triggers and individualized assessment. The threshold for transfusion in chronic anemia in the absence of symptoms is approximately 7 g/dL, prior clinical practice used higher Hb goals when Hb concentration targets were greater than 10.0 or 11.0 g/dL, and a careful within-patient assessment of symptoms before and after transfusion may be the best strategy to determine a patient-specific threshold until better evidence is available.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^9cc6b816]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, absolute and functional iron deficiency are common among adult women and men in the US, even in the absence of anemia, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or current pregnancy. Further research on the role of functional iron deficiency in adverse health outcomes and on iron deficiency screening strategies is needed.

Who to investigate

The investigation of IDA potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, and so there is a strong case for targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even following previous guidelines advising investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases — and the majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.

It is also important to bear in mind that premenopausal women do on occasion develop cancer in the GI tract, and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is therefore sometimes justification for investigating younger women — particularly if the IDA is severe or recurrent, and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses (see the Special situations section).

There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables — specifically age, sex, MCV and Hb concentration. The IDIOM Apphas been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform the patient discussion as to the potential benefit of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process with the incorporation of additional clinical variables may allow the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^8ba19956]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others for screening and supplementation in pregnancy: For screening, recommendations generally focus on screening for anemia, rather than iron deficiency, and use variable cutoffs to define anemia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Family Physicians, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all pregnant persons be screened for anemia at their first prenatal visit, preferably during the first trimester of pregnancy; ACOG recommends repeat screening at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal supplementation for all pregnant persons with an oral low-dose iron supplement (30 mg/d).
