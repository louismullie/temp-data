## Question

A 5-year-old is brought into your office by his mother. His mother states that he is having 10–20 episodes per day where he stops responding to his mother and is found staring out of the window. During these periods, he blinks more frequently than normal, but returns to his normal self afterwards. These episodes last 30 to 60 seconds. His mother states that all of his milestones have been normal and he had an uncomplicated birth. His mother also denies any other recent illness. On exam, his vitals are normal. During one of these episodes in the office, his EEG shows three-per-second spike and wave discharge. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Febrile seizure
B. Benign focal epilepsy
C. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
D. Absence seizure

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the most likely diagnosis for a 5-year-old with brief staring spells, increased blinking, and a classic 3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave EEG pattern, and to justify why the alternatives are less likely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype and whether it fits absence epilepsy. Then, I should verify the EEG signature and its diagnostic specificity. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and actively exclude alternatives like febrile seizures, benign focal epilepsy, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Finally, I will confirm the diagnosis and outline immediate management implications, including medication choices and EEG activation maneuvers that aid diagnosis and prognosis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The child has frequent, brief episodes of behavioral arrest with unresponsiveness and staring, often accompanied by subtle automatisms such as increased blinking, each lasting about 30–60 seconds, with abrupt onset and offset and no postictal confusion. Development is normal and there is no fever or intercurrent illness, which aligns with typical absence seizures in a normally developing child, particularly with onset around age 5 years, the peak incidence for childhood absence epilepsy [^116hzsD2] [^113DPskU].

> Wait, let me verify the EEG finding because that is pivotal. The description of generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges during an episode is essentially pathognomonic for typical absence seizures; I initially thought "pathognomonic", but hold on, I should verify that nuance — while very specific, rare mimics can occur, so I should say "highly specific" rather than absolutely pathognomonic. In childhood absence epilepsy, the pattern is bilateral, synchronous, symmetric, 3-Hz (often 2.7–4 Hz) generalized spike-wave on a normal background, frequently provoked by hyperventilation, which matches this case and supports the diagnosis strongly [^116hzsD2] [^113DPskU].

> I will now examine the differential and exclude alternatives. Febrile seizures are excluded because the episodes are afebrile and recurrent throughout the day, not associated with fever, and the EEG is not consistent with febrile seizure physiology; febrile seizures are defined by fever and typically do not show generalized 3-Hz spike-wave discharges on EEG [^113edcJA]. Benign focal epilepsy of childhood, such as Rolandic epilepsy, presents with focal seizures and focal or centrotemporal spikes rather than generalized 3-Hz spike-wave, so this EEG pattern and semiology do not fit; moreover, benign focal epilepsies are not characterized by frequent, brief lapses of awareness without focal features [^112Y9GGC]. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy typically begins after age 10 and is defined by myoclonic jerks, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and often absence seizures with faster generalized polyspike-wave discharges around 3.5–6 Hz; the age of onset and EEG here are too slow and too early for JME, making JME unlikely [^113DPskU].

> Hold on, I should also consider nonepileptic staring and other mimics. Nonepileptic staring tends to occur in younger or developmentally delayed children, lasts longer, lacks the abrupt onset/offset, and shows a normal EEG; here, the child is 5 years old with normal development, events are brief with abrupt transitions, and the EEG shows the classic generalized spike-wave pattern, which together argue strongly against nonepileptic staring spells [^112Y9GGC]. Let me reconsider whether any other epileptic syndrome fits better — atypical absence seizures have slower spike-wave around 1.5–2.5 Hz and usually occur in the setting of developmental delay or encephalopathy, which is not this child's profile, further reinforcing typical absence epilepsy as the diagnosis [^116LbAKC].

> Next, I should review supportive diagnostic features and immediate management implications. Hyperventilation during EEG increases the yield of capturing absence seizures and 3-Hz generalized spike-wave, so I should confirm that hyperventilation was performed and, if not, consider repeating the EEG with activation; this is standard practice in suspected genetic generalized epilepsies and improves diagnostic confidence and syndrome classification [^1141XxFx]. For treatment, ethosuximide is first-line for absence seizures, with valproate or lamotrigine as alternatives; importantly, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine can worsen generalized epilepsies and should be avoided, so I need to ensure we do not inadvertently exacerbate seizures with the wrong agent [^113u6tXc].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is childhood absence epilepsy, given the age of onset, normal development, clinical semiology of brief staring with impaired responsiveness and subtle blinking automatisms, and the characteristic 3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave discharges on EEG. The absence of fever, focal features, and the mismatch with age and EEG for JME further solidify this conclusion [^116hzsD2] [^113DPskU].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **absence seizure** (childhood absence epilepsy) [^116hzsD2], given the classic triad of brief staring spells with impaired awareness, frequent daily episodes, and a 3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave pattern on EEG [^113DPskU]. Febrile seizures are excluded by the **afebrile course** [^113edcJA], benign focal epilepsy by the **generalized EEG** [^112Y9GGC], and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy by the **age of onset** and absence of myoclonus [^113DPskU].

---

## Clinical features supporting absence seizure

- **Age of onset**: Childhood absence epilepsy typically begins between ages 4–10 years, with a peak around 5–6 years, consistent with this patient's age [^116hzsD2].

- **Seizure semiology**: Brief episodes of staring with impaired responsiveness, often accompanied by subtle automatisms such as eye blinking, are characteristic of absence seizures [^117LpWp1].

- **Frequency**: Multiple daily episodes (10–20/day) are common in childhood absence epilepsy [^notfound].

- **Postictal state**: Absence seizures typically resolve abruptly without confusion or fatigue, aligning with the mother's report of the child returning to normal immediately after episodes.

---

## EEG findings supporting absence seizure

The EEG demonstrates a **3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave discharge**, which is the hallmark of absence seizures and childhood absence epilepsy [^113DPskU]. This pattern is typically bilateral, synchronous, and symmetric, further supporting the diagnosis of generalized epilepsy [^116zeMXv].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Febrile seizure | Febrile seizures occur in the context of fever and typically resolve by age 5–6 years. This patient has afebrile episodes, making febrile seizures unlikely [^113edcJA]. |
| Benign focal epilepsy | Benign focal epilepsy (e.g. benign Rolandic epilepsy) presents with focal seizures and focal EEG abnormalities. This patient has generalized EEG findings, inconsistent with focal epilepsy [^11382UGV]. |
| Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy | Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy typically begins in adolescence (ages 12–18 years) and is characterized by myoclonic jerks, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and absence seizures. This patient's age and absence of myoclonic jerks make juvenile myoclonic epilepsy unlikely [^113DPskU]. |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **childhood absence epilepsy** (absence seizure), supported by the clinical presentation and characteristic EEG findings [^116hzsD2]. Management typically involves antiepileptic medications such as ethosuximide, valproic acid, or lamotrigine, and the prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate treatment [^113DPskU].

Autism spectrum disorder — additional evaluations and consultations: Unusual features in the child (e.g., history of regression, dysmorphology, staring spells, family history) should prompt additional evaluations, with potential organic etiologies spanning infectious, endocrinologic, metabolic, traumatic, toxic, or genetic categories. Certain developmental disorders, most notably Landau-Kleffner syndrome, also should be ruled out; in this condition, a highly distinctive EEG abnormality is present and associated with development of a marked aphasia. Genetic or neurologic consultation, neuroimaging, EEG, and additional laboratory tests should be obtained when relevant based on examination or history, for example testing for the MeCP2 gene in possible Rett's disorder.

First nonfebrile seizure — electroencephalography (EEG): Multiple Class I studies address prognosis after a first seizure, with findings that epileptiform discharges or focal slowing predict recurrence, and in cryptogenic first seizures "54% of 103 children" with an abnormal EEG recurred versus "25% of 165" with a normal EEG (p < 0.001). A Class I study found that an EEG within 24 hours detected epileptiform abnormalities more often than later testing (51% versus 34%). Several studies report EEG information is useful for diagnosis of the event, identification of a specific syndrome, and prediction of long-term outcome. "Inclusion of both an awake and a sleep tracing, as well as hyperventilation and photo stimulation, are recommended by the American EEG Society, as they increase the yield of abnormalities seen on EEG tracings". Two Class II adult studies indicated that interpretation was difficult with diffuse postictal slowing and that an EEG done at that time was not helpful in determining which patients should be admitted to the hospital. A recent analysis "concluded that an EEG should not be routinely performed after a first seizure", but it assumed an "80% risk of recurrence" threshold; where EEG is used as one of several variables, it "can identify children with very high and very low recurrence risks".

### Practice parameter: evaluating a first nonfebrile seizure in children: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, the Child Neurology Society, and the American Epilepsy Society [^112abTfd]. Neurology (2000). Medium credibility.

First nonfebrile seizure in children — electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation and timing: Evidence from Class I and Class II studies confirms that an EEG helps in determination of seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, and risk for recurrence and may affect management, and experts commonly recommend that an EEG be performed after all first nonfebrile seizures; the EEG is recommended as part of the neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with an apparent first unprovoked seizure (Standard). Optimal timing is uncertain, but an EEG done within 24 hours of the seizure is most likely to show abnormalities, while abnormalities such as postictal slowing on EEG done within 24 to 48 hours may be transient and must be interpreted with caution. There is no evidence that the EEG must be done before discharge from the emergency department and it may be arranged on an outpatient basis; epileptiform EEG abnormalities may be useful in confirming that the event was a seizure, yet an abnormality alone is not sufficient to diagnose an epileptic seizure and its absence cannot rule out a seizure. The EEG is necessary to determine the epilepsy syndrome, which may help determine the need for imaging studies, and the EEG is also useful in predicting prognosis for recurrences.

### Limited role for routine EEG in the assessment of staring in children with autism spectrum disorder [^113bRrCD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

The assessment of staring episodes in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is difficult due to the range of diagnostic possibilities, the increased frequency of epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram (EEG), and the inability of normal EEG to exclude seizures. We reviewed the diagnostic use of routine EEG in this setting.

Method

The routine EEG database of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne was searched for recordings during 2005–2010 in children with ASD below 16years of age who were referred for staring. EEG reports and recordings were reviewed and epileptiform activity was characterised.

Results

Ninety-two EEGs in children with ASD were requested for episodes of staring. No child had absence or focal dyscognitive seizures confirmed on EEG. Findings were normal or showed non-epileptiform abnormalities in 80 children. Interictal epileptiform abnormalities were recorded in 12 children, but were judged potentially significant in only three. Seven children had epileptiform activity typical of benign focal epilepsy of childhood, such discharges seen not uncommonly in developmentally normal and delayed children without seizures.

Interpretation

Given the difficulties of performing EEG in children with ASD, the low yield of positive diagnostic findings and the high frequency of insignificant abnormalities, we suggest that EEG should be undertaken judiciously when evaluating children with ASD and staring episodes.

PEDIATRIC USE:

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established

GERIATRIC USE:

Clinical studies on this product have not been performed in sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually staring at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Results

Clinical presentation

A 9-year-old Brazilian boy presented with episodes of flaccid muscle paralysis. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. He experienced absence seizures with ocular aversion from age 4 months. These were initially resistant to treatment with status epilepticus occurring at age 1 year but eventually controlled with a combination of sodium valproate and levetiracetam. Seizures recurred with increasing age and increased drug doses were required. He had delayed motor milestones, not walking independently until 2 years 9 months, and speech delay with learning difficulties. At age 2 years he woke with tetraparesis and dysphagia lasting several hours, concomitant with a lower respiratory tract infection. Symptoms resolved with the infection and no specific diagnosis was made. He had two similar episodes at ages 3 and 4 years lasting several days. Episodes became increasingly frequent, averaging 5–10 per month. Paralysis attacks were bilateral, not associated with migraine or headache, occurred usually on waking and lasted hours to days. Triggers included carbohydrate meals and viral illness. Creatine kinase ranged from 382 to 1793 IU/l. Serum potassium was low (2.4 mM) during symptoms. Routine electrocardiogram was normal. A muscle biopsy undertaken shortly after an attack showed evidence of a non-specific myopathic process (Fig. 1 A). Brain MRI was normal at 5 months but at 7 years demonstrated increased prominence of the ventricular system with bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. EEG initially demonstrated epileptic activity although normalized on treatment. Routine EMG and nerve conduction study were normal but compound muscle action potential during an attack was significantly reduced compared to post-attack level, confirming peripheral impairment of neuromuscular function. Symptoms of paralysis improved with potassium supplements but were significantly worsened by acetazolamide.

### Neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with a simple febrile seizure [^113edcJA]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Background — simple febrile seizures definition and epidemiology indicate that a febrile seizure is accompanied by fever with temperature ≥ 100.4°F or 38°C by any method, occurs in infants and children 6 through 60 months of age without central nervous system infection, and febrile seizures occur in 2% to 5% of all children. Simple febrile seizures were defined as primary generalized seizures that lasted for less than 15 minutes and did not recur within 24 hours, whereas complex febrile seizures were defined as focal, prolonged (≥ 15 minutes), and/or recurrent within 24 hours. After a simple febrile seizure, the risk of epilepsy was only slightly higher than that of the general population, the chief risk was recurrence in one-third of the children, and authors concluded that simple febrile seizures are benign events with excellent prognoses.

### Staring spells: an age-based approach toward differential diagnosis [^115djTNb]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Evaluations to rule out epileptic vs nonepileptic staring spells may entail unnecessary evaluations that can be costly and time consuming. Our study aims to identify common etiologies for staring spells across 3 different pediatric age groups and to propose an age-based clinical guidance to help determine which patients warrant further workup. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective chart analysis of 1496 patients aged 0.0–17.9 years presenting with confirmed staring spell diagnosis from January 2011 to January 2021. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on their age: 0.0–2.9, 3.0–12.9, and 13.0–17.9 years. Patient information collected included demographics, clinical presentation, comorbidities, and final diagnosis. Multilevel likelihood ratios and a receiver operating characteristic curve were determined using 8 of the 11 clinical variables. A total of 1142 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included for the final analysis. The most common final diagnosis was attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35%), followed by normal behavior (33%). Generalized and focal epilepsy were diagnosed in 8% and 4% of the patients, respectively. In the 0.0–2.9-year age group, normal behavior was the final diagnosis in 72% patients. In the 3.0–12.9-year and 13.0–17.9-year age groups, ADHD was the most frequent final diagnosis in 46% and 60%, respectively. Overall, ADHD and normal behaviors remain the most common final diagnoses. Multilevel likelihood ratios can be used to develop an age-based guidance to differentiate between epileptic and nonepileptic staring spell diagnoses.

### Functional definition of seizure provides new insight into post-traumatic epileptogenesis [^115DBD4Z]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
Clinical features of pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients presenting short neocortical seizures

Patient 1 (Fig. 8 A) is a 19-year-old man who suffered severe traumatic brain injury at six years of age from a sporting accident. The first recognized convulsive seizure occurred a few weeks later, and others followed every few months. Complex partial seizures consisting of fluttering of eyes, confusion and speech impairments also occurred frequently but were not initially recognized. They were later noted to occur several times per week and were found to be refractory to several anti-epileptic drugs. Invasive monitoring confirmed the ictal sites to be in left inferior frontal region. The patient was seizure-free after surgery. Patient 2 (Fig. 8 B) is a 31-year-old woman who sustained severe closed head injury, from a motor-vehicle accident, at age 2. Seizures were diagnosed at age 23. Typical complex partial seizures started with a period of staring and unresponsiveness, with head turning towards the right, which could be followed by body hemiclonic movements and tonic–clonic convulsions. Seizures were refractory to several anti-epileptic drugs. Invasive monitoring confirmed the onset of the typical complex partial seizures to be in the left lateral superior frontal region. The patient was seizure-free after surgery. Both Patients 1 and 2 presented short electrographic seizures originating in the same ictal site as the longer complex partial seizures, which were distant from motor areas. These brief seizures were not reported by patients, nor were they associated with any detectable external behaviour, but were electrographically identical to the onset of the patient's longer complex partial seizures. Patient 3 (Fig. 8 C) was a 22-year-old man, with long standing developmental delay who suffered from as many as 100 complex partial or secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures per month. Scalp video-EEG monitoring demonstrated typical focal seizures lasting > 1 min and with onset suspected to be in the left lateral frontoparietal neocortex. During ECoG monitoring, several of the patient's typical complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures were captured, but it also became clear that the patient suffered many shorter seizures manifested only by brief runs of right eye blinking ('twitching') that were often unnoticed by the patient but recognized by family members as the earliest signs of seizures. Additional surface skin EMG electrodes were placed peri-orbitally to the right eye to capture the earliest clinical manifestations of seizures. Eye-twitching episodes, lasting < 5 s, each correlated with brief discharges limited to a few contacts over the left sensori-motor cortex. The ECoG changes appeared to precede EMG changes by ∼200 ms. Patient 4 (Fig. 8 D) was a 47-year-old woman, with a history of perinatal infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory, and subsequent cerebral palsy with mild left spastic hemiparesis. The patient experienced two dozen complex partial seizures and two secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures per month. The seizures lasted > 1 min and were manifested by movements on the left side including left hand twitching and posturing. Scalp video-EEG monitoring captured multiple focal simple and complex partial seizures suspected to begin in the right lateral hemispheric neocortex. Invasive ECoG monitoring was carried out with additional skin surface electrodes placed over left forearm, upper arm, face and leg areas to identify the earliest clinical manifestations of the seizures. Monitoring showed typical complex partial seizures with onset in the contralateral primary motor cortex. The patient also had brief simple partial motor seizures with cortical ECoG signals lasting < 2 s with associated EMG activity from the contralateral pectoralis muscle. Both Patients 3 and 4 presented short electrographic seizures originating in the same ictal site, within sensory-motor areas, as the longer complex partial seizures. These brief seizures were similar in ECoG appearance to the initial portion of longer complex partial seizures, and were accompanied by evident ictal behaviour consisting of twitching of the corresponding contralateral muscles as confirmed by simultaneous skin-EMG recordings.

### Paroxysmal eyelid movements: a confusing feature of generalized photosensitive epilepsy [^111q2N38]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent, frequent, nonepileptic paroxysmal eyelid movements were observed in 19 children and adults with well-controlled generalized epilepsy.

Methods

Patients were identified from five epilepsy centers.

Results

Seventeen patients were female and two male. All had generalized photosensitive epilepsy requiring antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In two children, paroxysmal eyelid movements began 2 to 4 years before their epilepsy was noted; in the remainder, it was noted when epilepsy was first diagnosed. Age at last follow-up was 8 to 38 years (average 21 years) with average follow-up of 9 years. All patients showed photosensitive generalized spike-wave discharges on EEG. Paroxysmal eyelid movements were a source of diagnostic confusion, but direct examination and video during EEG recording distinguished the attacks from absence seizures. In all cases, the epilepsy is completely or nearly completely controlled with AEDs, but the paroxysmal eyelid movements have not resolved with age. In 12 cases, there was a family history of the eyelid disorder without epilepsy. Videos of patients and an affected parent are available on the Neurology Web site.

Conclusion

There is an association between paroxysmal eyelid movements and photosensitive generalized epilepsy, creating diagnostic confusion.

### CDKL5 gene-related epileptic encephalopathy: electroclinical findings in the first year of life [^116KuN2U]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene abnormalities cause an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. We performed video-electroencephalography (video-EEG) monitoring early in the course of CDKL5-related epileptic encephalopathy in order to examine the early electroclinical characteristics of the condition.

Method

We used video-EEG to monitor six infants (five females, one male) with CDKL5-related epileptic encephalopathy (five mutations; one deletion), at ages 45 days to 12 months and followed them up to the ages of 14 months to 5 years (mean age 23 mo). We focused our analysis on the first year of life. The results were evaluated against those of a comparison group of nine infants (aged below 1y) with epileptic encephalography who had tested negative for CDKL5 mutations and deletions.

Results

One infant exhibited normal background activity, three exhibited moderate slowing, and two exhibited a suppression burst pattern. Two participants had epileptic spasms and four had a stereotyped complex seizure pattern, which we defined as a 'prolonged' generalized tonic-clonic event consisting of a tonic-tonic/vibratory contraction, followed by a clonic phase with series of spasms, gradually translating into repetitive distal myoclonic jerks. Seizure duration ranged from 2 to 4 minutes. The EEG correlate of each clinical phase included an initial electrodecremental event (tonic vibratory phase), irregular series of sharp waves and spike slow waves (clonic phase with series of spasms), and bilateral rhythmic sharp waves (time locked with myoclonus).

Interpretation

Infants with CDKL5-related early epileptic encephalopathy can present in the first year of life with an unusual electroclinical pattern of 'prolonged' generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

### Paradoxical exacerbation of myoclonic-astatic seizures by levetiracetam in myoclonic astatic epilepsy [^111vHB3B]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Case 1

AA is a 3 years 3 months old girl, with a history of new onset unprovoked nocturnal and diurnal GTCs with no focal onset for which treatment with valproate was initiated. At her initial evaluation at AUBMC, she had a normal psychomotor development, normal physical and neurological examinations, and a history of epilepsy in a maternal uncle as her only risk factor for epilepsy. A three-hour sleep deprived EEG revealed a normal awake background rhythm, and fragments of generalized spike and wave discharges. Brain MRI was normal except for a non-specific faint high FLAIR signal in the peritrigonal white matter. Two months later, the patient started to develop myoclonic jerks of the upper extremities associated with hiccup noise followed by head drops and falls five times daily (the parents described the child as limp when falling) resulting in multiple head and bodily injuries. A repeat three-hour video/EEG recording revealed the presence of frequent, 2.5–3.5 Hz generalized, frontally predominant spike and wave discharges. Treatment with LEV was initiated at 250 mg BID (31 mg/kg/day). Three days later, the parents noted that the frequency of the myoclonic jerks followed by head drop and falls increased to 10 times daily and then to 15 times daily when the dose of LEV was further increased to 375 mg BID (47 mg/kg/day). The dose of LEV was reduced to 250 mg BID with a rapid reduction of myoclonic-atonic seizures back to 10 times daily. LEV was tapered and discontinued and treatment with ethosuximide was initiated with complete resolution of her seizures and complete normalization of her EEG.

Table 4 — Triage indications warranting evaluation or referral — neurologic and sensory symptoms in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis (SWN) include the following examples. Headaches described as worsening, with vomiting, present when waking, associated with change in vision, and not relieved by pain medications are linked to NF1 - optic glioma or intracranial lesion, hydrocephalus, cerebrovascular complications, Moyamoya and NF2 - intracranial lesion. Seizures/Staring Spells with new onset or worsening correspond to NF1 - intracranial lesion, Moyamoya and NF2 - intracranial lesion. Vision with rapid change is associated with NF1 - optic glioma, Moyamoya and NF2 - cataracts, intracranial, intraocular or optic nerve lesion. Hearing loss/deafness or tinnitus that is sudden or unilateral is associated with NF2 - vestibular schwannoma. Balance/coordination with loss of balance is associated with NF1 - intracranial lesion, hydrocephalus and NF2 - vestibular schwannoma or intracranial lesion.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^111giW8U]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Phenotype

Step 1. Is it a movement disorder?

The first step is to distinguish normal, physiological developmental motor patterns and pathological movement disorders. Infantile fidgety movements and startles resembling chorea and myoclonus normally disappear around the age of 3 months. 4 Dystonic‐like features may appear from birth and can persist until the age of 16 years. 4 The development of goal‐directed movements (3–6mo) coincides with the occurrence of ataxic‐like features which can persist until the age of 12 years. 4 It may be difficult to distinguish physiological developmental motor patterns from pathological movement disorders. Children should be monitored to evaluate how the movement pattern develops. In general, physiological patterns will subside with typical psychomotor development. Besides developmental features, other neurological diseases (such as epilepsy) may resemble movement disorders.

Step 2. Classify the movement disorder phenotype and which movement disorder is the most prominent

The second step is to classify the movement disorder phenotype and denote which movement disorder is the most prominent. Clinical clues can be used to distinguish between different movement disorder phenotypes. Movement disorders are classified into three major groups: hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders and ataxia. In children, hyperkinetic movement disorders are more prevalent and include tics, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. Hypokinetic movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are rare in children. Ataxia is not a hypo‐ or hyperkinetic movement disorder, but includes disorganized and poorly executed movements, and is relatively common in children. 5

Hyperkinetic movement disorders

Tics

Tics are defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, non‐rhythmic movements or vocalizations (Video S1, online supporting information; descriptions of the videos are found in Appendix S1, online supporting information). 6 A distinction is made between motor and phonic tics and each is subdivided as simple or complex. Simple motor tics comprise a single muscle or localized muscle group, such as eye blinking. Complex motor tics involve either a cluster of simple actions or a coordinated sequence of movements. Simple phonic tics include sounds and noises such as humming or sniffing, whereas complex phonic tics comprise the repetition of words, syllables, or phrases. Positive clues are a waxing and waning course, worsening by stress or excitement, the report of a premonitory sensation, and brief voluntary suppressibility followed by a rebound. 1, 7

### Infantile-onset paroxysmal dystonia: a diagnostic dilemma [^116SctfM]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old boy presented with a history of paroxysmal dystonic posturing since birth. Episodes were triggered by stress, fatigue, and cold. Sleep, for as short as 1 minute, resulted in complete resolution of dystonia. He was developmentally normal, with no focal neurologic deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid, homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were borderline low. On ictal spectroscopy, there was reduced blood flow to the right temporal region, caudate nuclei, and thalami. The typical infantile form of dystonia is benign, resolving by 2 years of age in an otherwise normal child. Our patient remains symptomatic at 4 years of age.

### Neurophysiological findings in a newborn with chromosome 10 trisomy [^1178bPdS]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 10 is a rare condition. The phenotypic expression of this genetic aberration is characterised by growth and mental retardation with several neurological signs. We report the neurophysiological findings in a newborn affected by 10p chromosome trisomy who developed seizures. Serial EEGs showed a progressive reduction in burst-suppression activity and a slow rhythmic basal activity. At 1 year of age the recording showed for the first time spikes of high amplitude (up to 800 μV) in bilateral frontal regions. These findings could be related to an asymmetrical cerebral maturation in the context of perinatal sufferance and brain malformation due to the genetic aberration.

### 'Refractory epilepsy': what lies beneath? [^115qfYAy]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 30-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with recurrent seizures for 5 days. She had been diagnosed with epilepsy 2 years previously but stopped treatment due to the side effects of her medications. She was now experiencing episodes every 15–30 min. While undergoing a brain MRI to investigate for structural central nervous system pathology, she experienced another episode, preceded by prodromal symptoms. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was noted during the event. Further investigation revealed a normal QT interval, normal electrolyte panel, normal coronaries and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Cardiac MRI revealed non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The patient was managed with heart failure and antiarrhythmic medications and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. She remained symptom free at 6-month follow-up. This case highlights the importance of differentiating between cardiogenic syncope and epilepsy and reiterates the importance of re-evaluating a diagnosis of epilepsy when presentation is atypical or symptoms are refractory.

Case presentation

The proband was a 1-year and 11-month old boy at the time of admission. He is the third child with two healthy elder brothers of a non-consanguineous marriage, born after full-term by normal delivery, with a birth weight of 3000 g and allergy history of cephalosporin. No other members in the family have seizures. Nothing abnormal was observed in the perinatal period. Motor development and language development were mildly delayed before the onset of seizures, with an unbalanced gait and dual tone. The first two seizure episodes occurred within half a day when the temperature reached 39 °C at 1-year and 10-month old, which presented with generalized tonic-clonic, lasting for about 2 min per episode. Subsequently, the convulsion occurred twice during the following week without fever or other inducements. Twenty days later, the convulsion occurred again and presented as tonic of four limbs. Then the convulsion occurred more frequently (10–20/day) with varied epileptic seizure types such as myoclonic, atypical absence, atonic seizures a week before admission into our clinical center.

### Congenital long QT syndrome caused by a KCNH2 pathogenic variant exhibiting "motor seizures": a case report and literature review [^113MyBXC]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 10-year-old boy presented with a 2-year history of intermittent loss of consciousness, which had worsened over the previous week. Two years earlier, he had experienced his first episode of nocturnal loss of consciousness without an identifiable cause. The event was characterized by rightward deviation of both eyes; cyanosis of the lips; guttural vocalizations; stiffness and tremors in the upper limbs; and urinary incontinence, which lasted approximately one minute before resolution. Subsequently, the patient reported transient dizziness and headache, which resolved after rest. These episodes initially occurred approximately once every 6 months. One week before admission, the frequency of episodes had increased to daily occurrences during both wakefulness and sleep. Each episode was preceded by dizziness, and the clinical manifestations were consistent with prior events. The patient denied any psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairment between episodes. His past medical and family histories were unremarkable.

On admission, the physical examination results were unexceptional. Laboratory evaluations, including peripheral blood cells and thyroid function test results, were within normal limits. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (5 × 10⁶/L) with normal protein concentration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including T2/FLAIR sequences, revealed no abnormalities.

Video electroencephalogram (VEEG) monitoring recorded two clinical episodes. Each episode was preceded by a 10-s aura of headache and dizziness. The patient then exhibited loud vocalizations, random limb movements with occasional excessive motor activity, followed by limb flaccidity, rightward deviation of the eyes and head, intermittent upper limb flexion or generalized limb extension, and rapid breathing. The episodes lasted approximately 2–3 min and resolved spontaneously. Post-episode, the patient gradually regained consciousness, and he reported dizziness and headache. The background VEEG demonstrated normal activity, with a 9–10 Hz alpha rhythm observed in the bilateral occipital regions. During the interictal sleep period, 1.5–2 Hz delta waves were identified in the bilateral frontal poles, frontal regions, and midline frontal regions. The ictal VEEG revealed a distinct pattern of "generalized slow waves - low voltage - generalized slow waves - low voltage - generalized slow waves" (Fig. 1).

### Normally developed infant with a suppression burst pattern on electroencephalography in the neonatal period [^115aWDkJ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The background activity on neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) is a good prognostic indicator. An EEG suppression burst pattern usually indicates severe brain dysfunction and has been considered to be associated with a serious neurodevelopmental outcome. We report here a 2-year-old girl who developed generalized convulsions without any perinatal brain insult at 3 days of age. At that time, her EEG constantly showed a suppression burst pattern, and her prognosis was considered to be poor. However, her seizures were well controlled with the oral administration of carbamazepine, and the suppression burst pattern on EEG disappeared at 27 days of age. Unexpectedly, she developed normally for the following 2 years. Although children with normal development, despite the appearance of suppression burst, are extremely rare, and the reason why this patient showed a favorable outcome remains unknown, the clinical course of this patient proved that an EEG suppression burst pattern is not always associated with a poor prognosis.

### Misleading focal clinical, neurophysiologic, and imaging features in 2 children with generalized epilepsy who underwent invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring [^116ZjnfP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Children and adults with genetic generalized epilepsy may have focal clinical seizure symptoms as well as electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. This may pose a diagnostic challenge to clinicians, especially when concomitant focal neuroimaging findings exist and the epilepsy is medically refractory. We sought to highlight the challenges that clinicians may face through the description of 2 children with suspected genetic generalized epilepsy who had both focal seizure symptoms and EEG/neuroimaging findings and underwent invasive EEG monitoring. Ultimately, invasive monitoring failed to demonstrate a focal origin for the seizures in both cases, and instead confirmed the presence of genetic generalized epilepsy. We demonstrate that ≥ 3-Hz generalized monomorphic spike and waves are less likely to represent secondary bilateral synchrony, that focal neuroimaging findings may not always be causal and that repeated hyperventilation is an essential activation procedure for genetic generalized epilepsy.

### What is the impact of a novel DEPDC5 variant on an infant with focal epilepsy: a case report [^116Vyd3x]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The male infant was born to healthy non-consanguineous parents. There was no discovered family history of epilepsy or other nervous system diseases. The patient was the only child of his family. He was born at term with no asphyxia after an uneventfully pregnancy. His weight and body length were within the normal range at birth. The neonatal period was unremarkable. And up to now, there has been no problem with the patient's developmental milestones.

At the age of 5 months, the infant appeared the first afebrile epileptic seizure, which happened when he was sleeping. It lasted for 10 s approximately. And it was characterized by eyes blinking frequently, followed by binocular gaze and the tonic seizure of right upper limb. Asking for past medical history, we found it worth noting that the patient showed short-lasting symptom of blinking about half of a month ago. While, it failed to draw the attention of his parents. Physical examinations and the laboratory examinations showed no abnormality. The blood and urine metabolic screenings were normal as well. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed widened extracerebral space and widening of the beginning of left lateral fissure cistern. A video-electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed epileptiform discharges with spikes and sharp waves over the right frontal area (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The abnormal EEG picture of proband. Epileptiform discharges with sharp wave (marked with a red circle) over the right frontal area were revealed. The amplitude was 93.8 μV and the timing was 82 ms

Before the infant received effective treatment, he experienced 9 times focal seizures with similar symptoms. The epileptic seizure usually happened before sleep or during sleeping period. In order to control the epileptic seizure, the patient received a treatment of phenobarbital (5 mg/kg) at first. However, the seizure wasn't controlled until topiramate was applied. 5 months later, a follow-up review found that epileptic seizure had not occurred to the infant since he discharged from the hospital. And 6 months later, the re-examine of video-EEG showed nothing unusual. The psychomotor development didn't show retardation or decline. So far, the patient has been seizure-free for 7 months.

### Clinical whole-genome sequencing in severe early-onset epilepsy reveals new genes and improves molecular diagnosis [^116ySfey]. Human Molecular Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Many recent studies have successfully used whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) to uncover the genetic basis of rare disorders (reviewed by,), primarily in a research context. In addition, WES and WGS offer potentially revolutionary approaches to molecular diagnosis for patients in a clinical setting. In order to assess the possible clinical utility of WGS, we have sequenced the genomes of 500 individuals with a variety of medical conditions, including cancer, immunological disease and rare, putatively monogenic syndromes. As part of this 'WGS500 project', we sequenced six patients with severe early-onset epilepsy who had been previously refractory to molecular diagnosis.

Severe early-onset epilepsy is a good candidate for WGS as it is a challenging disorder to understand mechanistically. It represents a broad spectrum of phenotypes which are highly heterogeneous at the clinical and molecular levels. While some causative genes have been identified for many of these sub-phenotypes, the limitations of current technologies mean that genetic testing is largely confined to the genes associated with the specific presenting phenotype. However, it is increasingly being recognized that a given gene can cause multiple phenotypes, and that more comprehensive genetic testing may improve molecular diagnostic yield. This is useful clinically not only because it can help make or confirm a diagnosis, but also because it may allow counseling on recurrence risk and prenatal testing.

In its most severe form, early-onset epilepsy involves frequent seizures beginning in the first three months of life, with abundant epileptic activity that contributes to significant cognitive and motor delay. It is frequently associated with gross structural brain abnormalities and occasionally with metabolic disorders, which are often genetic in origin. Ohtahara Syndrome (OS) is a severe form of early-onset epilepsy characterized by a distinctive electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern known as 'burst-suppression', which consists of periodic high voltage bursts of slow waves mixed with spikes, followed by marked attenuation. The frequency of OS is about 1 in 100 000 live births. Children with OS typically have multiple seizure types including tonic spasms and focal seizures, which are often refractory to anti-epileptic drugs. Affected children may progress onto other epilepsy syndromes such as West Syndrome, or they may die in infancy.

### Electroencephalographic (EEG) photoparoxysmal responses under 5 years of age: diagnostic implications and peculiarities [^11742nTs]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) photoparoxysmal response has been little investigated in very young patients. We studied 5055 patients aged less than 5 years with no acquired brain damage, who underwent EEG recording. We determined the prevalence and significance of photoparoxysmal response induced by 1 to 20 Hz photic stimulation. Fifty-three showed photoparoxysmal response and were diagnosed as having Dravet syndrome (11), epileptic encephalopathy with myoclonic seizures (8), neurodegenerative disorders (8), benign idiopathic epilepsies (9), and static disorders with a known or suspected genetic origin (17). Photoparoxysmal response occurred in response to 1 to 5 Hz trains in 41.5% subjects. In most patients with epileptic encephalopathies, photoparoxysmal response was a transient finding: in 53.2%, it failed to be replicated in the recordings performed more than 6 months after initial evaluation. Photoparoxysmal response is rare in patients aged less than 5 years and has some peculiarities such as occurrence with low-frequency stimuli. Its distribution in specific conditions indicates that photoparoxysmal response may be useful in diagnostic workup.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^112pXtDZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

We attempted a third diagnostic session of PSG with full-montage of video-EEG and simultaneous 24-h gastric pH monitoring in order to exclude the possibility of GERD. Out of 6 choking episodes, 4 were associated with low-amplitude 13–14 Hz fast activities in the right or left frontal areas (Fz, F3, F4) that evolved into medium-to-high-amplitude bi-frontal sharp wave discharges intermixed with 6–7 Hz activities in the posterior cerebral region. Accompanying obscuring muscle artifacts were observed and presented as sudden eye opening and right arm tonicity, followed by breath-holding with or without agitation and gagging (Fig. 1a, b). Several low pH (< 4) events were observed on simultaneous 24-h pH monitoring; however, these episodes did not coincide with the nocturnal breath-holding spells. The patient was diagnosed with frontal lobe epilepsy and experienced complete resolution of her nocturnal symptoms after intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg of sodium valproate, and then, the patient was prescribed oral valproate (Depakoke15mg/kg/day, twice a day). 1 month later, the patient had added topiramate. On follow up until 1 year after, it had been reported that the patient's symptoms were well controlled with only sporadic manifestation of nocturnal episodes.

### Staring spells: how to distinguish epileptic seizures from nonepileptic staring [^112Y9GGC]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the nature of staring spells and factors distinguishing epileptic from nonepileptic staring spells, we studied the clinical and demographic features of children with staring spells referred to a regional new-onset seizure clinic.

Study Design

Our retrospective chart review encompassed 2818 consecutive patients evaluated in the new-onset seizure clinic between September 22, 2015, and March 19, 2018. We identified 121 patients with newly presenting staring spells.

Results

Sixty-two of 121 (51%) children were diagnosed with nonepileptic staring spells and 59 (49%) with epileptic seizures (24 with absence epilepsy, 35 with focal epilepsy). Patients with nonepileptic staring spells were younger (4.8 vs 7.1 years, P = 0.001) and more likely to have developmental delay (P = 0.005) than the seizure group. There was an 8.9-month delay on average from the onset of staring spells to the new-onset seizure clinic visit. The emergency department was a referral source for 80% (28/35) of focal seizures. In children with focal seizures, the staring spells typically lasted > 1minute (29/35, 83%), whereas only 19 of 62 (31%) of children with nonepileptic staring spells had events lasting this long (P = 0.04). All children had a routine electroencephalography (EEG) on the day of new-onset seizure clinic visit. EEG was diagnostic in 100% (24/24) of absence seizures and 51% (18/35) of focal seizures.

Conclusions

In children presenting with staring spells, the differential diagnosis of epileptic staring spells vs nonepileptic staring spells can be made by history and routine EEG. Staring was as likely to be epileptic as nonepileptic spells. Younger children with developmental delay were more likely to have nonepileptic events. Our simple approach based on event duration, postictal symptoms, and EEG allowed identification of epileptic staring on first visit to new-onset seizure clinic but requires validation in future prospective studies including long-term video EEG monitoring and follow-up.

### Variants ingene associated with epilepsy with favourable outcome [^112M33rq]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of the cases with BSN variants

In total, BSN variants were identified in eight cases involving 10 affected individuals. All probands showed infancy or childhood-onset epilepsy (the onset age ranging from 10 months old to 3 years old), with the exception in case 1 who started seizures at early adolescence. Eight out of 10 affected individuals had a history of febrile convulsions. All the cases but case 4 had normal development. The brain MRI in all the cases was normal. The representative EEG is shown in figure 2. Their clinical features are summarised in table 2.

Figure 2
Representative interictal EEG in the cases with BSN mutations. Interictal EEG of case 1 showed generalised 3–4 Hz spike slow waves. Interictal EEG of case 2 showed central midline area discharges. Interictal EEG of case 4 showed left frontal discharges and bilateral frontocentral slow activities. Interictal EEG of case 5 showed irregular generalised spike-and-slow waves. Interictal EEG of case 8 showed generalised spike-and-slow waves.

Table 2
Clinical features of the individuals with BSN variants

Two probands (cases 1 and 5) were diagnosed as idiopathic generalised epilepsy, two (cases 2 and 4) as partial/focal epilepsy and the remaining four probands (cases 3 and 6–8) as epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. Additionally, the parents of cases 5 and 6 carrying BSN variants had febrile seizures.

All the cases were seizure-free. Among the four cases with monoallelic variants (cases 5–8), case 7 with p. Glu1108Ter was seizure-free without treatment, while the other three cases (cases 5, 6 and 8) were seizure-free with monotherapy. Among the four cases with biallelic variants (cases 1–4), one case (case 3) achieved seizure-free status with monotherapy, while three cases (cases 1, 2 and 4) were seizure-free with combined therapy. Case 4 with the deletion variant (p. Leu1454del) and the missense variant in C-terminus (p. Ala3642Val) presented frequent seizures and developmental delay (he could not sit alone and speak at early childhood). He was microcephalic with an occipitofrontal head circumference of 44.5 cm (−3.3 SD) at early childhood. He was finally seizure-free under the combination of levetiracetam, lamotrigine and valproate.

EEG Analysis

In this study, the first EEG recording performed at the time of the early diagnostic assessment, when patients were not yet on antiseizure medications, was evaluated. EEGs were recorded for 25–45 minutes with Biologic or Natus machines, using the international 10–20 system with a 256-Hz sampling rate and 0.5- to 70-Hz filters. The presence of mild background slowing, focal spikes, photoparoxysmal response, occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activity, polyspike wave discharges, and bifrontal slowing were documented. These findings are routinely coded in the EEG database. The primary investigators (AD, JC) reviewed all the initial EEG recordings to confirm the EEG findings coded in the database. In addition, the number and duration of seizures were manually counted, and the shortest and longest burst intervals were documented by reviewing the EEGs.

A normal EEG background was defined as evidence of a posterior dominant rhythm between 8 and 13 Hz during relaxed wakefulness. Polyspike wave discharges were defined as a sequence of multiple spikes that may be followed by a slow wave. They typically occurred in the form of high-amplitude rhythmic bursts with synchronized and generalized distribution. Photoparoxysmal response was defined as reproducible epileptiform discharges in response to photic stimulation that may or may not be self-sustaining. Occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activity was characterized by symmetrical or asymmetrical bursts of rhythmic, sinusoidal, 3-Hz, delta activity over the occipital region. Bifrontal slowing was defined as paroxysmal slowing in the bilateral midfrontal regions (Fz, F3, F4) in the awake state, predominantly monophasic single slow waves of 0.25- to 0.5-second duration (Figure 1). This did not occur during hyperventilation. This is distinct from hypnagogic hypersynchrony (HH): a normal variant in drowsiness characterized by intermittent or sustained rhythmic slowing maximal in the central region ranging from 3- to 5-Hz activity.

Seizure onset was defined as the time of the first spike of a well-formed GSW complex, and seizure offset was defined as the end of the slow wave after the last spike. GSW bursts lasting less than 3 seconds were not considered seizures, unless a clinical correlate was noted.

### Advances in opioid therapy and formulations [^1131krYo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Newly developed opioid analgesics and drug delivery systems may provide pain relief for patients intolerant of morphine. Long-acting oral opioids supply satisfactory analgesia at more convenient dosing intervals. Implantable pumps can provide full analgesic doses of opioids both subcutaneously and intrathecally over extended time periods. Optimal opioid use should rely on individualized dose-finding approaches to enhance pain relief while limiting drug-related side effects and avoiding the common problems associated with opioid prescription in clinical practice.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^116sweur]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) — definition, phenotypes, and manifestations are described as seizure activity seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) without clinical findings associated with GCSE; two distinct phenotypes include the "wandering confused" patient presenting to the emergency department with a relatively good prognosis or chronic epileptic syndromes, and the acutely ill patient with severely impaired mental status with or without subtle motor movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation in the setting of acute brain injury; for these guidelines the focus is on the acutely ill patient with impaired mental status, a type that frequently follows uncontrolled GCSE and is often encountered in the intensive care setting; the semiological spectrum is highly variable with negative symptoms including an increase in confusion, aphasia, lethargy, and staring, and positive symptoms including agitation/aggression, automatisms, blinking, crying, delirium, delusions, echolalia, facial twitching, laughter, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus/eye deviation, perseveration, psychosis, and tremulousness.

### Paradoxical exacerbation of myoclonic-astatic seizures by levetiracetam in myoclonic astatic epilepsy [^112MYD5t]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Case 2

WS is a 22 months old boy, born after an uneventful pregnancy and with normal psychomotor development, who presented with a history of 6 unprovoked afebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures over a period of 10 days. The parents also reported noticing multiple daily staring episodes, each lasting for approximately 10 seconds and associated with unresponsiveness and blinking. At the time of his presentation to the AUBMC, treatment with valproate was already initiated by the referring pediatric neurologist. His physical and neurological examinations were normal. There were no risk factors for epilepsy. A three-hour sleep deprived video/EEG recording revealed bursts of frontally predominant, 2–3 Hz generalized spike and wave discharges lasting typically between 2 and 5 seconds. Some discharges lasted up to 17 seconds and were clinically associated with absences. Brain MRI was normal. Due to the persistence of absence seizures, add-on treatment with LEV was initiated at 125 mg BID (21 mg/kg/day) by the referring physician. Two days later, the child started to experience brief myoclonic jerks, recurring in clusters and resulting in brief extension of the neck. As the dose of LEV was uptitrated to 500 mg/day (42 mg/kg/day), the parents started noticing frequent head drops (averaging 3–4 episodes/day) without falls sometimes preceded by myoclonic jerks of the upper extremities, but resolution of the staring episodes. A repeat EEG again showed short bursts of frontally predominant generalized irregular 2–3 Hz spike and wave activity and a myoclonic-astatic seizure was recorded. The dose of LEV was further increased to 750 mg/day (63 mg/kg/day) with a substantial increase in the frequency of the head drops, with an average of 7 such seizures witnessed by the parents on a daily basis. Reduction in the dose of LEV to 500 mg/day without change in concomitant medication resulted in a reduction in the frequency of the head drops to 3 events per day within 24 hours of the reduction in the LEV dose. Subsequently, treatment with ethosuximide was initiated and LEV was tapered and discontinued. This treatment regimen resulted in total cessation of seizures and total normalization of the EEG.

### Excessive blinking in childhood: a prospective evaluation of 99 children [^116hrGrV]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the characteristics and causes of excess blinking in children and to determine outcomes after treatment.

Design

Prospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series.

Participants

Ninety-nine consecutive children who presented for evaluation of excessive blinking over a 2 year period.

Methods

Children less than 16 years of age who had excessive blinking as their sole or major chief complaint underwent detailed history and ophthalmologic examination. Treatment was recommended based on clinical examination findings. Follow-up evaluations were performed at least 2 months after initial examination.

Main Outcome Measures

Etiology of excess blinking and patient characteristics in each diagnostic group.

Results

The majority (89%) of children presented with bilateral excessive blinking. Boys outnumbered girls at a ratio of almost 2:1. The most common etiologies were anterior segment and/or lid abnormalities (37%), habit tics (23%), uncorrected refractive errors (14%), intermittent exotropia (11%), and psycogenic blepharospasm (10%). A history of neurologic disease was present in 22% of the patients but was not causally related to the excessive blinking in most cases. Vision-threatening disease was noted in 6% and was easily detected on standard clinical examination. Life-threatening disease was the cause in 4% of the children, but the presence of life-threatening disease was already known in all such patients.

Conclusions

Excessive blinking in children can occur because of a large number of potential problems. Most cases are caused by benign and/or self-limiting conditions. The cause can usually be determined after careful history and clinical examination and routine neurologic evaluation and neuroimaging is unnecessary.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorder [^114RoQQV]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2010). Medium credibility.

Children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) evaluation — Recommendation 2 states: "If Screening Indicates Significant PTSD Symptoms, the Clinician Should Conduct a Formal Evaluation To Determine Whether PTSD Is Present, the Severity of Those Symptoms, and the Degree of Functional Impairment. Parents or Other Caregivers Should Be Included in This Evaluation Whenever Possible (MS)". The proper assessment of PTSD requires relatively more diligence and educational interviewing than perhaps for any other disorder, and few have experienced an overgeneralized fear reaction in the presence of a reminder of a life-threatening traumatic event in the past, or dissociative staring, or a sense of a foreshortened future; this would be especially true for nontraumatized parents responding about their children.

### Cortical myoclonus and epilepsy in a family with a new SLC20A2 mutation [^111WEZ1G]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The second brother (II:2) is now 24 years old. He had normal developmental milestones. At the age of 10 years, he had his first nocturnal GTCS and from the age of 12 he noted small myoclonic jerks of his hands. He was initially treated with CBZ, which failed to control seizures and worsened the jerks. He was then switched to VPA; LEV was added as seizure control was not complete. EEG performed at the age of 11 showed bursts of high voltage poly-spike and slow wave discharges, more frequent during drowsiness and during intermittent photic stimulation. From the age of 17 he had daytime GTCS and myoclonic jerks worsened. Clonazepam (up to 2 mg/day) was added to VPA (1200 mg/day) and LEV (500 mg/day), but myoclonus has never been controlled. Propranolol (40 mg/day) was added at the age of 20. A brain MRI performed at the age of 18 was normal. A neurophysiology study was performed at the age of 23 including an EEG-EMG (Fig. 2 d, e). No myoclonic jerks were seen at rest. When holding his arms against gravity and during action, 20 Hz myoclonic jerks lasting about 20 ms, and episodes of sudden loss of tone of about 100 ms, were recorded in all the EMG channels. These abnormal findings together with a positive C-reflex and giant SSEP, were consistent with cortical myoclonus (Fig. 2 f).

The mother I:2 has never reported psychiatric nor neurological symptoms.

### Clinical evaluation and diagnosis of severe epilepsy syndromes of early childhood [^11327qr2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The developing brain is particularly susceptible to seizures. Diffuse central nervous system pathology or injury in early infancy, when the brain is most vulnerable, may lead to catastrophic epilepsies such as Ohtahara's epileptic encephalopathy and early myoclonic epileptic encephalopathy. These epileptic encephalopathies are difficult to treat and have poor prognoses. As the brain undergoes programmed synaptogenesis, apoptosis, and myelination, the epilepsy phenotypes and electroencephalography (EEG) findings change, producing age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies. Specifically, as they grow older, 40% to 60% of infants with infantile spasms and a concomitant hypsarrhythmia on EEG will develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with tonic and atonic seizures, associated with a synchronous, generalized 1.5- to 2-Hz spike and slow wave discharges on EEG. In the context of age-dependent epileptic encephalopathies, as an epilepsy syndrome is evolving, it is often difficult to accurately diagnose the specific epilepsy syndrome in a young child who presents with seizures. It is the clinical evolution of the seizure types and the EEG that helps the clinician make an accurate diagnosis. As more is known about the underlying pathophysiology for the various epilepsy syndromes, not only the clinical picture and EEG but also a genetic blood test will be used to accurately diagnose a specific epilepsy syndrome. A case in point would be severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (classically known as Dravet syndrome) and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy-borderland/ borderline, which are associated with specific mutations in the sodium ion channel gene SCN1A.

### Epilepsies in infancy [^114Ue4fs]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

To evaluate and manage epileptic seizures and other paroxysmal events in infants, it is necessary to ask five key questions: (1) Is this a type of epilepsy?; (2) What seizure type(s) are occurring?; (3) Do these seizure types, combined with factors such as age at onset and EEG features, constitute an 'epilepsy syndrome'?; (4) What investigations do we need to do in searching for an underlying aetiology? and finally, (5) What is the prognosis for neurological and developmental state in later life? This review considers epilepsies that have an onset in infancy but after the perinatal period, outlines the commoner epilepsy syndromes occurring in this age group and describes paroxysmal events that can mimic epilepsy. Epilepsies in infancy may be the manifestation of a genetic predisposition associated with a benign course and good prognosis for neurodevelopment. In contrast, they may pose the challenging situation of 'epileptic encephalopathy', rare but potentially treatable metabolic conditions, or structural abnormalities with poor developmental outlook and intractable seizures. Seizures in infancy are relatively rare and there is a wide range of underlying causes, some of which require specific treatments to avoid preventable neurodevelopmental damage. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence suggests early referral of cases of infantile epilepsy to a tertiary centre.

### A novel epilepsy phenotype in a young girl with a pathogenicGene variant [^11382UGV]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Her mother described also episodes of blank staring, followed by spreading hypertonia with upward ocular deviation, recurring on a monthly basis, first interpreted as oppositional behaviors in a child with frail emotional regulation. However, episodes increased in frequency, associated with motor phenomena, that is, left head turning and axo-rhizomelic tonic posturing leading to falls. At 4 years of age, we performed prolonged video electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, which revealed abundant posterior spike-and-wave discharges, mainly centered in the right parieto-occipital areas, and independent left centroparietal spikes (Figure 1). We interpreted her paroxysmal disturbances as focal impaired-consciousness seizures and introduced levetiracetam 60 mg/kg/d. However, as behavioral worsening was reported, we switched treatment to valproic acid 30 mg/kg/d. After 14 months, the patient is seizure-free and the EEG normalized. Sporadic temper tantrums are still present, yet her behavioral profile has remarkably improved.

### Central nervous system hyperexcitability associated with glutamate dehydrogenase gain of function mutations [^113u6tXc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe seizure phenotypes associated with the hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia syndrome (HI/HA), which is caused by gain of function mutations in the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).

Study Design

A retrospective review of records of 14 patients with HI/HA.

Results

Nine patients had seizures as the first symptom of HI/HA, and six had seizures in the absence of hypoglycemia. No electroencephalogram (EEG) background abnormalities were identified. In four patients, EEG recordings during seizures in the setting of normal blood glucose contained generalized epileptiform discharges. EEGs of three of these patients showed 0.5- to 2-second generalized irregular spike-and-wave discharge at 3 to 6 Hz corresponding to eye blinks, eye rolling, or staring. The EEG of the fourth patient consisted of 20 seconds of generalized regular spike-and-wave discharge at 3 Hz in the clinical context of staring and unresponsiveness. In two patients, seizure control worsened with carbamezapine or oxcarbezapine treatment.

Conclusions

In patients with HI/HA, generalized seizures are common and can occur in the absence of hypoglycemia. The drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine should be used with caution for treatment. Pathogenesis of epilepsy in these patients may be related to effects of GDH mutations in the brain, perhaps in combination with effects of recurrent hypoglycemia and chronic hyperammonemia.

### GRIN2B mutations in west syndrome and intellectual disability with focal epilepsy [^115GqQmk]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Patient Phenotypes

Patient 1 was a male born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. Myoclonic jerks and infantile spasms occasionally occurring in clusters at the age of 4 months led to the diagnosis of West syndrome. At 6 months old, he held no eye contact and presented with episodic hyperextension of axial muscles. The result of first EEG was not available for review. EEG at age 8 months showed multifocal bursts of irregular spike waves as well as rhythmic bilateral generalized spike waves with a frequency of 4 to 5 per second reminiscent of modified hypsarrhythmia. During sleep, there was rare irregular high-amplitude epileptiform activity with a hypsarrhythmialike pattern. Treatment with vigabatrin and pyridoxine led to a slight clinical improvement. Replacement of vigabatrin by levetiracetam improved neither seizures (predominantly of myoclonic type) nor EEG pattern, whereas implementation of valproate finally led to a significant reduction of seizure frequency. At last follow-up at age of 2 years and 1 month, the boy's length was at P90, weight at P25, and head circumference at P50. He had severe axial hypotonia with episodic hyperextension and could not sit independently. He could hold eye contact only briefly before drifting away. At this time, the boy presented additionally with dystoniclike movements of his fingers and still had no verbal communication.

Patient 2 was a female born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. At the age of 7 weeks, she presented with infantile spasms. She held no eye contact and showed muscular hypotonia. She had episodic hyperextension of axial muscles. These episodes were not recorded on video EEG, and an epileptic nature could not be excluded. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cerebrospinal investigation, and metabolic workup were normal. EEG showed typical hypsarrhythmia. Treatment with vigabatrin, sulthiame, and topiramate failed to decrease seizures, whereas implementation of steroid pulse therapy led to an improvement. At last follow-up at age 5 years and 3 months, the girl is not able to sit independently. She presented with autisticlike behavior and no verbal expression, severe feeding difficulties, and mild microcephaly. The EEG showed increased theta activity without epileptic discharges. The girl still exhibits series of epileptic spasms as well as occasional generalized tonic–clonic seizures.

### Confounding diagnoses in the neurodevelopmental disabilities population: a child with hearing loss, absence epilepsy, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115Z3eJp]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of a school-age child with a history of hearing loss presenting with staring spells. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a pattern consistent with absence epilepsy, and the patient was started on antiepileptic medication with decreased frequency of staring spells but he then continued to have behavioral issues. The patient was diagnosed subsequently with combined-type attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and started on stimulant medication with subsequent improvement in attention and school performance. Multiple confounding diagnoses are common in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, and comprehensive evaluation is required for appropriate management.

### Dravet syndrome as epileptic encephalopathy: evidence from long-term course and neuropathology [^115hnWjE]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical condition and evolution in adulthood

From onset in infancy, there was no period of seizure freedom recorded. In two patients, recognition of a false 'seizure-free period' in childhood led to anti-epileptic drug cessation, but increased seizure severity and frequency led to recommencement of anti-epileptic drugs, and in retrospect the parents could recognize subtle seizures had never ceased to occur. All patients had multiple anti-epileptic drugs with differential control of different seizure types (Table 2), but not complete seizure freedom.

Table 2
Anti-epileptic drug history

There was an evolution of seizure semiology and predominance of certain seizure types with time. There was no single pattern for seizure evolution for all patients.

All patients had multiple seizure types in adulthood (Table 1). For 10 patients, seizures were mostly nocturnal and comprised brief tonic or tonic–clonic seizures. Seizures were recorded in video-EEG telemetry for 10 adults; seizures observed were complex motor, dyscognitive, tonic or secondarily generalized with focal EEG onset pattern or no recognizable EEG change. Myoclonus was not prominent in adulthood, though its frequency may have been under-reported. No adult patient in our series had documented absences; all 'absence-like' (dyscognitive) seizures recorded in adulthood had focal EEG onset or no EEG change documented. Fever sensitivity persisted into adulthood, with even slight variations of temperature sufficient to trigger seizures in nine patients. No patient had any meaningful seizure-free period. Non-convulsive status epilepticus was documented with EEG on at least one occasion in seven patients. Triggers included inter-current infections and slight increases in body or ambient temperature.

Behavioural problems or 'autistic-like' features were observed at some time of the evolution in most patients in our series (Table 1).

At last follow-up, the oldest living patient was 60 years of age. Sixteen patients were in residential care; the remainder lived at home with support. Neurological deterioration continued throughout life in all patients, with further impairment of speech, mobility and ability for daily activities (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Kyphoscoliosis was documented in six patients. Cerebellar signs were found in five patients, pyramidal signs in seven and extra-pyramidal in four patients. Non-ictal urinary incontinence occurred late in the evolution. The majority (18/22) of adult patients had severe intellectual disability (as classified in) at last follow-up (Table 1).

### Benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy evolving to jeavons syndrome [^114nKf2K]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy is a rare idiopathic generalized epileptic syndrome occurring below the age of 3 years. Although benign outcome is presumed, some recent studies suggest less favorable outcome. A 14-year-old boy had a history of repeated episodes of myoclonic jerks of the shoulders and upper limbs in infancy (age 5 months). An ictal electroencephalogram indicated generalized spike-wave discharges associated with the myoclonic seizures, and the diagnosis of benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy was made. Valproate treatment resulted in control of the myoclonic seizures, and the drug was withdrawn when the patient was 5 years of age. At the age of 10, he presented with episodes of eyelid jerks associated with brief lapses in concentration triggered by sunlight. Electroencephalography revealed photosensitivity and a pattern of eye-closure sensitivity. These features were compatible with the diagnosis of eyelid myoclonia with absences, or Jeavons syndrome. Lamotrigine eliminated the seizures. The evolution of benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy to eyelid myoclonia with absences has been reported in one other case. A possible continuum of myoclonic epileptic syndromes, mediated by a common genetic abnormality, suggests the need for longer monitoring of patients with benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy.

### Core features differentiate dravet syndrome from febrile seizures [^111Tnjra]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

An 11-month-old girl with febrile seizures and first unprovoked seizures was evaluated in the hospital. Relevant history included developmental delay and strong family history of febrile seizures and migraines. A routine electroencephalogram was performed and was abnormal due to the presence of a slowed posterior dominant rhythm, generalized spike-wave discharges, and multifocal sharp waves. The findings were concerning for a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Given the concern for a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, a next generation sequence epilepsy gene panel was ordered which identified a pathogenic variant in SCN1A. The clinical history, electroencephalogram, and pathogenic variant were compatible with a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome. This Grand Rounds manuscript highlights the thought process, evaluation, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in Dravet syndrome.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^11748BDs]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Outcome of absence epilepsy with onset at 8–11 years of age: watershed ages when syndromes overlap [^113DPskU]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Absence seizures are characterized by brief impairments in awareness that arise and abate suddenly without post-ictal changes. Absence seizures most commonly occur in childhood, with an incidence of 6 to 8 per 100 000 in children up to 15 years of age. They appear in different epilepsy syndromes, predominantly childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy, and less commonly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. In these different syndromes, the timing when absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures arise vary, but overlap. In childhood absence epilepsy, absence seizures occur from 2 to 8 years, with a peak of 5 years. Patients often have good outcome, although generalized tonic-clonic seizures may occur in adolescence. In juvenile absence epilepsy, absence seizures occur from 7 to 16 years, with a peak of 10–12 years of age. The absence seizures are usually less frequent than childhood absence epilepsy and 80% of patients will have generalized tonic-clonic seizures, peaking at 17 years, and infrequent myoclonic seizures. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, approximately a third have absence seizures with onset between 5 and 16 years of age. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and the hallmark myoclonic seizures occur 1–6 years later. Juvenile absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients usually require long-term ASM. Therefore, identification of a syndrome is of utmost importance for prognostication.

The EEGs of childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy can also be difficult to distinguish at presentation, although nuances exist. In childhood absence epilepsy, the EEG is characterized by bilateral, synchronous, symmetrical 3-Hz (2.7–4 Hz) generalized spike wave discharges on a normal background. In juvenile absence epilepsy, the frequency of spike-wave discharges may be faster (3.5–4 Hz). Occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activity is reported in 32% of children with childhood absence epilepsy, but can occur in children with other forms of genetic generalized epilepsy. The incidence of photoparoxysmal response in childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy vary among studies, with some reporting it to be present less, similar, or more in juvenile absence epilepsy than childhood absence epilepsy. The EEG of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy consists of generalized 3.5- to 6-Hz polyspike wave discharges, with a third demonstrating photoparoxysmal response. However, these findings might not be apparent at onset of the absence seizures.

### A 15-day-old male infant presenting with jerking movements of the limbs [^114bJXGk]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

This 15-day-old Caucasian male infant presented to the clinic with his mother for a well-child visit. During the visit, the mother mentioned that she had observed jerking movements of the limbs, arms more than legs. Various tests were performed and observation in the ward helped determine the characteristics of the seizure-like movements. The infant was born by vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction with a history of possible perinatal asphyxia. After seizures were observed in the ward, the patient was referred to neurology where an EEG was performed. It was normal, excluding epilepsy states. A normal newborn screen excluded most metabolic disorders. After history and examination, investigations and observation, benign sleep myoclonus was diagnosed. Benign sleep myoclonus is a benign disorder that consists of jerking movements of the limbs, usually involving the upper limbs more than the lower limbs and usually occurring during sleep. The seizures spontaneously stopped when the infant was approximately 1.5 months old. This was consistent with the final diagnosis of neonatal sleep myoclonus.

In contrast, "another retrospective study in 243 ALTE patients reported that EEG contributed to a neurologic diagnosis in 6% of patients".

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — antiepileptic medications: Clinicians Should Not Prescribe Antiepileptic Medications for Potential Neurologic Disorders in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation). Supporting data include that in a cohort of 471 ALTE patients, most who developed epilepsy had a second event within 1 month of their initial presentation, that there is no evidence of benefit from starting therapy after the first seizure compared with starting therapy after a second seizure in terms of achieving seizure remission, and that sudden unexpected death in epilepsy has a frequency close to 1 in 1000 patient years with risks that include adolescent age and presence of epilepsy for more than 5 years; accordingly, these data do not support prescribing an antiepileptic medicine for a first-time possible seizure because of a concern for SUDEP, the evidence available for ALTEs suggests lack of benefit for starting an antiepileptic medication for a lower-risk BRUE, and recommendations are based on no prospective studies and on only a single retrospective study.

### Ictal single photon emission computed tomography in absence seizures: apparent implication of different neuronal mechanisms [^116zeMXv]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Absence seizures represent a complex group of epilepsy, characterized by lapse of consciousness with staring. Bilateral, synchronous, and symmetric bursts of 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharges are observed on the electroencephalogram, whereas interictal background activity is normal. This kind of epilepsy has to be differentiated from other generalized epilepsies such as juvenile absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Moreover, absence seizures, together with generalized spike-and-wave discharges, may coexist with other types of epilepsy such as frontal lobe epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms. We have carried out ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 10 patients with clinical evidence of absence seizures with the aim to better understand and to distinguish this kind of seizure as primarily or secondarily generalized to a specific area and to obtain more information on the neuronal mechanisms involved in the different types of seizures, usually not identifiable at the first appearance. During the long follow-up period (9 months to 14 years), 7 of the 10 examined patients underwent interictal SPECT when they became seizure free. Our data permitted, in two patients, the diagnosis of childhood absence seizures; in three patients, they suggested the possibility of later appearance of other seizure types, on the basis of focal hyperperfusion indicating a possible focal firing. In three of the examined patients, the diagnosis of idiopathic localization-related epilepsies mimicking childhood absence seizures could be performed. In the last two patients, the hypothesis of a coexistence of absences with partial and generalized seizures was considered. From our results, it can be presumed that ictal SPECT findings may contribute to the physiopathologic classification of the different types of epilepsies. Moreover, anticonvulsant treatment more appropriate to the different forms of seizures can be used.

### Journal club: pretreatment EEG in childhood absence epilepsy [^116hzsD2]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is defined by absence seizures in a normally developing child, with onset between 4 and 10 years of age.(1) Typical absence seizures consist of behavioral arrest with or without automatisms, usually last 30–60 seconds, and demonstrate a characteristic 3-Hz generalized spike-wave (GSW) pattern on EEG, often in response to hyperventilation.(2) Children may have hundreds of episodes daily, many of them subclinical, which can impair sustained attention and memory processing. There is a strong association between CAE and disorders of attention and executive function. This association persists even when seizures are well-controlled. An underlying structural or functional abnormality of the brain has been postulated to explain both observations.(3,4) This article by Dlugos et al.(5) is a post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blinded trial(6) that seeks to characterize the relationship between EEG characteristics prior to treatment, measures of attention, and the outcome of initial antiepileptic treatment.

### Pretreatment seizure semiology in childhood absence epilepsy [^117LpWp1]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine seizure semiology in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy and to evaluate associations with short-term treatment outcomes.

Methods

For participants enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative-effectiveness trial, semiologic features of pretreatment seizures were analyzed as predictors of treatment outcome at the week 16 to 20 visit.

Results

Video of 1,932 electrographic absence seizures from 416 participants was evaluated. Median seizure duration was 10.2 seconds; median time between electrographic seizure onset and clinical manifestation onset was 1.5 seconds. For individual seizures and by participant, the most common semiology features were pause/stare (seizure 95.5%, participant 99.3%), motor automatisms (60.6%, 86.1%), and eye involvement (54.9%, 76.5%). The interrater agreement for motor automatisms and eye involvement was good (72%-84%). Variability of semiology features between seizures even within participants was high. Clustering analyses revealed 4 patterns (involving the presence/absence of eye involvement and motor automatisms superimposed on the nearly ubiquitous pause/stare). Most participants experienced more than one seizure cluster pattern. No individual semiologic feature was individually predictive of short-term outcome. Seizure freedom was half as likely in participants with one or more seizure having the pattern of eye involvement without motor automatisms than in participants without this pattern.

Conclusions

Almost all absence seizures are characterized by a pause in activity or staring, but rarely is this the only feature. Semiologic features tend to cluster, resulting in identifiable absence seizure subtypes with significant intraparticipant seizure phenomenologic heterogeneity. One seizure subtype, pause/stare and eye involvement but no motor automatisms, is specifically associated with a worse treatment outcome.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^116GDJuq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE diagnosis — Patient presents for initial medical assessment after a brief, resolved event that was observed by caregiver in a child < 1 year of age, and the patient may be well-appearing or have additional symptoms or abnormal vital signs; use event characteristics, rather than the term "ALTE", to describe the event. The clinician characterizes the event as a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of one or more of the following, including cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered responsiveness. If event criteria are present, perform appropriate history and physical examination (PE); if no explanation for the event is identified, diagnosis of Brief Resolved Unexplained Event is made, whereas if an explanation for the event is identified (eg, GER, feeding difficulties, or airway abnormality) it is out of guideline scope and should be managed accordingly.

### A muddy crystal ball for infantile-onset epilepsy outcomes [^111XdDsD]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Commentary

When you see a little baby with epilepsy, have you ever wondered how she would do when she grows up? Is she going to be free of seizures? Is she going to be able to play and learn just like her friends? And… do you, as a doctor, know the answers?

The incidence of epilepsy is highest in infants compared to all age groups, estimated at 70 per 100 000. Focal epilepsy (including epileptic spasms due to a focal lesion) constitutes the largest subgroup. Seizures and developmental outcomes are generally believed to be poor in this population. But is that always true?

The work highlighted in this commentary found that 75% of 167 children with infantile-onset (< 24 months of age) epilepsy had focal epilepsy. Let's enjoy the good news first. After at least 2 years of follow-up, 57% of patients were seizure-free for at least a year, and almost one-third were able to stop taking anti-seizure medication. Normal cognition at diagnosis, normal neurological examination, normal MRI, absence of EEG background slowing, and an unknown etiology predict seizure freedom.

The not-so-good news is that for those who weren't seizure-free, 35.5% met the criteria for the "D word… drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE)". This incidence is higher compared to 22% to 23% in all pediatric age ranges. The factors casting this wicked outcome include cognitive impairment at onset, abnormal neurological examination, EEG background slowing, epileptic spasms, and status epilepticus. Although younger age at onset and a known etiology were probably at play, they did not reach statistical significance. This information could enable us to provide better anticipatory monitoring and prompt treatment of those at risk for unfavorable outcomes.

Take epileptic spasm as an example. The authors reported that of the 115 children with focal seizures without spasms at presentation, 15 (13%) eventually developed spasms within about 5 months of median duration. The younger age at onset, cortical dysplasia, and abnormal neurological examination predicts a greater chance of developing epileptic spasms. With this knowledge, we can be more prepared for early detection and provide earlier treatment of infantile spasms, knowing that a shorter lead time to treatment can improve the outcomes in these children.

### Clinical and genetic study on a Chinese patient with infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy carrying a PPP3CA null variant: a case report [^116LbAKC]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Five months later, the follow-up V-EEG demonstrated slower background rhythms and frequent clusters of generalized or multi-focal poly-spike discharges. During the interictal stage, fragmented atypical hypsarrhythmia discharges appeared. The observed seizure of the patient was developed into three types this time: generalized myoclonic seizures, epileptic spasms and atypical absence seizures. For generalized myoclonic seizures, single or double rapid proximal jerks in one lateral upper limb could be observed during the episode. V-EEG results revealed synchronous bursts of generalized slow spike-and-waves accompanied by 50 ms bursts of myoelectricity at deltoid muscles. For epileptic spasms, the patient remained awareness and consciousness during the episodes. Nodding, bending or upward staring could be observed. Each episode lasts very short for only 1–1.5 s, and was isolated and discontinued. V-EEG result demonstrated complex of high amplitude slow waves and low-amplitude high-frequency activities during the episodes. Synchronous EMG demonstrated 0.5–1 s bursts of myoelectricity followed by 1–2 s transient generalized voltage suppression at rhomboid muscles. For atypical absence seizures, the patient would have less movement and slow mild head bobbing, lasting for 8–30 s per episode. V-EEG revealed rhythmic generalized slow spike-and-wave discharges activity (1.5–2.5 Hz).

A month later, the latest follow-up V-EEG demonstrated slower background rhythms and frequent clusters of generalized or multi-focal sharp wave, spike-and-wave, as well as slow spike-and-wave discharges. During the interictal stage, generalized rhythmic slow spike-and-wave with irregular spikes was presented. Generalized myoclonic seizure, epileptic spasms and atypical absence seizures can still be identified.

### Epileptic seizures may begin hours in advance of clinical onset: a report of five patients [^112fv72H]. Neuron (2001). Low credibility.

Mechanisms underlying seizure generation are traditionally thought to act over seconds to minutes before clinical seizure onset. We analyzed continuous 3- to 14-day intracranial EEG recordings from five patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy obtained during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. We found localized quantitative EEG changes identifying prolonged bursts of complex epileptiform discharges that became more prevalent 7 hr before seizures and highly localized subclinical seizure-like activity that became more frequent 2 hr prior to seizure onset. Accumulated energy increased in the 50 min before seizure onset, compared to baseline. These observations, from a small number of patients, suggest that epileptic seizures may begin as a cascade of electrophysiological events that evolve over hours and that quantitative measures of preseizure electrical activity could possibly be used to predict seizures far in advance of clinical onset.
