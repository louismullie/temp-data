## Question

Does a prior history of bilateral pneumonia from COVID 3 years ago lead to residual shortness of breath that is worse on awakening in the morning? What is the differential diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether persistent, morning-predominant shortness of breath three years after bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia can be attributed to the prior infection, and what the differential diagnosis and evaluation should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about temporal plausibility and epidemiology. Then, I should analyze plausible pathophysiologic links between remote COVID-19 lung injury and current dyspnea. Next, I will examine whether the morning-worse pattern changes my pretest probability. After that, I should construct a differential that excludes alternative and life-threatening causes before labeling this as long COVID. Finally, I will outline a targeted diagnostic workup and synthesize the most likely conclusion and next steps [^114dSNPJ] [^1132mkzF].

> Let me first confirm temporal plausibility. Wait, I should verify whether dyspnea this far out is still commonly reported after COVID-19 pneumonia. A prospective 3-year cohort showed that 39.80% of survivors had at least one persistent symptom at three years, with shortness of breath among the most frequent complaints, so a three-year interval remains epidemiologically plausible for post-COVID dyspnea [^111UBP5S].

> Next, I need to connect symptoms to physiology and imaging. I will now examine whether known long-term pulmonary changes match dyspnea. The same 3-year cohort identified decreased DLCO as the primary feature of long-term impairment, remaining relatively stable from years 2 to 3, and "fibrotic-like" changes as the most common persistent CT abnormality; both restricted gas transfer and fibrotic remodeling provide a direct mechanistic explanation for exertional and even morning dyspnea, particularly with nocturnal or supine-related desaturation, which I should keep in mind [^111UBP5S]. Additional follow-up literature links severe COVID-19 and ARDS to subsequent fibrotic sequelae, further reinforcing the plausibility of diffusion limitation and restrictive physiology as drivers of breathlessness, although I should note some of these data are earlier and less definitive compared with the 3-year cohort [^112sKjbQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the morning predominance. At first glance I might reflexively ascribe "worse on awakening" dyspnea to heart failure and orthopnea, but wait, orthopnea is classically positional at night and relieved by sitting up, whereas morning-predominant symptoms can also reflect nocturnal hypoventilation, obstructive sleep apnea, overnight secretion retention, or circadian variation in airway tone and inflammation superimposed on reduced DLCO or fibrotic physiology; this pattern does not contradict a post-COVID mechanism but pushes me to consider sleep-disordered breathing and cardiopulmonary comorbidities in parallel before attributing causality to long COVID [^1132mkzF] [^114dSNPJ].

> I should now construct the differential and I need to ensure I exclude alternatives before diagnosing post-COVID condition. By WHO definition, long COVID requires symptoms lasting at least two months, usually three, not better explained by another diagnosis; dyspnea is a hallmark feature, which fits the scenario temporally, but causality is a diagnosis of exclusion, so I must rule out thromboembolism, cardiac disease, infection, and other lung disorders per ESCMID guidance before anchoring on long COVID [^114dSNPJ] [^1132mkzF]. Let me consider post-COVID interstitial lung disease or fibrotic-like change and also late organizing pneumonia as specific pulmonary sequelae that can present with progressive or fluctuating dyspnea months after infection, sometimes steroid responsive, keeping in mind that OP is less common and often needs imaging and occasionally bronchoscopic confirmation to substantiate [^11242Ezh] [^111UBP5S].

> But wait, what if this isn't post-COVID at all. I should review other pulmonary causes that can mimic this presentation. Asthma or COPD with morning-worse bronchomotor tone, post-infectious bronchiectasis with mucus retention, recurrent or aspiration pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism all remain on the table; aspiration risk factors require a careful history, and persistent dyspnea after COPD treatment warrants lung volumes, diffusion testing, and imaging per contemporary guidance, while COVID-19–related hypercoagulability argues for keeping venous thromboembolism in the differential if risk factors or symptoms align [^112rHX39] [^113tgFdB] [^1155TiB7] [^1132mkzF].

> I also need to check cardiac, sleep-related, and systemic contributors. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction can manifest as exertional dyspnea and orthopnea that might be perceived as morning breathlessness, and ESCMID specifically flags myopericarditis and other cardiovascular complications to exclude; moreover, obstructive sleep apnea or obesity hypoventilation may present with morning symptoms and should be screened based on history, while anemia or thyroid disease can amplify dyspnea disproportionate to pulmonary physiology, so I should double-check for these potentially overlapping contributors before final attribution to long COVID [^1132mkzF].

> Let me now outline the diagnostic strategy and I should confirm the core tests that change management. For pulmonary physiology, I need spirometry with bronchodilator, lung volumes, and especially DLCO given its status as the dominant long-term abnormality post-COVID; reduced DLCO would support diffusion impairment consistent with fibrotic change or vascular involvement in this context, aligning with both guideline suggestions and 3-year cohort findings [^111UHa4o] [^111UBP5S]. I should also perform standardized symptom assessment, pulse oximetry at rest and exertion, and consider ambulatory oximetry or overnight oximetry if nocturnal desaturation is suspected based on the morning pattern, while recognizing that individual results must be integrated with imaging and clinical context to avoid premature closure [^1132mkzF].

> Next, I should review imaging and targeted adjuncts. High-resolution chest CT is appropriate to evaluate for fibrotic-like changes, air-trapping, bronchiectasis, or consolidations suggestive of organizing pneumonia; if persistent focal consolidation or an OP pattern is identified, bronchoscopy can be considered in select cases to exclude infection and confirm OP when results would alter therapy, particularly steroid initiation or tapering strategy [^111UBP5S] [^11242Ezh]. In parallel, I need to check for cardiac involvement with ECG, troponin, natriuretic peptides, and transthoracic echocardiography as indicated, and I should add basic labs including CBC for anemia, thyroid panel, and D-dimer if pulmonary embolism suspicion is non-trivial; if history suggests OSA, a validated sleep apnea questionnaire followed by home sleep apnea testing or polysomnography is reasonable to clarify the morning symptom pattern before final attribution to long COVID, consistent with the ESCMID principle of excluding alternative pathology first [^1132mkzF].

> Synthesizing this, I should verify that the clinical picture fits both the timeline and objective findings. Yes, prior bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia can plausibly lead to residual shortness of breath three years later, supported by cohort data and by persistent physiologic (DLCO) and radiographic (fibrotic-like) abnormalities in a significant subset of survivors; the morning predominance is not classic in the literature but is biologically plausible through nocturnal ventilation-perfusion mismatch, supine desaturation, or coexisting sleep-disordered breathing superimposed on diffusion impairment, so I should not dismiss it [^111UBP5S]. However, this remains a diagnosis of exclusion; the cornerstone next steps are pulmonary function testing with DLCO and high-resolution CT to document post-COVID lung sequelae, coupled with targeted evaluation for cardiac disease, thromboembolism, sleep apnea, anemia, and thyroid dysfunction per guideline principles, before concluding that persistent dyspnea is attributable to the remote COVID-19 pneumonia rather than an alternative or coexisting process [^1132mkzF] [^111UHa4o].

A prior history of bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia can lead to **residual shortness of breath** [^111UBP5S] that is **worse in the morning** due to persistent lung injury, fibrosis, or airway inflammation. Morning worsening is often linked to **nocturnal hypoxemia** or airway hyperreactivity. The **differential diagnosis** includes post-COVID fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, sleep apnea, asthma, COPD, and anxiety [^1132mkzF]. Evaluation should include **pulmonary function tests** [^1155TiB7], **diffusion capacity** [^111UHa4o], **chest CT**, **echocardiography**, and **sleep studies** to identify the cause and guide management.

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking prior COVID-19 pneumonia to persistent dyspnea

- **Pulmonary fibrosis**: Persistent interstitial changes and fibrotic-like abnormalities are common years after severe COVID-19, causing restrictive defects and reduced diffusion capacity [^111UBP5S] [^1139UMfp] [^112sKjbQ].

- **Airway inflammation and hyperreactivity**: Chronic bronchial inflammation or hyperreactivity can cause morning-worse dyspnea due to nocturnal bronchoconstriction or mucus plugging.

- **Residual lung injury**: Ongoing parenchymal injury or organizing pneumonia can cause persistent dyspnea and morning hypoxemia [^11242Ezh].

- **Cardiovascular complications**: COVID-19–related myocardial injury or pulmonary hypertension can contribute to chronic dyspnea [^113RUPPZ] [^1132mkzF].

## Clinical evidence of persistent dyspnea after COVID-19 pneumonia

Long-term follow-up studies show that **persistent dyspnea is common** after severe COVID-19 pneumonia, with approximately 40% reporting persistent symptoms at three years, including dyspnea, accompanied by stable diffusion impairment and fibrotic-like changes [^111UBP5S] [^1139UMfp]. At one year, many patients have **reduced DLCO** and restrictive defects, particularly after severe disease or mechanical ventilation [^112sKjbQ]. Morning worsening of dyspnea often reflects **nocturnal hypoxemia**, airway hyperreactivity, or mucus plugging.

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Include spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity (DLCO) [^111UHa4o] [^1155TiB7].

- **High-resolution chest CT**: Assess for fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or organizing pneumonia [^1139UMfp].

- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate for heart failure or pulmonary hypertension.

- **Sleep studies**: Assess for obstructive sleep apnea or nocturnal hypoxemia.

- **Laboratory tests**: Include CBC, BNP, and D-dimer as indicated.

---

## Management strategies

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity and quality of life.

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Consider inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, or antifibrotics as indicated [^11242Ezh].

- **Oxygen therapy**: For documented hypoxemia.

- **Treatment of comorbidities**: Manage heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or sleep apnea.

As the long-term consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been fully defined, it is necessary to explore persistent symptoms, long-term respiratory impairment, and the impact on quality of life over time in COVID-19 survivors. In this prospective cohort study, convalescent individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were followed up 2 and 3 years after discharge from the hospital. Participants completed an in-person interview to assess persistent symptoms and underwent blood tests, pulmonary function tests, chest high-resolution computed tomography, and the 6-minute walking test. There were 762 patients at the 2-year follow-up and 613 patients at the 3-year follow-up. The mean age was 60 years, and 415 (54.5%) were men.

At 3 years, 39.80% of the participants had at least one symptom, most frequently including fatigue, difficulty sleeping, joint pain, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and cough. The participants experienced different degrees of pulmonary function impairment, with decreased carbon monoxide diffusion capacity being the main feature; results remained relatively stable over the 2–3 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that female sex and smoking were independently associated with impaired diffusion capacity.

A subgroup analysis based on disease severity indicated there was no difference in other parameters of lung function except forced vital capacity at the 3-year follow-up. Persistent radiographic abnormalities, most commonly fibrotic-like changes, were observed at both timepoints. At 3 years, patients had a significantly improved mental health status.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and initiated in December 2019, expanded dramatically throughout the world. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), frequent manifestations of COVID-19, may cause pulmonary sequelae, including pulmonary fibrosis. Short-term pulmonary sequelae have been described in cohorts of patients followed up between 3 and 6 months after discharge. These sequelae range from mild respiratory impairment, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in asymptomatic patients, to more significant restrictive ventilatory dysfunction in patients suffering persistent pulmonary symptoms, mainly exertional dyspnea. The severity of respiratory failure and the need for higher respiratory support, such as endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during pneumonia, together with the extent of the radiological involvement, were identified as factors associated with the development of both functional and radiological pulmonary sequelae.

A short-term follow-up may not be adequate to evaluate the long-term prognosis of respiratory impairment; therefore, studies with longer follow-ups are warranted. Preliminary data from Chinese cohorts have shown that up to 47% of patients exhibited residual abnormalities on pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scans performed at 1 year from the pneumonia, with ground glass attenuation and reticular abnormalities as the major radiologic patterns. Furthermore, when comparing 6 to 12-month follow-up radiological exams, fibrotic interstitial lung patterns were evident.

The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also called 2019-nCoV) recently broke out in Wuhan, China, and was named COVID-19. With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China.

- **Methods**: All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years; age range, 18–86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1–6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution.

- **Findings**: The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), and a crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%).

### Performance of national COVID-19 'symptom checkers': A comparative case simulation study [^113RxQMJ]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). Low credibility.

Cough is a non-specific symptom covering a wide range of conditions. Combined with fever, cough raises the possibility of chest infection, including COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia (one of the critical differential diagnoses in COVID-19). Detecting possible bacterial pneumonia is a prerequisite for a functioning triage system given the time-critical need for antibiotic initiation to prevent unnecessary deaths.

Shortness of breath is generally accepted as a marker of COVID-19 disease progression, although there are other reasons for shortness of breath. Specifically, in COVID-19, patients may not experience shortness of breath despite being hypoxic — so-called silent hypoxia.

Duration was chosen as a severity marker as the prolongation of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath, within the context of COVID-19 or a COVID-19 mimicker (pneumonia, sepsis, and so on), carries a worse prognosis. In particular, an unremitting, persistent fever warrants further assessment in regard to COVID-19 but also in relation to sepsis.

Age is a well-defined risk factor for severe complications of COVID-19. As such, it was deemed useful to include age as a variable in the case simulations to test whether the symptom checker accounted for age when determining risk.

Severity of symptoms relates to the duration of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Shortness of breath had its own severity scale and was crucial for staging levels of complicated COVID-19, severity of pneumonia, and sepsis. Mild shortness of breath was defined as shortness of breath during activities that did not stop one complete.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^112hccmP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The only currently available laboratory method for excluding the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is to obtain a negative result on serologic testing of a convalescent-phase serum sample obtained more than 28 days after the onset of symptoms. For patients without evidence of pneumonia at the initial evaluation, serial observations over time may be helpful in identifying those in whom isolation precautions can be safely discontinued. Resolution of symptoms and lack of development of radiographic evidence of pneumonia by the second week of illness argues against the diagnosis of SARS. Some patients with mild illness may be missed when this approach is used; however, if that is the case, they likely will not play an epidemiologically important role in transmission.

Patients with documented pneumonia who have been given the provisional diagnosis of SARS should be treated as if they have SARS-CoV infection, unless there is convincing evidence for an alternative diagnosis or new epidemiologic information excludes the possibility that the patient was exposed to SARS.

	- (b) Flaky density shadows with multiple patches are distributed in the lower lobe of the right lung of a 33-year-old female with a history of travel to Wuhan in the previous 14 days, fever and cough for 5 days, and confirmed with mycoplasma pneumonia.

- **COVID-19 positive cases**:
	- (c) No abnormal findings on a CT scan of a 29-year-old female with a history of travel to Wuhan in the previous 14 days, low fever and fatigue for 4 days, confirmed with COVID-19 positive.
	- (d) Flaky density shadows with multiple patches appear in the lower lobe of the right lung of a 29-year-old male with fever and cough for 9 days, confirmed with COVID-19 positive.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has become an important public health issue worldwide. More than 118,000 cases have been confirmed globally. The main clinical manifestations include respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms. However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. In this retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, detailing the history of contact, clinical manifestations, and the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during, and after treatment.

### A 57-year-old man with stridor and critical tracheal narrowing [^116rszzQ]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old man with a history of polysubstance use presented with shortness of breath, wheezing, productive cough, subjective fever, and chills of a 3-day duration. Additionally, he reported worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 months. Notably, the patient had two episodes of pneumonia in the previous 6 months, which were treated with antibiotics and steroids. He was also diagnosed several years prior with adult-onset asthma due to intermittent wheezing and was prescribed an albuterol inhaler. However, the albuterol did not help relieve his wheezing, and he stopped refilling it.

### Covid-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^114VuDP4]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

A 25-day-old full-term male infant with a history of mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was admitted initially for work-up of a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). His guardians described a single episode three days prior to presentation. During this incident, the patient stopped breathing and developed perioral cyanosis for approximately 3–4 seconds while sleeping, which resolved with mild stimulation and waking. Associated symptoms included nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Multiple family members had been experiencing fevers, cough, and congestion starting the week prior. The patient's only additional medical history included respiratory distress at birth, which required 24 hours of positive pressure ventilation, and episodes of desaturation during his first six days of life, attributed to possible mild laryngomalacia.

Vital signs were within normal limits, and the physical exam revealed no abnormal findings. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 and a respiratory viral panel (RVP) PCR were collected. Continuous pulse oximetry overnight was normal, and he was discharged home the subsequent morning with instructions to presumptively quarantine while RVP and COVID-19 testing were pending. Shortly after discharge, his COVID-19 PCR test resulted positive, and the RVP was negative.

Three weeks after his initial presentation, at 45 days of life, the patient was brought back to the hospital after his guardians noted new episodes of apnea and perioral cyanosis, intermittent stridor, and abnormal head and eye movements. The physical exam was unchanged from his prior admission except for these new observations.

### Three unsuspected ct diagnoses of COVID-19 [^115SWjsA]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has quickly spread around the globe. Health care facilities in the United States currently do not have an adequate supply of COVID-19 tests to meet the growing demand. Imaging findings for COVID-19 are non-specific but include pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities in a predominantly basal and peripheral distribution.

Three patients were imaged for non-respiratory-related symptoms with a portion of the lungs in the imaged field. Each patient had suspicious imaging findings for COVID-19, prompting the interpreting radiologist to suggest testing for COVID-19. All three patients turned out to be infected with COVID-19. Notably, one patient is the first reported case of the coincident presentation of COVID-19 and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Using imaging characteristics of COVID-19 on abdominal or neck CT when a portion of the lungs is included, patients not initially suspected of COVID-19 infection can be quarantined earlier to limit exposure to others.

### Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia [^114e4Xyf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old asthmatic male patient presented to the health centre with a 3-week history of coryzal symptoms, persistent productive sputum, and shortness of breath. The chest X-ray (CXR) revealed symmetrical, perihilar airspace shadowing with peribronchial cuffing and bilateral reticular markings. The patient did not improve despite treatment, and hence a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax was recommended. The HRCT showed smooth interlobular septal thickening, central perihilar soft tissue thickening, and patches of ground glass changes. Both the CXR and HRCT findings, along with the symptoms and eosinophilia counts, were suggestive of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP), which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient was successfully treated with steroids.

This case highlights the symptoms, diagnosis, management, and treatment of IAEP. A rapid diagnosis of this rare disease is essential since it can be completely cured with correct management but can be fatal if left untreated. Once properly treated, this disease does not recur.

### Spontaneous hemoptysis in a patient with COVID-19 [^117BiRsW]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, gradually worsening over the previous two weeks, associated with a dry cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. He denied having fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any sick contacts or travel history outside of Michigan. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. He was taking amiodarone, carvedilol, furosemide, pregabalin, and insulin.

The patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. He was afebrile and had an oxygen saturation of 93% on 3 L of oxygen, a heart rate of 105 beats/min, a blood pressure of 145/99 mm Hg, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. On auscultation, there were crackles on bilateral lung bases and chronic bilateral leg swelling with hyperpigmented changes. His white blood cell count was 6.0 K/cumm (normal range: 3.5 to 10.6 K/cumm) with an absolute lymphocyte count of 0.7 K/cumm (normal range: 1.0 to 3.8 K/cumm); serum creatinine was 2.81 mg/dL (normal range: 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL). He had elevated inflammatory markers, including serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and creatinine phosphokinase.

Chest radiography showed bilateral pulmonary opacities suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Therapy was initiated with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg IV for three days. By day three of hospitalization, he required endotracheal intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement. Blood cultures were negative.

### Spontaneous massive pneumomediastinum in a previously well infant with COVID-19 [^114nXzai]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

A 3-month-old boy presented with a 3-hour history of a neck lump and difficulty breathing after 5 days of fever and reduced feeding. Pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema were identified, and the child was intubated because of severe work of breathing, requiring significant levels of oxygen and ventilatory pressure. A computed tomography chest scan revealed massive pneumomediastinum and significant bilateral parenchymal disease. The child deteriorated cardiovascularly, so the mediastinum was dissected by cardiothoracic surgeons and two drains were placed. The patient clinically improved with resolution of the air leak over two days. A diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia was confirmed.

### Recurrence or relapse of COVID-19 in older patients: A description of three cases [^1135q1nN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide, particularly older adults. The first cases of possible reinfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in April 2020 among this demographic.

- **Design/Setting**: In this brief report, we present three geriatric cases with two episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infection separated by a symptom-free interval.

- **Participants**: The participants of this study are three cases of hospitalized geriatric women.

- **Measurements/Results**: We note clinical and biological worsening during the second episode of COVID-19 for all three patients. Additionally, there is a radiological aggravation. The second episode of COVID-19 was fatal in all three cases.

- **Conclusion**: This series of three geriatric cases with COVID-19 diagnosed twice, weeks apart, questions the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. It raises questions in clinical practice about the value of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection again in the event of symptomatic reoccurrence.

### Case report: Walking pneumonia in novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Mild symptoms with marked abnormalities on chest imaging [^116q4BRZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

This case report underlines the appearance of a "walking pneumonia" in a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient, with evidence of progressive lung involvement on chest imaging studies. The patient traveled from Wuhan, Hubei, China, to Thailand in January 2020. One of her family members was diagnosed with COVID-19. She presented to the hospital because of her concern, but she was without fever or any respiratory symptoms. Three days earlier, her nasopharyngeal and throat swabs revealed a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Her initial chest radiography was abnormal, and her first sputum SARS-CoV-2 test yielded inconclusive results. A subsequent sputum test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis in this patient was facilitated by chest imaging and repeat viral testing. Thus, chest imaging studies might enhance capabilities for early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Organising pneumonia manifesting as a late-phase complication of COVID-19 [^11242Ezh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Acute COVID-19 usually lasts four weeks from the onset of symptoms. We report two cases of COVID-19-associated organising pneumonia (OP) occurring beyond four weeks from the acute onset of symptoms. Both tested positive for SARS reverse transcription-PCR two months before presentation, with a resolution of respiratory symptoms.

The first case presented with residual fatigue and worsening exertional dyspnea. Chest CT revealed an OP pattern. The second case presented with worsening cough and new-onset pleuritic chest pain, along with persistent radiological consolidation. A transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed OP.

Both patients responded well to 12 weeks of steroid therapy. This case illustrates the rare presentation of OP as a late sequela of COVID-19 and the favorable response to steroid therapy.

### A comprehensive review of imaging findings in COVID-19 - status in early 2021 [^1136tegM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Figure 3 illustrates imaging findings from three different patients with COVID-19-related lung abnormalities as shown by non-contrast CT:

- **CT images of three COVID-19 patients**:
	- **Patient A**: A 55-year-old male patient diagnosed with COVID-19 one day prior. The CT scan reveals ill-defined ground glass nodules in both lungs, indicated by yellow arrows.
	- **Patient B**: A 49-year-old male experiencing acute dyspnea for four days. The CT scan displays extensive ill-defined consolidations with positive air-bronchograms in both lower lobes. COVID-19 was confirmed via RT-PCR.
	- **Patient C**: A 60-year-old male shows consolidations in the lung periphery, sparing the subpleural space, which is compatible with organizing pneumonia. This finding indicates ongoing repair of the known COVID-19 pneumonia.

Although imaging findings of pulmonary involvement are relatively characteristic of COVID-19, they are not specific to this disease. Underlying conditions might influence the imaging presentation, requiring careful consideration of any previous patient history. Other conditions such as influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus may mimic the radiological aspects of COVID-19 pneumonia. The pattern of distribution of findings in the lungs, as well as the composition of parenchymal opacities, may assist in distinguishing between viral etiologies. For instance, influenza pneumonia is reported to present with dense opacifications, whereas COVID-19 is characterized by more prevalent ground glass density.

Over the course of the COVID-19 illness, the relative proportion of ground glass opacities decreases, whereas the proportion of consolidations and reticular abnormalities tends to increase. The extent of consolidations peaks between…

### End-to-end automatic differentiation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from viral pneumonia based on chest CT [^1119pVmE]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

All patients underwent chest CT scans. We tabulated the number of days between symptom onset and the date of the CT scans. The time from the patient's symptom onset to admission for CT examination was defined as early (0–2 days), intermediate (3–5 days), or late (6–12 days). In addition to the basic demographics of the patients, the related exposure histories were also included, specifically, history of travel to Wuhan in the previous 14 days, history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, and history of contact with a dense crowd. The relevant exposure history was selected as an inclusion criterion since these patients had a high risk of COVID-19 infection in China during this period.

All COVID-19 positive patients were classified as having mild, common, severe, or critical illness, according to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia (Tentative Standard 7).

In the study population, 77 patients from The First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China were imaged using a CT slice of 1-mm thickness on a GE Revolution 256 scanner (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, American). Additionally, 89 patients were imaged with a CT slice of 5-mm thickness on a NeuViz 128 scanner (Neusoft, Shenyang, China). The other 35 patients from The Lu'an Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in China were imaged with a CT slice of 5-mm thickness on a NeuViz 64 scanner (Neusoft, Shenyang, China). All CT images were reviewed by two cardiothoracic radiologists with more than 10 years of experience.

### A 16-year-old boy with cough and fever in the era of COVID-19 [^116y1kSW]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

A 16-year-old white boy with a history of chronic lung disease of prematurity, cough-variant asthma, and incidental lung nodules presented to the emergency center in spring 2020 with acute onset dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. An initial history, gathered from his mother because of the patient's respiratory distress, revealed no recent travel. However, his mother is a health care worker at a hospital, and sick contacts included ongoing contact with a friend with cold-like symptoms. He had a variety of animals at home, including a dog, cats, fish, rodents, and reptiles. He had a history of vaping tobacco products more than six months ago. Fever and respiratory symptoms were associated with fatigue, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and myalgias.

On examination, he appeared ill and had tachycardia, tachypnea, borderline hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, and unremarkable abdominal examination results. A chest radiograph was consistent with the lung examination, revealing bilateral lower lobe hazy infiltrates. He showed initial improvement for 48 hours with antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen via nasal cannula, albuterol, and prednisone. Subsequently, he worsened with persistent high fever, increasing respiratory distress with pulmonary findings, and severe persistent epigastric pain, which added a layer of diagnostic complexity.

As this patient's clinical course evolved and further history became available, pulmonary medicine and infectious diseases services were consulted to guide diagnostic procedures.

### Organising pneumonia due to inadequately cleared COVID-19 infection while on rituximab [^113bsDBG]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A male patient in his 70s, with a history of tobacco use, organizing pneumonia, and rheumatoid arthritis that had been treated for several years with rituximab and was currently being treated with tocilizumab, presented with progressively worsening shortness of breath, increasing oxygen requirements, and weakness. He had a history of COVID-19 infection 6 months prior to presentation. Initial COVID-19 PCR testing at presentation was negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage was positive for COVID-19 but negative for spike antibodies. It was thought that he did not clear his prior COVID-19 infection due to his immunocompromised state while taking rituximab. On the recommendation of infectious disease specialists, he was treated with a prolonged course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and corticosteroids, which resulted in significant symptom improvement.

### 80-year-old man with dyspnoea and bilateral groundglass infiltrates: an elusive case of COVID-19 [^114WPQ5X]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is a novel viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 virus, first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has spread rapidly and is now considered a global pandemic. We present a case of a patient with minimal respiratory symptoms but prominent bilateral ground-glass opacities in a 'crazy paving' pattern on chest CT imaging and a negative initial infectious workup. However, given persistent dyspnoea and laboratory results suggestive of COVID-19 infection, the patient remained hospitalized for further monitoring. Forty-eight hours after the initial testing, the PCR test was repeated and returned positive for COVID-19.

This case illustrates the importance of clinical vigilance to retest patients for COVID-19, particularly in the absence of another compelling aetiology. As COVID-19 testing improves to rapidly generate results, selective retesting of patients may uncover additional COVID-19 cases and strengthen measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

### Case report: Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome diagnostic in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic [^111jB4dt]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Although radiological changes in the lungs of patients with HCPS can be confused with COVID-19, chest X-ray findings showing bilateral, irregular alveolar infiltrates with air bronchograms may be suggestive of HCPS. These findings were described in our patient, who presented an influenza-like illness with an epidemiological history compatible with HCPS. With regard to high-resolution computed tomography (CT), there is limited information in HCPS cases. CT findings in patients with HCPS are rare and predominantly note bilateral ground-glass opacities associated with smooth inter- and intralobular septal thickening, similar to COVID-19 CT findings.

In our patient, in view of the negative result for COVID-19, a presumptive diagnosis of HCPS was made based on his epidemiological history and clinical manifestations associated with laboratory findings. Some biochemical results can support the diagnosis of a suspected case of HCPS, because the blood counts show, in most cases, hemoconcentration (hematocrit > 49%), thrombocytopenia, and an elevated leukocyte count with left shift — uncharacteristic results for viral infections.

As noted, patients with HCPS can progress rapidly to respiratory failure. Therefore, it is important to investigate patients' exposure and activities in affected regions, as well as incursions to endemic areas. Furthermore, although orthohantavirus and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection has not yet been reported, it is necessary to consider the possibility of co-infection, as already observed with other respiratory viruses such as influenza and rhinovirus/enterovirus.

### Management of a severe bilateral pulmonary embolism as a complication of VITT following vaccination with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine [^117GzqRE]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

In the differential diagnosis of this case:

- **Exacerbation or deterioration of the ILD**: This was excluded based on the CT findings, which showed recent bilateral pulmonary emboli without evidence of the bilateral ground glass opacification and/or consolidation classically seen in ILD.

- **Bronchial asthma**: Clinically excluded as the pulmonary examination was completely normal with bilateral equal air entry and absence of wheezes.

- **COVID-19 viral pneumonia**: Excluded as the patient had a negative PCR test for COVID-19, and the CT findings did not indicate viral pneumonia.

- **Bacterial pneumonia**: Pneumonic pulmonary infiltrations were identified in the CT examination together with the pulmonary embolism. According to the radiological report, these infiltrations are most probably a post-infarction superadded infection. A history of aspiration pneumonia was unlikely since the patient denied any history of aspiration.

- **Idiopathic pulmonary embolism**.

- **Decompensated heart failure**: Excluded by echocardiography, which showed normal cardiac dimensions and function.

### CT differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 in symptomatic suspects: A practical scoring method [^1133JRjR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although typical and atypical CT image findings of COVID-19 are reported in studies, the CT image features of COVID-19 overlap with those of viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases, making exclusive diagnosis challenging.

- **Methods**: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters, and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs from significant COVID-19 CT image features (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO with or without consolidation) and four negative signs from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19.

- **Results**: Older age, symptoms of diarrhea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p). Validation of this scoring method indicated that a score above 4 yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.2.

### Early prediction of disease progression in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with chest CT and clinical characteristics [^1151Gbp6]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Demographic information, such as age and gender, exposure history, smoking history, and comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, COPD, cerebrovascular disease, and hepatitis B infection, were collected. Clinical symptoms and signs, including percutaneous oxygen saturation, as well as laboratory data (platelet count, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein) were obtained using data collection forms from electronic medical records.

Exposure history was defined as exposure in Wuhan within two weeks before illness onset or exposure to local individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical classification of COVID-19 pneumonia is as follows:

- **Moderate type**: Patients with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and radiological evidence of confirmed pneumonia.
- **Severe type**: Patients with one of the following:
	- Respiratory distress (respiratory rate ≥ 30 beats/min)
	- Hypoxia (oxygen saturation ≤ 93% in the resting state)
	- Hypoxemia (arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration ≤ 300 mmHg)
- **Critical type**: Patients with one of the following:
	- Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
	- Shock
	- Intensive care unit (ICU) admission is required due to combined organ failure

The primary endpoint of this study was the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia by February 15, 2020. Other clinical outcomes included bacterial co-infection.

### Clinical course of a 66-year-old man with an acute ischaemic stroke in the setting of a COVID-19 infection [^1159dhzB]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: SARS-CoV-2 is a type of coronavirus that was first reported to have caused pneumonia-like infections in humans on December 3, 2019. Coronaviruses as a group are a common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children, and have been extensively researched since they were first characterized in the 1960s. At the time of writing, there are seven known coronaviruses that cause infections in humans, including SARS-CoV-1, the first known zoonotic coronavirus outbreak in November 2002. Coronavirus infections typically circulate through communities during the winter months, causing small outbreaks that generally do not result in significant mortality or morbidity.

	- The SARS-CoV-2 strain is classified as a zoonotic coronavirus, indicating that the virus pathogen is transmitted from non-humans to cause disease in humans. However, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 also demonstrates human-to-human transmission. Previous research on the transmission of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the virus spreads via respiratory droplets, either through direct inhalation or indirectly by touching surfaces with the virus and then exposing the eyes, nose, or mouth. Common signs and symptoms identified in COVID-19 patients include high fevers, severe fatigue, dry cough, acute breathing difficulties, bilateral pneumonia on radiological imaging, and lymphopenia. Most of these features were identified in this case study. The significance of COVID-19 is underscored by its rapid global spread and its potential to cause severe clinical presentations.

### Development of a large spontaneous pneumothorax after recovery from mild COVID-19 infection [^114HYtSA]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A previously healthy 37-year-old man presented with fevers and myalgias for a week along with a minimal dry cough. Initial SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing was negative. However, due to high community prevalence, he was diagnosed with COVID-19, treated with supportive care, and self-quarantined at home. Three days after resolution of all symptoms, he developed sudden onset chest pain. Chest imaging revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax and patchy subpleural ground glass opacities. IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. His pneumothorax resolved after placement of a small-bore chest tube, which was removed after 2 days. This case demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 can develop a significant pulmonary complication, a large pneumothorax, despite only minimal lower respiratory tract symptoms and after resolution of the original illness. Medical professionals should consider the development of a pneumothorax in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and present with new respiratory symptoms.

### Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in patient with pneumonia, China [^114sthjv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 7, 2020, the causative pathogen was identified as a virus subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report a case of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in China.

A 69-year-old man was seen in the clinic of China-Japan Friendship Hospital on January 23, 2020, for fever and dry cough. The patient visited Wuhan from December 18, 2019, to January 22, 2020, and began having symptoms on January 23. He reported no underlying medical conditions. Routine blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 5.70 × 10^9 cells/L (reference range 3.5–9.5 × 10^9 cells/L) and lymphocyte count of 2.18 × 10^9 cells/L (reference range 1.1–3.2 × 10^9 cells/L). Chest computed tomography revealed a mass, ground-glass consolidation in the right inferior lobe of the lungs [Figure, panel A]. Because of the patient's travel history, he was isolated for suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

- **Figure**: Radiographs of a patient co-infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza A virus, China, 2020. A) Chest computed tomography demonstrating a mass, ground-glass consolidation in the right inferior lobe. B) Chest radiograph showing bilateral diffuse exudative shadows, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome. C) Chest radiograph showing improved lung fields after four days in the intensive care unit.

We obtained a nasopharyngeal swab specimen and conducted real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) for detection.

### A randomized trial of convalescent plasma in Covid-19 severe pneumonia [^114gwPUV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The PlasmAr Study was conducted by Ventura A. Simonovich and colleagues in 2021 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study addresses COVID-19 infection, specifically investigating the role of convalescent plasma in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The study utilized a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, and involved a population of 333 patients, comprising 108 females and 225 males. Inclusion criteria mandated hospitalization with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while key exclusion criteria included pregnancy or lactation, a history of blood component allergies, an infectious cause of pneumonia other than COVID-19, the requirement for mechanical ventilation, and multiorgan failure.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either convalescent plasma (n = 228) with a single administration of a median titer of 1:3200 of total COVID-19 antibodies plus standard treatment, or a placebo (n = 105) with normal saline solution plus standard treatment.

- **Primary outcome**: The trial observed a borderline significant decrease in death at 30 days between the groups (10.96% vs. 11.43%; absolute risk difference -0.46, 95% CI -7.8 to 6.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in the median time from intervention to hospital discharge (13 days vs. 12 days; sub-hazard ratio 0.99, 99% CI 0.75 to 1.32). A borderline significant increase was noted in the need for invasive ventilatory support at 30 days (8.3% vs. 9.5%).

- **Safety outcomes**: The study found no significant difference in the overall adverse events and serious outcomes between the groups.

### Family cluster of three recovered cases of pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^115agxdg]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

On 10 and 11 January 2020, a family of three, comprising the father (65 years), the mother (61 years), and the son (38 years), were admitted to the Department of Infectious Disease at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University with symptoms of cough and fever. On 21 December 2019, the mother started coughing with expectoration. Five days later, the father also developed a cough and fever, seven days before admission. He had a history of hypertension and coronary heart disease, for which he had received a stent. Both presented symptoms of restricted breathing. On 3 January 2020, twelve days after the mother's illness, the son developed a cough. Prior to admission, all three patients experienced fatigue and intermittent fever (37.9°C–39.1°C) for at least one day. They had no shortness of breath or chest pain.

- **Body temperature and heart rate observations**: After hospitalization, the temperature of all three patients decreased within 3–5 days. The mother experienced only occasional febrile episodes, while the son had moderate-to-high fever for four days post-admission.

- **Physical examination findings**: Some degree of tonsil enlargement was observed in the father and the son. Lung auscultation revealed rhonchi in the father and the mother. Other examination findings were generally unremarkable. None of the patients had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan or the surrounding area in the previous two weeks. They denied any contact with diagnosed patients with similar symptoms.

### Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study [^114b6ngr]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course.

- **Methods**: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped based on the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤ 1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (> 1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (> 2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analyzed and compared across the four groups.

- **Findings**: Eighty-one patients admitted to the hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, with a mean age of 49.5 years (SD 11.0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10.5 (SD 6.4) overall, with 2.8 (SD 3.3) in group 1, 11.1 (SD 5.4) in group 2, 13.0 (SD 5.7) in group 3, and 12.1 (SD 5.9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral in 64 (79%) patients, peripheral in 44 (54%), ill-defined in 66 (81%), and ground-glass opacification in 53 (65%), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n = 15), the predominant pattern was unilateral in nine (60%) patients.

### Favourable outcome following a delayed complication secondary to Covid-19 [^114DNZuG]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a 7-day history of fever, cough, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The chest radiograph (CXR) showed bilateral peripheral parenchymal infiltrates. He required 4L/min oxygen via nasal cannula for 72 hours and was discharged after 7 days with appropriate advice. Four weeks from the initial hospital admission, he presented with worsening cough, left chest pain, and breathlessness. The CXR showed left pneumothorax, and a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) scan confirmed left pneumothorax with mediastinal shift and a subpleural bulla. An intercostal chest drain was inserted with a good resolution of symptoms and lung re-expansion. A follow-up CT scan 2 months later showed complete resolution of the parenchymal abnormalities. Our case demonstrates the development of pneumothorax as a delayed complication in a patient with COVID-19 who did not require ventilatory support. The case also illustrates a favourable outcome, that is, complete resolution of parenchymal destruction due to COVID-19.

### Long COVID syndrome: A case-control study [^113RUPPZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes various cardiovascular complications. However, it is unknown if there are cardiovascular sequelae in the medium and long term. The aim of this study was dual. Firstly, we wanted to investigate symptomatology and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at medium-term follow-up (6 months post-COVID). Secondly, we wanted to assess whether history of COVID-19 and persistent shortness of breath at medium-term follow-up are associated with ongoing inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiac injury.

- **Methods**: A case-control study was performed. Virologically proven COVID-19 cases and age- and gender-matched controls were interviewed to assess symptoms and HRQoL. Biochemical tests were also performed.

- **Results**: The study comprised 174 cases and 75 controls. The mean age of the participants was 46.1 ± 13.8 years. The median follow-up was 173.5 days (interquartile range 129–193.25 days). There was no significant difference in the demographics between cases and controls. At follow-up, cases had a higher frequency of shortness of breath, fatigue, arthralgia, abnormal taste of food (P < 0.001), and anosmia. Cases also exhibited worse scores in the general health and role physical domains of the Short Form Survey-36. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was significantly higher in the cases, and there was a positive correlation of hsCRP with time. Significant determinants of shortness of breath were age, female gender, and white cell count, troponin I, and lower hemoglobin levels at follow-up.

### Litfulo [^11522J1n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Serious infections**: Serious infections have been reported in patients receiving Litfulo. The most frequent serious infections have been appendicitis, COVID-19 infection (including pneumonia), and sepsis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, multi-dermatomal herpes zoster was reported with Litfulo.

Avoid the use of Litfulo in patients with an active, serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating Litfulo in patients:

- with chronic or recurrent infections
- who have been exposed to TB
- with a history of serious infection or an opportunistic infection
- who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses
- with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Litfulo. Interrupt Litfulo if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Litfulo should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. Litfulo may be resumed once the infection is controlled.

- **Tuberculosis**: Screen patients for tuberculosis (TB) before starting therapy. Litfulo should not be given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be started prior to initiating therapy with Litfulo in patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or previously untreated latent TB.

### Exogenous lipoid pneumonia caused by repeated sesame oil pulling: a report of two cases [^1132R5Ev]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old female, who was a non-smoker and had no history of smoking, recently experienced shortness of breath. She had no relevant medical history and was not on any prescribed medications. She habitually performed sesame oil pulling via mouth washing every morning for six months, occasionally leading to aspiration of the oil. Five months after symptom onset, she was admitted to our hospital for a detailed examination of abnormal chest shadows detected during a medical check-up.

- **Clinical observations at admission**: Respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min; blood pressure was 130/60 mmHg; body temperature was 36.3 °C; and oxygen saturation was 98%. The patient had no fever, and routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and blood biochemistry, were all normal. However, a chest roentgenogram and CT revealed ground-glass opacities in the bilateral middle and lower lobes, particularly dominant in the middle and lingular lobes. Biochemistry and peripheral blood examination results were normal, except for the patient's LDH level, which was 250 IU/mL.

- **Imaging findings**: A chest roentgenogram and computed tomography images of the patient showed infiltrative shadows in the bilateral lower lung fields on admission. The chest CT revealed ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening (crazy-paving pattern) and partial infiltration in the bilateral lower lung fields. The shadows improved after three months.

### Rapidly worsening pneumonia in a middle-aged woman: A rare diagnosis and a crucial management decision [^114HY8SJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old Indian female presented to the hospital with a 4-day history of fever, shortness of breath, and blood-streaked sputum. A chest radiograph showed consolidation, and she was admitted as a case of bilateral bronchopneumonia. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals, but she continued to deteriorate clinically with increasing oxygen requirements and worsening lung infiltrates.

Since lab investigations also revealed significant anaemia and renal impairment, a vasculitic workup for pulmonary renal haemorrhagic syndrome was ordered even though she had no haemoptysis in the hospital, and her haemoglobin was stable after the initial blood transfusion. A high-resolution computed tomography scan was done on day 5 to assess progression and provide any clue to the diagnosis. It showed extensive bilateral air space consolidation and ground-glass opacities with a suggested radiological differential diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or pulmonary haemorrhage. The pulmonology team did not recommend bronchoscopy at the time.

Given the clinical features of rapidly progressing pneumonia despite standard treatment, history of haemoptysis, anaemia, renal impairment, and CT scan findings suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhage, pulse intravenous Methylprednisolone was initiated. The patient showed marked clinical and radiological improvement. The vasculitic workup later revealed positive myeloperoxidase antibody, and a definitive diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis was made. She was discharged in a stable condition and advised to follow up in rheumatology, where she continues to follow.

### A clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition by a Delphi consensus [^114cUAo9]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Long COVID can be associated with a wide range of symptoms including headache, skin rash, diarrhea, anosmia, fatigue, anxiety, myalgia, depression, and sleeping disorders. Patients may also experience abdominal pain, dyspnea, mood changes, a reduced sense of smell, palpitations, changes in smell, arthralgia, cacosmia, paresthesia, tremors, numbness in the limbs, changes in taste, cough, and fever.

Additional symptoms include chest pain, cognitive impairment, memory impairment, hearing loss, visual disturbances, dizziness, and a history of COVID-19 infection. This condition presents with diverse clinical manifestations, necessitating a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management.

### Covision: Convolutional neural network for the differentiation of COVID-19 from common pulmonary conditions using CT scans [^112PxciC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

SARS-Net is one of many deep learning models developed to aid with COVID-19 diagnosis. While this model achieves an accuracy of 97.6% in identifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays (CXRs), it fails to differentiate COVID-19 from other common pulmonary conditions, such as bacterial pneumonia, leading to low specificity. Specificity is a measure of how well a model can identify individuals who do not have a disease and can correctly identify what condition(s) an individual might have instead. For effective use in a clinical setting, and for triaging patients, models that detect COVID-19 from medical images and CT scans need a high specificity. One potential solution is to apply Capsule Networks. However, these networks use vector representation for the neurons and replace the backpropagation training algorithm with dynamic routing, both of which substantially increase computational complexity and training time.

In our research, we attempted to answer the following research question: Is it possible to create a lightweight computer model that can accurately identify COVID-19 and distinguish it from other common lung diseases, such as bacterial pneumonia? Due to the aforementioned potential of deep learning, we hypothesize that we can create a lightweight model, called COVision, using deep learning that will match or outperform radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia as measured by the metrics of accuracy, AUROC, sensitivity (recall), specificity, and precision.

### Post-sequelae symptoms and comorbidities after COVID-19 [^1132PVkN]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Low credibility.

The frequency, severity, and forms of symptoms months after coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are poorly understood, especially in community settings. To better understand and characterize symptoms months after community-based COVID-19, a retrospective cohort analysis was conducted. Three hundred and twenty-eight consecutive persons with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in the Johns Hopkins Health System, Maryland, March−May 2020, were selected for the study. Symptom occurrence and severity were measured through questionnaires.

Of 328 persons evaluated, a median of 242 days (109−478 days) from the initial positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 33.2% reported not being fully recovered, and 4.9% reported symptoms that constrained daily activities. Compared to those who reported being fully recovered, those with post-acute sequelae were more likely to report a prior history of heart attack (p < 0.01).

Among those reporting long-term symptoms, men and women were equally represented (men = 34.8%, women = 34.6%), but only women reported symptoms that constrained daily activities, and 56% of them were caregivers. The types of new or persistent symptoms varied and, for many, included a deviation from prior COVID-19 health, such as being less able to exercise, walk, concentrate, or breathe.

A limitation is that self-report of symptoms might be biased and/or caused by factors other than COVID-19. Overall, even in a community setting, symptoms may persist months after COVID-19, reducing daily activities, including caring for dependents.

### A unique presentation of delirium in a patient with otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 [^116hGxWF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Low credibility.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifests with a wide spectrum of presentations. Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19.

The setting for this brief report is a university hospital in Saudi Arabia. The participant is a 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever. The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up. Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2.

The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.

The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.

### CT differential diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 in symptomatic suspects: a practical scoring method [^112ZSAxJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although typical and atypical CT image findings of COVID-19 are reported in studies, the CT image features of COVID-19 overlap with those of viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases, making it challenging to achieve an exclusive diagnosis.

- **Methods**: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other etiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. Clinical data, including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters, and etiological diagnosis of all patients, were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO ± consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19).

- **Results**: Older age, symptoms of diarrhea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p4), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26%.

### Post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria: A single-center study [^113DfYnw]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Thirty COVID-19 patients (males, 66.7%) were eligible for inclusion as study participants out of 51 patients admitted during the study period. Fifteen mortalities and six losses to follow-up were excluded. The age range of study participants was 13 to 63 years, with a median age of 46 years (IQR, 32.5–53 years). Fever, anorexia, headache, and cough were the most common symptoms during admission, whereas cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms post-discharge. Seventeen (56.7%) of the 30 patients had symptoms suggestive of post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The prevalence of PCS in our study was 56.7%. One to five symptoms were reported per patient, with a median of three symptoms (IQR, 2–3.25) per patient.

- **Admission and post-discharge symptoms**: The most common post-discharge symptoms included cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Two of the four patients with leg pain had evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

- **Duration of follow-up and associated symptoms**: The duration from first symptom to last follow-up for each patient ranged from 21 to 267 days, with a median of 39.5 days (IQR, 28.8–75.3 days). The number of days of follow-up after discharge ranged from 7 to 238 days, with a median of 15.5 days (IQR, 7–48.3 days). Respiratory symptoms such as cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and throat discomfort were observed.

### 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month respiratory outcomes in patients following COVID-19-related hospitalisation: A prospective study [^1139UMfp]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The consequences of COVID-19 in those who recover from acute infection requiring hospitalisation have yet to be clearly defined. We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, longitudinal cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease (including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or a history of smoking documented at the time of hospital admission were excluded at the time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood tests, pulmonary function tests (i.e. diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-minute walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale.

### Preexisting symptoms increase the risk of developing long COVID during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^1176PTPP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Unlike acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, which can be established using laboratory methods, there is no objective measurement underpinning long COVID. Apart from the criterion of a past infection, the diagnosis rests on the presence of symptoms that are common in the general population. Whether individuals presenting with long COVID demonstrate greater susceptibility to symptoms compatible with long COVID than other people prior to the pandemic has not been established. Previous studies have predicted substantial increases in healthcare costs and utilization from patients with long COVID. However, few studies have estimated the prevalence and healthcare utilization of long COVID in adults using data from an entire region over an extended period.

The purpose of this study was to estimate, first, the proportion of the population registered with ICD codes for any of the relevant symptoms before and during the pandemic; second, the long COVID prevalence in the Region Västra Götaland, Sweden; and third, healthcare contacts of patients registered with a diagnosis of long COVID.

### Case report: COVID-19-associated rhinosinusitis mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus arrhizus: A rare but potentially fatal infection occurring after treatment with corticosteroids [^115QXziZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of dry cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and fatigue. Her medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which had been diagnosed 5 years previously. She had also undergone gastric bypass surgery for weight loss 2 years before admission. The patient did not use any medications for her diabetes because she assumed that she had controlled blood sugar after her surgery and possibly because of her poor compliance with antidiabetic therapy; however, she used two antihypertensive drugs (diltiazem and losartan) on a daily basis. She had no history of tobacco smoking or alcohol consumption. The patient was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19. On admission, she was hemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg and a pulse rate of 78 bpm. She had no fever (oral temperature, 37.2°C); however, she had an increased respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Blood tests revealed normal results, and her random plasma glucose level was 224 mg/dL. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated SARS-CoV-2, and a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed. During hospitalization, remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2–5) and dexamethasone (6 mg once daily for 10 days) were initiated. After 21 days, the patient was discharged with significant clinical improvement and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.

### A clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition by a Delphi consensus [^114dSNPJ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for long COVID, more specifically with respect to definition, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend defining post-COVID-19 as a condition in patients with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients present with symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction, and other symptoms affecting everyday functioning. These symptoms either have a new onset after initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness and may fluctuate or relapse over time. The symptoms should last for at least 2 months, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, and should not be explained by an alternative diagnosis.

### A 19-year-old with hemoptysis and shortness of breath [^114M8WEx]. Chest (2023). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old woman with no medical history who did not use tobacco presented to the hospital with a post-COVID-19 cough for two months and new onset of shortness of breath and blood-tinged sputum. She was initially treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia because her chest radiograph showed a right upper lobe infiltrate. Further CT scan imaging revealed a right hilar lymph node conglomerate and extensive lymphadenopathy. The patient left to pursue care at a facility that accepted her insurance.

Two weeks later, the patient presented with severe left-sided lower back pain, and she was found to have a new complete left lower lobe collapse, likely because of extrinsic compression of the left lower lobe bronchus. She was treated for pain, and she left for insurance reasons. Two months later, the patient presented with progressive shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and a 23-kg weight loss over the past four months. Because of the patient's increasing medical needs, she was transferred to our institution, where she was admitted to the medical ICU.

### Symptomatic relapse and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in a previously healthy 30-year-old man [^113tU4p6]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Much has been reported on the clinical course of severe COVID-19, but less is known about the natural history and sequelae of mildly symptomatic cases and the prospects of reinfection or recurrence of symptoms. We report a case of a patient with mildly symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who, after being symptom-free for two weeks, redeveloped symptoms and was found to be PCR-positive again more than four weeks from the original testing. Surprisingly, IgG and IgM antibody testing was negative two months after reinfection. Although no negative testing was performed between the two symptomatic bouts, this case raises the possibility of reinfection after controlling the virus and highlights the long period during which a patient can shed the virus and experience symptoms after initial infection. Characterizing variations in clinical symptoms and the length of viral shedding after improvement is essential for informing recommendations on patients safely resuming contact with others.

### Evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia [^1155Zorg]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

To delineate the evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features, including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities, were analyzed on a per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the three weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated.

Of the patients, 85.2% had a travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average five days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had a negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that were:

- **Pure GGO**
- **Mixed attenuation**
- **Mixed attenuation with linear opacities**
- **Consolidation with linear opacities**
- **Pure consolidation**:

The majority of patients had involvement of three or more lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time, while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first two weeks.

While bilateral GGO are predominant features, CT findings changed during different time intervals in the three weeks after symptom onset in patients.
