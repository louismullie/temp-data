## Question

What is the best treatment for hashimotos encephalitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment approach for Hashimoto's encephalopathy, also called steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, and how to sequence therapies and monitor response. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and its implications for treatment. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and dosing. Next, I will examine steroid non-responders and the role of IVIG and plasma exchange. After that, I need to consider second-line agents like rituximab and maintenance strategies. I will then address thyroid hormone management, supportive care, and monitoring. Finally, I should review special populations, prognosis, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats about evidence quality and bias [^112fSjJi] [^115uyg4X].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic construct and why it matters therapeutically. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is best conceptualized as a steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, characterized by subacute encephalopathy with neuropsychiatric features, seizures, myoclonus, or stroke-like episodes, elevated antithyroid antibodies, and exclusion of other causes; importantly, thyroid function can be normal, so euthyroid status does not exclude the diagnosis, and the presence of antibodies alone is nonspecific, so I need to ensure we are not overcalling it based on serology alone [^115snVAG] [^117PDnv1] [^116cLLWn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before establishing the first-line modality. High-dose corticosteroids are the cornerstone, with typical regimens using intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days followed by an oral prednisone taper over weeks to months; this approach is supported by multiple series and case reports showing rapid clinical improvement in a majority of patients, though I should acknowledge that much of the evidence is observational and subject to publication bias [^1159xBRv] [^114iKfUR] [^115uyg4X].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and speed of steroid response so I set expectations correctly. In a representative series, 15 of 20 patients returned to baseline after IV methylprednisolone and oral taper, with the remaining 5 having only mild residual deficits; similarly, a large literature review reported complete or partial neurological response in 91% after immunomodulatory therapy, most often steroids, though this estimate is likely inflated by reporting bias and the inclusion of steroid-responsive cases by definition in some studies [^1159xBRv] [^115uyg4X].

> I should confirm what to do when steroids fail or are contraindicated. For steroid-refractory cases or when steroids are unsafe, IVIG and plasma exchange are reasonable next steps; case reports and series document rescue with IVIG after steroid failure and dramatic improvement with plasma exchange in status epilepticus or severe presentations, and neurocritical care guidance lists corticosteroids and immunomodulation among options for refractory status epilepticus, including Hashimoto's encephalopathy contexts [^111gnG2h] [^112GjCtk] [^114AHPEP].

> Let me consider second-line and maintenance strategies when relapses occur or tapering is problematic. Rituximab has been used in steroid-refractory pediatric and adult cases with favorable outcomes, though I need to ensure vigilant infection risk monitoring and hypogammaglobulinemia surveillance; azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and prolonged low-dose steroids have also been used as maintenance, but again, the evidence base is limited to case series and expert opinion [^1167znu5] [^112UjvWi] [^1159xBRv].

> But wait, what about thyroid hormone therapy itself; I need to check that I do not conflate treating the thyroid with treating the encephalopathy. Thyroid hormone replacement is indicated only for coexisting hypothyroidism per standard thyroid guidelines and does not treat the encephalopathy; moreover, levothyroxine should not be started in euthyroid patients for nonspecific symptoms, and in patients with adrenal insufficiency risk, adrenal status should be addressed before initiating levothyroxine to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis [^117E3haQ] [^11527wum] [^116jZuEB] [^111rgtSQ].

> Next, I should review supportive and adjunctive care that often co-manage symptoms. Antiseizure medications are frequently required for seizures or myoclonus, and levetiracetam has been reported as a steroid-sparing option in patients who cannot receive immunosuppression, though this is based on very limited case-level evidence and should not replace immunotherapy when indicated; psychiatric symptoms may necessitate antipsychotics, and neurocognitive tracking can help gauge treatment response and guide tapering decisions [^1161owQU] [^111wgF7M] [^116NTFEV].

> I will now examine how to monitor response and decide on tapering. Clinically, I should track encephalopathy, seizures, and neuropsychiatric features daily early on, then space out as improvement stabilizes; EEG abnormalities often improve in parallel with clinical recovery, and neuropsychological testing can document cognitive gains and help determine taper readiness; antibody titers may decline but do not reliably correlate with clinical course, so I should not use them alone to judge response or relapse risk [^115fGsdG] [^116NTFEV] [^114kxAMY].

> Let me think about special populations and settings. In pediatrics, presentations and responses mirror adults, but steroid resistance may be more common and plasma exchange or rituximab are reasonable earlier in refractory cases; in pregnancy, standard thyroid management principles apply for hypothyroidism, and immunotherapy decisions should weigh maternal-fetal risks with maternal neurocritical illness severity; in older adults, SREAT remains a must-not-miss reversible cause of new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms and responds promptly to steroids when recognized early [^113xpRtF] [^111ASogu] [^114iKfUR].

> Hold on, I should verify prognosis and relapse risk to counsel accurately. Most patients improve with immunotherapy, but relapses occur in roughly 16% and are more frequent after severe initial presentations such as coma; long-term outcomes are generally favorable with early treatment, whereas delays risk persistent cognitive deficits, so maintaining a high index of suspicion and initiating steroids without undue delay are key [^115uyg4X] [^1159xBRv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that steroid responsiveness is a diagnostic criterion; I should double-check that assumption. While many historical and some contemporary reports treat steroid responsiveness as supportive, more recent data suggest that pretreatment criteria including high TPO antibodies and euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid status do not reliably predict steroid response, and TPOAb positivity is common in controls, so I need to avoid circular reasoning and ensure thorough exclusion of other autoimmune encephalitides before anchoring on SREAT [^115snVAG] [^117PDnv1].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check each step. First, confirm the diagnosis with encephalopathy, elevated antithyroid antibodies, and exclusion of infection, structural disease, toxic-metabolic causes, and neuronal antibody–mediated encephalitis; second, start high-dose IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days with a planned oral prednisone taper over 12–16 weeks if there is clinical improvement; third, if there is no improvement within 1–2 weeks or steroids are contraindicated, escalate to IVIG or plasma exchange; fourth, for relapses or steroid dependence, consider rituximab or other steroid-sparing immunosuppressants; fifth, manage hypothyroidism per endocrine guidelines but do not expect thyroid hormone to treat the encephalopathy; sixth, provide supportive care including seizure control and neuropsychiatric management; seventh, monitor clinically, with EEG when indicated, and with neuropsychological testing to guide tapering, recognizing antibody titers are adjunctive at best [^112fSjJi] [^1159xBRv] [^115uyg4X] [^117E3haQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the strength of evidence and counseling are transparent. The treatment consensus is based on case series, expert opinion, and extrapolation from autoimmune encephalitis practice rather than randomized trials, so I should discuss uncertainty, potential benefits and risks of immunosuppression, and the possibility of relapse while emphasizing that early immunotherapy is associated with the best outcomes in related autoimmune encephalopathies and appears similarly beneficial in SREAT cohorts [^112fSjJi] [^115uyg4X] [^1159xBRv].

---

The best treatment for Hashimoto's encephalitis is **high-dose intravenous corticosteroids** (e.g. methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3–5 days) followed by a **tapered oral prednisone course** (typically 40–60 mg/day, tapering over 6–12 months) [^1159xBRv] [^114iKfUR]. This regimen yields rapid clinical improvement in most patients and is the **first-line therapy** [^115uyg4X]. For steroid-refractory or relapsing cases, escalate to **IVIG (2 g/kg over 2–5 days)** or **plasmapheresis (5–7 exchanges over 10–14 days)** [^111gnG2h] [^112GjCtk]. Rituximab or other immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate) are options for maintenance or recurrent disease [^112UjvWi] [^1167znu5]. Thyroid hormone replacement is managed separately for coexisting hypothyroidism but does not treat the encephalopathy itself [^117E3haQ] [^1159xBRv]. Early, aggressive immunotherapy improves outcomes; monitor for relapses and taper slowly to minimize recurrence [^112fSjJi] [^115uyg4X].

---

## First-line treatment: corticosteroids

- **High-dose intravenous corticosteroids**: Methylprednisolone 1 g/day IV for 3–5 days is standard initial therapy, with rapid clinical improvement in most patients [^1159xBRv] [^114iKfUR].

- **Oral corticosteroid taper**: After IV therapy, transition to oral prednisone 40–60 mg/day, tapering over 6–12 months to reduce relapse risk [^1159xBRv] [^114iKfUR].

- **Clinical response**: Steroids improve encephalopathy, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms; cognitive deficits may lag and guide taper duration [^1161tqg4] [^115uyg4X].

---

## Second-line treatments: immunomodulatory therapies

For steroid-refractory or relapsing disease, **immunomodulatory therapies** are recommended:

| **Therapy** | **Dosage and regimen** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| IVIG | 2 g/kg total, divided over 2–5 days | - Effective in steroid-refractory cases <br/> - Rapid improvement reported [^111gnG2h] |
| Plasmapheresis | 5–7 exchanges over 10–14 days | - Useful in severe or refractory cases <br/> - Including status epilepticus [^112GjCtk] [^114AHPEP] |
| Rituximab | 375 mg/m² weekly × 4 or 1 g IV × 2, 2 weeks apart | - Option for steroid-refractory or relapsing disease <br/> - Especially in pediatrics [^1167znu5] [^112UjvWi] |
| Azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate | Maintenance regimens individualized | - Used for relapse prevention or steroid-sparing <br/> - Evidence limited to case series [^112UjvWi] [^1159xBRv] |

---

## Adjunctive and supportive therapies

- **Antiepileptic drugs**: Levetiracetam or valproate for seizures; consider levetiracetam when steroids are contraindicated (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes) [^1161owQU] [^111XuJvn].

- **Antipsychotics**: Risperidone or haloperidol for severe psychiatric symptoms; use cautiously with monitoring [^111wgF7M].

- **Thyroid hormone replacement**: Treat coexisting hypothyroidism per guidelines, but it does not address the encephalopathy itself [^117E3haQ] [^1159xBRv].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

- **Steroid responsiveness**: Most patients improve with steroids; about 31.6% have complete response, and 91% have partial or complete response to immunomodulatory therapy [^115snVAG] [^115uyg4X].

- **Relapse risk**: Relapses occur in ~16%, more often after severe initial presentations (e.g. coma) [^115uyg4X].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Early, aggressive immunotherapy improves outcomes; persistent deficits can occur if treatment is delayed [^112fSjJi] [^115c3uVD].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular clinical assessments** for relapse or adverse effects during and after steroid taper, as well as periodic thyroid function tests to guide hormone replacement. EEG may be used to track seizure control and encephalopathy, and neuropsychological testing can help quantify cognitive recovery and guide therapy duration [^112GjCtk] [^116NTFEV].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients generally respond similarly to adults, though **steroid resistance may be more common** and rituximab or plasmapheresis may be needed [^115acYcK] [^1167znu5] [^11157HzY]. Pregnant patients should receive individualized therapy that balances maternal benefit with fetal risk, and immunosuppression may be adjusted accordingly. Elderly patients may require lower steroid doses and closer monitoring for adverse effects.

---

High-dose IV corticosteroids followed by a **tapered oral course** are the cornerstone of therapy for Hashimoto's encephalitis, with IVIG or plasmapheresis as key second-line options. Early, aggressive immunotherapy improves outcomes, and maintenance strategies help prevent relapse.

We report a case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy with detailed neuropsychological testing before, during and after steroid treatment, allowing a more precise characterization of the deficits and their response to treatment. It highlights that behavioral and psychotic symptoms remit before cognitive deficits and suggests that the latter may be more appropriate for guiding the duration of steroid treatment.

### Clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria and therapy of Hashimoto's encephalopathy: report of two cases [^116ZypWd]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a rare, still not well understood, autoimmune disease with neurological and psychiatric manifestations. and elevated titers of antithyroid antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a hallmark of the disease. Patients are mostly women. Current diagnostic criteria include corticosteroide responsiveness, but it is the case in only 50% of patients with HE. In steroid non-responders other immunomodulatory therapies or plasmapheresis could be applied. Disease course can be acute, subacute, chronic or relapsing-remitting. Two distinct forms emerged from the reported cases: a vasculitic type characterized by multiple relapsing-remitting stroke-like episodes and mild cognitive impairment and a diffuse progressive type characterized by dementia and psychiatric symptoms. Both forms may be accompanied by depressed level of consciousness (stupor or coma), tremor, seizures, or myoclonus. We present two patients with two distinct forms of HE who had different clinical manifestations and response to therapy.

### Altered mental status: what is the diagnosis? [^1131Eno4]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We report a patient presenting with a 2-day history of altered mental status and lethargy. She had recently started taking prednisone for suspected 'autoimmune arthritis'. Clinical deterioration in hospital characterised by increasing confusion, alternating hyperarousal and somnolence, auditory hallucinations and eventual unresponsiveness led to an intensive care unit transfer. Initial laboratory and radiological testing did not reveal a cause for her symptoms. The only abnormality detected was antithyroid peroxidase antibody levels elevated to > 900IU/mL with patient demonstrating marked clinical improvement within 24h of receiving high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis. Hashimoto's encephalitis is an underdiagnosed reversible neuropsychiatric disorder with unknown pathogenesis. Recent studies indicate that autoimmune encephalopathy and specifically Hashimoto's encephalitis is under-reported. Our case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a wide differential for altered mental status, especially after negative initial diagnostic work-up of more common aetiologies. Although steroids are an effective treatment for Hashimoto's encephalitis, the addition of early plasmapheresis may be indicated in patients with severe presentation and those who develop disease while taking steroids.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Hashimoto's encephalopathy [^112UjvWi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To share our experience on clinical presentation and management of patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (HE) at Vanderbilt Medical Center between 1999 and 2012.

Background

HE is a rare disorder characterized by encephalopathy and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, elevated antithyroid antibodies, the absence of infection or structural abnormalities in the CNS, and a response to treatment with steroids. The relationship between thyroid antibodies and encephalopathy has remained unresolved.

Design/Methods

Retrospective chart review.

Results

We identified 13 patients who met the criteria for the diagnosis of HE. The median age was 49 years (range, 2–66) and all except one were women. Encephalopathy in the form of altered mental status, stroke-like symptoms or seizures, with prompt resolution of symptoms upon receiving steroids, was the commonest presentation, seen in 7 patients. The second commonest presentation was subacute progressive decrease in cognitive function, which reversed within days to weeks after steroid therapy, seen in 4 patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was available in 12 patients and was abnormal in 8, showing nonspecific cerebral dysfunction in all 8 and epileptiform activity in 3. Treatment consisted of steroids in the acute phase for 12 of 13 patients with rapid improvement in symptoms. Maintenance therapy was rituximab in 7 patients, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in 7, azathioprine in 4, mycophenolate mofetil in 3, and methotrexate in 1 (some patients received sequential therapy with different agents). There was complete or near complete resolution of symptoms in 12 of the 13 patients.

Conclusions

We present a cohort of patients in whom CNS dysfunction was associated with elevated antithyroid antibodies and reversal of disease followed immunomodulatory therapies.

### Risks and benefits of rituximab in the treatment of hashimoto Encephalopathy in children: two case reports and a mini review [^1167znu5]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare condition, characterized by the association of encephalopathy with a variety of neurological symptoms and autoantibodies to the thyroid gland. Its etiology is unknown, and symptoms are usually treated with immune suppressive therapy, e.g., high doses of corticosteroids.

Methods and Results

Here, we report the long-term outcome in two steroid-refractory adolescents with Hashimoto encephalopathy who were treated with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20. In addition, we reviewed the literature regarding treatment strategies in Hashimoto encephalopathy.

Conclusions

Anti-B-cell therapy can be of value in the treatment of Hashimoto encephalopathy, especially in steroid refractory cases, but side effects due to low levels of immunoglobulins warrant careful monitoring.

### Two patients with Hashimoto's encephalopathy and uncontrolled diabetes successfully treated with levetiracetam [^1161owQU]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a rare syndrome of progressive or relapsing-remitting encephalopathy associated with elevated serum anti-thyroid antibody concentrations. It is thought to be an autoimmune process that generally responds well to high-dose corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory therapies. However, some patients are unresponsive to steroids or are unable to receive immune therapy. A viable alternative is needed for this group. Given that seizure and EEG abnormalities are commonly associated with this syndrome, we postulate that treatment with levetiracetam, which has duel anti-inflammatory and anti-seizure mechanisms, might show clinical benefit. We present the cases of two patients who met the criteria for HE but were unable to receive steroids due to labile diabetes. They were both successfully treated with levetiracetam.

### Learning from history: lord brain and Hashimoto's encephalopathy [^115oGRcQ]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

We present two historic cases of severe encephalopathy associated with antithyroid antibodies. The first was published by Lord Brain of Eynsham, and the second was from our department's archives. Although both cases are from archival sources, they continue to inform current clinical care. We briefly review the poorly defined entity, Hashimoto's encephalopathy, and discuss diagnostic advances for autoimmune encephalopathy and for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We advocate for giving a trial of corticosteroids to patients with 'encephalopathy, not otherwise specified' while awaiting antibody results or more definitive testing. Our case, initially diagnosed as having Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, responded remarkably (with video evidence) to a trial of corticosteroids.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy: an under diagnosed entity [^116z9D8g]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

We describe a 60-year-old woman with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who presented with neuropsychiatric manifestations even on optimal and stable doses of levothyroxine replacement therapy. She had high anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody and responded to glucocorticoid treatment.

---

### A series report of autoimmune hypothyroidism associated with Hashimoto's encephalopathy: an under diagnosed clinical entity with good prognosis [^116fGCbM]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunctions may be accompanied by numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. The most well-known is cognitive impairment and depression in hypothyroid patients, as well as an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents. A separate, although a rare entity, is Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Unlike encephalopathy associated with other conditions, management in Hashimoto's encephalopathy highly responds to steroid treatment and may be associated with normal thyroid profile at presentation. Hashimoto's encephalopathy, while rare, may have been under-recognised since its clinical presentation overlaps several more common disorders, such as depression, seizures or anxiety. We present two cases of hypothyroidism with peculiar presentation. The first case has rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction, normal thyroid function at presentation, normal MRI finding and responds to steroid treatment. The second case has a subacute progressive neurological deterioration with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone titre at presentation. Both these cases are known hypothyroidism on regular thyroxin replacement therapy with elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. We conclude that Hashimoto's encephalopathy can present with a wide spectrum of neurological illnesses in the setting of hypothyroidism. Thyroid status may vary from hypothyroid, normothyroid to even hyperthyroid. This condition usually has an abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) background and usually responds to high dose steroids.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a rare pediatric brain disease [^115FFHq9]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

We report a 9-year-old female who presented with new onset intractable seizure activity followed by a prolonged encephalopathic state. After ruling out common etiologies, Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) was considered, and antibody levels to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were both markedly elevated in her serum. She was euthyroid at the time of presentation. Upon treatment with high dose methylprednisolone, the patient demonstrated a significant improvement in her encephalopathy. The diagnosis of HE requires strong clinical suspicion with evidence of antithyroid antibodies, as well as an encephalopathy not explained by another etiology. While well documented in the adult literature, only a handful of pediatric cases have been described to date. Patients with HE have a nearly universal response to high dose glucocorticoids. HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient, adult or pediatric, who displays prolonged, unexplainable encephalopathy.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment response of steroid in pediatric hashimoto encephalopathy [^11157HzY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy is a steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with elevated titers of antithyroid antibodies. Clinical symptoms are characterized by behavioral and cognitive changes, speech disturbance, seizures, myoclonus, psychosis, hallucination, involuntary movements, cerebellar signs, and coma. The standard treatment is the use of corticosteroids along with the treatment of any concurrent dysthyroidism. Other options are immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis. We described symptoms and outcomes on 3 teenage girls with Hashimoto encephalopathy. Presenting symptoms were seizure or altered mental status. One patient took levothyroxine due to hypothyroidism before presentation of Hashimoto encephalopathy. After confirmation of elevated antithyroid antibodies, all patients were treated with steroids. One patient needed plasmapheresis because of the lack of response to steroids and immunoglobulins. Hashimoto encephalopathy should be considered in any patient presenting with acute or subacute unexplained encephalopathy and seizures. Even though the use of steroids is the first line of treatment, plasmapheresis can rescue steroid-resistant patients.

### A methodology for assessing treatment response in Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a case study demonstrating repeated computerized neuropsychological testing [^116NTFEV]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy, a steroid-responsive encephalopathy, presents with cognitive deterioration, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures and is often associated with elevation of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies or thyroid dysfunction. Because of the absence of a gold-standard diagnostic test and serological marker of disease, improvement in cognitive impairment is an important sign when assessing response to corticosteroid treatment. The purpose of this case study is to present a methodology for tracking neurocognitive functioning using computerized testing (CNS Vital Signs) in a 14-year-old girl with Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Computerized neuropsychological testing was done prior to commencing corticosteroid treatment, as well as at 7 follow-up assessments over 1 year. Improvement in cognitive, psychological, and behavioral functioning heralded a response to treatment, which was sustained during tapering of medication. Computerized neuropsychological testing seems to be a viable tool for tracking cognitive functioning (when rapid assessments are desired) and assessing response to corticosteroid treatment in Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy presenting with bipolar affective disorder [^112ie3FM]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We report on a rare case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy associated with a bipolar affective disorder.

Case Report

A 32-year-old woman presented with a bipolar affective disorder and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Neurological investigations (magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid) did not reveal any pathological findings except for a pathological electroencephalogram (EEG). Despite consequent antidepressant treatment, the patient remitted only in conjunction with normalization of the EEG after short-term treatment with high doses of prednisolone.

Conclusion

In treatment resistant courses of disorders, the thorough clinical and laboratory investigation of our patient revealed a very efficient treatment strategy. Cases of Hashimoto's encephalopathy associated with the occurrence of a manic episode and hence with bipolar disorder are rare; this is the first reported case. However, clinicians should be alert to this possibility.

### A case of hashimoto encephalopathy in a malay woman with Grave's disease [^113kKzmb]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) is a poorly recognised steroid-responsive encephalopathy, with prominent neuropsychiatric features. Diagnosis is often difficult due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation, especially since the thyroid status or anti-thyroid antibody titres may not be related to the disease state. Here, the case of a 23-year-old Malay woman with Graves disease who presented with progressive encephalopathy diagnosed as HE is presented. She responded dramatically to high dose intravenous and then oral corticosteroid. A month after the initiation of treatment, she regained full independency.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy: an unusual cause of seizures in the intensive care unit [^116nuhWz]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a case study of Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Nottingham University Hospital, UK.

Patients

Two adolescent females presented with encephalopathy and raised venous lactate. Both had subtle signs of neurocognitive deterioration before initial presentation. Extensive investigation revealed elevated antithyroid antibody titer, suggesting Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

Interventions

Steroid administration.

Measurements and Main Results

Symptoms rapidly resolved in both cases after steroid treatment.

Conclusion

Hashimoto's encephalopathy should be considered in cases of unexplained encephalopathy presenting to the intensive care unit. Teenage girls with an antecedent history suggestive of thyroid disease or progressive cognitive decline warrant special attention. Antithyroid antibody titers should be measured even if standard thyroid function tests are normal. Although the etiology is unknown, prompt steroid responsiveness suggests an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder, and patients should be treated accordingly.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy responding to risperidone [^111wgF7M]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

This report describes a case of Hashimoto encephalopathy in an 11-year-old girl. She presented with features typical of this disorder including encephalopathy, seizures, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Diagnosis was supported by an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level, a low levo-thyroxine level, and positive results for antithyroperoxidase antibody. Her response to typical treatment with levo-thyroxine was incomplete, requiring additional therapy with valproic acid and methylprednisone. Her course was further complicated by the development of acute psychosis. Treatment with risperidone was correlated with resolution of her psychosis and improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Response to antipsychotic therapy has not previously been described in the pediatric population with Hashimoto encephalopathy. This case highlights the need for guidelines for the management of this rare disorder.

### Successful response to intravenous immunoglobulin as rescue therapy in a patient with Hashimoto's encephalopathy [^111gnG2h]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

The authors describe the case of a 61-year-old woman who was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) due to impaired consciousness associated with generalised seizures. Her cerebrospinal fluid, electrolytes, acid-base analysis, and common laboratory and toxicology tests were normal. An MRI ruled out the presence of stroke or haemorrhage but showed severe leukoencephalopathy. Parkinson's disease, Creuzfeld-Jacob disease, vascular alterations, cancer, and rheumatological and metabolic diseases were evaluated and excluded. In view of her history of hypothyroidism despite adequate hormonal replacement and clinical behaviour, Hashimoto's encephalopathy was considered. Anti-thyroperoxidase levels were above 3000 IU/ml. The patient received 5 g of methylprednisolone followed by prednisone, but after a favourable initial response, returned to a comatose state. However, after administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg, the patient recovered with resolution of neurological symptoms and was discharged from the ICU 4 days after finishing IVIG treatment.

### Encephalopathy associated with hashimoto thyroiditis: pediatric perspective [^114kxAMY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In recent years, neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis have been increasingly recognized in both adult and pediatric patients. This neurologic complication has been termed "Hashimoto encephalopathy", and it can begin abruptly, in the form of seizures or agitation, with or without other neurologic complaints, or it can develop gradually, in a relapsing-remiting manner, including, among others, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric illness. The occurrence of Hashimoto encephalopathy is unrelated to the patient's thyroid function status. Although the pathogenesis of this encephalopathy is not fully understood, evidence for both autoimmune and vasculitic mechanisms exists. Owing to a low index of suspicion, this encephalopathy is very likely underdiagnosed in children. The diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy is based on detecting antithyroid antibodies in these patients, although there is no correlation between antibody levels and the severity of the illness. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging studies do not show consistent findings to support the diagnosis. Physicians' awareness of this complication is of great importance because most patients respond dramatically to corticosteroid therapy. Moreover, early recognition might also avoid an expensive diagnostic work-up in patients with unexplained encephalopathy (J Child Neurol 2006;21:1–5).

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^116jZuEB]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Regarding medical management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, indications, abnormal TSH, BMJ 2019 guidelines recommend to do not initiate thyroid replacement therapy in adult patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Steroid-responsive encephalopathy: an under recognised aspect of Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^114sH4iL]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with Hashimoto's encephalopathy based on the presence of subacute behavioural changes, negative work up for infection and immunological serology except for high serum titres of thyroid autoantibodies. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) and MRI of the brain were normal. EEG showed low amplitude, slow waves and θ waves at both frontal areas. His condition improved dramatically after treated with high-dose glucocorticoid. After 2 years of a relapsing-remitting course, a new episode occurred. There was an abrupt change of TFTs within 5 days: free thyroxine (fT4) from 1.52 to 1.53 ng/mL, free triiodothyronine (fT3) from 3.25 to > 30 pg/mL and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from 5.08 to 0.78 mIU/L. On the following day found fT4 2.58, fT3 14.67 and TSH 0.042. The patient was diagnosed with Hashitoxicosis. High-dose glucocorticoid and β-blockers were initiated. The symptoms gradually improved and TFTs normalised within 2 weeks.

### Autoantibody-associated psychiatric syndromes: a systematic literature review resulting in 145 cases [^1139M6tD]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy, most (94%) responded to this treatment. However, this finding is subject to a relevant publication bias because the patients responding to therapy are preferentially published, and additionally, a successful response to immunomodulatory drugs was required for a diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy to be made, which was an inclusion criterion for the current study. Still, 91% of patients with Abs against cell surface antigens also responded to immunomodulatory treatment. The good therapeutic response of this group is probably due to the direct pathophysiological role of Abs against cell surface antigens. Regarding the most frequently detectable anti-NMDA-R Abs, it has been shown that they are directly responsible for the pathophysiological processes (Kreye et al.). The Abs crosslink to the NMDA receptors changes the interaction with other synaptic proteins and causes reversible internalization of the receptors (Dalmau et al.). This leads to electrochemical, electrophysiological, and neuroplastic changes (Dalmau et al; Kreye et al.). Patients most frequently benefited from steroids; however, this finding is likely biased because the patients who were successfully treated with steroids did not need any further immunosuppressive treatment. Only 67% of the patients with Abs against intracellular antigens benefited from immunosuppressive treatment. This poor response can be explained pathophysiologically for this subgroup because a misdirected response of cytotoxic T cells is assumed to be the cause of the resulting inflammatory nerve damage, which is often irreversible; hence, there is often a defect state prior to starting immunomodulatory treatment (Stich & Rauer).

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy in children and adolescents [^113xpRtF]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy is an underdiagnosed, steroid-responsive, progressive or relapsing encephalopathy associated with high titers of serum antithyroid antibodies. Although Hashimoto's encephalopathy is well documented in adults, it is rarely observed or studied in children and adolescents. We describe the clinical and laboratory findings of four children (aged 9–15 years) with Hashimoto's encephalopathy. The clinical features of two patients at presentation included epileptic seizures and confusion. The other presenting signs included breath-holding spells, behavioral problems, psychosis, and ataxia (one patient each). During their presentation, three patients were euthyroid, and one was hyperthyroid. All patients manifested increased antithyroid antibodies, and all improved with steroid treatment. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is rarely suspected at presentation. Therefore, greater awareness of its signs by clinicians is necessary for proper diagnoses.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy mimicking presenile dementia [^117MoZq1]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE), which carries kaleidoscopic clinical presentations, is easily misdiagnosed in clinical practice. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of steroid therapy are associated with good prognosis. We describe a 50-year-old female patient who had subclinical hypothyroidism and who presented herself with gradual cognitive impairment, accompanied with auditory hallucination and delusion. Increased anti-thyroid antibodies titers were found in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The HE diagnosis was confirmed using the laboratory test for anti-thyroid antibodies along with the patient's clinical presentation. We treated her with steroid pulse therapy, and the results were favorable. We highlight this case to call for early diagnosis and prompt intervention of HE in clinical practice.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy causing drug-resistant status epilepticus treated with plasmapheresis [^115enS1K]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare, clinically heterogenous condition. Its treatment is based on corticosteroids. A previously normal 12-year-old boy was admitted to our pediatric emergency department with status epilepticus. He experienced a recurrence of status epilepticus after pentobarbital withdrawal, and required repeated resumptions of drug-induced coma. He manifested acute personality changes. His limbic encephalitis markers were normal, but his level of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody was high. A diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy was considered. Our patient responded to plasmapheresis instead of corticosteroid treatment. This case report is the first, to the best of our knowledge, of plasmapheresis because of Hashimoto encephalopathy in a child.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: clinical spectrum and management [^116cLLWn]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnoses

Clinicians need to consider a broad differential diagnosis to reflect the spectrum of neurological phenomenology in autoimmune encephalitis. Here we outline a few considerations that apply in each of several clinical situations.

Infectious encephalitis (most commonly HSV): often presents with seizures as well as fever, focal neurology and more extensive imaging changes than in autoimmune encephalitis.
Temporal lobe glioma in cases with mesial temporal swelling: semiologies can overlap but autoimmune encephalitis usually has a less abrupt onset and interval imaging swelling on imaging typically resolves with treatment on interval imaging.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other rapid dementias: often remain a differential in more chronic cases, especially patients with LGI1-antibodies. However, in practice, the differences in clinical features, CSF and imaging mean that distinguishing these is usually straightforward.
Post-ictal MRI changes in patients with frequent seizures can often mimic autoimmune encephalitis in the acute phase.
Metabolic encephalopathies: usually delirium dominates the clinical picture.
Hashimoto's encephalopathy: fundamentally a difficult diagnosis to make as definitions remain unclear. New autoantibody discoveries may better describe many cases once termed 'Hashimoto's'.

### Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis [^114iKfUR]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy or steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) is a rare condition associated with rapidly progressive dementia, stroke-like symptoms, psychosis and positive antithyroid antibodies. In this case report, a woman in her 80s with hypothyroidism and no other medically relevant history presented with a 2-week complaint of progressive hallucinations, short-term memory loss and paranoia. Eventually hospitalised, her hospital course was complicated by severe hospital-acquired delirium, which clouded the clinical picture; however, initial workup revealed an elevated thyroglobulin antibody and thyroid peroxidase, both highly specific for SREAT. A 3-day course of high-dose methylprednisolone (1g/day) was administered, which revealed marked improvement in patient symptoms. Definitive treatment included a 13-week oral prednisone taper and outpatient follow-up with neurology and primary care. In cases of new onset neuropsychiatric symptoms in geriatric populations, SREAT is a reversible, must-not-miss diagnosis, when treated with systemic steroids.

### A follow-up ¹ ⁸ F-FDG brain PET study in a case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy causing drug-resistant status epilepticus treated with plasmapheresis [^112GjCtk]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a rare neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with antithyroid antibodies. It may have an acute onset (episodes of cerebral ischemia, seizure, and psychosis) or it may present as an indolent form (depression, cognitive decline, myoclonus, tremors, and fluctuations in level of consciousness). We here describe a case of encephalopathy presenting as non-convulsive status epilepticus associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy, with improvement after plasma exchange treatment. A previously healthy 19-year-old woman, presented generalized tonic-clonic seizures. About a month later, she manifested a speech disorder characterized by difficulties in the production and comprehension of language. Within a few days she also developed confusion and difficulties in recognizing familiar places, with gradual worsening over time. EEG revealed a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). CSF examination showed slightly elevated cell count and four oligoclonal bands. MRI was unremarkable, and ¹⁸F-FDG brain PET showed widespread hypometabolism, mostly in posterior regions bilaterally. Laboratory and ultrasound findings showed signs of HT. Treatment with steroid was introduced without any improvement. After five sessions of plasma exchange there was a decrease of antithyroid antibodies, as well as EEG and clinical improvement. Three months after discharge ¹⁸F-FDG brain PET showed a complete normalization of the picture, and the patient was asymptomatic. This report emphasizes the successful treatment of HE with plasma exchange in a patient who presented with NCSE. Based on the actual evidence, the term "Encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis" may be the most proper. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first case of an adult patient studied twice with an (18)F-FDG brain PET: prior to treatment with plasma exchange, and at 3 months follow-up when the patient was clinically completely asymptomatic. Studies in more patients are needed to clarify the relevance of (18)F-FDG brain PET as a possible diagnostic tool for HE.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy presenting with stroke-like episodes in an adolescent female: a case report and literature review [^111fowSZ]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare form of encephalopathy thought to be of autoimmune etiology. Cognitive changes and seizures are the most commonly reported presenting manifestation. Stroke-like episodes have also been documented in these individuals. We describe a rare adolescent with Hashimoto encephalopathy who presented with stroke-like symptoms.

Patient Description

A previously well 15-year-old girl experienced sudden-onset language disturbance and right hemiparesis. Her symptoms resolved, but weeks later, she began experiencing refractory seizures, episodes of status epilepticus, and cognitive decline. An extensive evaluation was unremarkable, but thyroid peroxidase antibodies were elevated, and a diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalitis was made. Steroid therapy was initiated, and her symptoms resolved with return to baseline cognitive function.

Conclusion

Hashimoto encephalopathy is a highly treatable condition that may be considered in the differential diagnosis of children and adolescents presenting with stroke-like symptoms.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy presented with mutism: a case report [^111qdLNP]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hashimoto's encephalopathy presents with high serum antithyroid antibody concentrations in association with an excellent response to immunosuppressant therapies such as corticosteroids. Females were four to five times more likely to be affected by this condition, with a mean age of onset between 41 and 48 years, though rare occasional paediatric presentations were also reported. Encephalopathy, episodes of seizures, stroke-like focal neurological deficits, myoclonus and cognitive impairment are the common manifestations of this condition. Neuropsychiatric manifestations such as hallucinations and non-specific behavioural disturbances were reported in approximately 30% of patients as per the literature. Because of this, it often gets misdiagnosed as a psychiatric condition.

Here, we report on a child who presented with mutism and gait difficulties, and upon evaluation was diagnosed as having Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

### An unusual cause of cerebellovestibular symptoms [^113mhBo4]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) is a controversial autoimmune disorder, probably underdiagnosed, that causes a wide variety of neurological manifestations. Symptoms differ among patients and may be very severe in some cases. However, it can be treated, with a very good prognosis. In our case, a teenaged girl with a family history of migraine, vitiligo and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo presented with severe ataxia, vomiting and hypotension. She had a history of similar, but milder, symptoms and was misdiagnosed several times. She had subclinical hypothyroidism, and high levels of antithyroid antibodies. There were abnormal MRI and visual evoked potential findings. After excluding other more common causes, we diagnosed her as having 'Hashimoto Encephalopathy', and started treatment with corticosteroids, on which she showed dramatic improvement. After about 2 years of presentation, the patient is able to continue her life independently.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin [^111q1jng]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report an instance of Hashimoto encephalopathy probably resulting from pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.

Case Summary

A 36-year-old woman with a 10-year history of autoimmune thyroiditis presented with symptoms and signs consistent with Hashimoto encephalopathy during therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.

Discussion

Hashimoto encephalopathy is a rare autoimmune condition that occurs in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and high titers of antithyroid antibodies. It is characterized by a variety of nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms, increased cerebrospinal fluid protein level, and abnormal brain imaging and electroencephalogram. Prompt response to corticosteroids is observed in most cases. As of August 29, 2005, this is the first report of such an association. An objective causality assessment revealed that the Hashimoto encephalopathy was probably caused by the patient's medications.

Conclusions

Hashimoto encephalopathy may rarely be triggered by interferon alfa therapy in susceptible patients.

### Antibodies in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of psychotic disorders [^112P3aht]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy (also known as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, SREAT) is characterized by diverse neuropsychiatric signs in the presence of thyroid autoantibodies. Symptoms cannot merely be attributed to thyroid dysfunction. Endres et alhave recently reported a case of elevated antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody levels in a patient with a schizophrenia-like illness who responded well to immunosuppression with corticosteroids. They also reported antibodies to either TPO or thyroglobulin (TG) in 13 of a series of 100 patients with schizophreniform syndromes, raising the possibility that TPO and TG antibodies could be used to characterize a group of patients who might respond well to corticosteroid therapy.

Antibodies to infectious antigens may have a special role in personalizing adjunctive treatment for patients with psychotic disorders. An open-label study in 2003 showed an improvement in psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who were seropositive for CMV, but this was not replicated in a randomized double-blind trial. Prasad et al, in a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that 18 weeks of valacyclovir treatment improved cognition in a number of domains, but not psychotic symptoms, in HSV-1 seropositive patients with schizophrenia.

Despite the evidence of an association between psychotic disorders and antibodies against toxoplasma, these antibodies do not appear to predict symptomatic response to anti-toxoplasma therapy in schizophrenia, insofar as 4 RCTs have failed to find a main effect on psychotic symptoms. Notably one study did find that artemether treatment was associated with a greater reduction in PANSS negative symptom scores, and in clinical global impression scores, when compared with placebo, in 100 toxoplasma antibody–positive schizophrenia patients, although this was not the primary outcome of the trial.

Recently, dietary antibodies have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some cases of psychotic disorder. Case studies and case series indicate that patients who are seropositive for antibody markers of gluten sensitivity (eg, anti-gliadin, anti-transglutaminase antibodies)may benefit symptomatically from gluten-free dietsalthough trial evidence is lacking.

### A case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy: association with sensory ganglionopathy [^112A9FKx]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy with prominent unsteadiness of gait. Nerve conduction studies and electromyographic findings were consistent with a sensory ganglionopathy. Symptoms and clinical findings resolved with high-dose corticosteroid therapy and paralleled the levels of anti-microsomal antibodies. Sensory ganglionopathy seems to be another aspect of the broad clinical syndrome labeled Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy presenting with progressive cerebellar ataxia [^113B6Hig]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy has a wide clinical spectrum with various neuropsychiatric features. The detection of anti-thyroid antibodies in patient sera is helpful, but alone not sufficient for the diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy because of the high prevalence of antibodies in the normal population. Here, a patient with Hashimoto encephalopathy, who presented with progressive cerebellar ataxia with mild abnormality on electroencephalography (EEG) and who showed marked improvement after steroid administration, is described. This emphasises that Hashimoto encephalopathy can present with isolated cerebellar ataxia and is responsive to immunosupression.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy mimicking a brain tumor and its pathological findings: a case report [^115sDQaH]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy is characterized by the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies with no alternative cause. Patients with Hashimoto's encephalopathy present with various clinical symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. To our knowledge, this is the first documented report of Hashimoto's encephalopathy with MRI findings mimicking a brain tumor. The patient was a 41-year-old woman with a history of Hashimoto's disease. She experienced gradually worsening Parkinsonism and an MRI revealed a brain tumor-like lesion at the left caudate nucleus. She underwent a brain biopsy that revealed diffuse gliosis and perivascular lymphocyte infiltration with CD3+ T-cell predominance. No pathological signs of a brain tumor were found. Hashimoto's encephalopathy was suspected based on the patient's history and the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies. Her symptoms and the MRI findings improved with glucocorticoid treatment. Although there exist only a few studies on the pathology of Hashimoto's encephalopathy, our findings were consistent with those of previous reports. Our findings suggest cerebral vasculitis as an underlying etiology of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. We also emphasize the importance of considering Hashimoto's encephalopathy as a differential diagnosis of brain tumors.

### Thyrotoxic autoimmune encephalopathy: a repeat positron emission tomography study [^113ALhRn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Thyroid related autoantibodies have been related to the development of encephalopathy, known as Hashimoto's encephalopathy. However, their relation with the encephalopathy occurring in patients with Graves' disease has not been well established. The case is reported of a 51 year old woman presenting with subacute progressive dementia with evidence of hyperthyroidism. She had Graves' disease associated with high titres of thyroid related autoantibodies. Her encephalopathy was not improved by antithyroid drugs, but promptly responded to corticosteroid treatment, and stabilised with a gradual reduction of thyroid related autoantibody titres. Brain positron emission tomography initially showed a diffuse and multifocal cerebral hypometabolism with subsequent normalisation on her clinical recovery, which was consistent with the acute and reversible cerebral inflammation probably mediated by autoimmune mechanisms.

### Treatment of refractory convulsive status epilepticus: a comprehensive review by the American Epilepsy Society treatments committee [^114v98Ep]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Database searches identified no class I, no class II, 9 class III, and multiple class IV studies on the use of the 13 ASMs in the treatment of CRSE.

Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Corticosteroids, and IVIg

Immunomodulatory therapies include IM ACTH, IV corticosteroids, and IVIg. The mechanisms and roles that inflammation and the immune system play in epilepsy and SE are currently a topic of active investigation. Conditions associated with SE that may respond to immunomodulatory therapies include Rasmussen encephalitis, Hashimoto encephalitis, antibody-mediated encephalitis (eg, N -methyl-aspartate receptor, LGI1, and GABA B R antibodies) which can cause RSE, and selected cases of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) and febrile infection-related epileptic seizures (FIRES). Patients with Rasmussen encephalitis rarely develop CSE but rather develop focal SE or epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). Corticosteroids, IVIg, and other immunomodulatory therapies are an important part of the treatment of these patients. The effects of these therapies are variable, and studies have not demonstrated a sustained response. In a case series of patients with encephalitis and seizures associated with GABA A receptor antibodies, 6 patients had RSE or EPC, of whom 4 required pharmacologically induced coma for treatment.

### Progressive dementia caused by Hashimoto's encephalopathy – report of two cases [^111wUkdc]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Dementia induced by Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) seems to be a rare condition. We report on two patients, who revealed a syndrome consisting of a rapid progressive dementia with myocloni. In both patients, the detection of antithyroid antibodies enabled the diagnosis of HE. The symptoms receded completely during a high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. In patients with rapidly progressive dementia or with dementia of unknown origin, HE should be considered.

### Autoantibody-associated psychiatric syndromes: a systematic literature review resulting in 145 cases [^112gt73h]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic findings and tumor association

The diagnostic work-up that most frequently showed abnormalities was CSF analysis (in 78% of the reported cases). EEGs revealed alterations in 61% of the cases, and MRI pathologies were described in 51% of the cases. When analyzing the results of these three main clinical diagnostic procedures (CSF analyses, EEG, MRI), only one abnormality was found in 44 cases (30%), two alterations in 57 cases (39%), and three pathologies in 22 case reports (15%). FDG-PET results of the brain were reported for nine cases (seven patients had Abs against cell surface antigens) and alterations were detected in all patients (100%); predominant hypermetabolic alterations were found in five (56%) and hypometabolic changes in four cases (44%). Tumor detection was described in 32 cases (22%). None of the patients with Hashimoto encephalopathy had an associated neoplasm (Table 2).

Table 2.
Findings of instrument-based diagnostics

Immunomodulatory treatment approaches

Immunomodulatory treatment was performed in 126 cases (87%). A total of 118 cases (94%) benefited from these interventions as reported by the primary authors. Seventy-one patients (56%) were treated with only one immunomodulatory drug, and 69 of these patients (97%) benefited from it. Fifty-five patients (44%) were treated with more than one immunomodulatory drug, and improvement was reported for 49 cases (89%). Overall, most patients were treated with steroids (N = 119; 94%) and 106 subjects (89%) improved. Most frequently, intravenous immunoglobulins (N = 51, 43%) and plasma exchange (N = 42, 33%) were used as second- and third-line interventions. The detailed therapy approaches and responses are summarized in Table 3.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy in the 21st century [^115snVAG]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report the presenting syndromes and to determine whether pretreatment criteria of Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) predict response to steroids.

Methods

We assessed symptoms and steroid responsiveness in 24 patients with pretreatment criteria of HE, including (1) subacute onset of cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms, or seizures; (2) euthyroid status or mild hypothyroidism; (3) serum thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) > 200 IU/mL; (4) absent neuronal antibodies in serum/CSF; and (5) no other etiologies. Additional studies included determination of TPOAb (> 200 IU/mL) in 74 patients with criteria of possible autoimmune encephalitis (AE) without neuronal antibodies and 205 patients with different neuroimmunologic diseases, psychosis, or new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE). Serum antibodies to the amino (ΝΗ2)-terminal of α-enolase (NH₂-α-enolaseAb) were examined in the indicated 24 patients and 13 controls.

Results

The 24 patients (14 women) with suspected HE had a median age of 48 years (range 8–79 years). Four syndromes were identified: psychiatric (7, 29%), encephalopathy (7, 29%), NORSE-like (6, 25%), and limbic encephalitis (4, 17%). Only 6 of 19 (31.6%) patients completely responded to steroids. The frequency of TPOAb in the 74 patients with possible AE (6 of 74, 8.1%) was similar to that of the 205 controls (17 of 205, 8.2%; p = 0.84). NH2-α-enolaseAb were identified in 1 of 24 suspected HE cases and 1 of 13 controls.

Conclusion

Current pretreatment criteria of HE do not predict steroid responsiveness. The detection of TPOAb across all control groups reveals their poor disease-specificity. NH2-α-enolaseAb did not help in the diagnosis of HE. These findings imply a redefinition of HE that requires a systematic exclusion of antibody-mediated encephalitis.

### Rarity of encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis: a case series from mayo clinic from 1950 to 1996 [^115vrohq]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (also called Hashimoto's encephalopathy) is a rare, life-threatening, treatable, and possibly autoimmune condition. We identified nine patients (with the diagnosis made after 1979) who had relapsing encephalopathy compatible with previous reports of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and no other identifiable cause of encephalopathy at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Of these nine patients, three were clinically hypothyroid, four were subclinically hypothyroid, and two were euthyroid. Thyroid antibodies were positive in eight of eight patients in whom these measurements were made. Electroencephalographic abnormalities were identified in eight of the nine patients (89%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities considered etiologically related to encephalopathy were present in three patients (33%). An increased protein concentration was noted on cerebrospinal fluid examination in seven patients (78%). Of the six patients who received high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, 5 (83%) had improvement of neurologic symptoms. In conclusion, encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis is rare but important to recognize because it may be responsive to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. We believe that this condition is not caused by thyroid dysfunction or antithyroid antibodies but represents an association of an uncommon autoimmune encephalopathy with a common autoimmune thyroid disease. The term Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a misnomer and should not be used.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy presented with mutism: a case report [^115acYcK]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Mutism can present in functional psychiatric disorder; however, it is extremely important to perform a thorough physical and systemic examination to rule out organic causes for mutism. In the case of psychiatric disorder, mutism is often a gradual onset during preschool age. It is commonly linked with social phobia, autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In selective mutism, children often face the dilemma of whether they should speak or not; eventually, they get adapted to certain kinds of stimulus. Any form of encephalitis, either chronic or acute, can present with a complex neurobehavioural problems that have been previously reported in the literature. It is only possible to rule with sensible clinical examination and laboratory investigations.

In our case, the only positive findings are positivity of anti-TPO and low T3, which can be non-specific as these can also be detectable in a healthy population. However, clinical correlation and improvement with IVIG are the pointers towards the neuropsychiatric presentation of an organic condition. The parathyroid level might be increased for a transient period as in our case, which can be explained by an inflammatory process involving both the glands. This condition is generally steroid responsive, but in children, only 55% of patients were found to be responsive, which was also very slow. Steroid-resistant cases are treated with immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. In our case, the patient was treated with IVIG as the neurologist wanted prompt improvement in the children.

We are presenting this case as this is the first-ever reported case of selective mutism in the background of autoimmune or Hashimoto's encephalitis; hence, this may be of great value in the field of neuropsychiatry.

### Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with hashimoto thyroiditis [^113awhTN]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old girl presented with sudden sensory disturbance and left-sided muscle weakness. MRI revealed ischaemic change in the right lateral thalamus and the right internal capsule. During sonographic work-up of the cervical arteries, inflammation of the thyroid gland was noted. The results of the thyroid function tests and antibody titers confirmed Hashimoto thyroidits. Under high-dose corticosteroids, the girl had a full neurological recovery.

### The neurological disorder associated with thyroid autoimmunity [^1125V2nU]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The neurological disorder associated with thyroid autoimmunity is an elusive disease that neurologists have learned to recognize in the last few years. The diagnosis is made, after excluding more common diseases, when neuropsychiatric symptoms develop in a patient with high serum concentrations of anti-thyroid antibodies. The clinical presentations of the disease and the many controversial issues surrounding the diagnosis, the pathogenesis, the role of thyroid autoantibodies, and the choice of therapy are reviewed and discussed in the light of the medical literature in English.

### Hashimoto encephalopathy in a 15-year-old-girl: EEG findings and follow-up [^115fGsdG]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy is characterized by severe neuropsychiatric findings, including psychosis, confusion, seizures, stupor, stroke-like episodes, tremor, and myoclonus. The combination of findings is variable. Hashimoto encephalopathy constitutes an important differential diagnosis in patients with encephalopathy. The triad of encephalopathy, corresponding electroencephalographic slowing, and increased protein content in cerebrospinal fluid should prompt testing of anti-thyroid antibodies in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Elevated antibody levels support the diagnosis. We describe a 15-year-old girl with a fluctuating course of Hashimoto encephalopathy. Electroencephalograms revealed no specific alterations, but widespread slowing of the background activity occurred during two episodes of fluctuating encephalopathy. Cortical edema was indicated by cranial magnetic resonance imaging during the first episode of encephalopathy, in the context of cerebral seizures. Laboratory findings were in accordance with Hashimoto encephalopathy, which was steroid-responsive.

### Central nervous system vasculitis with positive antithyroid antibodies in an adolescent boy [^115DErPT]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Hashimoto's encephalopathy is diagnosed when patients exhibit features of corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy and positive antithyroid antibodies. The relationship between antithyroid antibodies and encephalopathy is subject to considerable debate. We describe corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy in a 14-year-old boy with positive antimicrosomal antibodies. His history included subtle neurocognitive decline. He presented with seizures. He underwent a brain biopsy before initiating treatment after his third episode. That biopsy was consistent with central nervous system vasculitis. This report is unique because, to our knowledge, it describes the first pretreatment brain biopsy of a pediatric patient who fits the criteria for Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

### Limbic encephalitis associated with elevated antithyroid antibodies [^11425rg4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Immune-mediated limbic encephalitis affects both adults and children. Patients typically present with seizures, memory problems, and imaging changes in the medial temporal lobes. Both paraneoplastic and nonparaneoplastic forms have been described in which the antibody to the voltage-gated potassium channel-complex associated protein, leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1, is most commonly reported. Elevated antithyroid antibodies have also been reported in a range of neurological syndromes with encephalopathy, such as limbic encephalitis, often collectively termed Hashimoto encephalopathy, a condition whereby corticosteroids responsiveness with a complete recovery is commonly observed. Here we describe 3 children presenting with limbic encephalitis with elevated thyroid antibodies that did not respond to corticosteroids alone and required more aggressive immunotherapy, mirroring the slower treatment response that is more frequently seen in other immune-mediated forms of limbic encephalitis.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy after intensive lymphocyte depletion with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin in a renal transplant patient [^116w4dic]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

There has been no reported case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) ('steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis', 'SREAT'), in the renal transplant recipient population. We describe the case of a 55-year-old female with Type-1 diabetes who presented 2 years posttransplantation in a comatose state that had developed over the preceding 24 h. The patient had received a short, intensive course of rATG induction at the time of transplantation and early steroid withdrawal. After 6 months she had been withdrawn from calcineurin inhibitors and was maintained on mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus. Systematic workup determined the cause of her coma to be HE. High-dose steroid therapy resulted in complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. The literature regarding the diagnosis, course and treatment of HE is reviewed and the possibility that increased use of steroid-free immunosuppression and intensive lymphocyte depletion regimens may increase the prevalence of de novo autoimmune disease is discussed.

### Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT): characteristics, treatment and outcome in 251 cases from the literature [^115uyg4X]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Steroid-responsive encephalopathy and associated autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) is characterized by encephalopathy and the presence of antithyroid antibodies. We describe the clinical presentation, outcome and treatments for SREAT by a systematic review of the literature.

Methods

MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published until 2015. Inclusion criteria were unexplained encephalopathy with antithyroid antibodies.

Results

We found reports of 251 patients (median age 52years [range 18–86], 73% females, 80 [32%] with preexisting thyroiditis). Patients presented encephalitis signs with convulsions (n = 117; 47%), confusion (n = 115, 46%), speech disorder (n = 91, 37%), memory impairment (n = 107, 43%), gait disturbance (n = 67, 27%) and persecutory delusions (n = 61, 25%). Twenty-eight patients (11%) presented progressive memory impairment and 26 (10%) isolated psychiatric disorders. In serum, 34% of patients were positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, 7% for anti-thyroglobulin (TG) antibodies, and 69% both. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were usually normal, at 2 UI/ml [0.001–205]. Cerebrospinal fluid from 10/53 patients (19%) was positive for anti-TPO antibodies, 2/53 (4%) anti-TG antibodies and 28 (53%) both. Electroencephalography findings were abnormal for 82% of patients, showing diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy (70%) or epileptic activity (14%). The first-line treatment was steroids in 193 patients and other immunosuppressive drugs in 10 cases. At a median follow-up of 12months [range 0.2–110], 91% of patients showed complete or partial neurological response, with anti-TPO and -TG antibody titers at 347 UI/ml [0–825,000] and 110 UI/ml [0–50,892], respectively. During follow-up, 40 patients (16%) experienced at least one relapse. Relapse was more frequent in patients with initial coma (26% vs 13%, p = 0.08).

Conclusion

The diagnosis of SREAT should be suspected in case of encephalopathy without obvious cause, to quickly start corticosteroid treatment. The exact modalities of treatment must be defined.

### Pediatric anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with catatonia: treatment with electroconvulsive therapy [^115c3uVD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Since its discovery in 2007, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is being recognized more frequently, especially in adolescents and young adults. As demonstrated by this case, the presentation of this autoimmune encephalitis may closely mimic primary psychiatric syndromes, but the disease process is unresponsive, or possibly exacerbated by psychotropic interventions.

Diagnosing anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is often challenging given the wide range of clinical presentation, and may be further complicated by its overlap of symptoms, brain MRI changes, CSF findings with other entities affecting the brain. The differential diagnosis includes viral infections (e.g. HSV-1), other auto-immune processes (e.g. acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis or Hashimoto's encephalitis), primary central nervous system vasculitis, or other described encephalitides. Even though the diagnosis can be made by identifying antibodies in immune-mediated encephalitis, the diagnosis may be delayed by weeks to months. One retrospective study found the median time from presentation to diagnosis to be 47 days for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, and even longer in other auto-immune encephalitides. Delay in immune suppressive therapy is associated with adverse outcomes. Conventional clinical neurological assessment and standard diagnostic tests (MRI, EEG, and CSF studies) are reasonable approaches to decide early treatment of probable anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis since antibody testing or response to immunosuppression are late diagnostic criteria.

Immune suppressive therapies improve the prognosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. First-line treatment, including high-dose corticosteroids combined with either IVIG or PLEX or both, results in improvement of one-half of patients at 3–4 weeks. Second-line therapy (rituximab and/or cyclophosphamide) is efficacious in many patients with persistent symptoms after failing first-line treatment. The choice and escalation of immune suppressive therapies depend on the severity of clinical symptoms and clinical response. In our case, early intense first-line treatment (high dose corticosteroids and PLEX) was started due to the severe clinical condition. Ten days later, after antibody confirmation of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and the failure to improve on first-line treatment, rituximab and IVIG were added. Even with the prompt initiation of first and second-line immunosuppression, the patient continued to suffer from malignant catatonia which required initiation of anti-catatonic treatments.

### Hashimoto's encephalopathy presented with mutism: a case report [^115vmg4b]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is a unique case of Hashimoto's encephalitis presenting as selective mutism. Generally, Hashimoto's encephalopathy presents with psychosis, mood fluctuations, insomnia, irritability and cognitive dysfunction. Vasculitis or disseminated encephalomyelitis secondary to impairment in cerebral perfusion is the main cause of encephalopathy. Hashimoto's encephalopathy can also present with reversible dementia with differential diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease or viral encephalitis. Seizures, confusion, headache, ataxia and hallucinations are common paediatric presentations.EEG often shows epileptiform waves, and MRI findings are generally nonspecific. Thyroid function may be normal; however, thyroid abnormalities do not correlate with encephalopathy. Even anti-TPO antibody titre does not correlate with the symptomatic presentation.

Selective mutism is a child psychiatric condition, which usually presents around the age of 5 years, characterised by a refusal to speak in particular settings. In this condition, children may speak at home but not in other situations or front of strangers. However, often they note by nodding or by writing if encouraged. This may lead to impaired scholastic performance and isolation from peers. This condition frequently associates with an anxiety disorder as a comorbid diagnosis. As per DSM-5 criteria, minimum period of 1 month is sufficient to make a diagnosis.

### Cerebellopathy secondary to anti-peroxidase antibody-mediated toxicity. A special case of hashimoto encephalopathy [^116vN3Fh]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this case report is to highlight the importance of recognizing uncommon causes of cerebellar involvement.

Case Presentation

A 45-year-old woman with no medical history who presented gait instability that appears suddenly and evolves rapidly in two weeks, causing frequent falls. Neurological examination revealed an inability to walk due to severe ataxia, accompanied by global hypotonia, appendicular dysmetria, opsoclonus and dysarthria. We studied this patient with cerebellar syndrome, obtaining as relevant findings global cerebellar atrophy in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and especially, considerably elevated levels of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The patient was treated with high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone for 5days. Six months after diagnosis and in treatment with low doses of prednisone, the patient is asymptomatic.

Conclusion

We must considerer the cerebellar involvement secondary to steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) in a patient in whom other more frequent causes of isolated cerebellar disease have been ruled out.

Subgroup analyses

In the next step, we analyzed the differences between the subgroups of patients with (1) Abs against neuronal cell surface antigens, (2) Abs against intracellular antigens, and (3) Hashimoto encephalopathy/SREAT. The descriptive findings are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
Age and gender: The subgroups differed significantly in age (F = 3.64; p = 0.029). Patients with Abs against intracellular antigens were the oldest, followed by patients with Hashimoto encephalopathy. There were no significant differences in the gender distribution between the three subgroups (χ² = 1.15; p = 0.563).
Clinical syndromes: The clinical syndromes showed no significantly different distribution (χ 2 = 20.55; p = 0.196). Patients with Abs against cell surface antigens were most commonly afflicted by schizophreniform syndromes (36%), patients with Abs against intracellular antigens by amnestic/dementia-like syndromes (80%), and patients with Hashimoto encephalopathy by schizophreniform syndromes (36%).
Diagnostic investigations: EEG: The frequency of EEG pathologies did not differ between the three subgroups (W = 0.93; p = 0.627). CSF: CSF pathologies were found in significantly different frequencies between the subgroups (W = 15.41; p < 0.001). The most common CSF abnormalities were seen in patients with Abs against cell surface antigens (in 89%). MRI: Significant differences were observed in the occurrence of MRI changes (W = 8.66; p = 0.013). Patients with Abs against intracellular antigens most often displayed MRI pathologies (86%). Tumor association: There was a significant difference in the presence of accompanying tumor diseases (χ² = 23.36; p < 0.001). Tumors were detected in 47% of the patients with Abs against intracellular antigens and in 31% of the patients with Abs against cell surface antigens and in no patients with Hashimoto encephalopathy/SREAT.
Immunomodulatory treatment response: All patients with Hashimoto encephalopathy/SREAT responded to immunomodulatory treatment (inclusion criterion). The comparison between patients of the two other groups showed a trend to better responses to immunomodulatory drugs in patients with Abs against cell surface antigens (χ² = 3.60; p = 0.058).

### Autoimmune encephalitis: what the radiologist needs to know [^117PDnv1]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT)

Previously known as Hashimoto's encephalitis (HE), SREAT is a condition associated with autoantibodies against thyroid antigens, for which the pathogenetic role is still controversial. SREAT can mimic AE both by presenting with T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the MTL structures, and by causing memory deficits, psychiatric symptoms and seizures. Moreover, as seen in AE, SREAT may also be MRI-negative (~ 50% of the cases). However, SREAT is characterized by a peculiar "migratory pattern", consisting in the disappearance of some signal abnormalities over time, while new signal alterations appear in new sites. Additionally, SREAT often presents a preferential white matter involvement: leukoencephalopathy with confluent T2/FLAIR alterations. These two MRI findings aid the distinction between SREAT and AE. In addition, approximately 1/3 of SREAT cases occur in patients with a known thyroid disfunction, according to a revision of 251 cases. It is worth noting that the definition of SREAT/HE is evolving. For instance, evidence from a recent study has challenged SREAT/HE definition, by highlighting that in a cohort of patients fulfilling criteria for these conditions, these criteria are not able to actually predict response to steroids.

Other infectious and immune-mediated conditions

AE with a striatal involvement, especially anti-CV2/CRMP5, may resemble other conditions affecting the basal ganglia, and particularly Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). In the suspicion of CJD, seeking the typical patterns of DWI restriction in the basal ganglia and/or in the cortex is crucial.

As already discussed, some Group I AE (e.g. anti-Ma/Ta, anti-Hu) can involve the brainstem and the cerebellum. In these cases, alternative causes of rhombencephalitis should be considered, especially Listeria encephalitis. In Listeria encephalitis, enhancement is frequent and supratentorial involvement is rare. In addition, CSF examination and CSF and blood cultures may aid the diagnosis. It should be noted that AE is a relatively rare cause of rhombencephalitis, as other bacterial (Listeria), viral (Herpesviridae, Epstein-Barr), and immune-mediated (Behçet) etiologies are more common.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^112fSjJi]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute immunotherapy

Several retrospective studies have shown that early and aggressive immunotherapy is associated with better outcomes in AE patients. The 2016 AE clinical criteria emphasise the importance of starting immunotherapy once AE is highly suspected and infectious etiologies are excluded based on CSF results (cell-count, glucose, viral PCR, gram stain). It is impractical and potentially hazardous to delay immunotherapy until AE is confirmed by a positive antibody. There are no robust clinical trials comparing the different modalities of acute immunotherapy; therefore, the choice of the initial therapy may be based on anecdotal evidence and factors related to the specific syndromic presentation and comorbidities as shown in figure 4 and detailed below:

Figure 4

### Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies with encephalopathy in MELAS syndrome [^114Z6yVG]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Both the syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome) and Hashimoto's encephalopathy can present with nonspecific encephalopathy. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is an association of steroid-responsive encephalopathy with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy, however, is not characteristic of the MELAS syndrome, which typically presents with stroke-like episodes and lactic acidosis in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Here, a patient is described with goiter, recurrent encephalopathy and elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies who apparently responded to steroid therapy; however, magnetic resonance imaging was atypical for Hashimoto's encephalopathy, and she was diagnosed with MELAS syndrome. This syndrome can present with apparent steroid-responsive encephalopathy and elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies, mimicking Hashimoto's encephalopathy, and should be suspected if lactic acidosis is present and typical features are detected on magnetic resonance imaging.

### Autoantibodies against the amino terminal of α-enolase are a useful diagnostic marker of Hashimoto's encephalopathy [^116kcxFB]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2005). Low credibility.

We investigated autoantibodies and their epitope(s) in Hashimoto's encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In a proteomic analysis, they proved to recognize alpha-enolase. We further searched the epitope region in alpha-enolase using different regions of recombinant proteins expressed in cultured human cells. The amino terminal region was recognized by autobodies from a much higher proportion of patients with Hashimoto's encephalopathy (83.3%; 5/6) than from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (11.8%; 2/17), and not at all by sera from controls (25 healthy individuals and 25 controls with other neurological disorders) (0%; 0/50). Neither the carboxyl terminal nor the mid-region of alpha-enolase showed specificity for Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Autoantibodies against the amino terminal of alpha-enolase are a useful diagnostic marker for Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1154E9Qy]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or acute liver failure (ALF) due to AIH — glucocorticoids and timing of liver transplantation (LT): Glucocorticoid therapy (usually prednisolone or prednisone; 0.5–1 mg/kg daily in adults and up to 2 mg/kg in children) has been effective in 20%-100% of patients with acute severe AIH and has not been associated with an increase in sepsis. In AIH with ALF, glucocorticoids have not been associated with improved overall survival, and survival has been less in treated patients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores > 40; reports of improvement with mild encephalopathy have been sparse and therapy may be deleterious in severe decompensation. The key is to abandon ineffective treatment quickly (within 1–2 weeks depending on clinical status and treatment response) and proceed to LT; failure to improve laboratory tests or any clinical deterioration or hepatic encephalopathy during treatment justifies immediate consideration of LT, and hepatic encephalopathy at presentation defines ALF with AIH and is associated with LT being more likely to improve survival than protracted glucocorticoid treatment.

### The growing spectrum of antibody-associated inflammatory brain diseases in children [^116LJYrN]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical spectrum, diagnostic evaluation, current management, and neurologic outcome of pediatric antibody-associated inflammatory brain diseases (AB-associated IBrainD).

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients aged ≤ 18 years diagnosed with an AB-associated IBrainD at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, between January 2005 and June 2013. Standardized clinical data, laboratory test results, neuroimaging features, and treatment regimens were captured.

Results

Of 169 children (93 female, 55%) diagnosed with an IBrainD, 16 (10%) had an AB-associated IBrainD. Median age at presentation was 13.3 years (range 3.1–17.9); 11 (69%) were female. Nine patients (56%) had anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, 4 (25%) had aquaporin-4 autoimmunity, 2 (13%) had Hashimoto encephalitis, and 1 (6%) had anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) encephalitis. The key presenting features in children with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, Hashimoto encephalopathy, and anti-GAD65 encephalitis included encephalopathy, behavioral symptoms, and seizures; patients with aquaporin-4 autoimmunity showed characteristic focal neurologic deficits. Six patients (38%) required intensive care unit admission at presentation. Median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 55 days (range 6–358). All but 1 patient received immunosuppressive therapy. One child with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis died due to multiorgan failure. At last follow-up, after a median follow-up time of 1.7 years (range 0.8–3.7), 27% of the children had function-limiting neurologic sequelae.

Conclusions

Children with AB-associated IBrainD represent an increasing subgroup among IBrainD; 1 in 4 children has function-limiting residual neurologic deficits. Awareness of the different clinical patterns is important in order to facilitate timely diagnosis and initiate immunosuppressive treatment.

### Autoimmune neurology: the need for comprehensive care [^115hMtTL]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Incorporating Research Into Multidisciplinary Care

International, multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to guide treatment in AE and limit variability in treatment approaches. A number of off-label immunotherapies have been proposed for AE, but there is no consensus on the type, timing, dose, or route of delivery of these agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the selection of safe and efficacious therapies. One of the strengths of a dedicated neurology clinic for autoimmune patients is the ability to offer unique opportunities for patients through clinical trial participation. These multidisciplinary autoimmune neurology clinics would be ideally positioned to serve as a portal to these studies. Research can span many relevant areas such as drug development, neuroimaging, genomics, quality of life, and behavioral studies including evaluation of neurocognitive outcomes. Furthermore, a biospecimen repository may be effectively used in these clinics to facilitate future research projects.

Teprotumumab (Tepezza), a fully human insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) — inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb), was approved for treatment of thyroid eye disease (TED) in 2020. The effect of blocking IGF-1R activation and signalling pathways of teprotumumab is the first treatment shown to be beneficial in reducing proptosis and diplopia. Teprotumumab is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for a total of eight doses (10 mg/kg initial dose followed by 20 mg/kg for the next seven doses). Common side effects include nausea, diarrhoea, muscle spasms, hearing impairment, dysgeusia, headaches, dry skin, infusion reactions, alopecia, paresthesia, weight loss and hyperglycaemia. Other reported serious effects may include optic neuropathy, Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE), Escherichia infection, urinary retention and inflammatory bowel disease.

### Multiple disease associations in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II [^116qD8pB]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II (APS II) is characterized by adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), autoimmune thyroid disease, and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). Multiple other autoimmune diseases have been associated with APS II. Here we report a case of a patient with APS II who over the course of 10 years developed Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, DM1, Hashimoto's encephalopathy, vitiligo, celiac disease, seronegative arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. This is a particularly aggressive course of APS II, and this combination of autoimmune diseases has not been previously reported.

Methods

A 25-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), celiac disease, and DM1 presented to our institution with mental status changes. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto's encephalopathy and treated with high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). She recovered well from her encephalopathy but her posthospitalization course was complicated due to the development of Addison's disease, vitiligo, seronegative arthritis, and hypothyroidism.

Results

The current understanding of APS II and its autoimmune disease associations are briefly summarized. The association of UC and Hashimoto's encephalopathy with APS II is novel and discussed in detail.

Conclusion

A case of a patient with APS II with a dramatic development of 8 autoimmune diseases over 10 years is described. The novel APS II developments of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and UC are discussed. This case highlights the potential complexity and severity of the clinical course of APS II.

### Autoantibody-associated psychiatric syndromes: a systematic literature review resulting in 145 cases [^112ZJXsD]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Subgroup definition

We classified patients by Ab type: (1) against neuronal cell surface antigens, (2) against intracellular/synaptic antigens, and (3) with steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT)/Hashimoto encephalopathy. We also distinguished patients by predominant clinical syndrome (schizophreniform, amnestic/dementia-like, depressive, manic, confusional, anxiety-compulsive, tic, sleep disturbance, or autistic). The schizophreniform group included patients with paranoid-hallucinatory, catatonic, hebephrenic, and schizoaffective syndromes. The confusional syndrome category represented a residual category that included patients with confusion and other accompanying symptoms that could not be assigned to the other syndrome groups. The severity of brain involvement was assessed based on the number of additional abnormal findings from MRIs, EEGs, and CSFs.

Statistics

The data were transferred to a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 24 (IBM, New York, USA) database. The main results are presented descriptively. The subgroup comparisons (between patients with different Abs) for categorical variables (e.g. gender, therapy response) were carried out using Pearson's χ² test or via binominal logistic regression for age-dependent variables (e.g. CSF, MRI, or EEG pathologies). The dimensional variables (e.g. age) were compared using a one-way ANOVA. For all statistical analyses, a p value of < 0.05 served as the criterion of significance.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: recent clinical and biological advances [^112diq6J]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Since 2015, the field of autoimmune encephalitis has witnessed a number of advances in our understanding of the underlying biology and the correlation of this with more refined clinical observations. Our hope is that by the time of our next review, the use of early, targeted immunotherapies is commonplace in these conditions and has had an appreciable impact on the long-term outcomes of patients. To integrate the emerging biological insights with our progress around patient-relevant outcomes and the limitations of currently available therapies, the field now needs to embrace experimental medicine approaches. Some classical clinical trials are underway but may be hampered by difficulty recruiting immunotherapy-naïve patients. Nevertheless, a large pipeline of exciting new treatments will likely enter clinical trials in the near future. If incorporated with further dissection of the underlying biology, these trials are likely to provide a foundation for patient treatments over the next decade.

7. MANAGEMENT OF MODERATE-TO-SEVERE TED

7.1. Medical therapies

A range of therapies are available for treatment of moderate-to-severe active TED, as supported by evidence from RCTs. Efficacy and safety are key elements in deciding among available therapies. Several therapies require parenteral infusion and premedication to avoid common AEs. Serious AEs can rarely occur during infusion and beyond, making it imperative that these therapies are administered in a safe environment. Individual patient features are important as some treatments are more effective for specific components of TED than others (Table 5).

Appraising the role of different medical therapies is limited by heterogeneity in inclusion criteria (particularly disease activity and duration of TED), and in methods for assessing response to treatment as well as documenting and classifying AEs. The introduction of biologics has raised the cost of treatment many fold over conventional agents. No cost-effectiveness appraisals are available, nor comparative effectiveness trials for any currently available medical therapy for TED. The use of standardized treatment outcomes in clinical trials involving patients with TED has been recently proposed. Making decisions about treatment of moderate-to-severe TED lends itself particularly well to the principles of shared decision making. Tables 5–8 and Figure 5 are intended to aid this process.

### N-methyl-D-aspartate antibody encephalitis: temporal progression of clinical and paraclinical observations in a predominantly non-paraneoplastic disorder of both sexes [^115wrxcV]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Twenty-three percent of our cases overall were children aged between 2 and 17, confirming the increasing numbers of children, often without tumours, who develop this antibody (Florance et al.), some of whom had been given a previous diagnosis of encephalitis lethargica (Dale et al.). Since some of the features and investigations overlap with those of other disorders, such as Hashimoto's encephalitis (Castillo et al.) and the paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS, Church et al.), the phenotype associated with this antibody may expand in both children and adults.

For serial measurements on sera we used immunoprecipitation of solubilized native NR1-EGFP dimers, but this assay would need further refinement for use in serological diagnosis or on CSF. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Dalmau et al.) has been used successfully for serum and CSF studies, although at present we feel that the cell-based assay offers the best sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis. Using our NR1-EGFP immunoprecipitation assay, the nine paraneoplastic patients, eight of whom were females aged between 20 and 35 years with ovarian teratomas, had higher serum NR1-antibody levels than the non-paraneoplastic patients and did well after early tumour removal (as in Dalmau et al.). Follow-up in the non-paraneoplastic patients, who accounted for 80% of our cohort, extend previous data (Dalmau et al; Florance et al.) that reported a less good response to immunotherapy in the non-paraneoplastic patients. Our best outcomes were in those patients treated early (≤ 40 days), and given glucocorticosteroids and at least one other immunotherapy, whereas 9/10 of the relapsing patients received insubstantial or no immunotherapy during their previous episode(s). In some cases, positive NMDAR antibodies were still present after treatment of the first episode when only partial clinical remission had been obtained (two examples are shown in Fig. 4). This, together with the finding of high and persistent antibody levels in the three patients who died, and reduction of antibody titres in patients who improved, suggests that the condition needs to be treated more intensively and may need long-term maintenance immunosuppression. This contrasts with voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies which, in general, fall rapidly following similar immunotherapy (Thieben et al; Vincent et al.), although occasionally patients do relapse (Irani and Vincent, unpublished observations). With an average hospital stay of 160 days, long periods of ventilation and multiple infectious complications, this condition is now becoming a recognized and relatively frequent cause of admission to intensive care (Davies et al.).

### Hashimoto encephalopathy… [^111XuJvn]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

On hospital admission, she was comatose. Brainstem reflexes were present, and painful stimuli resulted in extensor posturing of all limbs. Brain magnetic resonance images revealed diffuse, nonenhancing white matter hyperintensity, sparing the posterior fossa and deep gray nuclei. Treatment with intravenous valproic acid, phosphenytoin, mannitol, and methylprednisolone resulted in rapid improvement. The CSF leukocyte count was 26 × 103/µL, the protein concentration was 0. 098 g/dL, and viral and bacterial culture findings were negative. With glucocorticoid therapy, she gradually improved; 15 months later, while taking prednisone, she was asymptomatic, and cognitive function was normal. Administration of the same dose of prednisone was continued, and she remained well at last evaluation. We conducted a MEDLINE search using the words "Hashimoto" or "autoimmune thyroiditis" and "encephalopathy.

" We retrieved articles in all languages, and we reviewed references cited in these articles. We did not consider patients described in abstracts. 59, 60. Twenty-four patients were treated with glucocorticoids and levothyroxine, of whom 22 improved. Twelve patients were treated with levothyroxine alone; 8 improved. The clinical characteristics of the patients who improved in response to treatment with glucocorticoids, glucocorticoids and levothyroxine, and levothyroxine were similar. One patient was treated with glucocorticoids and carbimazole, 1 with anticonvulsant drugs, and 1 with plasma exchange; all 3 improved. Eight treated patients did not improve: 1 patient treated with glucocorticoids, 2 treated with glucocorticoids and levothyroxine, 4 treated with levothyroxine, and 1 treated with intravenous immunoglobulins. One patient received no treatment and did not improve.

Among the 85 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 47 had subclinical or overt hypothyroidism; 8 of these 47 patients improved in response to levothyroxine therapy, and 19 improved in response to levothyroxine and glucocorticoid therapy.

### Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis… [^1159xBRv]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Cranial MRI was performed in 19 patients. Fourteen patients had normal imaging results or nonspecific white matter abnormalities consistent with age. Four patients had a diffuse increased signal on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images in the cerebral white matter, and 1 MRI showed extensive dural enhancement. Following corticosteroid therapy, the MRI findings normalized in the 4 cases with white matter signal changes; meningeal enhancement has persisted for throughout 5 years in the other patient. By definition, marked clinical improvement was seen in all patients following high-dose corticosteroid therapy, in which 15 returned to their normal neurologic baseline status and 5 had mild residual symptoms, which included tremor in 1, gait impairment in 1, mild forgetfulness in 1, mild forgetfulness and tremor in 1, and mild forgetfulness and gait impairment in 1.

Intravenous methylprednisolone, 1 g/d for 5 days, was used in 17 patients followed by a course of oral steroids in 6 patients. Oral prednisone, 60–100 mg/d for 10 to 30 days, was used in 3 patients. Eight patients were able to discontinue the use of steroids after initial treatment and had no relapses. Three required treatment of relapses with additional short courses of intravenous methylprednisolone, and 9 patients required continuous treatment with oral steroids or with other immunomodulatory therapy to maintain remission. These other therapies included azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and intravenous immunoglobulin. Thyroid hormone therapy was initiated in patients with laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, but neurologic improvement did not correlate with thyroid hormone therapy.

However, because of our experience with another patient with an increased signal in the cortical ribbon on FLAIR images who responded to corticosteroids and the report of increased 14–3–3 protein levels in other patients diagnosed as having Hashimoto encephalopathy who responded to steroids, 14 we treated these 3 patients with steroids in the unlikely but possible event that an autoimmune or inflammatory mechanism was the cause of their illness.

### What's in a NAIM? [^113zZC7H]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Hashimoto encephalopathy was first described by Lord Brain in 1966. 1 Multiple case reports followed and the term Hashimoto encephalopathy became generally accepted for the syndrome of encephalopathy in association with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Although Brain's original patient with Hashimoto encephalopathy did not improve with corticosteroid treatment, most of the patients described later showed marked improvement with some form of immunosuppression. This has led to the renaming of Hashimoto encephalopathy by some authors as "steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis" 2 or "nonvasculitic autoimmune meningoencephalitis", a heterogeneous group that would include autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus–associated meningoencephalitis as well as Hashimoto encephalopathy. These disorders are unified by the feature of steroid responsiveness.
