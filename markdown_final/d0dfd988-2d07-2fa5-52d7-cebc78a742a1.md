## Question

What is the relationship between low serotonin levels and depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether low serotonin levels cause depression and how to interpret the evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core claim of the "serotonin hypothesis" and what would constitute strong evidence for causality. Then, I should verify the highest-quality synthesis of evidence, especially the 2022 umbrella review. Next, I will examine key lines of evidence — direct neurochemical measures, genetic studies, tryptophan depletion, and antidepressant mechanisms — and check for confounding by medication or illness state. After that, I need to consider alternative models like stress–serotonin interactions, inflammation, and network-level dysfunctions. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical implications for treatment and communication with patients.

> Let me first confirm the core claim. The traditional serotonin hypothesis posits that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations, implying a direct causal relationship rather than mere association; this is the premise that has guided decades of research and treatment development, so I need to ensure I'm testing that specific causal claim rather than broader serotonergic involvement in mood regulation [^2e64db88] [^2a2347e3].

> Next, I should review the highest-level evidence. The 2022 umbrella review systematically synthesized systematic reviews and meta-analyses across six principal domains: serotonin and 5-HIAA in body fluids, 5-HT1A receptors, SERT binding, tryptophan depletion, SERT gene associations, and gene–environment interactions; importantly, it applied modified GRADE to rate certainty and concluded there is no convincing evidence that depression is associated with or caused by lower serotonin concentrations or activity, which directly challenges the causal claim I need to evaluate [^2e64db88] [^1b99b837] [^37c5307a].

> Wait, let me verify the direct neurochemical data. Meta-analyses of plasma serotonin and cerebrospinal fluid 5-HIAA show no consistent association with depression, and in some analyses, lower serotonin levels were linked to antidepressant use rather than depression per se, which could reflect treatment effects rather than disease biology; this undermines the idea of a universal serotonin deficit in depression [^1b99b837] [^37c5307a].

> I will now examine receptor and transporter imaging. Meta-analyses of 5-HT1A receptors and SERT binding show weak and inconsistent findings, with some studies suggesting reduced SERT binding in certain regions, but most included participants with current or prior antidepressant exposure, which can downregulate SERT and confound interpretation; moreover, if anything, reduced SERT would imply more synaptic serotonin, not less, so this pattern does not support a simple deficiency model [^c228549a] [^96061d8b] [^8f1bbf49].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from depletion studies. Acute tryptophan depletion reliably lowers brain serotonin synthesis, but in healthy volunteers it generally does not cause depression; however, in people with a history of depression or those in remission on SSRIs, depletion can precipitate mood lowering or relapse, indicating vulnerability in a subset rather than causation in everyone; I should double-check that this nuance is reflected in the synthesis, and yes, the umbrella review and subsequent critiques align with this interpretation [^2e64db88] [^247ffca1] [^bcc7fe0c].

> Next, I should review genetic evidence. Large, high-quality studies, including a genome-wide analysis of 115,257 individuals and a collaborative meta-analysis of 43,165, found no association between SERT gene variants and depression, nor evidence for a gene–stress interaction; this is a critical test of causality, and the negative findings weigh heavily against a genetically mediated serotonin deficiency as a general cause of depression [^1b99b837] [^ed29bf1b].

> But wait, what if antidepressants still imply a serotonergic mechanism? SSRIs increase synaptic serotonin and can be effective, yet their clinical effects lag weeks behind acute serotonin changes, and placebo-controlled trials show mixed effect sizes with publication bias; furthermore, antidepressants act on multiple systems and may work via downstream effects on neuroplasticity and affective processing rather than simply correcting a preexisting serotonin deficit, so medication efficacy does not establish causality by itself [^6fe66aeb] [^fedb8946] [^c2498a19].

> I need to ensure I consider alternative frameworks. Evidence supports a multifactorial model in which serotonergic changes can be downstream of stress, inflammation, or network-level dysfunctions; inflammation can shunt tryptophan toward kynurenine pathways, reducing serotonin synthesis, and stress–serotonin interactions may modulate vulnerability rather than act as a sole cause; this helps reconcile why serotonergic abnormalities are sometimes observed without supporting a universal causal deficit [^d089ee36] [^e00dea2e] [^5e5dc86f].

> Let me synthesize carefully. The best available evidence indicates there is no consistent evidence that depression is caused by low serotonin levels; instead, serotonin may play a modulatory role, and in vulnerable individuals or illness states, serotonergic perturbations can precipitate symptoms, but this is not equivalent to a causal, universal deficiency; thus, the serotonin hypothesis as a monocausal explanation is not supported, while serotonergic systems remain relevant to treatment response in some patients [^2e64db88] [^1b99b837] [^5e5dc86f].

> I should confirm the clinical implications. For patients, this means we should avoid oversimplified "chemical imbalance" messaging and emphasize that depression is multifactorial, with biological, psychological, and social contributors; for treatment, SSRIs and other serotonergic agents can still be effective for some, but we should set expectations, consider alternatives like psychotherapy, and recognize that non-serotonergic mechanisms, including glutamatergic and anti-inflammatory approaches, may be important for non-responders [^fedb8946] [^19addd68] [^6fe66aeb].

> In conclusion, I need to be precise: current high-quality evidence does not support the claim that low serotonin causes depression; rather, serotonin is part of a complex neurobiological system in which dysregulation can contribute to symptoms in some contexts, and this nuance should guide both scientific understanding and clinical care [^2e64db88] [^1b99b837] [^5e5dc86f].

The weight of evidence shows **no consistent link** between low serotonin and depression [^2e64db88]. Large umbrella reviews and meta-analyses find **no evidence** that depression is caused by low serotonin levels or activity [^1b99b837] [^37c5307a]. While some studies report serotonergic differences, these are often small, inconsistent, and confounded by medication or illness state [^c228549a] [^96061d8b]. Tryptophan depletion does not reliably induce depression in healthy people, and genetic studies do not support a serotonergic cause [^bcc7fe0c] [^1b99b837]. Serotonin may modulate mood, but depression is best viewed as a multifactorial disorder involving multiple systems, not a simple serotonin deficiency [^5e5dc86f] [^e96e943e].

---

## Historical serotonin hypothesis

The serotonin hypothesis emerged in the 1960s, positing that depression results from **deficient serotonin** [^2a2347e3]. This aligned with the observation that SSRIs, which increase synaptic serotonin, improve mood in some patients [^e77a291b]. However, this is a mechanistic rationale and **does not prove causation** [^cc80ee39].

---

## Evidence from neurochemical studies

### Serotonin and metabolite levels

Meta-analyses of serotonin and 5-HIAA in blood, CSF, and urine show **no consistent association** with depression [^1b99b837]. Some studies suggest lower plasma tryptophan in unmedicated depression, but findings are inconsistent and often confounded by diet, stress, or illness severity [^8be93be0] [^ea49b6d2].

---

### Serotonin receptors and transporter

Imaging and postmortem studies of serotonin receptors and the serotonin transporter (SERT) yield **mixed results** [^8f1bbf49]. Some report reduced SERT binding in depression, but others find no difference or even increased binding, and medication effects often confound interpretation [^c228549a] [^96061d8b].

---

## Evidence from genetic studies

Large-scale genetic studies, including GWAS and candidate-gene work, **do not support** a causal role for serotonin-related genes in depression [^1b99b837]. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism shows inconsistent associations with depression and antidepressant response, and modern polygenic models indicate minimal contribution from serotonin genes to depression risk [^ed29bf1b] [^1b99b837].

---

## Evidence from tryptophan depletion studies

Acute tryptophan depletion lowers brain serotonin and transiently worsens mood in some vulnerable groups (e.g. those with a family history or remitted depression), but **does not reliably induce depression** in healthy individuals [^247ffca1] [^bcc7fe0c]. This argues against a simple causal role for low serotonin in depression [^247ffca1].

---

## Evidence from antidepressant studies

SSRIs increase synaptic serotonin, but their clinical effects lag by weeks, suggesting indirect mechanisms such as neuroplasticity or altered network function rather than direct correction of a deficiency [^6fe66aeb]. Moreover, SSRIs are not effective for all patients, and their efficacy is influenced by placebo effects and individual differences, further undermining a purely serotonergic model [^fedb8946] [^6fe66aeb].

---

## Alternative and complementary theories

Contemporary models emphasize depression's **multifactorial etiology**, including:

- **Stress and HPA axis dysregulation**: Chronic stress alters serotonin and other systems [^e00dea2e].
- **Inflammation**: Cytokines can reduce serotonin synthesis and alter neurotransmission [^d089ee36].
- **Glutamate and GABA**: Imbalances in excitatory/inhibitory systems contribute to mood symptoms [^19addd68] [^b7680868].
- **Neuroplasticity and network dysfunction**: Depression involves altered connectivity and plasticity, not just neurotransmitter levels [^e96e943e] [^19addd68].

---

## Clinical implications

Given the lack of evidence for a causal serotonin deficit, clinicians should:

- **Avoid oversimplified explanations**: Refrain from telling patients depression is due to a "chemical imbalance" [^54f7c225].
- **Emphasize multifactorial causes**: Discuss psychosocial, genetic, and biological contributors [^5e5dc86f].
- **Individualize treatment**: Use SSRIs when appropriate, but also consider psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, and non-serotonergic options [^fedb8946] [^19addd68].

---

## Conclusion

The prevailing view that depression is caused by low serotonin is **not supported** by current evidence [^2e64db88]. Serotonin may modulate mood, but depression reflects a complex interplay of multiple neurobiological and psychosocial factors; thus, serotonin deficiency is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain depression [^5e5dc86f].

Discussion

Our comprehensive review of the major strands of research on serotonin shows there is no convincing evidence that depression is associated with, or caused by, lower serotonin concentrations or activity. Most studies found no evidence of reduced serotonin activity in people with depression compared to people without, and methods to reduce serotonin availability using tryptophan depletion do not consistently lower mood in volunteers. High quality, well-powered genetic studies effectively exclude an association between genotypes related to the serotonin system and depression, including a proposed interaction with stress. Weak evidence from some studies of serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors and levels of SERT points towards a possible association between increased serotonin activity and depression. However, these results are likely to be influenced by prior use of antidepressants and its effects on the serotonin system. The effects of tryptophan depletion in some cross-over studies involving people with depression may also be mediated by antidepressants, although these are not consistently found.

### The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^1b99b837]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest n = 1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression, and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use (n = 1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT 1A receptor (largest n = 561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest n = 1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However, effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (n = 566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (n = 75). Another systematic review (n = 342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (n = 407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (n = 115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (n = 43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.

### Depressive disorders… [^fedb8946]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

A third systematic review showed that tricyclic antidepressants were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than SSRIs, but the difference was small. One systematic review and two case–control studies showed no significant difference in risk of suicide between SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. One RCT and observational data suggested that abrupt withdrawal of SSRIs was associated with adverse symptoms and that these symptoms were more likely to occur with drugs with a short half-life. There is evidence of publication bias in trials of SSRIs. Combining Prescription Antidepressant Drugs and Psychological Treatments Two systematic reviews showed that a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy improved depressive symptoms compared with either treatment alone.

One subsequent poor-quality RCT showed no significant difference in response rate between a combination of interpersonal therapy and sertraline and either therapy alone. A subsequent RCT showed no significant difference between short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy plus antidepressants and antidepressants alone, although subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy was more effective in persons with depression and a personality disorder. Etiology The causes of depression are unclear but are thought to include childhood events and current psychosocial adversity. Recent studies suggest that genetic factors also may be important, indicating that several chromosomal regions may be involved. Phenotypes, however, do not seem to exhibit classic mendelian inheritance. Psychiatric research also has focused on the role of psychosocial factors in depression. Many theories emphasize the importance of temperament, which can increase vulnerability to mood disturbances. Impairment in social relationships, gender, socioeconomic status, and dysfunctional cognition also may play a role. It seems that integrative models, which take into account the interaction of biologic and social variables, offer the most reliable approach to the complex etiology of depression. 9 One systematic review showed that the prognosis may be especially poor in older persons with chronic or relapsing depression. 10 Another systematic review showed that depression in older persons was associated with increased mortality. 11.

### A leaky umbrella has little value: evidence clearly indicates the serotonin system is implicated in depression [^9be79d92]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To summarise, the methodology is inconsistent with an umbrella review, with substantial bias created by the authors' chosen quality criteria, selective reporting, and interpretation of results. There is an underappreciation of the complexities of neuroscience and neuropsychopharmacology, and it is therefore impossible for the reader to draw valid or reliable conclusions.

A more accurate, constructive conclusion would be that acute tryptophan depletion and decreased plasma tryptophan in depression indicate a role for 5-HT in those vulnerable to or suffering from depression, and that molecular imaging suggests the system is perturbed. The proven efficacy of SSRIs in a proportion of people with depression lends credibility to this position.

### Review: serotonin by stress interaction: a susceptibility factor for the development of depression? [^e00dea2e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

A genetic predisposition to depression may be a potential risk factor in the development of depression. Although the neurobiological equivalent of the predisposition remains unclear, it seems as though the brain serotonin (5-HT) system plays an important mediating role. Therefore, individuals with a family history of depression (FH+) may be more likely to develop depression due to an innate vulnerability related to altered serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain. A major problem, however, is that the role of brain 5-HT in depression is complex and this serotonin-related innate vulnerability, by itself, is not sufficient enough to cause a depressive episode. In the search for additional factors, stress has received particular attention. Stressful life events influence and precede the onset of depression. Furthermore, depression is associated with stress hormone dysregulation and bidirectional interactions are thought to occur between stress-related changes in the neuroendocrine stress system and the 5-HT system. In the current review, we argue that healthy individuals with a positive family history of depression are more prone to develop depression due to a genetic 5-HT susceptibility, which deteriorates stress coping mechanisms and increases stress vulnerability.

Tryptophan depletion

The critical role that tryptophan availability plays in brain serotonin synthesis has led to some ingenious techniques designed to lower brain serotonin levels acutely through dietary manipulation. The most widely used technique is 'tryptophan depletion' where administration of an amino acid load which lacks tryptophan lowers plasma tryptophan levels by about 80% over a few hours. In both animals and humans, this produces a significant decrease in brain serotonin synthesis, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. Nonetheless, tryptophan depletion offers a straightforward way to test the serotonin hypothesis of depression.

It is well established that tryptophan depletion in healthy participants, who lack obvious risk factors for depression, does not cause significant lowering of mood. Therefore, the notion that decreasing brain serotonin levels is sufficient to cause depression can be rejected. However, in people recovered from depression and free of pharmacological and psychological treatment for long periods of time, tryptophan depletion produces a clinically significant lowering of mood. Such an effect is apparent in the review byand was reported in a highly cited meta-analysis, cited in the aforementioned 'umbrella' review. The effect size for mood symptoms in remitted antidepressant free depression patients was 1.9, from 8 samples, with removal of a potential outlier giving Hedge's g = −1.06.

From this, it seems reasonable to conclude that diminished serotonin levels in the brain are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause clinical depression. However, in those at risk of depression through suffering previous episodes, reductions in brain serotonin levels can lead to clinical relapse. Presumably here, decreased activity of serotonin pathways interacts with important pre-existing neurobiological vulnerabilities, probably in the regulation of key neural networks. The widespread neuromodulatory role of serotonin is likely to be relevant to this (see below).

### The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^2a2347e3]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The idea that depression is the result of abnormalities in brain chemicals, particularly serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), has been influential for decades, and provides an important justification for the use of antidepressants. A link between lowered serotonin and depression was first suggested in the 1960s, and widely publicised from the 1990s with the advent of the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Although it has been questioned more recently, the serotonin theory of depression remains influential, with principal English language textbooks still giving it qualified support, leading researchers endorsing it, and much empirical research based on it. Surveys suggest that 80% or more of the general public now believe it is established that depression is caused by a 'chemical imbalance'. Many general practitioners also subscribe to this view and popular websites commonly cite the theory.

It is often assumed that the effects of antidepressants demonstrate that depression must be at least partially caused by a brain-based chemical abnormality, and that the apparent efficacy of SSRIs shows that serotonin is implicated. Other explanations for the effects of antidepressants have been put forward, however, including the idea that they work via an amplified placebo effect or through their ability to restrict or blunt emotions in general.

Despite the fact that the serotonin theory of depression has been so influential, no comprehensive review has yet synthesised the relevant evidence. We conducted an 'umbrella' review of the principal areas of relevant research, following the model of a similar review examining prospective biomarkers of major depressive disorder. We sought to establish whether the current evidence supports a role for serotonin in the aetiology of depression, and specifically whether depression is associated with indications of lowered serotonin concentrations or activity.

Overall results

Table 3 presents the modified GRADE ratings for each study and the overall rating of the strength of evidence in each area. Areas of research that provided moderate or high certainty of evidence such as the studies of plasma serotonin and metabolites and the genetic and gene-stress interaction studies all showed no association between markers of serotonin activity and depression. Some other areas suggested findings consistent with increased serotonin activity, but evidence was of very low certainty, mainly due to small sample sizes and possible residual confounding by current or past antidepressant use. One area - the tryptophan depletion studies - showed very low certainty evidence of lowered serotonin activity or availability in a subgroup of volunteers with a family history of depression. This evidence was considered very low certainty as it derived from a subgroup of within-subject studies, numbers were small, and there was no information on medication use, which may have influenced results. Subsequent research has not confirmed an effect with numerous negative studies in volunteers.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

The present umbrella review was reported in accordance with the 2009 PRISMA statement. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO in December 2020 (registration number CRD42020207203). This was subsequently updated to reflect our decision to modify the quality rating system for some studies to more appropriately appraise their quality, and to include a modified GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the findings in each category of the umbrella review.

In order to cover the different areas and to manage the large volume of research that has been conducted on the serotonin system, we conducted an 'umbrella' review. Umbrella reviews survey existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses relevant to a research question and represent one of the highest levels of evidence synthesis available. Although they are traditionally restricted to systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we aimed to identify the best evidence available. Therefore, we also included some large studies that combined data from individual studies but did not employ conventional systematic review methods, and one large genetic study. The latter used nationwide databases to capture more individuals than entire meta-analyses, so is likely to provide even more reliable evidence than syntheses of individual studies.

We first conducted a scoping review to identify areas of research consistently held to provide support for the serotonin hypothesis of depression. Six areas were identified, addressing the following questions: (1) Serotonin and the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA–whether there are lower levels of serotonin and 5-HIAA in body fluids in depression; (2) Receptors - whether serotonin receptor levels are altered in people with depression; (3) The serotonin transporter (SERT) - whether there are higher levels of the serotonin transporter in people with depression (which would lower synaptic levels of serotonin); (4) Depletion studies - whether tryptophan depletion (which lowers available serotonin) can induce depression; (5) SERT gene – whether there are higher levels of the serotonin transporter gene in people with depression; (6) Whether there is an interaction between the SERT gene and stress in depression.

### Association between serotonin transporter genotype, brain structure and adolescent-onset major depressive disorder: a longitudinal prospective study [^da4eb683]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depressive disorders are common and debilitating, have a multifaceted etiology and often emerge during adolescence. Recent efforts to understand the underlying biological basis of susceptibility to depression have focused on genetic risk factors. However, comprehensive genome-wide association studies have had little success in identifying risk loci, with no replicated findings to date. Increasingly, researchers are returning to more theoretically guided approaches based on biological systems implicated in depression. Such an approach can extend from candidate gene to whole-pathway analyses. It is widely accepted that abnormal serotonergic function is implicated in the onset and course of depressive disorders. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4, synonyms: 5-HTT, SERT) controls transporter enzyme production and is a key regulator of serotonergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, the effects of genetic variation at this loci have been shown to interact with environmental stressors, such as child maltreatment, however, this has not been consistently demonstrated, suggesting a need for further refinement of research methodologies.

### Fifty years on: serotonin and depression [^e95b9261]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, last July, to the surprise of many, the role of serotonin in depression was trending on multiple media outlets, as well as PubMed. The reason for this was a paper by Joanna Moncrieff and colleagues, entitled 'The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence'. That such an unpromisingly titled academic paper could create widespread public interest vindicates the view of Moncrieff et al. that the serotonin hypothesis retains a considerable reach on how people understand the causation of depression (though the 2011 Australian survey cited by Moncrieff et al. showed more people attributed depression to life events and psychosocial stressors than a 'chemical imbalance';).

However, perhaps the main target of the paper (and the reason for it capturing the public space) was the putative relationship between the serotonin hypothesis of depression and prescribing of SSRIs. The press release from University College, London commented: 'SSRIs. were originally said to work by correcting abnormally low serotonin levels. There is no other pharmacological mechanism by which antidepressants affect the symptoms of depression'. Alec Coppen's warning had apparently gone unheeded.

The abstract of the paper bystated there was 'no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations'. In fact, this conclusion is arguable and is not consistent with the data reviewed by Moncrieff et al. The aim of the current narrative review is to briefly summarise the more reliable abnormalities in serotonin mechanisms found in (ideally) unmedicated depressed patients and relate these to the integrated models of depression found in current neurobiological formulations of aetiology.

### Serotonin transporter availability increases in patients recovering from a depressive episode [^123462be]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, but the biological underpinnings of the disorder are still largely unknown. The monoamine hypothesis has been the dominant pathophysiological model for half a century. Aberrations in the monoamine serotonin (5-HT) system is one of the most replicated observations in experimental MDD research – and most efficacious pharmacological treatments target the serotonin system. However, it is not known if serotonin plays a direct causal role in the pathophysiology of depression, as suggested by the classical interpretation of the monoamine hypothesis; or if change in 5-HT activity is part of a salutogenic response to stress, enhancing adaptive responses to adverse conditions. Nor is it known if aberrations in the serotonin system are trait-like, or if they are temporary, only present during the time of the illness. To answer these basic questions is of key importance for the development of better MDD treatment options.

The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) has received a lot of attention in MDD research, in part since it is the primary mechanism to decrease extracellular 5-HT, but also because it is the target of the most commonly used antidepressant drugs. Positron emission tomography (PET) have been used to study 5-HTT in depression. Results from individual studies differ, showing lower binding in cortical and subcortical regions –, but also higher binding. A meta-analysis has shown reduced 5-HTT binding in the midbrain and amygdala, indicating a general trend towards lower cerebral 5-HTT availability in patients suffering from MDD.

The dorsal and median raphe nuclei, located in the brainstem, are the main sites for cell bodies of serotonergic neuronsand has the highest concentration of 5-HTT in the brain. While both nuclei project axons to a wide array of partially overlapping cerebral targets the pattern of projections differ. The median raphe has been suggested to be of particular interest with regards to MDD. The raphe nuclei are small structures that are not observable on a magnetic resonance image (MRI). This makes it challenging to examine with PET, especially using imaging systems with low spatial resolution. Results from meta-analyses of molecular imaging data suggest low 5-HTT availability also in raphe in MDD, but the interpretation is hampered by methodological drawbacks in the many different methods used for spatial definition.

### A leaky umbrella has little value: evidence clearly indicates the serotonin system is implicated in depression [^4a63b4a4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Moncrieff et al. aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the context of the monoamine hypothesis of depression, into an umbrella review. They concluded, "there is no convincing evidence that depression is associated with, or caused by, lower serotonin concentrations or activity". The review included investigations of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in "body fluids", 5HT 1A receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) availability in imaging and post-mortem studies, investigations of SERT gene polymorphisms, interactions between SERT and stress in depression, and effects of tryptophan depletion on mood. Given the complexity of the serotonergic system and importance of the subject, great care and transparency are essential when reviewing, synthesising and interpreting such data. Clear guidance is available for conducting umbrella reviews, cited in the current review.

Putting aside concerns about the antiquated concept of single-gene polymorphisms and the current view of polygenetic architecture of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and discussion of antidepressant efficacy in a review that did not present any such data, we highlight substantial methodological weaknesses that make interpretation of the current review challenging.

### A leaky umbrella has little value: evidence clearly indicates the serotonin system is implicated in depression [^538a9b03]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent "umbrella" review examined various biomarkers relating to the serotonin system, and concluded there was no consistent evidence implicating serotonin in the pathophysiology of depression. We present reasons for why this conclusion is overstated, including methodological weaknesses in the review process, selective reporting of data, over-simplification, and errors in the interpretation of neuropsychopharmacological findings. We use the examples of tryptophan depletion and serotonergic molecular imaging, the two research areas most relevant to the investigation of serotonin, to illustrate this.

The serotonin transporter (SERT)

The serotonin transporter protein (SERT) transports serotonin out of the synapse, thereby lowering the availability of serotonin in the synapse. Animals with an inactivated gene for SERT have higher levels of extra-cellular serotonin in the brain than normal and SSRIs are thought to work by inhibiting the action of SERT, and thus increasing levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Although changes in SERT may be a marker for other abnormalities, if depression is caused by low serotonin availability or activity, and if SERT is the origin of that deficit, then the amount or activity of SERT would be expected to be higher in people with depression compared to those without. SERT binding potential is an index of the concentration of the serotonin transporter protein and SERT concentrations can also be measured post-mortem.

Three overlapping meta-analyses based on a total of 40 individual studies fulfilled inclusion criteria (See Table 1). Overall, the data indicated possible reductions in SERT binding in some brain areas, although areas in which effects were detected were not consistent across the reviews. In addition, effects of antidepressants and other medication cannot be ruled out, since most included studies mainly or exclusively involved people who had a history of taking antidepressants or other psychiatric medications. Only one meta-analysis tested effects of antidepressants, and although results were not influenced by the percentage of drug-naïve patients in each study, numbers were small so it is unlikely that medication-related effects would have been reliably detected. All three reviews cited evidence from animal studies that antidepressant treatment reduces SERT. None of the analyses corrected for multiple testing, and one review was of very low quality. If the results do represent a positive finding that is independent of medication, they would suggest that depression is associated with higher concentrations or activity of serotonin.

### Serotonin and brain function: a tale of two receptors [^e77a291b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence for an association between serotonin and mood

Serotonin was first isolated and named in the late 1940s and subsequently found in the brain in the early 1950s. At the same time, scientists were beginning to identify interactions between serotonin and the recently discovered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Struck by LSD's remarkable potency (psychoactive in doses as low as 20 µg) and powerful modulatory effects on mood and cognition, it was speculated that abnormal serotoninergic functioning may underlie certain mental disorders. Although the 'psychotomimetic' (mimicking psychosis) properties of LSD and related psychedelics were recognised in the 1950s and 60s, as they are today, these compounds were also used extensively as psychotherapeutic aids for the treatment of a range of disorders, including depression and anxiety.

The earliest and most direct evidence for the involvement of monoamines in mood regulation however, came with the observation that reserpine, which depletes 5-HT and noradrenaline in the brain, also induces depressed mood in some individuals – see also. This observation was closely followed by the discovery of the antidepressant properties of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and subsequently the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) – both of which increase synaptic monoamines. More specific evidence for the involvement of 5-HT in depression came from studies showing a combined antidepressant effect with an MAOI plus tryptophan, the biochemical precursor to 5-HT.

The idea that serotonergic mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression was controversial in the 1960s; however, it gradually gained traction in the 1980s and into the 1990s with the development and licensing of the SSRIs and particularly fluoxetine. When chronically administered, SSRIs increase concentrations of synaptic 5-HT by blocking its reuptake, show superior efficacy to placebo in depression and are safer than MAOIs and TCAs. Another important finding supporting the involvement of serotonin in depression was the observation that acute tryptophan depletion can induce a (transient) relapse in symptoms in formerly depressed patients and plasma tryptophan levels have been found to be low in patients with severe depression, potentially owing to inflammation-related mechanisms.

### No association between peripheral serotonin-gene-related DNA methylation and brain serotonin neurotransmission in the healthy and depressed state [^a280c6df]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Most psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), arise from a complex etiology, with contributions from genetic and environmental factors. The serotonin system mediates a variety of different functions from the very early stages of development and throughout life, including cognition, mood and sleep as well as adaptation to environmental challenges. For instance, serotonin-mediated neuroplasticity has been suggested to allow us to adapt to the ever-changing environment. In this case, alterations in serotonin function might translate into resilience or vulnerability to MDD.

DNA methylation of genes coding for key regulators of the serotonin system, such as the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2), has been proposed as a possible gene-by-environment mechanism involved in several psychiatric disorders, including MDD. However, DNA methylation is often measured in peripheral samples (e.g. blood or saliva) and little is known of the effect of this modification on in-vivo brain serotonin transmission. In this study, we investigated the association between methylation of peripheral SLC6A4 and TPH2 and brain proxies of serotonin transmission measured with in-vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) critically shape serotonin signalling by regulating serotonin levels. Specifically, 5-HTT regulates synaptic levels of serotonin available for neurotransmission and is the main target of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), the most widely used class of antidepressant medications. TPH2 is the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis in the brain, thereby directly affecting presynaptic serotonin levels.

A role of SLC6A4 in gene-by-environment interaction was initially described by Caspi and colleagues, reporting that 5-HTTLPR s-carriers, who had lower SLC6A4 expression, were more vulnerable to stress in terms of developing depressive episodes when experiencing stressful life events. Nonetheless, these findings have not been replicated by all larger studies, suggesting that 5-HTTLPR per se may not be as relevant to MDD or anxiety-related traits as previously thought. Instead, a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors may affect SLC6A4 gene expression levels in a way that may be relevant to the development of psychopathology.

### Plasma serotonin levels are associated with antidepressant response to SSRIs [^a129e5fc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Less than half of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) respond to their first antidepressant trial. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remains poor, and there is no reliable method of predicting treatment response.

Methods

Thirty-seven MDD subjects and 41 healthy controls, somatically healthy and medication-free for at least six weeks, were recruited, and plasma serotonin (5-HT) levels were assessed at baseline. Twenty-six of the MDD subjects were then treated in an open-label manner with clinically appropriate doses of sertraline for 8 weeks, after which plasma 5-HT levels were again assessed. Response to treatment was defined as an improvement of 50% or more on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

Results

Non-responders to sertraline treatment had significantly lower pre-treatment 5-HT levels compared to both healthy controls and responders (F = 4.4, p = 0.004 and p = 0.036, respectively). There was a significant decrease in 5-HT levels over treatment in all MDD subjects (t = 6.2, p = 0.000003). The decrease was significantly more prominent in responders compared to non-responders (t = 2.1, p = 0.047). There was no significant difference in post-treatment 5-HT levels between responders and non-responders.

Limitations

The study had a modest sample size. 5-HT levels in plasma may not reflect 5-HT levels in the brain.

Conclusions

The results indicate that SSRI response may be facilitated by adequate baseline plasma 5-HT content and that successful SSRI treatment is associated with greater decreases in circulating 5-HT. Plasma 5-HT content may be a predictor of SSRI treatment outcome. Potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.

### Association of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region genotype with lower bone mineral density [^4b44b786]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depressive disorders were the second leading cause of years lived with disability in 2010, accounting for considerable worldwide disability. In the United States, in 2009 through 2012, antidepressants were the third most prescribed class of medications (9% of prescriptions), after antihyperlipidemia and analgesic medications. However, little is known about the long-term adverse effects of antidepressants despite their prevalent use. Osteoporosis is an important public health problem. In the United States, in 2000 through 2011, osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women accounted for > 40% of hospitalizations for the composite of osteoporotic fracture, myocardial infarction, stroke and breast cancer. Depression by itself has been associated with low bone mass, independent of antidepressant use. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants have been implicated in the development of bone loss, possibly by decreasing osteoblast function through reduced Wnt signaling secondary to increased serotonin levels.

### Effects of tryptophan depletion on anxiety, a systematic review [^a046e304]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are severe and disabling disorders and many patients have a poor course trajectory –. Although sociodemographic and clinical factors have been associated with developing anxiety disorders (e.g. gender, disability), their predictive validity is low. Studies of biological factors (e.g. hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis functioning, inflammation markers) show inconclusive results –. Currently, vulnerability to develop an anxiety disorder cannot be revealed.

In depressive disorders, the serotonergic (or 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) system provides an indication for vulnerability. This neurotransmitter system is involved in the regulation of emotions and seems dysregulated in depressive disorders. The serotonin system in depression has been investigated repeatedly by lowering serotonin levels with ATD. In ATD, the availability of the essential amino acid tryptophan, the dietary precursor of serotonin, is decreased by means of a specifically designed amino acid drink. ATD is assumed to result in a decrease of the availability of serotonin in the central nervous system(see Methods for more details).

Responding to ATD with a lower mood seems to reveal vulnerability for developing a depressive episode. A meta-analysis showed that in healthy volunteers without a family history of depression no changes in mood occurred. However, in persons at risk for depression, including healthy volunteers with a positive family history and remitted depressed patients, a decrease in mood did occur, with the effects being more prominent for remitted patients. Moreover, a deterioration of mood after ATD in remitted depressed patients predicted a higher chance to develop a new depressive episode. In current depressed patients no mood response was observed, probably because the disorder is already present, and thus there is no risk for developing a depression.

The serotonergic system also plays a role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. A positron emission tomography study showed that compared to controls, patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) had an overactive presynaptic serotonin system. Increased serotonin synthesis and serotonin transporter availability was observed in several brain regions. Serotonin is also the mode of action of antidepressants, which are effective in treating anxiety disorders. Details of the underlying mechanisms of the role of the serotonin system in anxiety disorders are still unknown. Given that ATD seems to reveal vulnerability in depressive disorders and the involvement of the serotonergic system in both disorders, ATD could potentially reveal vulnerability for developing anxiety disorders.

### Fifty years on: serotonin and depression [^5a05df7a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Status of serotonin activity in depression

The evidence summarised here shows that there are some reliable abnormalities in serotonin activity in unmedicated depressed patients. Currently, a simple synthesis of these abnormalities is elusive, but overall the evidence suggests a decrease in the activity of presynaptic serotonin neurons. This would be consistent with diminished tryptophan availability to the brain, impaired serotonin-mediated endocrine responses to presynaptic challenge, and lowered serotonin transporter binding on raphe cell bodies in the brainstem. Decreased serotonin release in the brain in response to amphetamine challenge, if replicated, would further support this view.

While these changes in the serotonin activity in depressed patients are of interest, they do not necessarily represent causal mechanisms. However, the work with tryptophan depletion suggests that in some circumstances, particularly in patients who have experienced recurrent depression, low serotonin activity could be involved in predisposing to clinical relapse. This might be relevant to the role of maintenance antidepressant treatment in people at high risk of recurrent illness.

Systems-level role of serotonin in cognition

When assessing whether the serotonergic system is involved in the aetiology of depression, it is useful to first consider the role serotonin plays in how the brain processes information. In common with other neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, there are relatively few serotonergic neurons in the brain, their nuclei are concentrated in a small region of the brainstem, and they project widely throughout both the cortex and sub-cortical structures. This anatomical arrangement is well suited to the transmission of relatively simple, globally relevant messages across multiple regions of the brain. While the complexity of the serotonergic system is increased by a broad range of functionally distinct receptors and anatomically specific subnuclei projections, there has been continued interest in determining what the content of these messages might be. The paradigmatic example of this approach has examined dopaminergic neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area. The activity of approximately 50% of these dopaminergic neurons is well described by 'reward prediction error' signals, which carry the message 'that was better than you thought it was going to be'.

### Exploring the association between serotonin transporter promoter region methylation levels and depressive symptoms: a systematic review and multi-level meta-analysis [^d3d865d4]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review investigates the association between 5-HTT promoter region methylation levels and depressive symptoms in humans. Two meta-analyses assessing (1) 5-HTT promoter methylation levels between depressed and non-depressed conditions and (2) the association between 5-HTT methylation and the severity of depressive symptoms were conducted. A total of 24 studies were encompassed in the systematic review, with two studies lacking adequate data for inclusion in the meta-analyses.

The results of the first meta-analysis, comparing depression occurrence and 5-HTT promoter methylation (12 studies – 2 028 subjects – 127 effects), found no significant effect (g = 0.06, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.21). An asymmetry was detected, leading to a very small negative average effect size upon adjustment (g = −0.09, 95% CI: −0.14 to 0.11). The heterogeneity within-study was moderate (I 2 (2)), while the between-study heterogeneity was low (I 2 (3)), impairing the possibility to test for moderators at study-level. The overall heterogeneity, indexed by the prediction interval, indicates that the true effect falls between moderate negative and moderate to large positive in the universe of populations represented by the included studies. The moderator analysis assessing the effect of single CpG sites at effect size level was not significant. However, this analysis was conducted on a substantially smaller subset of the dataset due to limitations in data availability and comparability. In the second meta-analysis, focusing on the association between depression severity and 5-HTT promoter methylation (14 studies – 2 296 subjects - 116 effects), the results revealed a null average effect size (Z = 0.05, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.16). An asymmetry was also detected, leading to a small positive average effect size upon adjustment (g = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.19). Heterogeneity within individual studies was null, while between-study heterogeneity was moderate. The prediction interval indicated a range for the true effect from small negative to small/moderate positive. No significant moderators were identified. Among the comprehensive array of studies incorporated, it's notable that all reported effects carried the potential for bias.

### The self on its axis: a framework for understanding depression [^e96e943e]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurotransmitter systems

There is longstanding evidence that monoaminergic systems are implicated in depression, with most evidence for serotonin. However, studies that have shown abnormal plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of serotonin, and altered levels of serotonin receptors and transporters, have been inconsistent. Perhaps the best evidence for serotonin's involvement in depression is that depressive symptoms can be improved by medications that affect the serotonergic system, particularly by blocking its presynaptic reuptake. The effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are, however, inconsistent at an individual level, with only some patients gaining benefit.

There has been more recent focus on the roles of other neurotransmitter systems in depression, and particularly on the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. Glutamate levels in the MPFC are reduced in depression, and other abnormalities in the glutamatergic system are also evident, likely reflecting the observed changes in cortical and subcortical network connectivity. Interest in the role of glutamate in depression has been spurred by evidence that agents that act on the system, such as ketamine, have antidepressant properties. It has become more evident that our early understanding of depression as arising from dysfunction of the serotonergic system was overly simplistic; and that depression is in fact unlikely to be explained by altered function of any single neurotransmitter system.

### Postmortem evidence of decreased brain pH in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^46ba8dba]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Accumulating evidence suggests that decreased brain pH is a common feature of several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recent meta-analyses of magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS) and postmortem studies have reported statistically significant and marginal decreases in brain pH in patients with these disorders compared with healthy controls. Decreased brain pH has frequently been associated with increased lactate levels under these psychiatric conditions. Increased lactate levels are considered indicative of metabolic changes resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction and/or increased glycolysis due to neuronal hyperexcitation. It has been reported that tissue pH influences gene expression in the brain, and genes sensitive to pH are linked to various biological processes relevant to these disorders, such as energy production, the immune system, and synaptic signaling. Considering the strict regulation of pH in the brain, changes in pH could be a potential clue to understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mood disorder that partially shares clinical and neurobiological features with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, such as cognitive dysfunction, functional dysconnectivity in certain brain networks, and genetic risks. Our recent large-scale animal studies demonstrated that decreased brain pH and increased lactate levels are common hallmarks among many animal models of depressive disorders and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Animal models of depressive disorders included serotonin transporter knockout (SERT KO) mice, mice exposed to social defeat stress, and mice induced to develop diabetes mellitus or colitis, which have a high comorbidity risk for depression. An increase in brain lactate levels has been suggested in patients with MDD compared to control subjects by MRS studies. However, little is known about brain pH in MDD. The pH of tissue of individual subjects is frequently reported in the demographic data of samples in human studies using postmortem brains, as it is considered an indicator of the quality of preserved tissue. In this study, we conducted meta-analyses utilizing publicly available data to investigate postmortem brain pH in MDD.

### Depression in women: windows of vulnerability and new insights into the link between estrogen and serotonin [^69640130]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this commentary is to provide an update on the research in both preclinical and clinical models regarding the cross-talk between estrogen and various serotonin molecular markers and the possible implications this may have on female-related mood disorders.

Conclusions

Animal and human studies provide strong and consistent evidence suggesting that estrogen is able to regulate the serotonin pathway at various levels. The general trend that emerges is that estrogen administration increases serotonin availability by altering mRNA and protein levels of various serotonin markers and by decreasing serotonin breakdown. These effects may have direct implications on female mood disorders such as premenstrual disorders and depression during pregnancy, postpartum, and during the menopausal transition.

### Serotonin transporter availability increases in patients recovering from a depressive episode [^876fe5ab]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the relatively large number of cross-sectional (i.e. patient-control) PET-studies on MDD and 5-HTT there is a lack of studies examining the longitudinal course of 5-HTT availability in depression. It is thus unclear if the putative lower level of 5-HTT represent a "trait", i.e. a risk factor for MDD chronically present, or a "state", i.e. present only around the time of the depressive episode. Since most pharmacological treatment options against MDD affects the serotonergic system, it is difficult to interpret the results from pre-post molecular imaging studies using drugs to understand the natural progression of the disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), on the other hand, has been shown to be as effective as pharmacological treatment of depression. Internet delivered CBT (ICBT) has been found to be as effective as face-to-face CBT, and is available as an option in regular health care in many countries. ICBT has standardized treatment modules, ensuring that all subjects get as close to the same intervention as possible and is thus a suitable intervention in a study of the longitudinal course of 5-HTT availability in MDD.

The primary aim of this study was to address the trait-state question of MDD biology by examining if the 5-HTT availability changes as subjects improve from a depressed state. The secondary aims were to compare the 5-HTT availability in the brain of depressed individuals with healthy controls; and to apply a novel approach to delineate the raphe nuclei and examine these regions separately using a high-resolution PET system.

### Relationship of neurotransmitters to the symptoms of major depressive disorder [^4041c2dc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

A relationship appears to exist between the 3 main monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain (i.e., dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) and specific symptoms of major depressive disorder. Specific symptoms are associated with the increase or decrease of specific neurotransmitters, which suggests that specific symptoms of depression could be assigned to specific neurochemical mechanisms, and subsequently specific antidepressant drugs could target symptom-specific neurotransmitters. Research on electroconvulsive therapy has supported a correlation between neurotransmitters and depression symptoms. A 2-dimensional model of neurotransmitter functions is discussed that describes depression as a mixture of 2 separate components — negative affect and the loss of positive affect — that can be considered in relation to the 3 amine neurotransmitters. Owing to the different methods of action of available antidepressant agents and the depression symptoms thought to be associated with dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, current treatments can be targeted toward patients' specific symptoms.

### Fifty years on: serotonin and depression [^91b49a92]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

None of the proposed serotonergic messages enjoy the broad, cross-species empirical support of the dopaminergic reward prediction-error account and should therefore be considered as pointers to serotonin's overall role in cognitive function rather than definitive descriptions. However, a common factor across all of the potential serotonergic messages is that they contain information about the estimated value of events, a quantity which, when measured, is disordered in depressed patients and is a core component of cognitive accounts of the illness. This observation clearly does not provide compelling evidence that disordered serotonergic function is a significant aetiological factor in the development or maintenance of depression; however, it does suggest an intermediate cognitive mechanism by which altering serotonergic function (e.g. via tryptophan depletion, treatment with serotonergic medication or pathology) might lead to changes in depressive symptoms.

### A mechanistic account of serotonin's impact on mood [^c2498a19]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Major depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, representing one of society's most challenging, and costly, health burdens. Pharmacotherapy of depression primarily targets monoamine neurotransmitter function, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) constituting first-line antidepressant intervention. Despite their well-described clinicaland neurochemical effects, the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying SSRI treatment effectiveness remain elusive. This lack of a mechanistic understanding arguably compromises development of effective treatment stratification and clinical prediction models.

At the cognitive level, a bias towards attending and remembering negative information, as well as a decrease in perception of positive information, are considered to play a key role in both the development and maintenance of depression. Consequently, modulating affective biases, with the aim of boosting reward exposure and positive experience, is a principled target in psychological interventions, as in the paradigmatic instance of behavioural activation therapy. Intriguingly, a growing body of work suggests pharmacological intervention might influence affective processing in a similar manner, in other words via a boost in perception of positive affective information that induces a 'rosier' perspective. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how a pharmacological induction of affective biases in perceptual processing, for example as reported in emotional face perception, translates into overt mood change –. Influential theories propose affective biases may influence cognitive processes other than perception, such as reward learning and affective memory consolidation.

We previously proposed a mechanistic framework for how affect-learning interactions contribute to mood dynamics. Empirically, we have shown how unexpected outcomes alter affective state, which in turn biases a sensitivity to subsequent reward outcomes. Theoretically, this two-way relationship can set in train an escalating positive feedback loop wherein good outcomes improve mood which, in turn, improves perception of subsequent outcomes leading to further mood elevation.

Based upon clinical observation that antidepressants do not enhance mood either acutely or directly, but are instead characterised by a delayed clinical onset, we hypothesised SSRIs would influence an integral aspect of this feedback loop. Specifically, we conjectured serotonin would boost the impact of positive affect on reward processing, an effect that can give rise to gradual mood improvement. To test our hypothesis, we used a week-long SSRI treatment intervention in healthy volunteers, with repeated experimental testing, to probe two specific predictions. First, we predicted that, during learning of novel reward associations, SSRIs would boost the impact of positive affect on the subjective value of reward. Second, we predicted that, at the time of exposure to previously learned reward associations, SSRIs would boost the impact of positive affect on value reconsolidation.

### Variations in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 linked to decreased serotonergic activity are associated with elevated risk for metabolic syndrome in depression [^638195f0]. Molecular Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Major depression and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) are interacting clinical conditions influenced by genetic susceptibility. For both disorders, impaired serotonergic neurotransmission in specific brain areas has been suggested. This led us to investigate whether variants in the gene coding for tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the brain-specific and rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis, might be predictive for an increased liability for the development of MetS in depressed patients. In a case-control study consisting of 988 patients with recurrent unipolar depression (RUD) and 1023 psychiatric healthy controls, MetS components were ascertained according to the International Diabetes Foundation criteria. A total of 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms fully covering the TPH2 gene region were genotyped in stage 1 (300 patients/300 controls), resulting in significant genetic associations of polymorphisms located in exon 7 and intron 8 of TPH2 and the occurrence of MetS in depressed patients after correction for age, gender and multiple testing (51 RUD-MetS/179 RUD-non-MetS). We were able to confirm the significant association of rs17110690 in stage 2 (688 patients/723 controls; 110 RUD-MetS/549 RUD-non-MetS) and to link risk-genotypes and risk-haplotypes for MetS to lower TPH2 mRNA expression and to lower 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in cerebrospinal fluid previously reported in functional studies. Our findings suggest that TPH2 polymorphisms characterize a subgroup of depressed patients who are especially prone to develop metabolic disorders induced by a genotype-dependent impairment of serotonergic neurotransmission. Identifying depressed patients at high risk for MetS using genetic variants could have direct clinical impact on individualized disease management and prevention strategies.

### No association between peripheral serotonin-gene-related DNA methylation and brain serotonin neurotransmission in the healthy and depressed state [^2c3ed5a7]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To conclude, our findings do not support an association between SLC6A4 or TPH2 methylation and 5-HTT or 5-HT 4 brain levels or measures of early life stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms. We suggest that caution should be used when interpreting findings on peripheral DNA methylation in relation to the adult serotonergic brain architecture and to measures of early life stress or mood disorders symptoms. However, our findings do not rule out a role of peripheral DNA methylation in serotonergic neurotransmission and (mal)adaptation to environmental stress, which should be further elucidated by future studies considering more CpG sites and related genetic variants, larger sample sizes, more sensitive measures of early environmental stress, blood cell composition and longitudinal cohorts.

### The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^96061d8b]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Receptors

Fourteen different serotonin receptors have been identified, with most research on depression focusing on the 5-HT 1A receptor. Since the functions of other 5-HT receptors and their relationship to depression have not been well characterised, we restricted our analysis to data on 5-HT 1A receptors. 5-HT 1A receptors, known as auto-receptors, inhibit the release of serotonin pre-synaptically, therefore, if depression is the result of reduced serotonin activity caused by abnormalities in the 5-HT 1A receptor, people with depression would be expected to show increased activity of 5-HT 1A receptors compared to those without.

Two meta-analyses satisfied inclusion criteria, involving five of the same studies (see Table 1). The majority of results across the two analyses suggested either no difference in 5-HT 1A receptors between people with depression and controls, or a lower level of these inhibitory receptors, which would imply higher concentrations or activity of serotonin in people with depression. Both meta-analyses were based on studies that predominantly involved patients who were taking or had recently taken (within 1–3 weeks of scanning) antidepressants or other types of psychiatric medication, and both sets of authors commented on the possible influence of prior or current medication on findings. In addition, one analysis was of very low quality, including not reporting on the numbers involved in each analysis and using one-sided p-values, and one was strongly influenced by three studies and publication bias was present.

### Serotonin function and the mechanism of antidepressant action… [^7540829e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Brain serotonin content is dependent on plasma levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan. We investigated the behavioral effects of rapid tryptophan depletion in patients in antidepressant-induced remission. Twenty-one patients who were depressed by DSM-III-R criteria received a 24-hour, 160-mg/d, lowtryptophan diet followed the next morning by a 16 — amino acid drink, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion. Total and free tryptophan levels decreased 87% and 91%, respectively, during acute tryptophan depletion. Fourteen of the 21 remitted depressed patients receiving antidepressants experienced a depressive relapse after the tryptophan-free amino acid drink, with gradual return to the remitted state on return to regular food intake. Control testing produced no significant behavioral effects.

Free plasma tryptophan level was negatively correlated with depression score during acute tryptophan depletion. The therapeutic effects of some antidepressant drugs may be dependent on serotonin availability. Delgado PL, Charney DS, Price LH, Aghajanian GK, Landis H, Heninger GR.

### Association between reduced white matter integrity in the corpus callosum and serotonin transporter gene DNA methylation in medication-naive patients with major depressive disorder [^33f24990]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Not only is serotonin involved in basic morphogenetic activities during brain development, such as modulation of neural cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, axonal guidance and synaptogenesis, but is also involved in adult neurogenesis. Chronic exposure to several forms of stress have been shown to alter chromatin structure in the brain, such as increases in DNA methylation or histone acetylation, and several studies have found associations between stress and altered promoter methylation levels of the SLC6A4 in particular. Also, epigenetic changes occur not only in the developing fetus, but also in individuals throughout the human life-span. High methylation density at the gene promoter region typically silences gene expression, so increased methylation of the SLC6A4 promoter region may result in a loss of gene functioning. The serotonin transporter is essential to determining the duration and intensity of serotonin communication with pre- and post-synaptic receptors, including the serotonin 1A receptor, which is implicated in synaptic function and plasticity. Therefore, decreased expression of SLC6A4 due to increased DNA methylation may decrease serotonin uptake and produce a deficiency in serotonin activity. Accordingly, SLC6A4 promoter methylation has been associated with lower in vivo measures of serotonin synthesis in specific brain areas. Given that alterations in serotonergic modulation can have unexpected effects on neuronal growth, brain regions with increased methylation of the SLC6A4 promoter region may exhibit dysfunctional brain morphology and physiology. As stress has repeatedly been associated with MDD, known to precipitate depressive episodes and influence the severity, duration and natural course of the disorder, patients with MDD are more likely to have been exposed to stress. Therefore, our results may represent an association between alterations in serotonin activity influenced by increased SLC6A4 promoter methylation levels due to stress exposure, and changes in white matter integrity in MDD.

A depleted account of tryptophan depletion

These methodological weaknesses are manifested in the consideration of tryptophan depletion studies. The authors include a meta-analysis, systematic review and 10 recent studies involving healthy volunteers, but missed a clinical and molecular imaging study, which showed an effect in people with MDD. The authors state, "studies involving people diagnosed with depression showed slightly greater mood reduction following tryptophan depletion… but most participants were taking antidepressants and participant numbers were small". However, in the meta-analysis they cite, the effect size for the effects of tryptophan depletion on mood in depressed people not taking antidepressants, from 8 samples, was large (Hedge's g = −1.9 (95% CIs −3.02 to −0.78). Admittedly, a number of these studies came from the same group, and confidence intervals were wide (removal of a potential outlier decreased Hedge's g to −1.06 (95% CIs −1.83 to −0.29)). Notwithstanding this, omission of these data in the current review is questionable. A more accurate interpretation is that tryptophan depletion studies suggest a role for 5-HT in people vulnerable to depression and in those remitted on SSRI treatment. In contrast, by citing a series of individual negative studies in healthy participants, the authors give the impression tryptophan depletion has no effect.

The authors also omit several studies included in 2 meta-analyses of circulating tryptophan concentrations, which directly influence central serotonin synthesis. This is far more relevant to CNS serotonin function than serotonin and 5-HIAA levels in body fluids, which are covered in the review. L-tryptophan plasma concentrations show, after adjusting for publication bias, significant decrease in people with MDD (Hedge's g = −0.45, 95% CIs, −0.66 to −0.23), with a large effect size of g = −0.84 (95% CIs −1.27 to −0.4) in unmedicated people. Furthermore, using the authors' bespoke criteria for certainty, this would presumably score quite well given that it fulfils most criteria, except pre-specification of outcome measures. The authors were aware of this meta-analysis as they state they excluded it from the section on serotonin in body fluids.

### Supplementation-induced increase in circulating omega-3 serum levels is not associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms: results from the mooDFOOD depression prevention trial [^a3b934b0]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Some observational studies have shown that low n‐3 PUFA plasma levels are more often found in patients with depressive disorders than in healthy individuals, but other studies do not confirm this (Lin, Huang, & Su, 2010; Smith, Beilin, & Mori, 2011; Wani, Bhat, & Ara, 2015). Several potential biochemical mechanisms could explain the association between PUFAs and depressive disorders (Smith et al. 2011). For a long time, it was thought that the anti‐inflammatory property of n‐3 PUFAs may mitigate the overactive immune system associated with several disorders (Young & Conquer, 2005), whereas n‐6 PUFAs were generally seen as proinflammatory (Husted & Bouzinova, 2016) because n‐3 and n‐6 PUFAs compete for the same substrates. However, it has recently been discovered that the biochemistry of n‐3 and n‐6 PUFA is much more nuanced, with both n‐3 and n‐6 PUFAs having proinflammatory and anti‐inflammatory properties, and neither is "all good" or "all bad" (Nasir & Bloch, 2019). In addition to inflammatory activities that could underlie depressive and anxiety disorders, a decrease in dietary DHA is related to a decrease in cortical serotonin and dopamine (Young & Conquer, 2005), and these neurotransmitters have been implicated in the etiology of depressive disorders (Smith et al. 2011; Young & Conquer, 2005). In addition, fatty acids are implicated as regulators of gene transcription within the central nervous system (Alessandri et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2011) and may play a role in neural membrane fluidity and receptor binding (Owen, Rees, & Parker, 2008; Smith et al. 2011; Stahl, Begg, Weisinger, & Sinclair, 2008). For instance, DHA can affect neurological function by modulating neurotransmission, neurogenesis, myelination, and more (Weiser, Butt, & Mohajeri, 2016). As not all studies have found this association between low n‐3 PUFA levels and depressive disorders, a possible role of potential third factors (i.e. residual confounding factors) has been suggested, such as biological stress (Thesing, Bot, Milaneschi, Giltay, & Penninx, 2018b) or psychological vulnerabilities (Thesing et al. 2018a), although these could also be considered mediators.

### Serotonergic function in depression… [^103f038f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

There is considerable evidence that serotonergic function may be reduced in the brains of depressed patients. Serotonin is an effective stimulant of prolactin release, and intravenous tryptophan, when administered to healthy subjects, produces a reliable and robust increase in serum prolactin level. To evaluate serotonergic function in depressed patients, we gave 25 patients and 19 age- and sex-matched controls tryptophan, 7 g IV. There was a marked blunting of the maximal prolactin response to the tryptophan in both the male and female patients. The patient control differences could not be accounted for on the basis of age, sex, or time without medications. The data provide strong support for a possible serotonergic abnormality in depression. Heninger GR, Charney DS, Sternberg DE.

### Depression-an underrecognized target for prevention of dementia in Alzheimer's disease [^40402483]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Noradrenalin, serotonine, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles

Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are neuropathologic hallmarks of AD. Furthermore, modifications in the serotonergic and noradrenergic system are involved in the pathogenesis of AD and depression (Fig. 4). Noradrenalin is a neurotransmitter of major importance in the pathophysiology and treatment of depressive disorders. In addition to its role as a neurotransmitter, it has potent anti-inflammatory, neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects as well as effects on amyloid deposition. Lesions of the Locus coeruleus (LC) in mouse models of AD led to increased inflammation, neuronal damage and increase in Aβ plaque burden. LC degeneration compromised microglial migration and Aβ phagocytosis in vivo, suggesting that a loss of noradrenaline increases inflammation and Aβ deposition. The serotonergic system also influences the production of Aβ and therefore provides another link between depression and AD. Serotonin increases the release of non-amyloidogenic APP via 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors, thereby disfavoring the formation of neurotoxic Aβ. A reduction in 5-HT levels could potentially alter the cleavage of APP facilitating Aβ production. Another hypothesis linking depression to Aβ implies an increase of Aβ production by a stress response associated with depression and including glucocorticoid levels. Animal models of AD indicate that stress-level glucocorticoid administration increases Aβ formation by increasing steady-state levels of APP and β-secretase enzyme (BACE). Higher brain Aβ burden was associated with increasing anxious-depressive symptoms in cognitively normal older adults and supports the hypothesis that emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms might represent an early manifestation of preclinical AD. Recent evidence suggests that cortical amyloid moderates the association between worsening depressive symptoms and declining cognition in older adults. Changes in depression and cognition among older adults with higher cortical amyloid might suggest that depressive symptoms may serve as targets in delaying the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease.

### How antidepressants help depression: mechanisms of action and clinical response [^ad693d6e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The monoamine hypothesis of depression suggests that depressive symptoms can be moderated by enhancing monoamine neurotransmission. Targeted neurotransmitters include serotonin and norepinephrine, and a number of medications are available that can selectively enhance the actions of one or both of these substances. Although laboratory tests have validated the pharmacologic effects of these compounds, much less is known about how these effects translate into clinical response. Therapeutic research and experience show clearly that the medications help patients, although the individual and potential cooperative or complementary effects of stimulating each neurotransmitter system remain unclear. Depletion studies have reinforced the validity of targeting these systems and, at the same time, underscored that monoamines most likely are not the only factor driving the clinical presentation of depression.

### Serotonin versus catecholamine deficiency: behavioral and neural effects of experimental depletion in remitted depression [^196ce2f1]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Despite immense efforts into development of new antidepressant drugs, the increases of serotoninergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmission have remained the two major pharmacodynamic principles of current drug treatments for depression. Consequently, psychopathological or biological markers that predict response to drugs that selectively increase serotonin and/or catecholamine neurotransmission hold the potential to optimize the prescriber's selection among currently available treatment options. The aim of this study was to elucidate the differential symptomatology and neurophysiology in response to reductions in serotonergic versus catecholaminergic neurotransmission in subjects at high risk of depression recurrence. Using identical neuroimaging procedures with [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography after tryptophan depletion (TD) and catecholamine depletion (CD), subjects with remitted depression were compared with healthy controls in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Although TD induced significantly more depressed mood, sadness and hopelessness than CD, CD induced more inactivity, concentration difficulties, lassitude and somatic anxiety than TD. CD specifically increased glucose metabolism in the bilateral ventral striatum and decreased glucose metabolism in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, whereas TD specifically increased metabolism in the right prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. Although we found direct associations between changes in brain metabolism and induced depressive symptoms following CD, the relationship between neural activity and symptoms was less clear after TD. In conclusion, this study showed that serotonin and catecholamines have common and differential roles in the pathophysiology of depression.

### Phenome-wide investigation of bidirectional causal relationships between major depressive disorder and common human diseases [^084dbebf]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, mental illnesses continue to be diagnosed symptomatically, with no objective genetic or soluble biomarker validated so far. Biochemical boundaries between MDD and other mental or neurological disorders are not well-defined. The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) deficiency hypothesis of MDD put forward by Coppen in 1967 may also be relevant to other psychiatric conditions. Recently, this view has been strengthened in a large number of studies. 5-HT, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is released in both the central nervous system (5%) and the peripheral nervous system (95%). Genetic variants and changes in expression levels of 5-HT receptors and transporters as well as overactivity of presynaptic autoreceptors are implicated in a wide range of psychiatric or neurological disorders, such as depression, panic disorder, schizophrenia, and migraine. Association of depression with other psychiatric or neurological disorders at the genetic level has proceeded. Accordingly, this study demonstrated that both psychiatric and neurological disorders have a causal influence on MDD, possibly through alterations in serotoninergic signaling. Some of these interactions were bidirectional, including that with other and unspecified nonorganic psychotic disorders; with delirium, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances; with other and unspecified nerve root and plexus disorders; with migraine with aura and triptan purchases; with other neurological diseases, and with nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders.

Our observations are also in line with previous findings that other psychiatric comorbidity among mental disorders is common and that many of these disorders exhibit pairwise relationships. For example, an analysis based on 27 national communities involving 145,990 respondents showed that, after adjusting for comorbidities, the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder was 55 times higher in the first year after developing major depression when compared to patients without comorbidities (hazard ratio (HR) = 55.1, 95% CI = 51.0–59.6); even 15 years later, patients with major depression still had a nearly 7-fold higher risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder (HR = 6.6, 95% CI = 5.7–7.7). Additionally, a majority of antidepressants and antipsychotics used in clinical practice for various psychiatric conditions target the same set of pathways.

### Pathophysiology of major depressive disorder: mechanisms involved in etiology are not associated with clinical progression [^4963c267]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several biological mechanisms with a possible role in major depressive disorder (MDD)'s pathophysiology have been identified, and it has been hypothesized that these mechanisms may have a role both in the etiology and progression of the disorder. Here, we consider four central mechanisms that have substantial support in literature for their importance in depression etiology and that have previously been shown to be significantly different in MDD cases and controls in our own sample: inflammation, hypothalamic–pituitary (HPA) axis, neutrophic growthand vitamin D. We examined whether progression of MDD at a clinical level (that is, that what patient/clinicians experience as more advanced disease stage, which is multiple episodes and/or chronicity) is paralleled by more pronounced dysregulation in pathophysiological mechanisms, as evidence for that is scarce.

An upregulation of inflammation might be involved in the development of depression by decreasing the production of monoamines (for example, serotonin), and increasing the production of tryptophan catabolites that are toxic for the brain. Meta-analyses showed that depressed subjects in comparison with controls had significantly increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6, and acute phase C-reactive protein (CRP). An example of inflammation and MDD progression is the finding that tumor necrosis factor alpha was significantly higher in those who experienced > 3 episodes.

Hyperactivity of the HPA-axis as a causal factor in MDD has been studied extensively. This hyperactivity is presumably caused by malfunctioning of glucocorticoid receptors impairing the negative feedback circuit of the HPA-axis. Glucocorticoid receptor malfunction might cause depression via impaired neurogenesis and reduced hippocampus volumes. In depressed persons, cortisol levels might determine risk ofand time to recurrenceof an MDD episode. This suggest that HPA-axis dysfunctioning is associated with MDD progression.

Low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are seen as an indicator of reduced neurotropic growth, a third important possible pathophysiological mechanism of MDD. A recent meta-analysis supports the idea that depressed patients have lower BDNF levels than controls. One study found that drug-free patients with a long index episode had significantly lower BDNF levels compared with patients with a shorter index episode.

### A population-based observational study using statistical modeling to assess the association between depressive symptom severity and sleep disorders in postmenopausal women [^58f261e3]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed dose–response relationship between depressive symptom severity and sleep disorders aligns with previous research indicating that greater depressive symptoms are associated with an increased likelihood of sleep disturbances. Prior studies have reported similar positive correlations, yet many have focused on broader populations or specific clinical groups rather than postmenopausal women, who may experience distinct physiological and psychological changes that exacerbate this relationship. Unlike some earlier research suggesting a potential threshold effect, where sleep disorder risk sharply rises beyond a certain depressive symptom severity, our findings demonstrated a consistent linear trend among postmenopausal women, reinforcing the notion that even mild depressive symptoms can contribute significantly to sleep disturbances in this specific population. This indicates that interventions targeting depressive symptom management in postmenopausal women may be beneficial even at lower levels of symptom severity, potentially preventing further sleep disruption and improving overall health outcomes.

In postmenopausal women, the association between depressive symptom severity and sleep disorders may be driven by two key biological pathways: hormonal dysregulation and neurotransmitter imbalance, both of which play a crucial role in mood regulation and sleep homeostasis. Postmenopause is characterized by a substantial decline in estrogen and progesterone levels, which can adversely impact both emotional stability and sleep regulation. Estrogen plays a key role in modulating serotonin and GABA pathways, both of which are essential for maintaining mood balance and sleep architecture. The reduction in estrogen levels has been linked to increased depressive symptoms and impaired sleep quality, manifesting as shortened sleep duration and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Additionally, progesterone, known for its sedative effects, declines sharply after menopause, contributing to prolonged sleep latency and difficulty maintaining sleep. These hormonal fluctuations may exacerbate depressive symptoms, which in turn further disrupt sleep patterns, creating a bidirectional cycle between depressive symptoms and sleep disorders. Beyond hormonal changes, neurotransmitter imbalances serve as another critical mechanism underlying this relationship. Depressive symptoms are strongly associated with dysfunctions in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems, all of which play fundamental roles in both mood regulation and sleep–wake control. Serotonin deficiency, a well-established feature associated with depressive symptoms, is particularly relevant in postmenopausal women as it directly influences melatonin production, the key hormone regulating the circadian sleep–wake cycle. A decline in serotonin availability may not only intensify depressive symptoms but also lead to disruptions in sleep initiation and maintenance. Additionally, dopaminergic and noradrenergic dysregulation may contribute to hyperarousal states, further impairing sleep continuity and increasing the risk of chronic insomnia. Given that postmenopausal women already experience age-related declines in neurotransmitter function, these neurochemical alterations may compound the risk of bothdepressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in this population.

### A history of metaphorical brain talk in psychiatry [^cc80ee39]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, in an important development in the history of neuroscience, in the early 1960s, cell bodies and neuronal pathways of the putative monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin were demonstrated in mammalian brains. Within a few years, prominent psychiatric researchers proposed that abnormalities of function in these neurotransmitters were the major cause of three of the most important of psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, mania and depression. I suggest that these theories reflect, in more subtle ways than prior examples, metaphorical brain talk. Or, perhaps these monoamine hypotheses could be seen as sitting somewhere on a continuum of naively enthusiastic scientific theories and metaphorical brain talk. They were grounded in solid basic neuroscience, and had support from pharmacologic studies of mechanisms of action of antipsychotic and antidepressant medication. However, trying to clarify disease etiology through the mechanism of action of pharmacologic treatments is deeply problematic as illustrated by the now common phrase: "headache is not an aspirin-deficiency disease". Given the more than 100 neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain, the plausibility that dysfunctions in the first three to be traced in the brain caused the major psychiatric disorders strains to the breaking point any sense of credulity. Furthermore, these theories, for example, the serotonin hypothesis of depression, have not fared well over time. Large-sample, genome-wide association studies are now available on all three disorders, and none support a major role for genetic variants involved in the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin systems for, respectively, schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and depression. A recent widely-cited umbrella review concludes, "The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations" p. 3243. While there remains substantial controversy about the precise etiological relationship between serotonin and depression, I do not seek to deny that serotonin may play some role in the complex pathophysiology of this syndrome. Rather, I suggest, less controversially, I hope, that the grand monocausal theory of depression resulting primarily from serotonin dysfunction (as I have argued earlier, regarding the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia) is almost certainly false.

### The serotonin transporter gene and depression [^ed29bf1b]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric disorders such as depression are known to be under a degree of genetic influence, but the specific variants contributing to this heritability remain largely unknown. The serotonin transporter gene has received the most attention in relation to depression, either alone or in conjunction with exposure to stressful life events (i.e. a gene x environment interaction), whereas neuroimaging studies have suggested an association with amygdala activation. There is also some evidence that this gene may predict antidepressant response. However, each of these literatures has followed a similar course of initial promise giving way to an inconsistent pattern of replications and nonreplications. In parallel, whole genome approaches have begun to provide robust findings and novel insights into the mechanisms of common disease. One of these insights is that the genetic architecture of common disease phenotypes such as depression comprises a very large number of common variants of very small effect, possibly together with a smaller number of rare variants of larger effect. This is at odds with the apparently large effect of the serotonin transporter gene reported in some studies. Taken together, it is unlikely that the serotonin transporter gene plays a major role in depression. Future single locus analyses should be informed by more robust findings derived from whole genome methods.

### Molecular pathways of major depressive disorder converge on the synapse [^19addd68]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The monoamine theory

One of the first suggested biological mechanisms underlying MDD is the deficiency in monoamine levels, i.e. 5-HT, noradrenaline, and dopamine. This "monoamine theory of depression" was supported by initial findings that monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants could improve depressive symptoms by potentiating 5-HT and noradrenaline activity. While many studies later supported this theory, limitations include the fact that the clinical effects of antidepressant treatments typically take weeks to be observed, while the effects of antidepressants to increase monoamine levels are almost instantaneous. Moreover, around one third of depressed patients do not respond to antidepressants that work exclusively by inhibiting monoamine reabsorption, and restricting the availability of the 5-HT precursor tryptophan does not induce depressive episodes in all patients. Thus, monoamine deficiency may not be universal across all patients, pointing to the relevance of other pathways and neurotransmitters for MDD.

Other neurotransmitters

MDD is associated with disturbances in other neurotransmitters in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and in peripheral tissues, including the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamatergic systems. Glutamate levels are decreased in specific brain regions of patients possibly linked to a decreased response to emotional stimuli and supported by postmortem findings of reduced number of synapses. Thus, newly developed antidepressant treatments focus on reversing glutamate and GABA deficits by addressing glutamate α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors or group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. This also led to the discovery of fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine, which rapidly increases glutamate signaling and leads to rapid and sustained antidepressant response in both preclinical and clinical studies. Mechanistically, ketamine blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels and thus excitatory glutamate signaling in GABAergic neurons, increasing the overall activity of the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, ketamine enhances the mTOR complex 1 signaling and increases the number and function of synapses in the prefrontal cortex independently of NMDA receptor inhibition. Further drug developments include brexanolone, an analog of the neurosteroid THP, for the treatment of postpartum depression, as THP levels drop after pregnancy. THP also affects the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as a positive allosteric modulator for specific subunits of extrasynaptic GABA A receptors (GABAARs) expressed in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.

### Pathophysiology of depression: do we have any solid evidence of interest to clinicians? [^5e5dc86f]. World Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Due to the clinical and etiological heterogeneity of major depressive disorder, it has been difficult to elucidate its pathophysiology. Current neurobiological theories with the most valid empirical foundation and the highest clinical relevance are reviewed with respect to their strengths and weaknesses. The selected theories are based on studies investigating psychosocial stress and stress hormones, neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neurocircuitry, neurotrophic factors, and circadian rhythms. Because all theories of depression apply to only some types of depressed patients but not others, and because depressive pathophysiology may vary considerably across the course of illness, the current extant knowledge argues against a unified hypothesis of depression. As a consequence, antidepressant treatments, including psychological and biological approaches, should be tailored for individual patients and disease states. Individual depression hypotheses based on neurobiological knowledge are discussed in terms of their interest to both clinicians in daily practice and clinical researchers developing novel therapies.

### The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^54f7c225]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The chemical imbalance theory of depression is still put forward by professionals, and the serotonin theory, in particular, has formed the basis of a considerable research effort over the last few decades. The general public widely believes that depression has been convincingly demonstrated to be the result of serotonin or other chemical abnormalities, and this belief shapes how people understand their moods, leading to a pessimistic outlook on the outcome of depression and negative expectancies about the possibility of self-regulation of mood. The idea that depression is the result of a chemical imbalance also influences decisions about whether to take or continue antidepressant medication and may discourage people from discontinuing treatment, potentially leading to lifelong dependence on these drugs.

As with all research synthesis, the findings of this umbrella review are dependent on the quality of the included studies, and susceptible to their limitations. Most of the included studies were rated as low quality on the AMSTAR-2, but the GRADE approach suggested some findings were reasonably robust. Most of the non-genetic studies did not reliably exclude the potential effects of previous antidepressant use and were based on relatively small numbers of participants. The genetic studies, in particular, illustrate the importance of methodological rigour and sample size. Whereas some earlier, lower quality, mostly smaller studies produced marginally positive findings, these were not confirmed in better-conducted, larger and more recent studies. The identification of depression and assessment of confounders and interaction effects were limited by the data available in the original studies on which the included reviews and meta-analyses were based. Common methods such as the categorisation of continuous measures and application of linear models to non-linear data may have led to over-estimation or under-estimation of effects, including the interaction between stress and the SERT gene. The latest systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies was conducted in 2007, and there has been considerable research produced since then. Hence, we provided a snapshot of the most recent evidence at the time of writing, but this area requires an up to date, comprehensive data synthesis. However, the recent studies were consistent with the earlier meta-analysis with little evidence for an effect of tryptophan depletion on mood.

### The serotonin transporter in depression: meta-analysis of in vivo and post mortem findings and implications for understanding and treating depression [^8f1bbf49]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Altered serotonin transporter levels have been reported in blood and brain of patients with major depressive disorders. However, the strength and consistency of the evidence for altered serotonin transporter availability in major depressive disorder is not clear.

Methods

To address this, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted of all available in vivo neuroimaging and post mortem studies reporting serotonin transporter availability in patients with depression compared with healthy controls.

Results

The final sample consisted of fifty (n = 27 in vivo and n = 25 post mortem) studies including 877 patients with depression (mean age: 42.9 years) and 968 healthy controls (mean age: 42.7 years). In vivo neuroimaging studies indicated reduced serotonin transporter binding in the striatum (g = -0.39, p = 0.01), the amygdala (g = -0.37, p = 0.01) and the brainstem (g = -0.31, p = 0.01), including the midbrain (g = -0.27, p = 0.02), but no significant alteration in the thalamus or the hippocampus. The post mortem findings indicated no significant change in serotonin transporter binding in depression in the brainstem (p = 0.64), the frontal cortex (p = 0.75) and the hippocampus (p = 0.32, corrected for publication bias). Although there were too few studies for a meta-analysis, the post mortem studies in the amygdala and striatum showed reduced SERT binding in MDD in absolute terms, consistent with the imaging findings.

Limitations

A number of potential factors might have biased the results of the present meta-analysis such as the imaging modality (post mortem or in vivo neuroimaging), partial volume effects, susceptibility of some radiotracers to synaptic serotonin levels or binding to other monoamine transporters.

Conclusions

The results indicate that serotonin transporter availability in depressed patients is reduced in key regions of the limbic system. This provides direct support for the serotonin hypothesis of depression, and underlines the importance of the serotonin transporter as a target of pharmacological treatments.

### Anti-inflammatory treatment for major depressive disorder: implications for patients with an elevated immune profile and non-responders to standard antidepressant therapy [^d089ee36]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Pro-inflammatory cytokine effects on neurotransmitter metabolism

The link between pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased serotonergic synthesis has already been extensively explored. It was hypothesized that during inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, INF-γ and TNF-α increase the activity of IDO and reduce the production of serotonin. IDO catalyzes tryptophan (TRP) catabolism through the kynurenine pathway, producing kynurenic acid (KYN), quinolinic acid (QUIN) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Substantial evidence demonstrates that a pro-inflammatory scenario leads to increased and unbalanced production of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) that play a major role in the development and maintenance of MDD. A recent meta-analysis bydemonstrated convincing evidence for lowered plasma TRP levels in patients with MDD. The study included MDD patients (n = 744) and healthy controls (n = 793), and found a highly significant decreased levels of TRP in depressed patients vs controls (p < 0.001). A secondary analysis using only data of unmedicated MDD patients (n = 156) and controls (n = 203) demonstrated an even more pronounced difference in TRP levels in unmedicated patients, when compared with controls (p < 0.001). These data suggest that psychotropic therapy (antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines) reduced the difference in TRP levels between groups. Decreased levels of TRP and consequent depletion of serotonin results in the development of depressive symptoms, as proposed by the classic monoamine depletion hypothesis. IDO induction may have evolved as a mechanism for the maintenance of NAD+, which is the final product of the IDO and TRP catabolism pathway. NAD+ is important for the induction of sirtuins, which contribute to many of the processes that are deregulated in depression including neurogenesis, circadian rhythms and mitochondrial regulation. Despite the evidence that suggest a role of TRYCATs in depression, one should keep in mind that TRYCATs have also been associated with the psycho-somatic symptoms that accompany depression. Since depression and somatization shared common pathways, it may be difficult to discriminate between these effects.

### Serotonergic vulnerability and depression: assumptions, experimental evidence and implications [^1093e8ff]. Molecular Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

In recent years, the term serotonergic vulnerability (SV) has been used in scientific literature, but so far it has not been explicitly defined. This review article attempts to elucidate the SV concept. SV can be defined as increased sensitivity to natural or experimental alterations of the serotonergic (5-HTergic) system. Several factors that may disrupt the 5-HTergic system and hence contribute to SV are discussed, including genetic factors, female gender, personality characteristics, several types of stress and drug use. It is explained that SV can be demonstrated by means of manipulations of the 5-HTergic system, such as 5-HT challenges or acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Results of 5-HT challenge studies and ATD studies are discussed in terms of their implications for the concept of SV. A model is proposed in which a combination of various factors that may compromise 5-HT functioning in one person can result in depression or other 5-HT-related pathology. By manipulating 5-HT levels, in particular with ATD, vulnerable subjects may be identified before pathology initiates, providing the opportunity to take preventive action. Although it is not likely that this model applies to all cases of depression, or is able to identify all vulnerable subjects, the strength of the model is that it may enable identification of vulnerable subjects before the 5-HT related pathology occurs.

### The interaction of early life factors and depression-associated loci affecting the age at onset of the depression [^de621f4e]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The early life factors of the newborn are crucial in the adaptation to (potentially life-long) environmental exposures. Relative to adulthood, neurodevelopment during childhood and adolescence is more plastic and susceptible to programming influences from stressful environmental and social contexts. For example, childhood trauma exposure is associated with altered brain structure and function. Altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation and secondary regional brain structure changes in children exposed to emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and aggressive families. Early life stress affects hippocampal neurogenesis, increases depressive-like behavior, and causes mild metabolic imbalance in early adulthood (2 months).

Further, early life factors may modify the role of genetic polymorphism by providing the necessary substrates for the development of human disease or influencing the effect of a specific gene. For example, individual genotypic variations interacting with early life stress may contribute to variability in clinical outcomes. Alterations in humans with early life stress experiences include glucocorticoid resistance. Feedback inhibition of the HPA axis response via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is significantly lower in patients with MDD, and cytosolic FKBP5 gene expression is induced via GR activation. Laboratory animals exposed to cigarette smoke in utero experience structural changes to their serotonin system that are associated with reduced serotonin levels and last through adulthood. Low serotonin level is an important precursor to behaviors that are consistent with depression in animals and depression in humans.

The age at onset of depression is under genetic control, and genetic variants associated with MDD may differ according to age at onset of depression. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) only calculates the association between a single SNP and phenotype, which could easily lead to a decline in the interpretation of phenotypes affected by multiple genetic variants in complex diseases. However, previous studies on age at onset of depression merely focused on the effects of environmental or genetic factors on the risks, usually without considering the interaction between them.

Utilizing the UK Biobank cohort, we first calculated polygenic risk score (PRS) for depression based on previous depression GWAS summary data. The interacting effects of depression PRS and early life factors (e.g. childhood trauma exposure, mother smoking during pregnancy) on age at onset of the depression were tested through regression analysis. Then, genome-wide environment interaction studies (GWEIS) were performed to identify potential genetic loci × early life factors interacting effects on the risk of age at onset of the depression based on the regression analyses results.

### Can monoamine-based therapies be improved? [^8bd08fe5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Monoamine-based therapies that selectively target serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine uptake are effective as antidepressants. However, many depressed patients do not achieve remission with these single-action agents. Treatment strategies that target more than one neurotransmitter, either through augmentation, combination treatment, or the development of single agents with dual or triple reuptake mechanisms, may prove to be even more effective than traditional antidepressants and merit further research.

### Oxidative stress, anti-oxidants and the cross-sectional and longitudinal association with depressive symptoms: results from the CARDIA study [^20c027e1]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

There is also evidence suggesting that common genetic factors underlie both low carotenoid levels and depressive symptoms: a recent study demonstrated a single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with low levels of β-cryptoxanthin was also associated with depressive symptoms.

Besides increased exposure to ROS from exogenous sources owing to poor health and lifestyle behaviors, there is evidence to suggest that depression is also accompanied by increased endogenous production of ROS, possibly through mitochondrial dysfunction. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage owing to its large oxygen consumption and relatively weak antioxidant defenses. Sustained oxidative brain damage during a depressive episode may make a sufferer prone to developing another depressive episode. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that exposure to oxidative stress could be an explanatory mechanism in the remitting and chronic course of depressive disorders.

There is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants have antioxidant properties and may act through reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS production and improving levels of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase. A number of studies have demonstrated that successful treatment with antidepressants decreases markers of oxidative stress and/or increases markers of antioxidant activity. However, these findings are limited and conflicting. To illustrate, Chung et al. found that serotonin re-uptake inhibitor treatment actually increased F2-isoprostane levels, despite reducing depressive symptoms.

### 'It's not over when it's over': persistent neurobiological abnormalities in recovered depressed patients [^69252d17]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The tendency of major depression to recur is a leading problem in clinical management and is responsible for much of the illness burden. Until recently, biological studies of depression have focused on the mechanisms involved in acute illness but there are now many data to suggest that neurobiological abnormalities persist when depressed patients are clinically recovered and withdrawn from medication. These abnormalities encompass a number of neurochemical and neuropsychological mechanisms that could be relevant to recurrence, including changes in the availability of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor subtypes, decreases in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), increases in cortisol secretion and negative biases in the processing of emotional information. Studies of groups at high risk of depression before illness onset will help to clarify which biological abnormalities precede the development of depression and which are the product of recurrent illness. Ultimately this work should lead to a better understanding of the neurobiology of vulnerability to depression and more innovative approaches to primary and secondary prevention.

### Psychiatric and cognitive function in patients with serotonin producing neuroendocrine tumors [^ea49b6d2]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Serotonin metabolism

As a central neurotransmitter within the brain, serotonin is known to regulate both mood and a broad spectrum of cognitive functions, including memory processes, attention, and executive functions. Reduced serotonin neurotransmission has been associated with impaired cognitive functioning in several brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Cognitive function, however, was not associated with peripheral measures of serotonin, its metabolite 5-HIAA or its precursor tryptophan. Therefore, we conclude that tryptophan depletion following tumor-related peripheral serotonin production does not seem to be a mechanism underlying cognitive problems in patients with a serotonin producing NET.

Similarly, disturbances in the serotonergic system are thought to underlie psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety. However, no conclusive direct evidence exists that tryptophan depletion per se causes depressive symptoms. In a large study with three cohorts of postmenopausal women, the association between serotonin concentrations and depression was only present in women using antidepressants but absent in women with depression who did not use antidepressants. Previous observations show that the use of SSRIs lowers the measured levels of serum serotonin in SINET patients, so serum serotonin measurements in SSRI users may be unreliable. However, the same study also found an inverse relation between tryptophan and severity of depression in women not using antidepressants, which is the opposite of the positive association between depression severity and tryptophan concentrations found in our study. Low tryptophan has been hypothesized as the missing link between somatic and psychiatric states, through a mechanism in which inflammation causes increased degradation of tryptophan and central depletion. The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) investigated this hypothesis but found similar tryptophan levels between depressed and non-depressed individuals and no association between depressive symptoms and tryptophan levels. Tryptophan degradation, expressed as the ratio between the amino acid kynurenine and tryptophan (KYN/TRP) was slightly lower in the group with a current depression, suggesting decreased tryptophan degradation, but this difference disappeared after correction for antidepressant use. Therefore, our finding that tryptophan is positively associated with the severity of depressive symptoms remains puzzling. Because the association was consistently found for multiple outcomes, including the total score on the IDS, both subscales of the IDS, and the cognitive subscale on the BAI, even after controlling for possible confounding factors, it likely reflects a genuine association and not merely a false positive or coincidental finding. More research is necessary before we are able to truly comprehend its meaning.

### Gene expression studies in depression development and treatment: an overview of the underlying molecular mechanisms and biological processes to identify biomarkers [^54cc0d1b]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the serotonin transporter has been linked to MDD in candidate gene studies and in gene-to-environment interaction studies, hence it plays a key role in MDD pathophysiology. The serotonin transporter protein (SLC6A4) is the main target of many antidepressants, although the relationship between pathophysiology and therapeutic effects of antidepressants is still not clear. Based on previous studies on SLC6A4 mRNA gene expression variation in peripheral tissues, Belzeaux et al.explored whether SLC6A4 mRNA could be a target biomarker of antidepressant treatment during a major depressive episode that varies between the baseline and the 30-week follow-up period in responder patients. Interestingly, decreased expression levels of SLC6A4 were observed in responder patients across a 30-week follow-up, whereas non-responder subjects showed increased mRNA levels of SLC6A4. Conversely, healthy controls exhibited a stable pattern of SLC6A4 mRNA expression across the 30-week follow-up period. These data support that the serotonin transporter protein, the main target of many antidepressants, could be a valid target biomarker in MDD patients for a personalized medicine approach.

As suggested by our results in responder and non-responder patients, gene expression variation of selected genes, monitored across a long period of time, could be informative of clinical evolution and potential relapses or recurrences.

Another interesting hypothesis of MDD suggests that the inflammasome is a central mediator by which psychological and physical stressors could contribute to the development of the disorder. In this regard, the study performed by Alcocer-Gómez et al.examined this hypothesis to determine whether NLRP3 inflammasome could be activated in PBMC from MDD patients and to shed light on the implication of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Furthermore, they studied the effects of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant drug, on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The authors found that MDD patients showed reduced serum levels of IL-1b and IL-18, and a significant reduction in NLRP3 and caspase-1 activation. Moreover, they observed that the association between the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and IL-1b and IL-18 serum levels was reduced when controlling for antidepressant treatment, suggesting that antidepressants can modulate the inflammation levels.

### Understanding the mechanism of action and clinical effects of neuroactive steroids and GABAergic compounds in major depressive disorder [^4a6ecd6f]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

More recent data implicate alterations in the sensorimotor network as being the most consistent factor in depression. Evidence also suggests an association of altered connectivity in the default mode network with postpartum depression (PPD). These functional networks communicate using several neurotransmitters, including amino acids such as glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain, respectively, and monoamines such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin.

Hypotheses of depression

Several hypotheses exist for the pathophysiology of depression as it relates to altered neurotransmitter levels. The early monoamine hypothesis, which posits that a core pathophysiologic feature of depression is depletion of brain monoamine neurotransmitters (eg, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin), originated from the observation that most standard-of-care antidepressant therapies (ADTs) can increase extracellular concentrations of these neurotransmitters.

The glutamatergic hypothesis of depression suggests an association between elevated glutamate levels and depression. This hypothesis is based on preclinical evidence of the antidepressant effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists. Glutamate binds to NMDA receptors, resulting in excitatory neurotransmission. Elevated glutamate levels lead to overactivation of NMDA receptors and induce calcium ion (Ca 2+) influx, which in turn may lead to long-term potentiation and long-term depression. However, the evidence for elevated glutamate levels in depression is inconsistent. A postmortem study of adults with MDD reported increased glutamate levels in the frontal cortex of patients with MDD, and a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study showed increased glutamate levels in the occipital cortex of patients with MDD. Conversely, a meta-analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies examining levels of glutamatergic neurometabolites reported significant decreases in the combined glutamine-plus-glutamate level within the medial PFC in patients with depression compared with healthy volunteers but not in the dorsolateral PFC or medial temporal cortex; differences in glutamate levels between the two groups were not significant in any of these areas. Another meta-analysis showed that glutamate levels were lower within the anterior cingulate cortex of patients with depression compared with healthy volunteers.

### Exploring the combined influence of serum serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor on depression remission: short-and long-term responses [^433945a5]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the independent and interactive combined effects of serum serotonin (s5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (sBDNF) levels on antidepressant remission at 12 weeks and 12 months in patients with depressive disorders. Baseline levels of s5-HT and sBDNF were measured in 1086 patients receiving stepwise antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Remission was defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≤ 7. Logistic and multinomial regression analyses examined individual and interactive biomarker effects, adjusting for relevant covariates. The clinical relevance was assessed using Number Needed to Treat (NNT). Higher baseline s5-HT significantly predicted 12-week remission but showed no association with 12-month remission. Conversely, higher baseline sBDNF was significantly associated with 12-month remission but not with 12-week remission. A significant interaction between s5-HT and sBDNF was observed specifically at 12 months, where patients with low levels of both biomarkers showed markedly reduced remission rates. NNT analyses demonstrated substantial clinical utility in combining biomarkers, with an improved NNT of 6.8 when identifying patients at risk for poor long-term remission. The interactive combination of low baseline s5-HT and sBDNF levels strongly predicts reduced 12-month antidepressant remission, highlighting its potential for guiding personalized clinical management to enhance long-term depression outcomes.

### The role of serotonin in cognitive function: evidence from recent studies and implications for understanding depression [^5fa45452]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of cognitive impairment such as poor concentration, memory loss and difficulty with decision making are prevalent in patients with depression, but currently are not specific targets for treatment. However, patients can continue to demonstrate cognitive impairments even when apparently clinically recovered. Drugs that potentiate serotonin (5-HT) function, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay of treatment for depression. Nevertheless, our understanding of the effects of SSRIs and other conventional antidepressant therapy on cognitive function in healthy humans and depressed patients remains limited.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to provide a concise overview for clinicians on the impact of pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT on cognitive function in healthy humans with additional reference to animal models where human data are lacking, particularly regarding specific 5-HT receptor subtype modulation.

Findings

The most consistent observation following manipulation of serotonin levels in humans is that low extracellular 5-HT levels are associated with impaired memory consolidation. Preclinical data show that agonism and antagonism at specific 5-HT receptors can exert effects in animal models of cognition.

Conclusions

Larger, consistently designed studies are needed to understand the roles of 5-HT in cognition in healthy and depressed individuals. Efforts to target specific 5-HT receptors to improve cognitive outcomes are warranted.

### Neuroimaging markers of cellular function in major depressive disorder: implications for therapeutics, personalized medicine, and prevention [^b64717b6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

It is estimated that 15% of all individuals will experience a major depressive episode (MDE) during their lifetime and that treatment response is inadequate in 40% of these cases. To address this, neuroimaging is being used to identify MDE subtypes and mechanisms of onset as well as to optimize target occupancy of novel treatments. Neuroimaging of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) binding; glutamate levels; indexes of 5-HT(2A), 5-HTT, 5-HT(1A), and 5-HT(1B) receptors; levels of dopamine transporters D(1) and D(2); and hippocampal volume are described here. Three themes emerge. First, symptoms such as pessimism, motor retardation, anxiety disorder, and verbal memory deficits best indicate the subtype of depression. Second, measures related to mechanisms of monoamine loss, particularly elevated MAO-A binding in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, are present in MDE and in high-risk states for MDE. Third, clinical trials show a consistent 80% 5-HTT occupancy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at doses sufficient to distinguish from placebo in clinical trials (although in vitro affinities vary 100-fold), thereby supporting the need for further occupancy studies to accelerate therapeutic development.

attitudes during MDE. Dysfunctional attitudes are negatively biased assumptions and beliefs regarding oneself, the world, and the future. Our recent publication of increased serotonin2 BP in MDE with severely negativistic dysfunctional attitudes suggests that this subgroup of MDE subjects has very low levels of extracellular serotonin. Methods. Given that serotonin can function as a modulator of dysfunctionalattitudes, it seemed quite possible that low levels of serotonin could contributeto the increased severity of dysfunctional attitudes that often occur duringMDE. In a second investigation in MDE subjects, we found that negativisticdysfunctional attitudes were associated with increased cortex serotonin2 BP. 25 Furthermore, MDE subjects withseverely negativistic dysfunctional attitudes had increased serotonin2 BP compared with healthy subjects. The BPis proportional to receptor density.

A plausible explanation for the relationshipbetween serotonin2 BP and dysfunctional attitudes is that subjectswho have a form of MDE with severely negativistic dysfunctional attitudesalso have had an extended period of low levels of extracellular serotoninin the cerebral cortex. We hypothesized that MDE subjects with greater 5-HTT BP would have moreseverely negativistic dysfunctional attitudes. The underlying model for thishypothesis is that MDE subjects with greater 5-HTT BP will remove more extracellularserotonin, have lower levels of extracellular serotonin, and experience moresevere symptoms of pessimism. The association between negativistic thinking and higher 5-HTT BP is interpretedto reflect a vulnerability to greater extracellular clearance of serotoninwhen the 5-HTT BP is high. Greater extracellular clearance of serotonin thenresults in more severe symptoms.

The earlier investigations25 suggestthat depressed patients with greater dysfunctional attitudes have a greaterloss of extracellular serotonin, and the present study proposes that greater5-HTT BP is a mechanism that could contribute to greater extracellular serotoninloss. This interpretation suggests that the 5-HTT and DAT have similar rolesof increasing vulnerability to symptoms during MDE. The DAS is highly correlated with the Beck Hopelessness Scaleduring MDE, 67, 68 and greater scoreson the Beck Hopelessness Scale are associated with higher likelihood of suicide. 69, 70 Therefore, it is possible that duringMDE, in some people, elevated 5-HTT BP may lead to lower serotonin levels, less stimulation via major serotonergic signal transduction pathways, andelevated serotonin2 BP. It may be that these processes mediategreater negativistic thinking and eventually result in an elevated risk ofsuicide.

### Serotonin and brain function: a tale of two receptors [^f53e80c2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Postmortem studies showing increased 5-HT2AR availability in unmedicated depressed patients and suicide victims could be viewed as consistent with the hypothesis that there is an adaptive upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors in response to deficient 5-HT2AR signalling in depression. The existent of discrepant findings (e.g. decreased 5-HT2AR availability in depression and suicide victims) that challenge this hypothesis may be explained by the confounding influence of antidepressant and other psychiatric medications – which reverse this relationship by downregulating 5-HT2AR availability.

### How do antidepressants work? New perspectives for refining future treatment approaches [^6fe66aeb]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Most currently available antidepressants target monoamine neurotransmitter function. However, a purely neurotransmitter-based explanation for antidepressant drug action is challenged by the delayed clinical onset of most agents and the need to explain how neurochemical changes reverse the many different symptoms of depression. Novel approaches to understanding of antidepressant drug action include a focus on early changes in emotional and social processing and the role of neural plasticity. In this Review, we discuss the ways in which these two different theories reflect different or complementary approaches, and how they might be integrated to offer novel solutions for people with depression. We consider the predictions made by these mechanistic approaches for the stratification and development of new therapeutics for depression, and the next steps that need to be made to facilitate this translation of science to the clinic.

### The interaction of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms and early adverse life events on vulnerability for major depression [^275569c6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Considerable literature supports the hypothesis of dysfunction in central nervous system serotonergic circuits in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, specifically major depression. Since the development of the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, a putative role for the 5-HT transporter (SERT) in the etiology of depression has been explored. The discovery of a functional SERT polymorphism has provided a novel tool to further scrutinize the role of serotonergic neurons in depression. This article reviews the burgeoning evidence of an interaction between early life stress and an SERT polymorphism on vulnerability to depression.

### Association of depressive disorders, depression characteristics and antidepressant medication with inflammation [^5dd5bd5b]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Instead of inflammatory or vascular, the true etiology of depression in this subgroup of men with late-onset depression might have a metabolic nature. Several studies have confirmed an association between CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α with the metabolic syndrome and visceral fat depots release cytokines. The metabolic syndrome and in particular visceral fat have been bidirectionally associated with depression in late life, specifically in men. Men possess higher amounts of visceral fat compared with women and are therefore more likely to experience related inflammation and depression. Involvement of metabolic processes is further supported by our finding that the association between depression and inflammation in particular decreased after adjustment for BMI.

Several biological mechanisms could further explain the relationship between depression and inflammation. Depression has been associated with dysregulation of important stress systems of the human body, that is, the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal-axisand the autonomic nervous system. Although the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal-axis in normal situations should temper inflammatory reactions, prolonged hyperactivity of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal-axis could result in blunted anti-inflammatory responses to glucocorticoids resulting in increased inflammation. In addition, both decreased parasympatheticas well as increased sympathetic nervous system activityhave been associated with increased inflammation. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines might inhibit hippocampal neurogenesis, which could lead to a reduced hippocampal volume, which is also seen in depression. Also, several inflammatory markers have been shown to promote indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activation, which catalyzes tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, to kynurenine, thereby indirectly reducing the availability of serotonin. Lastly, specific genes might underlie both increased inflammation and depression, as several inflammation-related genes have been associated with susceptibility to major depression.

### The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^3722787b]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

We searched for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large database studies in these six areas in PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO using the Healthcare Databases Advanced Search tool provided by Health Education England and NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). Searches were conducted until December 2020.

We used the following terms in all searches: (depress* OR affective OR mood) AND (systematic OR meta-analysis), and limited searches to title and abstract, since not doing so produced numerous irrelevant hits. In addition, we used terms specific to each area of research (full details are provided in Table S1, Supplement). We also searched citations and consulted with experts.

Inclusion criteria were designed to identify the best available evidence in each research area and consisted of:
Research synthesis including systematic reviews, meta-analysis, umbrella reviews, individual patient meta-analysis and large dataset analysis.
Studies that involve people with depressive disorders or, for experimental studies (tryptophan depletion), those in which mood symptoms are measured as an outcome.
Studies of experimental procedures (tryptophan depletion) involving a sham or control condition.
Studies published in full in peer reviewed literature.
Where more than five systematic reviews or large analyses exist, the most recent five are included.

Exclusion criteria consisted of:
Animal studies.
Studies exclusively concerned with depression in physical conditions (e.g. post stroke or Parkinson's disease) or exclusively focusing on specific subtypes of depression such as postpartum depression, depression in children, or depression in bipolar disorder.

No language or date restrictions were applied. In areas in which no systematic review or meta-analysis had been done within the last 10 years, we also selected the ten most recent studies at the time of searching (December 2020) for illustration of more recent findings. We performed this search using the same search string for this domain, without restricting it to systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

### 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels determine vulnerability to stress and response to antidepressants [^b3720fc5]. Neuron (2010). Low credibility.

Most depressed patients don't respond to their first drug treatment, and the reasons for this treatment resistance remain enigmatic. Human studies implicate a polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor gene in increased susceptibility to depression and decreased treatment response. Here we develop a new strategy to manipulate 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in raphe nuclei without affecting 5-HT(1A) heteroreceptors, generating mice with higher (1A-High) or lower (1A-Low) autoreceptor levels. We show that this robustly affects raphe firing rates, but has no effect on either basal forebrain serotonin levels or conflict-anxiety measures. However, compared to 1A-Low mice, 1A-High mice show a blunted physiological response to acute stress, increased behavioral despair, and no behavioral response to antidepressant, modeling patients with the 5-HT(1A) risk allele. Furthermore, reducing 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor levels prior to antidepressant treatment is sufficient to convert nonresponders into responders. These results establish a causal relationship between 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor levels, resilience under stress, and response to antidepressants.

### A metabolome-wide association study in the general population reveals decreased levels of serum laurylcarnitine in people with depression [^9fe2c13e]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study conducted a metabolome-wide association analysis comprising 353 unique serum metabolites in the general population sample of 1411 KORA F4 study participants. We were able to identify the organic compound laurylcarnitine to be significantly associated with depressive symptoms after thorough correction for multiple testing, and successfully replicated this finding in an independent general population sample of 968 SHIP-Trend study participants. Laurylcarnitine levels were significantly lower in individuals with other/major as well as in individuals with purely major depressive symptoms compared against individuals without depressive symptoms in KORA F4. Laurylcarnitine levels were also lower in serum specimens collected from individuals with other depressive symptoms, although without reaching statistical significance. This might point to a severity-dependent association between decreasing laurylcarnitine levels and increasing depressive symptoms.

Laurylcarnitine has not yet been identified as a major player in psychiatric disorders including depression, and its significant association with depressive symptoms in two independent general population cohorts comes as a surprise. Laurylcarnitine belongs to the chemical class of acylcarnitines, fatty acyl esters of the quaternary ammonium compound L-carnitine. Acylcarnitines are involved in the transport of (long-chain) fatty acids from the cytosol across the mitochondrial membrane toward the mitochondrial matrix for subsequent β-oxidation. Lower levels of acylcarnitines in depressed subjects might point to altered fatty acid oxidation and/or mitochondrial function in these individuals.

Aberrancies in mitochondrial energy production seem to contribute in important ways to the development of neuropsychiatric diseases, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Gardner et al. for instance, reported significant decreases in mitochondrial ATP production rates and mitochondrial enzyme ratios in MDD patients in comparison to healthy controls. On the other hand, depressive disorders have been observed in patients with various mitochondrial disorders. Interestingly, several antidepressants have been reported to influence neuronal mitochondrial function either positively or negatively. In our study, we observed varying effect sizes for the association between laurylcarnitine and depressive symptoms in individuals using or not using antidepressants. However, case numbers in both subcohorts were rather small, and results should be interpreted with caution. Interestingly, a mice study reported altered brain energy metabolism and increased norepinephrine and serotonin content subsequent to chronic acetyl-L-carnitine intake, and acetyl-L-carnitine has been suggested for depression treatment due to its beneficial neuroplasticity effect, membrane modulation, and neurotransmitter regulation.

### Serotonin and brain function: a tale of two receptors [^0ac0e976]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1 summarises findings that support various associations between 5-HT, signalling at its post-synaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and relevant psychological phenomena. A number of these associations require qualification, e.g. 5-HT2AR agonism can have opposite acute and longer-term effects. To account for this, we use the acronyms 'ST' and 'LT' for acute (short-term) and long-term outcomes respectively, where we feel disambiguation is required. Also, receptor signalling may increase plasticity in one region but decrease it in the other (e.g.). As this matter is most relevant in relation to molecular markers of plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex, we use the acronyms 'hip' and 'cx' to provide the necessary disambiguation. Regarding plasticity, we use 'general plasticity' (gP) to refer simply to an increased capability for change and 'regional plasticity' (rP) when we are specifically referring regional changes in molecular markers of plasticity such as trophic factors. It is important to stress that the effects of 5-HT2AR agonism are highly context sensitive (see Figure 2), e.g. the effects of 5-HT2AR signalling on mood and mental health are likely highly sensitive to the quality of the environment in which a 5-HT2AR-mediated experience occurs, and this rule may also apply for treatment with an SSRI perhaps due to increased 5-HT2A receptor signalling through increased synaptic 5-HT. For this reason, and due to the still developing evidence base for psychedelics for depression (e.g. see), we took the modest step of not describing the association between 5-HT2AR signalling and depression as 'strong' (+++). In fact, we describe all associations between 5-HT, mood and depression as resting on 'reasonable' (i.e. ++) evidence because we acknowledge that these associations are especially complex. Also, some aspects of cognition but not others may be enhanced by increased signalling at a specific receptor and this is not qualified in the table. The reader may therefore notice some contradictory associations, simply because the data are not straightforward in supporting one particular direction. Importantly, this table is not intended as an exhaustive nor comprehensive account of literature pertaining to brain serotonin function but rather as an overview of significant associations between 5-HT, its 1A and 2A receptors and specific psychological phenomena of interest. This table cannot be considered a substitute for a detailed reading of the surrounding text. To properly understand the relevant associations, a careful reading of the text and supporting references is encouraged. Key: to provide a qualitative index of the perceived strength of evidence for a given association, we use the symbols +, ++ and +++ to denote 'weak', 'reasonable' and 'strong' evidence. Moreover, strong associations are shown in bold font. The '↑' symbol denotes an increase in a particular factor and '↓' denotes a decrease. The '→' symbol denotes that one factor causes another.

### Serotonin transporter availability increases in patients recovering from a depressive episode [^5fe64859]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Molecular imaging studies have shown low cerebral concentration of serotonin transporter in patients suffering from depression, compared to healthy control subjects. Whether or not this difference also is present before disease onset and after remission (i.e. a trait), or only at the time of the depressive episode (i.e. a state) remains to be explored. We examined 17 patients with major depressive disorder with positron emission tomography using [11 C]MADAM, a radioligand that binds to the serotonin transporter, before and after treatment with internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. In all, 17 matched healthy control subjects were examined once. Cerebellum was used as reference to calculate the binding potential. Differences before and after treatment, as well as between patients and controls, were assessed in a composite cerebral region and in the median raphe nuclei. All image analyses and confirmatory statistical tests were preregistered. Depression severity decreased following treatment (p < 0.001). [11 C]MADAM binding in patients increased in the composite region after treatment (p = 0.01), while no change was observed in the median raphe (p = 0.51). No significant difference between patients at baseline and healthy controls were observed in the composite region (p = 0.97) or the median raphe (p = 0.95). Our main finding was that patients suffering from a depressive episode show an overall increase in cerebral serotonin transporter availability as symptoms are alleviated. Our results suggest that previously reported cross-sectional molecular imaging findings of the serotonin transporter in depression most likely reflect the depressive state, rather than a permanent trait. The finding adds new information on the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.

### Alteration of frontal EEG asymmetry during tryptophan depletion predicts future depression [^6bcc684e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Tryptophan depletion (TD) reduces brain serotonin and may induce acute depressive symptomatology, especially among those with a history of Major Depression. Depressive response to TD among euthymic patients with a history of depression also predicts future depression. Better prediction might result by assessing a putative endophenotype for depressive risk, frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry, in the context of TD.

Method

Nine euthymic history-positive participants and nine controls were administered TD. Symptomatic and EEG frontal asymmetry data were collected for 6 h following TD, and clinical status was followed for the next 12 months.

Results

The magnitude of TD-induced change in frontal EEG asymmetry significantly predicted the development of depression during the ensuing six to twelve months, and with greater sensitivity than symptomatic response.

Limitations

The results are tempered by the small sample size.

Conclusions

Despite the limited sample size, these preliminary results suggest that TD-induced changes in frontal EEG asymmetry may provide a more sensitive indicator of risk for imminent depression than symptomatic response to TD.

### Association of depressive disorders, depression characteristics and antidepressant medication with inflammation [^ee5e45ea]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Growing evidence suggests that immune dysregulation may be involved in depressive disorders, but the exact nature of this association is still unknown and may be restricted to specific subgroups. This study examines the association between depressive disorders, depression characteristics and antidepressant medication with inflammation in a large cohort of controls and depressed persons, taking possible sex differences and important confounding factors into account. Persons (18–65 years) with a current (N = 1132) or remitted (N = 789) depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria and healthy controls (N = 494) were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Assessments included clinical characteristics (severity, duration and age of onset), use of antidepressant medication and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)). After adjustment for sociodemographics, currently depressed men, but not women, had higher levels of CRP (1.33 versus 0.92 mg l(-1), P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.32) and IL-6 (0.88 versus 0.72 pg ml(-1), P = 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.23) than non-depressed peers. Associations reduced after considering lifestyle and disease indicators — especially body mass index — but remained significant for CRP. After full adjustment, highest inflammation levels were found in depressed men with an older age of depression onset (CRP, TNF-α). Furthermore, inflammation was increased in men using serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (CRP, IL-6) and in men and women using tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants (CRP), but decreased among men using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (IL-6). In conclusion, elevated inflammation was confirmed in depressed men, especially those with a late-onset depression. Specific antidepressants may differ in their effects on inflammation.

### Serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in major depressive disorder: state-trait issues, clinical features and pharmacological treatment [^c74ee7ce]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Alternative factors that have been proposed to underlie the low levels of BDNF during depression are exposure to stressful life events. Two studies, for example, found that adverse life events are associated with lower peripheral BDNF levels within a depressed and bipolar patient samples. Therefore, it seems worthwhile to integrate a wider range of variables, notably (early) adverse life events, but also genetic variants and their interactions with environmental variablesin models that study the link between BDNF and depression.

In addition, we found that serum BDNF levels were higher in antidepressant-treated patients compared with patients who were antidepressant free. This finding largely is in accord with previous findings. We were able to expand previous findings by showing that the use of an antidepressant is associated with increased serum BDNF during a depressive episode but not during remission. This suggests that antidepressant-induced increases in BDNF occur in a disease state when BDNF functioning might be defective and not in remission when BDNF functioning is normalized. In addition, we found the increase in serum BDNF levels to be a specific associate of the use of SSRIs and St John's wort and not of the use of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or NaSSAs. Although not directly confirmed, this finding might be explained by increased availability of extra-synaptic levels of serotonin. It is known that serotonin stimulates the expression of BDNF. In line with this, we found the highest BDNF levels in patients who were treated with an agent that generally leads to an increase in the availability of serotonin (that is SSRIs and St John's wort). Furthermore, we found the lowest levels of BDNF in patients who were treated with agents that have little or no impact on the availability of serotonin (that is NaSSAs). Nevertheless, this antidepressant-specific finding seems at odds with the specific prediction of the neurotrophin hypothesis, stating that increases in BDNF levels are a key mediator for an antidepressant response to occur. According to this prediction, one might expect that antidepressants that are known to be about equally efficacious in the treatment of the symptoms of depression, would have similar effects on serum BDNF levels. Yet another finding that seems hard to reconcile with the neurotrophin hypothesis is that the group of depressed persons who used antidepressants (prolonged and frequently) had the highest BDNF levels, but also the highest symptom severity of depression. This suggests, to our belief that increases in peripheral BDNF levels do not parallel clinical effectiveness, or at least have no direct effects on the depression characteristics such as its severity. Such a conclusion on the absence of direct effects could also be drawn on the findings that the severity of a depressive episode was unrelated to serum BDNF levels and that persons who were in early remission had similar levels of BDNF yet marked lower levels of depression severity compared with depressed patients.

### Linking molecules to mood: new insight into the biology of depression [^f5697237]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a heritable psychiatric syndrome that appears to be associated with subtle cellular and molecular alterations in a complex neural network. The affected brain regions display dynamic neuroplastic adaptations to endocrine and immunologic stimuli arising from within and outside the CNS. Depression's clinical and etiological heterogeneity adds a third level of complexity, implicating different pathophysiological mechanisms in different patients with the same DSM diagnosis. Current pharmacological antidepressant treatments improve depressive symptoms through complex mechanisms that are themselves incompletely understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the neurobiology of depression by combining insights from human clinical studies and molecular explanations from animal models. The authors provide recommendations for future research, with a focus on translating today's discoveries into improved diagnostic tests and treatments.

### Monoamine depletion studies: implications for antidepressant discontinuation syndrome [^ef3ba3f6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The likelihood of a connection between serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation and an acute reduction in synaptic serotonin (5-HT) has ignited interest in the similarities between SRI discontinuation syndrome and the symptoms observed after acute tryptophan depletion, which reduces synaptic 5-HT levels. An open question is whether these 2 phenomena have shared characteristics because of a similar underlying mechanism. The evidence in support of a similar underlying mechanism includes the observation that comparable proportions of SRI-treated patients experience depressive symptoms following tryptophan depletion and SRI discontinuation. Furthermore, the proportion of people who have emotional changes with rapid antidepressant discontinuation may be parallel to the proportion of people who experience those changes with rapid tryptophan depletion.

### The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence [^bcc7fe0c]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Depletion studies

Tryptophan depletion using dietary means or chemicals, such as parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), is thought to reduce serotonin levels. Since PCPA is potentially toxic, reversible tryptophan depletion using an amino acid drink that lacks tryptophan is the most commonly used method and is thought to affect serotonin within 5–7 h of ingestion. Questions remain, however, about whether either method reliably reduces brain serotonin, and about other effects including changes in brain nitrous oxide, cerebrovascular changes, reduced BDNF and amino acid imbalances that may be produced by the manipulations and might explain observed effects independent of possible changes in serotonin activity.

One meta-analysis and one systematic review fulfilled inclusion criteria (see Table 1). Data from studies involving volunteers mostly showed no effect, including a meta-analysis of parallel group studies. In a small meta-analysis of within-subject studies involving 75 people with a positive family history, a minor effect was found, with people given the active depletion showing a larger decrease in mood than those who had a sham procedure. Across both reviews, studies involving people diagnosed with depression showed slightly greater mood reduction following tryptophan depletion than sham treatment overall, but most participants had taken or were taking antidepressants and participant numbers were small.

Since these research syntheses were conducted more than 10 years ago, we searched for a systematic sample of ten recently published studies (Table 2). Eight studies conducted with healthy volunteers showed no effects of tryptophan depletion on mood, including the only two parallel group studies. One study presented effects in people with and without a family history of depression, and no differences were apparent in either group. Two cross-over studies involving people with depression and current or recent use of antidepressants showed no convincing effects of a depletion drink, although one study is reported as positive mainly due to finding an improvement in mood in the group given the sham drink.

### Applying neuroimaging ligands to study major depressive disorder [^4a816ac4]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The recent increase in radioligands available for neuroimaging major depressive disorder has led to advancements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this illness and improved antidepressant development. Major depressive disorder can be defined as an illness of recurrent major depressive episodes of persistently low mood, dysregulated sleep, appetite and weight, anhedonia, cognitive impairment, and suicidality. The main target sites investigated with radioligand neuroimaging include receptor sites that regulate in response to lowered monoamine levels, targets related to removal of monoamines, uptake of ligands related to regional brain function, and target sites of antidepressants.

### The role of neurobiologic processes in treating depression [^b3348757]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Current antidepressants work by directly affecting the neurotransmission of serotonin and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters modulate regions of the brain associated with depression and affect the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis and neuroprotection. Treatment targets for the development of future antidepressants include medications with novel mechanisms of action, such as glutamate receptor antagonists, that may alter the stress response of gene activity and provide neuroprotection to patients with depression.

### Association between a serotonin transporter promoter region polymorphism and mood response during tryptophan depletion [^2ca83454]. Molecular Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

This study investigated the relationship between depressive symptom response during tryptophan (TRP) depletion and a functional polymorphism of the promoter region of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter gene (SLC6A4).(1) Forty-three subjects in remission from a major depressive episode who underwent TRP depletion were genotyped. DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes or from cheek cells.(2) The two common alleles are designated long (l) and short (s). Depressive symptoms were measured with the 25-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).(3) There was a significant association between the l homozygous genotype and the depressive response to TRP depletion, with a significant main effect of time (F = 8.763, df = 3, 38, P = < 0.001), and time x l homozygous allele interaction (F = 3.676, df = 3, 38, P = 0.02). Individuals whose genotype predicted increased 5-HT transporter activity may be more susceptible to depressive changes in response to transient 5-HT perturbations. The use of endophenotypic markers for affective disorders such as the mood response to TRP depletion may facilitate studies of complex genetic traits such as depression by decreasing its heterogeneity.

### The association between serum lipid levels, suicide ideation, and central serotonergic activity in patients with major depressive disorder [^2a2c5347]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is some evidence that low lipid levels cause suicide in depressed patients. The purpose of this study was to identify whether low serum lipid levels are associated with suicide ideation or are correlated with central serotonin function.

Methods

Auditory processing for the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) was measured in 73 outpatients with major depressive disorder. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were administered on the same day as measurement of the LDAEP. In addition, serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured. All subjects had received antidepressant monotherapy.

Results

The depressed subjects were divided into those with and without suicide ideation according to the score for HAMD item 3 or BDI item 9. TG levels differed significantly between the two groups, whereas body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and LDAEP did not. The scores for HAMD item 3 and BDI item 9 were negatively correlated with TG levels (p = 0.045 and 0.026, respectively). The LDAEP was negatively correlated with TG levels (p = 0.012). Although there was tendency toward a negative correlation between the LDAEP and serum LDL, it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.068).

Limitations

The cross-sectional design of this study means that baseline serum lipid levels were not measured.

Conclusion

The findings of this study revealed a relationship between TG and suicide ideation that is independent of both BMI and body weight. Furthermore, serum lipid levels were associated with central serotonergic activity, as assessed using the LDAEP.

### Seasonal difference in brain serotonin transporter binding predicts symptom severity in patients with seasonal affective disorder [^8ddc418a]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional neuroimaging studies in non-depressed individuals have demonstrated an inverse relationship between daylight minutes and cerebral serotonin transporter; this relationship is modified by serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region short allele carrier status. We here present data from the first longitudinal investigation of seasonal serotonin transporter fluctuations in both patients with seasonal affective disorder and in healthy individuals. Eighty (11)C-DASB positron emission tomography scans were conducted to quantify cerebral serotonin transporter binding; 23 healthy controls with low seasonality scores and 17 patients diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder were scanned in both summer and winter to investigate differences in cerebral serotonin transporter binding across groups and across seasons. The two groups had similar cerebral serotonin transporter binding in the summer but in their symptomatic phase during winter, patients with seasonal affective disorder had higher serotonin transporter than the healthy control subjects (P = 0.01). Compared to the healthy controls, patients with seasonal affective disorder changed their serotonin transporter significantly less between summer and winter (P < 0.001). Further, the change in serotonin transporter was sex- (P = 0.02) and genotype- (P = 0.04) dependent. In the patients with seasonal affective disorder, the seasonal change in serotonin transporter binding was positively associated with change in depressive symptom severity, as indexed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - Seasonal Affective Disorder version scores (P = 0.01). Our findings suggest that the development of depressive symptoms in winter is associated with a failure to downregulate serotonin transporter levels appropriately during exposure to the environmental stress of winter, especially in individuals with high predisposition to affective disorders.media-1vid110.1093/brain/aww043_video_abstractaww043_video_abstract.

### Modulation of neuroimmune cytokine networks by antidepressants: implications in mood regulation [^fc6d5582]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly referred to as clinical depression, is a mood disorder characterized by a spectrum of persistent sense of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and a variety of physical and other emotional symptoms. MDD is the second leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) globally. As a severe condition, MDD can profoundly affect an individual's thoughts, feelings, and behavior, often necessitating professional treatment that may include therapy, pharmacological interventions, and lifestyle modifications.

Current models of MDD pathogenesis propose that it is a multifactorial condition, with at least six interrelated hypotheses that have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. These include a) the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation hypothesis, which suggests that MDD is associated with an overactive HPA axis, leading to cortisol dysregulation; b) the monoamine hypothesis, which posits that MDD is caused by a deficiency of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) in the brain; c) the genetic and epigenetic anomaly hypothesis, which implicates inherited and acquired changes in gene expression in the development of MDD; d) the brain circuit hypothesis, which suggests that MDD results from alterations in brain structure and function, particularly in areas responsible for mood regulation and cognitive function; e) the social psychological hypothesis, which considers the role of personal relationships, social support, and other psychosocial factors in the onset and course of MDD; and f) the inflammatory hypothesis, which links chronic inflammation with the pathophysiology of MDD.

### Genetic variants within the serotonin transporter associated with familial risk for major depression [^e5154237]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

The role of the serotonin transporter promoter linked polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in depression, despite much research, remains unclear. Most studies compare persons with and without depression to each other. We show offspring at high (N = 192) as compared to low (N = 101) familial risk for major depressive disorder were almost four times as likely to have two copies of the short allele at 5HTTLPR, suggesting that incorporation of family history could be helpful in identifying genetic differences.

### The GABAergic deficit hypothesis of major depressive disorder [^b7680868]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence points to an association between major depressive disorders (MDDs) and diverse types of GABAergic deficits. In this review, we summarize clinical and preclinical evidence supporting a central and causal role of GABAergic deficits in the etiology of depressive disorders. Studies of depressed patients indicate that MDDs are accompanied by reduced brain concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and by alterations in the subunit composition of the principal receptors (GABA(A) receptors) mediating GABAergic inhibition. In addition, there is abundant evidence that suggests that GABA has a prominent role in the brain control of stress, the most important vulnerability factor in mood disorders. Furthermore, preclinical evidence suggests that currently used antidepressant drugs (ADs) designed to alter monoaminergic transmission and nonpharmacological therapies may ultimately act to counteract GABAergic deficits. In particular, GABAergic transmission has an important role in the control of hippocampal neurogenesis and neural maturation, which are now established as cellular substrates of most if not all antidepressant therapies. Finally, comparatively modest deficits in GABAergic transmission in GABA(A) receptor-deficient mice are sufficient to cause behavioral, cognitive, neuroanatomical and neuroendocrine phenotypes, as well as AD response characteristics expected of an animal model of MDD. The GABAergic hypothesis of MDD suggests that alterations in GABAergic transmission represent fundamentally important aspects of the etiological sequelae of MDDs that are reversed by monoaminergic AD action.

### The association of 5-HTTLPR genotype and depressive symptoms is moderated by physical activity [^ff49a222]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

The s allele serotonin transporter polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is associated with a number of physiological mechanisms that may increase the risk of elevated depressive symptoms. However, reports of a relationship between serotonin transporter polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype and depressive symptoms have thus far been inconclusive. This heterogeneity of results suggests that other factors may be moderating the relationship between 5-HTTLPR and depressive symptoms. Higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Mechanisms responsible for this association include alterations of the serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The aim of the current study was to measure the moderating effect of physical activity on the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and depressive symptoms. Participants, ages 18–23, provided a saliva sample for DNA analysis and completed questionnaires to assess depressive symptoms and physical activity. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the moderating effect of physical activity on the relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and depressive symptoms. Analysis revealed a significant interaction between 5-HTTLPR and physical activity (p = .010). At low levels of physical activity, individuals with at least one s allele had significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms compared to ll individuals (p = .011). This finding provides preliminary support for a moderating effect of physical activity on the relationship between 5-HTTLPR and depressive symptoms.

### A requirement of serotonergic p38 α mitogen-activated protein kinase for peripheral immune system activation of CNS serotonin uptake and serotonin-linked behaviors [^4ae4f871]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depression remains the leading cause of disability worldwide. Although the etiology of depression and other mood disorders is complex, multiple studies have reported that depressed subjects display an elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (see Raison et al. for review). Experimental and/or therapeutic immune system manipulations, as with administration of cytokines or viral/bacterial mimetics such as poly I:C and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), result in mood alterations in humans. Weand others, have hypothesized that inappropriate activation of immune signaling mechanisms may also contribute to risk for mood disorders in the absence of environmental triggers. Significant evidence points to a bidirectional interaction between the immune system and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling in both the brain and periphery. Peripheral immune system stimulation and/or inflammatory cytokines have been found to modulate 5-HT neuron activation, 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT release, and alter levels and/or signaling of various 5-HT receptor subtypes.

### Novel melatonin-based therapies: potential advances in the treatment of major depression [^893c4f9a]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Major depression is one of the leading causes of premature death and disability. Although available drugs are effective, they also have substantial limitations. Recent advances in our understanding of the fundamental links between chronobiology and major mood disorders, as well as the development of new drugs that target the circadian system, have led to a renewed focus on this area. In this review, we summarise the associations between disrupted chronobiology and major depression and outline new antidepressant treatment strategies that target the circadian system. In particular, we highlight agomelatine, a melatonin-receptor agonist and selective serotonergic receptor subtype (ie, 5-HT(2C)) antagonist that has chronobiotic, antidepressant, and anxiolytic effects. In the short-term, agomelatine has similar antidepressant efficacy to venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and sertraline and, in the longer term, fewer patients on agomelatine relapse (23·9%) than do those receiving placebo (50·0%). Patients with depression treated with agomelatine report improved sleep quality and reduced waking after sleep onset. As agomelatine does not raise serotonin levels, it has less potential for the common gastrointestinal, sexual, or metabolic side-effects that characterise many other antidepressant compounds.

### Modulation of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress by targeting GPR55-new approaches in the treatment of psychiatric disorders [^7dcea124]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

A Swedish population- and a sibling-based study reported higher incidences of autoimmune diseases after exposure to traumatic or stressful events with the development of a stress-related disorder, such as PTSD. Interestingly, using SSRIs during the first year after the diagnosis of PTSD showed decreased incidences of autoimmune diseases. For major depression, a decrease of interleukin (IL)-6 serum levels based on the treatment with SSRIs has been shown before, eliciting possible anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SSRIs besides the increase of serotonin. Besides pharmacological treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy did not only decrease depressive symptoms in unmedicated first-episode women, but also reduced IL-6 baseline levels. Even if this study did not show a correlation between symptoms' severity and the IL-6 baseline levels, remission rate and variation of the IL-6 levels were correlated. Conversely, high IL-6 baseline levels in patients with depression were negatively correlated with the response to SSRIs or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), supporting the hypothesis of different subgroups with different pathomechanisms in the genesis of depressive disorders. This study suggests high IL-6 levels as a possible predictor of SSRI-/SNRI failure and shows a positive correlation between IL-6 levels and the severity of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, higher serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α as well as lower levels of brain-derived nuclear factor (BDNF), were found in depressive patients, with an association between BDNF levels and the severity of the depression.

### Serotonin transporter clustering in blood lymphocytes as a putative biomarker of therapeutic efficacy in major depressive disorder [^b0735a78]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonin transporter (SERT) binding is decreased in lymphocytes of depression patients and this decrease is partially reversed by antidepressant medication. However, recent evidence has shown that clustering of SERT on cell membranes is very important for receptor functionality. Alteration in SERT clustering on peripheral lymphocytes does not affect symptoms severity. At the most it is associated or predicts responsivity to treatment.

Methods

We collected blood samples from 38 untreated and newly diagnosed depression patients at the time of diagnosis and after 8weeks of pharmacological treatment and of 38 control subjects. We used the Hamilton Scale to quantify the level of depression in patients both before and after pharmacological treatment. We then used immunocytochemistry to assess SERT protein clusters in lymphocyte blood samples.

Results

We found an increase in SERT cluster size, but not the number of SERT clusters, in naïve depression patients compared to control subjects. Based on the distribution of SERT cluster size we differentiated the naïve depression patients into two groups (D-I and D-II). Naïve D-I and D-II patients initially showed similar Hamilton scores. However, after pharmacological treatment the D-II patients showed a greater decrease in Hamilton scores than did the D-I patients, and they had an increase in the number of SERT clusters.

Limitations

The data should be replicated in a larger cohort of patients and with a proper clinical trial.

Conclusions

We propose that SERT clustering in blood lymphocytes may be a putative biomarker for antidepressant efficacy in major depressive disorder.

### In vivo serotonin 1A receptor distribution in treatment-resistant depression [^a36687a4]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. A particular challenge arises from depressive episodes that show insufficient response to first-line treatment. The lack of response to two or more adequate psychopharmacological treatment trials is commonly referred to as treatment-resistant depression (TRD). As approved treatment options appear to be ineffective in TRD, one might also expect to find differences on a pharmacological level. With regard to the considerable economic and personal consequences of treatment-resistance, understanding the biological characteristics of this form of depression is of particular relevance.

Current models for the pathophysiology of depression consider various biopsychosocial factors, including alterations within the serotonergic system. The serotonin 1A (5-HT 1A) receptor is one of the most abundant serotonin receptors in the human brain and, thus, among the most researched subtypes. In the past, pathophysiological states and changes to its distribution in the cortex were connected to different psychiatric disorders, including MDD. Positron emission tomography (PET) has become a valuable modality for investigating pathophysiological molecular processes in psychiatric disorders in vivo. Previous studies have shown alterations of 5-HT 1A receptor binding potential in MDD patients across various brain regions, including the raphe nuclei. However, there have been inconsistencies regarding the direction of these alterations. On the one hand, a reduction in 5-HT 1A receptor availability across different limbic and cortical regions, mesiotemporal cortex and raphe nuclei was demonstrated in various cohorts of MDD patients (including in non-remitters). However, on the other hand, convincing publications report increases in cortical and subcortical regions when comparing MDD patients with healthy controls. These discrepancies were reconciled when replication studies concluded that heterogeneous outcome measures and quantification methods were the most plausible origin of the divergent findings. Still, care needs to be taken when comparing and interpreting these results.

### Dopamine in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo imaging studies [^f9d6b075]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability. Several lines of evidence implicate the dopamine system in its pathophysiology. However, the magnitude and consistency of the findings are unknown. We address this by systematically reviewing in vivo imaging evidence for dopamine measures in MDD and meta-analysing these where there are sufficient studies.

Methods:

Studies investigating the dopaminergic system using positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography in MDD and a control group were included. Demographic, clinical and imaging measures were extracted from each study, and meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results:

We identified 43 studies including 662 patients and 801 controls. Meta-analysis of 38 studies showed no difference in mean or mean variability of striatal D 2/3 receptor availability (g = 0.06, p = 0.620), or combined dopamine synthesis and release capacity (g = 0.19, p = 0.309). Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was lower in the MDD group in studies using DAT selective tracers (g = −0.56, p = 0.006), but not when tracers with an affinity for serotonin transporters were included (g = −0.21, p = 0.420). Subgroup analysis showed greater dopamine release (g = 0.49, p = 0.030), but no difference in dopamine synthesis capacity (g = −0.21, p = 0.434) in the MDD group. Striatal D 1 receptor availability was lower in patients with MDD in two studies.

Conclusions:

The meta-analysis indicates striatal DAT availability is lower, but D 2/3 receptor availability is not altered in people with MDD compared to healthy controls. There may be greater dopamine release and lower striatal D 1 receptors in MDD, although further studies are warranted. We discuss factors associated with these findings, discrepancies with preclinical literature and implications for future research.

### Association between serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) and behavioral responses to tryptophan depletion in healthy women with and without family history of depression… [^e98b89aa]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Evidence suggests that serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism–dependent low transcriptional activity of the human serotonin transporter gene may be a genetic susceptibility factor for depression. We studied the behavioral responses to tryptophan depletion in healthy women with and without a first-degree family history of depression and examined the relationship to 5HTTLPR alleles. Finally, s/l subjects without family history showed a mood response that was intermediate between the s/s and l/l subjects, while s/l subjects with a family history of depression showed the same depressiogenic effect of TD as seen in the s/s subjects. Conclusions The results of the present study suggest that the s-allele of the 5HTTLPR and a positive family history of depression are additive risk factors for the development of depression during TD. There is now substantial evidence suggesting that altered brain serotonergic transmission plays a key role in the development of depression.

1 Altered serotonin system indexes, including lower plasma tryptophan levels, 2, 3 reduced cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels, 4 decreased platelet serotonin uptake, 5 and blunted neuroendocrine responses in challenge studies of different serotonin receptors suggesting decreased brain serotonin responsiveness, 6–9 have been reported in depressed patients relative to healthy control subjects. Moreover, brain imaging studies suggest widespread impairment of serotonergic function in depression. 10, 11. We hypothesized that women with a positive first-degree FH of depression will experience a transient lowering of their mood during TD, in contrast to women without a positive first-degree FH of depression.

On the basis of the evidence that the s-allele of the 5HTTLPR is associated with reduced 5-HTT functions, we tested the hypothesis that women carrying the s/s and s/l genotypes are more vulnerable to the mood-lowering effects of TD and thus will show more pronounced behavioral responses. Conclusively, the s-allele of the 5HTTLPR and a positive FH of depression appear to be additive risk factors for the development of depression during TD. Studies assessing mood responses to TD in healthy subjects without an FH of affective disorders suggest a greater risk for women to develop depressive symptoms during TD. 54, 57 However, these findings remain controversial and could not be replicated by others. 58–60 Altogether, these studies and the present findings suggest that responses to lowered tryptophan availability may reveal a genetic vulnerability to depression in some individuals.

### Effects of genetic and early environmental risk factors for depression on serotonin transporter expression and methylation profiles [^6895e08e]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) has been implicated in moderating the link between life stress and depression. However, respective molecular pathways of gene-environment (GxE) interaction are largely unknown. Sustained alterations in SERT gene expression profiles, possibly mediated by epigenetic modifications, are a frequent correlate of depression and may thus constitute a putative mediator of GxE interaction. Here, we aimed to investigate joint effects of 5-HTTLPR and self-reported environmental adversity throughout the lifespan (prenatal, early and recent stress/trauma) on in vivo SERT mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells. To further evaluate whether environmentally induced changes in SERT expression are mediated by epigenetic modifications, we analyzed 83 CpG sites within a 799-bp promoter-associated CpG island of the SERT gene using the highly sensitive method of bisulfite pyrosequencing. Participants were 133 healthy young adults. Our findings show that both the 5-HTTLPR S allele and maternal prenatal stress/child maltreatment are associated with reduced in vivo SERT mRNA expression in an additive manner. Remarkably, individuals carrying both the genetic and the environmental risk factors exhibited 32.8% (prenatal stress) and 56.3% (child maltreatment) lower SERT mRNA levels compared with those without any risk factor. Our data further indicated that changes in SERT mRNA levels were unlikely to be mediated by DNA methylation profiles within the SERT CpG island. It is thus conceivable that the persistent changes in SERT expression may in turn relate to altered serotonergic functioning and possibly convey differential disease vulnerability associated with 5-HTTLPR and early adversity.

### Serotonin versus catecholamine deficiency: behavioral and neural effects of experimental depletion in remitted depression [^1f38f4a6]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The current study had several limitations that merit comment. The study sample was relatively small and contained a majority of female subjects. We took this into account by including a regressor for gender in each analysis and by repeating all analyses with female subjects only. In addition, PET imaging of glucose metabolism did not specifically assess central serotonin or catecholamine concentrations. Instead, we assessed the central effect of TD indirectly by measuring plasma total and free tryptophan levels and the central effect of CD by assessing serum prolactin levels, which is the standard method to assess the effect of central CD. A preferable design would have been a within-subjects design, whereby all participants underwent both depletion procedures. However, the two experiments took place at the same scanning site and used the same PET imaging procedure for both the TD and the CD studies, increasing the comparability of the two studies. In addition, an analysis of between-subject variance between TD and CD during the placebo condition did not reveal any significant differences. Finally, a noninvasive method for comparing the depth of CD versus TD within the brain is not available. Given the similar amount of depressive symptoms induced by both methods and the similar effect of both methods on metabolism in at least some brain structures, we assumed that TD and CD, as used in our study, were comparable regarding the hypotheses we aimed to test.

Taken together, these data suggest that serotonin and catecholamines have both common and distinct roles in the neurobiology of depressive symptoms. This study further suggests that the development of psychopathological and neuronal markers predicting response to selective monoamine inhibition may be feasible. Finally, this study provides a rationale for the use of antidepressants with primary pharmacological actions involving both serotonergic and catecholaminergic mechanisms in some patients.

### Blood transcriptomic signatures associated with depression, or the risk for depression, in pregnant women from the psychiatry research and motherhood-depression (PRAM-D) study [^a48072ad]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the AIM2 inflammasome-related pathway, an increased activity of the inflammasomes machineries has been previously correlated with severity of depression in patients, albeit mostly in the context of the NLRP3-dependent inflammasome, the most studied and best characterized inflammasome component, though a previous study has reported AIM2 to be the most abundant in neurons. In line with our results, a previous study analysing gene expression in peripheral blood from individuals with depressive symptoms as compared with controls found higher mRNA levels of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC, even if AIM2 expression levels were not different between groups. Of note, the increased mRNA levels of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC were driven by the expression levels found in those individuals with moderate depressive symptoms, as opposed to those with severe symptoms, and our sample of history-only women also showed slightly higher levels of depressive symptoms, compared with controls (Table 1). Therefore, although the aforementioned study has not been conducted in pregnant women, some common ground in the level of symptomatology in the groups of the two studies can be observed, and the results are comparable, suggesting that inflammasomes could be implicated in the vulnerability to depressive disorders.

Regarding the kynurenine pathway (Figure S4), the observed upregulation of the gene expression of the central enzyme kynureninase (KYNU) indicates an activation of this mechanism and suggests the possible increase in the levels of the kynurenine metabolites (e.g. quinolinic acid, kynurenine, 3OH-anthranilic acid, and 3OHkynurenine), which are pro-inflammatory and neuro-toxic molecules, with depressogenic effects. Concurrently, the increased metabolism of the precursor tryptophan through this pathway, decreases the availability of this amino-acid to be metabolized for the synthesis of serotonin, thereby lowering the levels of this neurotransmitter. Both increased activity of kynurenine-linked enzymes, as well as decreased levels of serotonin, are known correlates of a higher risk of developing depression and have also been associated with depressive symptoms in the peripartum.
