## Question

Is NPO status required for patients with gastroparesis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether NPO (nil per os) status is required as part of routine management for gastroparesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what current guidelines define as first-line nutritional management in gastroparesis. Then, I should verify when and how we escalate beyond oral intake. Next, I will examine whether "gastric rest" implies routine NPO. After that, I need to distinguish peri-procedural fasting from disease management. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and state a clear conclusion with practical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: standard care in gastroparesis prioritizes maintaining nutrition via the oral route with dietary modification, not withholding oral intake. I need to ensure I quote the right sources here; ACG 2022 recommends a small-particle, low-fat dietary approach to facilitate symptom relief and gastric emptying, and ACG 2013 explicitly prefers the oral route for nutrition and hydration as first-line, which argues against routine NPO as a baseline strategy [^113XaXsK] [^116wXKdJ] [^113F2ZH4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does any high-credibility source actually recommend routine NPO for day-to-day disease management? I should double-check the major guidelines. ACG 2013 and 2022 emphasize dietary modifications to enable oral intake; the UEG/ESNM 2021 consensus similarly reserves non-oral nutrition for severe cases with weight loss or intractable vomiting, and none endorse routine NPO outside of specific contexts, so routine NPO is not recommended as a management principle [^116wXKdJ] [^113XaXsK] [^117BAWU4].

> Next, I will examine the escalation pathway if oral intake fails. I need to confirm the sequence: guidelines advise stepwise escalation to enteral nutrition when oral intake is inadequate, preferring postpyloric delivery over gastric because gastric feeding can be erratic, with jejunal access considered after a short nasoenteric trial and parenteral nutrition rarely required; a large prospective registry also shows only a small subset require EN or PN, underscoring that most patients remain on oral nutrition [^113fwWLa] [^111Jmf2w] [^111SLuNp] [^116wXKdJ] [^11458RC4].

> But wait, what about the term "gastric rest" — doesn't that mean NPO? I should verify how "gastric rest" is used clinically. Therapeutic gastric rest refers to temporary postpyloric feeding via a nasoduodenal tube for roughly three months in decompensated, refractory cases (grade III) with the explicit goal of subsequently reintroducing oral intake; that is not routine NPO, it is targeted, time-limited bypass with planned return to eating, and only a minority of severe patients proceed to long-term jejunal access afterward [^111b2yts] [^11458RC4] [^114taAZh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost used evidence about eliminating pre-procedural fasting from cardiology to generalize away from NPO in gastroparesis — let me reconsider. That coronary intervention experience highlights a broader procedural trend but is not disease-specific; the correct distinction is that peri-procedural fasting is an anesthesia/sedation practice rather than a chronic disease management strategy. For gastroparesis-specific procedures like G-POEM, short perioperative NPO is standard procedural care in expert centers, but this does not imply chronic NPO for the disease itself, and G-POEM shows only modest overall effectiveness in refractory patients [^114H2ZRq] [^114SRoNz] [^115WT8iR].

> I should confirm supportive measures that further argue against routine NPO. When solids are poorly tolerated, guidelines recommend progression to small-particle or liquid nutrient meals to preserve oral intake; in addition, reviewing and discontinuing drugs that slow gastric emptying (e.g., pramlintide, GLP-1 receptor agonists) and optimizing glycemic control in diabetes can improve tolerance, again favoring continued, adapted oral feeding rather than withholding by mouth [^113XaXsK] [^117BAWU4] [^112s3xye] [^11571cZg] [^111t1qF5].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy to ensure I am not missing a nuance. First-line management is modified oral diet; if inadequate, a trial of postpyloric enteral feeding is considered, with jejunal access if necessary, and parenteral nutrition as a last resort for rare situations where enteral routes fail; at no step is routine NPO recommended as a chronic disease strategy, reinforcing that patients should eat with appropriate modifications whenever possible [^113XaXsK] [^116wXKdJ] [^111EkcaT] [^11458RC4].

> Finally, I will state the conclusion clearly. Routine NPO is not required for patients with gastroparesis; in fact, it conflicts with evidence-based priorities to maintain nutrition via adapted oral intake, using stepwise escalation to postpyloric enteral nutrition only when necessary and reserving parenteral nutrition for rare, refractory cases; temporary "gastric rest" with nasoduodenal feeding is a targeted intervention for severe decompensation with planned reintroduction of oral intake, and perioperative NPO applies only around procedures, not day-to-day management [^113F2ZH4] [^113XaXsK] [^116wXKdJ] [^111b2yts] [^11458RC4].

> One last check for clinical exceptions so I do not overstate the rule. If a patient has a different pathology such as malignant bowel obstruction, acute surgical abdomen, or an aspiration risk scenario, temporary NPO may be indicated on those grounds, but that is outside the routine management of uncomplicated gastroparesis, where the standard is to encourage and adapt oral intake rather than to withhold it [^1163LUKQ] [^113F2ZH4] [^113XaXsK].

---

No, gastroparesis patients do not need to be **NPO by default** [^113XaXsK]. NPO is only indicated for **severe, refractory symptoms** [^111EkcaT] (intractable vomiting, high aspiration risk, or before procedures). Routine care emphasizes **oral intake first** with small, low-fat, low-fiber meals [^11179FuE]; if oral intake is inadequate, use enteral nutrition [^116wXKdJ], and reserve parenteral nutrition [^11458RC4] for rare cases [^111SLuNp]. Prolonged NPO increases malnutrition [^111EkcaT] and dehydration risk, so reintroduce oral intake as soon as feasible.

---

## Indications for NPO status in gastroparesis

NPO is **not routine** in gastroparesis; reserve it for specific clinical scenarios [^116wXKdJ]:

- **Severe, refractory symptoms**: Intractable vomiting, severe nausea, or high aspiration risk may require temporary NPO [^113mAdQb] [^111EkcaT].

- **Procedures**: Preoperative or procedural fasting is indicated to reduce aspiration risk during anesthesia or sedation.

- **Acute exacerbations**: Short-term NPO may be used during acute flares with severe symptoms, then reintroduce oral intake as soon as feasible.

---

## Risks associated with prolonged NPO status

Prolonged NPO in gastroparesis carries **significant risks** [^116LYRS8]:

- **Malnutrition**: Delayed gastric emptying already limits intake; prolonged NPO worsens nutritional deficits [^116LYRS8] [^111EkcaT].

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Reduced oral intake increases dehydration and electrolyte disturbances [^111SLuNp].

- **Reduced quality of life**: Extended NPO worsens symptoms and quality of life.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

The focus is on **maintaining nutrition and hydration**:

- **Oral intake first**: Small, frequent, low-fat, low-fiber meals are first-line dietary management [^11179FuE] [^113XaXsK].

- **Enteral nutrition**: Use enteral nutrition [^116wXKdJ] (preferably postpyloric) [^113fwWLa] if oral intake is inadequate.

- **Parenteral nutrition**: Reserve for rare cases [^111SLuNp] when enteral nutrition is not feasible [^115Sixjh] [^11458RC4].

- **Symptom-targeted therapy**: Use prokinetics and antiemetics [^113mAdQb] to enable oral intake.

---

## Clinical scenarios where NPO may be necessary

Severe, refractory symptoms — such as intractable vomiting, severe nausea, or high aspiration risk — may warrant **temporary NPO** [^111EkcaT], generally short term until symptoms are controlled. Preoperative or procedural fasting is indicated to reduce aspiration risk during anesthesia or sedation, with duration determined by procedural guidelines. Acute exacerbations may likewise require short-term NPO until symptoms stabilize.

---

## Alternative nutritional strategies

When **oral intake is inadequate**, consider **enteral nutrition** [^116wXKdJ] — preferably postpyloric (nasojejunal or jejunostomy) rather than gastric feeding [^113fwWLa] — and reserve **parenteral nutrition** for situations where enteral nutrition is not feasible [^111SLuNp].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with gastroparesis **do not require routine NPO** [^113XaXsK]; reserve it for severe symptoms, aspiration risk, or procedures [^111EkcaT]. Because prolonged NPO increases risks of malnutrition and dehydration [^116LYRS8], prioritize oral intake [^11179FuE], then enteral nutrition [^116wXKdJ], and reserve parenteral nutrition for rare cases [^111SLuNp]. Reintroduce oral intake promptly to maintain nutrition and hydration.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^115Sixjh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is identified in clinical practice through the recognition of clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain.

Management of gastroparesis should include assessment and correction of nutritional state, relief of symptoms, improvement of gastric emptying, and glycemic control in diabetic patients. Patient nutritional state should be managed by oral dietary modifications. If oral intake is inadequate, then enteral nutrition via a jejunostomy tube should be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely required, but may be necessary when hydration and nutritional state cannot be maintained. Medical treatment involves prokinetic and antiemetic therapies.

Approved treatment options, such as metoclopramide and gastric electrical stimulation (GES, approved on a humanitarian device exemption), do not adequately address clinical needs. Antiemetics have not been specifically tested in gastroparesis, but they may relieve nausea and vomiting. Other medications aimed at symptom relief include unapproved medications or off-label indications, such as domperidone, erythromycin (primarily for short-term use), and centrally acting antidepressants used as symptom modulators. GES may relieve symptoms, including weekly vomiting frequency and the need for nutritional supplementation, based on open-label studies. Second-line approaches include several other therapeutic modalities.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^115PZLPT]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Based on literature data, approximately 30% of gastroparesis patients progress to grade III (decompensated) gastroparesis, of which the majority eventually need long-term enteral tube feeding. In our hands, only 19 of 86 patients (22%) progressed to grade III. We have chosen the placement of PEG-J with fixation of the tip of the tube in the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum. Alternative procedures include jejunostomies, either placed via surgery, radiology, or endoscopy. The surgical approach is known for higher complication rates, and experience with (direct) PEJ (percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy) and percutaneous radiologic jejunostomy (PRJ) in gastroparesis is limited. In a study assessing the effect of surgical jejunostomy in diabetic gastroparesis, symptom relief was seen in 39% and improved nutritional status in 56%. No data on the efficacy of nasojejunal feeding or the effect of dietary treatment on weight in gastroparesis patients were published earlier. Our choice in favor of the PEG-J procedure with duodenal extension and fixation is based on the local expertise of our PEG team and outpatient PEG support.

- **Additional therapeutic entities**: Botulinum toxin injections were performed at our center during the period these patients were included. Some patients had been treated with botulinum toxin (22/86). However, botulinum toxin therapy was not the primary focus of our analysis. Additionally, this therapy is not recommended by guidelines due to a questionable response when compared to placebo.

### Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) for refractory gastroparesis: results from an international prospective trial [^115WT8iR]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Although gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) is considered a promising technique for the management of refractory gastroparesis, high-quality evidence is limited. We prospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of G-POEM in unselected patients with refractory gastroparesis.

In five tertiary centers, patients with symptomatic gastroparesis refractory to standard medical therapy and confirmed by impaired gastric emptying were included. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined as at least one score decrease in the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) with a ≥ 25% decrease in two subscales, at 12 months. The GCSI score and subscales, adverse events (AEs), and the 36-Item Short Form questionnaire of quality of life were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after G-POEM. A gastric emptying study was performed before and 3 months after the procedure.

Of the 80 enrolled patients, 75 patients (94%) completed the 12-month follow-up. Clinical success at 12 months was 56% (95% CI, 44.8 to 66.7). The GCSI score, including subscales, improved moderately after G-POEM. A baseline total GCSI > 2.6 (OR = 3.23, p = 0.04) and baseline gastric retention > 20% at 4 hours (OR = 3.65, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of clinical success at 12 months, as was an early response to G-POEM at 1 month after therapy (OR = 8.75, p < 0.001). Mild procedure-related AEs occurred in 5 (6%) patients.

In conclusion, G-POEM is a safe procedure but showed only modest overall effectiveness in the treatment of refractory gastroparesis. Further studies are warranted to fully assess its benefits.

### Gastroparesis: Clinical update [^115mPTuv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis refers to chronically abnormal gastric motility characterized by symptoms suggestive of mechanical obstruction and delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It may be idiopathic or attributable to neuropathic or myopathic abnormalities, such as diabetes mellitus, postvagotomy, postviral infection, and scleroderma. Dietary and behavioral modification, prokinetic drugs, and surgical interventions have been used in managing patients with gastroparesis. Although mild gastroparesis is usually well managed with these treatment options, severe gastroparesis may be very difficult to control and may require referral to a specialist center if symptoms are intractable despite pharmacological therapy and dietetic support. New advances in drug therapy, botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electrical stimulation techniques have been introduced and might provide new hope to patients with refractory gastroparesis. This article critically reviews the advances in the field from the perspective of the clinician.

### Nutritional approaches for gastroparesis [^116LYRS8]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with gastroparesis often exhibit symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, and early satiety, which can lead to inadequate food intake and a high risk of malnutrition. There is a notable scarcity of data on nutritional strategies for gastroparesis, resulting in practices that rely on extrapolated evidence. Some approaches include modifying food composition, consistency, and volume in the context of delayed gastric emptying. If patients are unable to consume sufficient calories through a solid food diet, stepwise nutritional interventions might incorporate liquid meals, oral nutrition supplements, enteral nutrition, and parenteral nutrition. This review discusses the role, rationale, and evidence of diverse nutritional interventions in the management of gastroparesis.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^111b2yts]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

- **Gastric rest (GR)**: A total of 36 patients (non-responders to DP) were treated with three months of gastric rest by nasoduodenal tube feeding after insufficient response with DP. Enteral tube feeding was well tolerated by all patients. Only in case of complaints, tube position was checked.

- **Outcomes of GR**: A total of 17 patients (47%, group III) responded well to GR; these patients were able to discontinue enteral feeding after three months and successfully re-introduced oral intake (in a slow and stepwise manner, gradually increasing calories as tolerated). Oral intake was combined with medication such as prokinetics (erythromycin, domperidone, and metoclopramide) in 65% of patients. Objective weight gain in GR symptom responders was 2.5 kg (P = 0.018 compared to pretreatment).

The other 19 patients (53%, group IV) were non-responders, unable to discontinue enteral feeding and resume complete oral feeding. These 19 patients also had a weight gain of, on average, 2.1 kg (P = 0.027) after three months of GR. Weight change and weight before and after treatment were not statistically different amongst responders and non-responders to GR (resp. P = 0.433 and P = 0.531).

- **Complications of GR**: In the 3 months of GR, complications included occlusion of the nasoduodenal tube in three patients (8%) and nasopharyngeal irritation in two patients (5.5%), resulting in tube replacement.

- **Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy with jejunal extension (PEG-J)**: The 19 patients (22% of the total of 86 patients, group IV) with insufficient symptomatic response…

### Rome Foundation and international neurogastroenterology and motility societies' consensus on idiopathic gastroparesis [^1144JK9D]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

To establish a consensus on the definition and management of idiopathic gastroparesis, international experts, selected by neurogastroenterology and motility societies and initiated by the Rome Foundation, devised 144 statements using the Delphi method, with at least 80% agreement required. This consensus defined idiopathic gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms. Frequently co-existing symptoms are early satiation and postprandial fullness. Diagnosis requires the presence of these symptoms alongside delayed gastric emptying, measured by a 4-hour scintigraphy or gastric emptying breath test of a mixed composition meal, in the absence of mechanical obstruction.

- **Therapeutic options**: Proven options were sparse. Dietary adjustments, nutritional support (per guidelines from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism for substantial weight loss or intractable vomiting), and opioid cessation were recommended by consensus opinion. Antiemetic and prokinetic agents were also considered potentially beneficial. This consensus offers a global perspective on idiopathic gastroparesis.

### Pre-procedural fasting for coronary interventions: is it time to change practice [^115ijmb1]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Traditionally, patients are kept nil-per-os/nil-by-mouth (NPO/NBM) prior to invasive cardiac procedures, yet there exists neither evidence nor clear guidance about the benefits of this practice.

- **Objectives**: To demonstrate that percutaneous cardiac catheterization does not require prior fasting.

- **Methods**: The data source is a retrospective analysis of a data registry of consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable angina at two district general hospitals in the UK with no on-site cardiac surgery services.

- **Results**: A total of 1916 PCI procedures were performed over a 3-year period. None of the patients were kept NPO/NBM prior to their coronary procedures. The mean age was 67 ± 16 years. Out of these, 1349 (70%) were men; 38.5% (738/1916) had chronic stable angina, while the rest had ACS. Moreover, 21% (398/1916) were diabetics while 53% (1017/1916) were hypertensive. PCI was technically successful in 95% (1821/1916) of patients. A transradial approach was used in 88.5% (1697/1916) of cases. Notably, 77% (570/738) of elective PCI patients were discharged within 6 hours post-procedure. No patients required emergency endotracheal intubation, and there were no occurrences of intraprocedural or postprocedural aspiration pneumonia.

- **Conclusions**: Our observational study demonstrates that patients undergoing PCI do not need to be fasted prior to their procedures.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^117VTWkh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Of primary interest was the effect of the interventions (diet and prokinetics; intraduodenal tube feeding with gastric rest; PEG‐J) on subjective treatment response, determined according to the Global Physician Assessment Scale 36, 37 (GPA 1: complete relief; GPA 2: marked relief; GPA 3: moderate relief; GPA 4: slight relief; GPA 5: no relief; GPA 6: worsening symptoms), based on the clinical effect reported by the patient during visits to the outpatient department. GPA score was documented four weeks after onset of treatment. Reported complete and marked relief (GPA 1‐2) was considered as a successful treatment response (responders). In case treatment was considered not successful (based on repeated symptom scores), patients were classified as non‐responders and were offered the next step of treatment. Preferably, each medication was tested for at least a four‐week period. Gastric rest with nasoduodenal feeding was given for three months. PEG‐J treatment was evaluated regularly, with objective outcomes measured after six months.

Other parameters assessed included the effect on body weight (BMI). In this respect, interruption of weight loss or an increase in weight were considered as treatment success, whereas persistent weight loss was considered as treatment failure.

Success rates of the treatments, occurrence of complications, and of side effects were monitored.

- **Statistical methods**: Data analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, version 23 (IBM Corporation). Normal distribution was tested for continuous variables. Non‐parametric tests were used.

### Gastroparesis: A review of current diagnosis and treatment options [^114agJGR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GP) is a chronic neuromuscular disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of GP is not well described; however, the number of individuals affected by symptoms of GP in the United States is estimated to be over 4 million. The etiology of GP is diverse. Approximately 25% of cases are associated with diabetes, whereas nearly 50% are classified as idiopathic; many of these latter cases likely represent a postinfectious process. Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, prior gastric surgery, ischemia, and medications make up the vast majority of the remaining cases.

The pathophysiology of GP is also diverse. Abnormalities in fundic tone, antroduodenal dyscoordination, a weak antral pump, gastric dysrhythmias, and abnormal duodenal feedback all contribute to delays in gastric emptying and symptom expression. Characteristic symptoms of GP include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of GP is made using a combination of characteristic symptoms in conjunction with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment options include dietary modification, medications to accelerate gastric emptying, antiemetic agents, gastric electrical stimulation, and surgery.

In the following sections we will provide an overview of the health care impact of GP, describe the underlying pathophysiology, and review treatment options using an evidence-based approach.

This editorial addresses the importance of diabetic gastroparesis as a marker of poor glycemic control, other vascular complications, and suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Highlighting the need to prevent and manage gastroparesis, it explores why the condition has not received its due share of attention. Complexities in screening, diagnosis, and management all contribute to the lack of focus on this autonomic neuropathy. The editorial reinforces the need to enhance awareness about diabetic gastroparesis and utilize good clinical sense and rational prescription writing to limit the impact of this complication.

### Management of the patient with gastroparesis [^116EcTn3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis may be related to a variety of underlying disorders, but management options are fairly universal. Dietary measures and pharmacologic agents, primarily in the form of prokinetic medications, form the foundation of standard management. Some patients will have refractory symptoms, and alternative dosing schemes or drug combinations may be used. Occasionally, a patient will still require venting gastrostomy and/or jejunal feeding.

This review addresses the standard dietary and pharmacologic approaches to gastroparesis, as well as issues pertaining to gastrostomy/jejunostomy tubes and surgical options for refractory cases. Finally, experimental agents and techniques, such as gastric pacing, will be discussed.

### ACG clinical guideline: Gastroparesis [^113F2ZH4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Gastroparesis is characterized by symptoms suggesting retention of food in the stomach with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction in the gastric outflow. This condition is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. These guidelines summarize perspectives on the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis in adults, including dietary, pharmacological, device, and interventions directed at the pylorus, and they represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology.

The scientific evidence for these guidelines was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. When the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, expert consensus was used to develop key concept statements. These guidelines should be considered as preferred but are not the only approaches to these conditions.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with gastroparesis using enteral and/or exclusive parenteral nutrition [^11458RC4]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Patients with gastroparesis (Gp) may need enteral nutrition (EN) or exclusive parenteral nutrition (PN). Among patients with Gp, we aimed to identify the frequency of EN and exclusive PN use and explore characteristics of patients using EN and/or exclusive PN compared with those using oral nutrition (ON), including changes over 48 weeks.

- **Methods**: Patients with Gp underwent history and physical examination, gastric emptying scintigraphy, water load satiety testing (WLST), and questionnaires assessing gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life (QOL). Patients were observed for 48 weeks.

- **Results**: Of 971 patients with Gp (idiopathic: 579; diabetic: 336; post-Nissen fundoplication: 51), 939 (96.7%) were using ON only, 14 (1.4%) using exclusive PN, and 18 (1.9%) using EN. Compared with patients receiving ON, those receiving exclusive PN and/or EN were younger, had a lower body mass index, and exhibited greater symptom severity. Patients receiving exclusive PN and/or EN had lower physical QOL but not mental QOL or Gp-related QOL scores. They also ingested less water during WLST but did not have worse gastric emptying. Of those who had been receiving exclusive PN and/or EN, 50% and 25%, respectively, resumed ON at the 48-week follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: This study describes patients with Gp requiring exclusive PN and/or EN for nutrition support, representing a small (3.3%) but important subset of patients with Gp. Unique clinical and physiological parameters are associated with this subset and provide insight into the use of nutrition support.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: Principles and current trends in management [^117Hnu49]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

The process of gastric emptying is a result of the integration of tonic contractions of the fundus, phasic contractions of the antrum, and the inhibitory forces of pyloric and duodenal contractions. This complex process requires interactions between smooth muscle, enteric and autonomic nerves, and specialized pacemaker cells known as the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC).

The emptying of the reservoir is driven by two mechanisms: a tonic contraction of the fundus and peristaltic waves (phasic contractions) moving over the distal part of the gastric body and antrum. These two forces constitute the pump of the gastric reservoir. Cholinergic enteric neurons, which are under modulatory vagal tone, stimulate both peristaltic waves and tonic contractions of the reservoir. In the region of the body of the stomach, peristaltic waves result in only a small circular constriction.

Peristaltic waves originate at the proximal stomach and propagate to the pylorus. Electrical waves from the gastric wall form the basis of these peristaltic waves. A network of interstitial cells — called the ICC — exists in the wall of both the stomach and the small intestine. These cells produce electrical pacesetter potentials due to oscillations in their membrane potential. The pacesetter potential of the ICC drives electrical events in smooth muscle cells, where they are reflected as slow waves.

### Diabetic gastroparesis: Therapeutic options [^114p7CQd]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is characterized by a failure of normal gastric motility and emptying. The delay in gastric emptying leads to considerable morbidity due to nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and stomach fullness. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are frequently associated with abnormal gastric motility and are recognized causes of gastroparesis. The relationship between delayed gastric emptying and symptoms is variable, and individuals with delayed gastric emptying may be asymptomatic. Cross-sectional studies show that around 30%–50% of those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes exhibit delayed gastric emptying.

Paradoxically, however, in the early stages of type 2 diabetes, there may be an accelerated phase of gastric emptying and enhanced proximal contraction, resulting in nausea in individuals without overt neuropathy. Diabetic gastroparesis (DG) is a cause of significant morbidity, manifesting as nausea and vomiting in only a small minority of patients, while in others it may present simply as unpredictable hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia with overall deranged glycemic control. Thus, the phenomenon of "gastric hypoglycemia" is well-documented and may be an important cause of unexplained hypoglycemia in those classified as having brittle diabetes.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^111ATWob]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A procedural success rate of 100% was found in our study for both gastroduodenal tube placement and PEG-J, which is comparable to literature rates. In three months of nasoduodenal feeding (GR), occlusion of the tube and nasal irritation occurred at relatively low rates (8% and 5.5% respectively). Patients were able to accept the NJ fairly well because they agreed to a three-month period in advance. Additionally, patients were informed that PEG-J placement is a procedure generally associated with more risks and complications than an NJ tube. The NJ tube is fairly thin, which may have contributed to good tolerability.

Dislocation is the major disadvantage of PEG-J and occurred in 32% of patients, which aligns with literature data ranging from 25.2% to 55.9%. No occlusion occurred, which is described in 3.5%-35% of patients with PEG-J.

Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. Firstly, it is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Over the eight-year period, we did not systematically collect all patient-reported outcome measures or systematically characterize psychological factors and psychiatric comorbidities. Secondly, we serve as a tertiary referral center. Therefore, a small percentage (9%) of the scintigraphic data were collected in other centers with different protocols and normal values, and were therefore not eligible for statistical comparison. However, we believe these are reliable in diagnosing gastroparesis.

Antroduodenal manometry results were only taken into account with respect to antral…

### Acupuncture for symptomatic gastroparesis [^112MtLxs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis, a state of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach, significantly impacts people's daily function and quality of life when symptomatic. Treatment options rely on limited evidence of benefits. Acupuncture is widely used to manage gastrointestinal disorders, although its role in people with symptomatic gastroparesis is unclear. Therefore, a systematic review of the evidence was undertaken.

- **Objective**: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture in comparison with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, or other non-pharmacological active interventions for symptom management in people with gastroparesis.

- **Search methods**: On 26 March 2018, searches were conducted in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, AMED, Korean medical databases (including Korean Studies Information, DBPIA, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Centre for Health Database, KoreaMed, and the National Assembly Library), and Chinese databases (including the China Academic Journal). Additionally, two clinical trials registries were searched for ongoing trials. No language limitations were imposed.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials comparing the penetrating type of acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, and other non-pharmacological active interventions for people with symptomatic gastroparesis of any etiology (i.e. surgical, diabetic, or idiopathic) were selected.

### Epidemiology and outcomes of gastroparesis, as documented in general practice records, in the United Kingdom [^11348VHM]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

We found that the majority of patients with gastroparesis in the CPRD were overweight or obese. Contrary to previous beliefs, this evidence from a real-world setting suggests that the chronic nausea and vomiting associated with gastroparesis may not always lead to weight loss. The coexistence of obesity should, therefore, not preclude consideration of gastroparesis as a potential cause of upper GI symptoms, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.

To put these results in context, the mean BMI among patients with gastroparesis in the Olmsted County study was 24.9 ± 6.8 versus 27.2 ± 8.1 in the CPRD. A higher proportion of patients with type 2 diabetic gastroparesis in the CPRD were overweight or obese compared to those with type 1 diabetic gastroparesis or idiopathic gastroparesis. Given the association of obesity with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, this is perhaps not surprising. However, our observation that approximately 50% of patients with idiopathic gastroparesis were also overweight or obese supports data reported by the NIH Consortium in the United States.

On further investigation, Parkman et al. concluded that patients with idiopathic gastroparesis consume and expend fewer calories than healthy controls and postulated that weight gain could be possible in the presence of less severe symptoms. Without information on the severity of symptoms, we are unable to address this hypothesis in CPRD, and further research is required.

Other than underlying patient factors, the structure of the UK healthcare system may partially contribute to the difference.

### Medical and surgical management of gastroparesis: A systematic review [^113jXfb5]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis (GPS) is a rare disease with multiple etiologies that results in delayed gastric emptying. Diagnosis of GPS can be challenging due to its rather complex clinical presentation. Pharmacologic refractory cases require surgical interventions, all of which have yet to be standardized and characterized.

- **Objectives**: We present a review of the literature and provide an update on therapies for patients with GPS.

- **Setting**: Department of General Surgery, Academic Hospital, United States.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase of English-written articles published in the last 38 years, with an advanced title search of "gastroparesis management". Other keywords included "surgical management" and "refractory gastroparesis". Further references were obtained through cross-reference.

- **Results**: A total of 12,250 articles were selected after eliminating duplicates. Following thorough screening of selection criteria, 68 full-text articles were included for review.

- **Conclusion**: GPS is a challenging disease to manage. Nutritional support must remain the primary approach, followed by either medical or surgical treatment modalities if necessary. In patients with refractory gastroparesis, adjunctive therapies have been proposed as promising long-term options.

### United European Gastroenterology (UEG) and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) consensus on gastroparesis [^111iLXk7]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by epigastric symptoms and delayed gastric emptying (GE) rate in the absence of any mechanical obstruction. The condition presents challenges in clinical practice due to the lack of guidance concerning diagnosis and management of gastroparesis.

- **Methods**: A Delphi consensus was undertaken by 40 experts from 19 European countries who conducted a literature summary and a voting process on 89 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as ≥ 80% agreement) was reached for 25 statements.

- **Results**: The European consensus defined gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed GE in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms, often coexisting with postprandial distress syndrome symptoms of dyspepsia. The true epidemiology of gastroparesis is not well known in detail, but diabetes, gastric surgery, certain neurological and connective tissue diseases, and the use of certain drugs are recognized as risk factors. While the panel agreed that severely impaired gastric motor function is present in these patients, there was no consensus on the underlying pathophysiology. The panel agreed that an upper endoscopy and a GE test are required for diagnosis. Only dietary therapy, dopamine-2 antagonists, and 5-HT4 receptor agonists were considered appropriate therapies, in addition to nutritional support in cases of severe weight loss. No consensus was reached on the use of proton pump inhibitors.

### The epidemiology and burden of gastroparesis: Real-world data from a large healthcare provider in Israel [^1153GSbJ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a gastrointestinal motility dysfunction characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of gastric mechanical obstruction. Data on the epidemiology of gastroparesis are sparse, even though the condition substantially impairs patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and estimate the short-term healthcare resource use burden of gastroparesis in a large population.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study utilized computerized data from Maccabi Healthcare Services, a 2.5-million member state-mandated health organization in Israel. Data were collected between 2003 and 2018 to assess the prevalence of gastroparesis. Definite gastroparesis was defined by gastroparesis diagnosis and gastric emptying test. Probable gastroparesis was defined by gastroparesis diagnosis only. To compare the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), data were also collected on controls that were individually matched (1:2) for age, sex, and comorbidities.

- **Key results**: A total of 522 patients with gastroparesis were identified (21.1 per 100,000 WHO age-standardized), including 204 with definite gastroparesis (8.6 per 100,000 WHO). The male-to-female ratio was 1:2, and the mean ± SD age was 54.7 ± 17.1 years. Diabetes accounted for 25.9% of gastroparesis cases, and the rest were idiopathic. Gastroparesis patients were more likely to have cardiovascular diseases (10% vs. 6.9% for controls, p = 0.034) and a lower prevalence of obesity (17% vs. 24.4%, p < 0.001). HCRU within the 2 years after the index date was higher, with more hospitalizations than controls.

### Gastroparesis: separate entity or just a part of dyspepsia [^113Lw7VJ]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is defined by the presence of delayed gastric emptying (GE) in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms attributed to gastroparesis include postprandial fullness, early satiation, nausea, and vomiting. Gastroprokinetic drugs are the preferred treatment option. Recently, a number of problems with the concept of gastroparesis have been identified. There is a major overlap with the symptom complex of the functional dyspepsia subtype of postprandial distress syndrome. The distinguishing feature of gastroparesis is delayed GE; however, the correlation between delayed emptying and symptom pattern or severity in gastroparesis is modest, and the stability of delayed emptying over time is poor. Other pathophysiological mechanisms, such as hypersensitivity or impaired accommodation, may also underlie symptoms in patients with gastroparesis. Moreover, the symptomatic response to prokinetic therapy is variable and cannot be predicted based on the degree of enhancing GE.

To increase the clinical usefulness of a diagnosis of gastroparesis, several approaches have been proposed. These include a higher threshold of abnormal emptying and the selection of patients with a specific symptom pattern more likely to be associated with delayed emptying.

### Epidemiology and outcomes of gastroparesis, as documented in general practice records, in the United Kingdom [^113Xp7Te]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Following diagnosis, 776 patients (68.4%) were prescribed at least one prokinetic, with the remaining 359 patients (31.6%) being offered no recognized pharmacological therapy. The most commonly prescribed medications were domperidone in 46.6% and metoclopramide in 22.9% of patients. Erythromycin had been prescribed for 6.2% of patients, while prucalopride and cisapride were prescribed for less than 1% of patients.

- **Pharmacological therapies for gastroparesis in the CPRD**: Refer to Table 4 for detailed information on the treatments.

Patients with type 2 diabetic gastroparesis differed from those with type 1 diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis in several notable factors. They were older at the time of diagnosis (62.6 years vs. 46.3 years in type 1 diabetic and 44.5 years in idiopathic gastroparesis). In addition, a higher proportion of patients with diabetic gastroparesis were overweight or obese than those with idiopathic gastroparesis (78.1% of type 2 diabetic and 56.4% of type 1 diabetic vs. 52.3% of idiopathic gastroparesis).

After multivariate Cox regression, patients with idiopathic gastroparesis had a significantly higher survival probability than patients with diabetic gastroparesis, after adjusting for significant predictors in this study population, including age, sex, and presence of cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was 1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0) in diabetic versus idiopathic gastroparesis.

- **Prognostic factors related to survival**: Patients with both type 1 diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis exhibited different survival probabilities, as highlighted by the adjusted HR data. Refer to Figure 4 for comprehensive analysis.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^1163LUKQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

When a patient is initially diagnosed with malignant bowel obstruction (MBO), they should be made nil per os (NPO; nothing by mouth). Once the acute MBO resolves fully or partially, a symptom-led, slow, and graded reintroduction to oral diet is recommended. This may include clear fluids, free or full fluids, texture-modified low fiber diets (soft, minced, and pureed), and, if tolerated, a return to normal-textured low fiber diets [level of evidence: IV; grade: B].

Nutrition interventions should be initiated in patients with advanced cancers only where the benefits on quality of life and survival outweigh the risks. Clear expectations should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team with patients and families [level of evidence: IV; grade: B].

Patients admitted with acute onset of an MBO are made nil by mouth with the addition of decompressive procedures to control symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. Managing the nutritional requirements of patients presenting with advanced cancers and MBO is controversial and ethically challenging due to the lack of consensus arising from scant published evidence. Nutrition interventions must be considered in the context of the patient's prognosis, with a focus on prioritizing the patient's wishes. Awareness of the socio-cultural meaning of food and nutrition for many people is an important consideration, as it may contribute to an increase in quality of life.

As a patient's acute MBO resolves, either fully or partially, a symptom-led, slow, and graded reintroduction to oral diet is once again recommended. This process may include clear fluids and free or full fluids.

### The goals for successful development of treatment in gastroparesis [^112bjF4h]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a motility disorder of the stomach characterized by cardinal symptoms and delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of mechanical obstruction. There is significant unmet need in its management, and essentially, there have been no medications approved for its treatment over four decades.

- **Purpose**: The objectives of this review are to develop an understanding of the goals of treatment, the evidence-based criteria for treatment success based on the scientific understanding of gastroparesis, as well as patient response outcomes. We propose evidence-based principles for the successful development of treatments for gastroparesis. Specifically, we discuss the pathophysiologic targets in gastroparesis, eligibility criteria for clinical trial participation based on validated gastric emptying studies, and the patient response outcome measures that have been validated to appraise the effects of treatment on clinically relevant outcomes.

These considerations lead to recommendations regarding eligibility, design, and duration of proof-of-efficacy studies. We endorse the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary as a validated patient response outcome. Furthermore, we justify the shortening of proof-of-efficacy, placebo-controlled clinical trials to a 4-week treatment duration following a baseline period. We believe that such approaches will increase the likelihood of successful assessment of efficacy of novel approaches to treating patients with gastroparesis.

### Endoscopic approaches to gastroparesis [^1122Huyn]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

This review covers the cause, evaluation, and treatment options for gastroparesis. Symptoms of delayed gastric emptying are increasingly seen by gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal surgeons. Endoscopy, both laparoscopic and flexible, is increasingly important in treatment algorithms for this problem.

Gastroparesis is increasingly being seen in clinical practice. A progressive algorithm needs to be followed in these challenging cases: starting with medical treatment and diet modification, progressing through endoscopic treatments including new ones such as per-oral pyloromyotomy, and finally laparoscopic treatments including gastrectomy.

Endoscopic interventions are effective treatments for certain gastroparesis patients. New procedures offer a minimally invasive alternative to more radical options and should probably be more widely adopted.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^1158mvkz]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A significant weight gain of 5.1 kg (range −5 to + 21 kg, P = 0.002) was observed within 6 months after PEG-J placement. Symptom responders showed a more pronounced weight gain compared with non-responders (Table 2), although weight and weight change were not statistically different amongst responders and non-responders for PEG-J (resp. P = 0.150 and P = 0.454).

- **Intake**: Of all patients receiving enteral nutrition, 16 (84%) were able to have some oral intake in addition to enteral tube feeding, while three patients could not eat or drink anything (16%).

- **Manometric data (subjective responders vs non-responders)**: Data were eligible for analysis in 17 of the 19 patients (no measurement performed in two patients). No significant differences were observed in manometry data (antral amplitude, antral motility index, and presence of phase III contractions) between responders (n = 7) and non-responders (n = 12) to PEG-J, albeit this might be due to a type II statistical error.

- **Complications of PEG-J**: The most frequent complication was luxation of the jejunal extension to the stomach (six patients [32%], 1–8 times), occurring following a few months of use, which required placement of a new extension. Other complications were peristomal infection (in two patients [10.5%] within 30 days, in three patients [16%] after 30 days, easily treated with oral antibiotics) and buried bumper (three patients, 16%, after approximately one year which led to replacement).

- **Long-term outcomes of PEG-J**: Only three patients (16%) of the 19 patients treated with PEG-J were able to return to normal.

### Ten controversies in gastroparesis and a look to the future [^114Mo1xr]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a complex, challenging gastrointestinal disorder presenting with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, especially nausea and vomiting, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. After mechanical obstruction is ruled out, it is essential to identify delayed gastric emptying for a definitive diagnosis. The most common causes are idiopathic (no identified etiology), diabetes mellitus, and postsurgical status. Management focuses on dietary modifications and treatments aimed at symptom relief. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of patients are refractory to pharmacological therapy, and the effectiveness of many non-pharmacological options has been questioned.

The extensive review of the literature identifies several uncertainties or controversies regarding the differential diagnosis based on the spectrum of symptoms, the lack of availability of reliable diagnostic tests, and questions regarding effective therapeutic options.

- **Controversies and discussion**: In this review, we discuss ten controversies regarding gastroparesis: clinical presentation, diagnosis, overlap syndromes, pathophysiology, etiology, as well as pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options. Additionally, studies exploring pathological, inflammatory, and molecular disturbances affecting the intrinsic neuromuscular elements that may be involved in gastroparesis pathophysiology are briefly reviewed. These elements may constitute potential therapeutic targets in the future.

- **Future research opportunities**: Lastly, we tabulate future research opportunities to resolve these controversies in the management of patients.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^113RbLfp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 86 patients diagnosed with gastroparesis (71% female, age range 20‐87 years, mean 55.8 years) were seen between 2008 and 2016, and their data were analyzed. Idiopathic gastroparesis was the most common type (n = 33, 38.3%), followed by diabetic gastroparesis (n = 23, 26.7%), postsurgical gastroparesis (n = 23, 26.7%), and generalized motility disorder (including patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) (n = 7, 8.1%).

- **Groups and treatment response**: Groups were defined as follows. Group I consists of patients that only needed DP (responders to DP, 50 patients). Group II consists of non-responders to DP (decompensated gastroparesis) who received GR (36 patients). Group III consists of responders to DP + GR (17 patients), and Group IV of patients that did not respond to DP and GR and therefore received PEG-J (19 patients).

Before treatment (6–12 months), 31 patients had a stable weight (36%), 27 patients (31.4%) had < 10 kg weight loss, and 28 patients (32.6%) had ≥ 10 kg weight loss. No relation was observed between treatment (both symptom and weight response) and gastric emptying parameters (data not shown).

- **Drug use**: Of the 86 patients, 12 patients used opioids. Only in three cases was it apparent that opioid use was an etiological factor in gastroparesis due to the temporal relation between initiating opioids and gastroparesis symptom development. A total of seven patients used centrally acting medications.

### Gastroparesis with concomitant gastrointestinal dysmotility is not a contraindication for per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) [^11787Rka]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP or G-POEM) provides significant short-term improvements in symptoms and objective emptying for patients with medically refractory gastroparesis, but it is unclear if patients with gastroparesis and co-existing dysmotility (small bowel or colonic delay) also benefit. In this study, we used wireless motility capsule (WMC) data to measure outcomes in patients with isolated gastroparesis (GP) and gastroparesis with co-existing dysmotility (GP+Dys) who underwent POP.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients who had POP and completed WMC data during their evaluation of intestinal dysmotility. WMC data were reviewed to identify patients who demonstrated isolated GP or GP+Dys. Each patient's pre-op and post-op Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and 4-hour solid-phase scintigraphy gastric emptying studies (GES) scores were compared to evaluate improvement.

- **Results**: Of the entire cohort (n = 73), 89% were female with a mean age of 47.0 ± 15.0 years old. Gastroparesis etiologies were divided among idiopathic (54.8%), diabetic (26%), postsurgical (8.2%), autoimmune (5.5%), and multifactorial (5.5%). Forty-one patients (56%) had GP and 32 patients (44%) had GP+Dys. GCSI improved after POP whether the patient had isolated GP (-12.31, p < 0.001) or GP+Dys (-9.58, p < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in total GCSI improvement between the two groups. A subset of patients had postoperative GES available (n = 47). In the isolated GP and GP+Dys cohorts, 15/28 (54%) and 12/19 (63%) patients had normal post-op 4-h GES, respectively.

### Gastroparesis [^114qBdoJ]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying of solid food in the absence of a mechanical obstruction of the stomach, resulting in the cardinal symptoms of early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, belching, and bloating. Gastroparesis is now recognized as part of a broader spectrum of gastric neuromuscular dysfunction that includes impaired gastric accommodation. The overlap between upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes the distinction between gastroparesis and other disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, challenging. Thus, a confirmed diagnosis of gastroparesis requires measurement of delayed gastric emptying via an appropriate test, such as gastric scintigraphy or breath testing. Gastroparesis can have idiopathic, diabetic, iatrogenic, post-surgical, or post-viral aetiologies.

- **Management of gastroparesis**: involves correcting fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional deficiencies; identifying and treating the cause of delayed gastric emptying (for example, diabetes mellitus); and suppressing or eliminating symptoms with pharmacological agents as first-line therapies. Several novel pharmacologic agents and interventions are currently in the pipeline and show promise to help tailor individualized therapy for patients with gastroparesis.

- **Key points**:
	- **Question**: Does nil-per-os (NPO) time and preoperative fasting influence fluid needs during surgery?
	- **Findings**: Using multiple statistical analyses, we found no relationship between NPO time and fluid volume delivery suggested by a goal-directed fluid-therapy algorithm.
	- **Meaning**: Intravenous fluid resuscitation based on historical "NPO time deficits" may not be indicated.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^117Pgb3J]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires objective evidence of clearly delayed gastric emptying in symptomatic patients. Because accelerated, normal, and delayed gastric emptying cannot be differentiated reliably based on the type or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, objective measurement of clearly delayed gastric emptying — gastric emptying time increased above the upper level of normal — using well-validated techniques, such as gastric emptying scintigraphy (FIG. 1), is required for diagnosis of gastroparesis. To obtain a more specific symptom pattern and better separation from functional dyspepsia with delayed emptying, gastroparesis has been proposed to require a stricter definition (for example, more than three standard deviations above the mean value in healthy volunteers).

The merit of gastric emptying studies for clinical management has been questioned because of variations in the reports of associations between gastric emptying rates and symptoms. Several studies published during the past seven years have shown a positive association between symptoms of gastroparesis and gastric emptying times. Measurement of gastric emptying can also predict responsiveness to different therapeutic options. For example, the presence of slow gastric emptying in patients with functional dyspepsia was associated with poor response to antidepressant medications that target visceral hypersensitivity. On the other hand, one systematic literature review that used multiple methods, various symptom instruments, and diverse treatments showed that most drugs improved idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis.

This retrospective study utilized a de-identified dataset provided by the hospital information technology department. The University of California Irvine Institutional Review Board deemed the protocol IRB exempt.

- **Data collection**: We extracted data for this study from our perioperative database, SIS (Surgical Information Systems, Alpharetta, GA). The initial data pull included all adult procedures in 20 main operating rooms at UC Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC) from September 1, 2013, through September 1, 2015, that were marked as receiving GDFT in the medical record (our charts include a mandatory GDFT field that must be selected yes/no before the chart can be closed).

Inclusion criteria for the study were adult patients aged 18 or over having open or laparoscopic abdominal procedures (colectomy, adrenalectomy, gastrectomy, hepatic resection, Whipple or pancreatic procedures, nephrectomy, cystectomy, abdominoperineal resection, or gynecologic oncology procedures). For each identified case, we pulled: case, date and time; procedure; patient demographics (including gender, height, weight, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists Patient Score); patient comorbidities (including hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and dialysis); NPO time; whether or not the patient received an epidural or arterial line; intraoperative data (including urine output, estimated blood loss, total crystalloid and colloid, blood administration, median and minimum heart rate, median and minimum mean arterial pressure).

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^116gaHmX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

In our tertiary referral center, Maastricht University Medical Centre (Maastricht UMC+), we provide medical and nutritional support according to a stepwise approach, starting with dietary and lifestyle advice, and prokinetics. When these initial measures fail in the presence of malnutrition (grade 3 gastroparesis), three months of nasoduodenal tube feeding with the aim to achieve "gastric rest" (GR) and "gastric decompression" is considered. Thereafter, oral feeding is reintroduced in a stepwise fashion, and nasoduodenal feeding is stopped. When oral reintroduction fails, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension (PEG-J) for long-term enteral nutrition is offered.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of our stepwise approach with different interventions (diet and medication; nasoduodenal tube feeding with gastric rest; PEG-J) on gastroparesis symptoms and objective parameters (bodyweight/BMI).

### Clinical predictors of symptom improvement failure in gastroparesis [^115RsjNV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In this retrospective study evaluating the clinical outcomes of gastroparesis (GP), we found that GP patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had better symptom improvement compared to non-diabetics. Furthermore, a history of bariatric surgery was associated with no clinical improvement at 4 or 12 weeks, whereas lower body mass index (BMI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were associated with refractory symptoms at 4 weeks after GP diagnosis. In a subgroup analysis, diabetic peripheral neuropathy was associated with refractory GP at both weeks 4 and 12. The duration of diabetes mellitus in this group was marginally associated with failure of symptom improvement 12 weeks after the diagnosis of GP, whereas a low BMI remained a predictor of poor outcomes in non-diabetic GP at 4 and 12 weeks. Prokinetic medications and gastrojejunal tube feeding were used in patients with severe disease, and as a result, these patients had persistent symptoms at weeks 4 and 12. Additionally, glycemic control at the time of diagnosis did not predict the clinical outcome.

The study population was predominantly female, as previously reported. A large number of patients were obese. This could be due to a nationwide increase in obesity prevalence. Obesity is a risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which explains its high incidence in our patient population. The relationship of GERD with GP is multifactorial. The delayed gastric motility causes an increase in acid secretion, gastric volume, and the gastroesophageal pressure gradient. Gastric distention can also cause relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which can contribute to esophageal reflux.

### Per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) for medically refractory gastroparesis: Short term results from the first 100 patients at a high volume center [^113rRZRV]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

For patients with gastroparesis, temporary pyloric disruption has been shown to improve symptoms and gastric emptying. Per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) is an innovative endoscopic procedure to divide the pylorus from within a submucosal tunnel, as a corollary to surgical pyloromyotomy. Here, we evaluate subjective and objective outcomes 12 weeks after POP at a high volume center.

The first 100 consecutive patients undergoing POP were included, with procedure dates between January 2016 and October 2017. Patients were evaluated using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and 4-hour solid-phase scintigraphic gastric emptying studies (GES) prior to the procedure and at 90 days post-POP.

The study cohort was 85% female, with a mean age of 45.0 ± 14.6 years. Gastroparesis etiologies were divided among idiopathic (56%), diabetic (21%), postsurgical (19%), and other in 4%. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had previous endoscopic or surgical interventions for gastroparesis. Most POP procedures were performed in the operating room (97%) and were completed in an average of 33 minutes. Ten patients incurred complications (10%), which included 1 diagnostic laparoscopy and 2 cases of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the GCSI improved from a preoperative mean of 3.82 ± 0.86 to 2.54 ± 1.2 (P < 0.001). The improvement in each GCSI subscore was also highly statistically significant. Among the patients with postoperative GES available, 78% had objectively better 4-hour emptying with a mean improvement in retention by 23.6% (P < 0.001).

### Diabetic gastroparesis: Principles and current trends in management [^112sciBm]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are the most disabling symptoms of gastroparesis. Antiemetic agents without stimulatory activity are often used alone or in combination with prokinetic drugs to treat the condition. These medications act on a broad range of distinct receptor subtypes in the peripheral and central nervous systems. As with prokinetics, the choice of antiemetic is empirical. Some antiemetics have the potential for KEG Q-Tc prolongation, similar to other drugs used for treating gastroparetic symptoms.

- **Phenothiazines**: Phenothiazines, including prochlorperazine and tiethyperazine, are the most commonly prescribed traditional antiemetics. These drugs are both dopamine and cholinergic receptor antagonists that act on the area postrema in the brainstem. Side effects include sedation and extrapyramidal effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, skin rashes, and Parkinsonian-like tardive dyskinesia.

- **Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists**: These medications, including ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and peripheral afferent nerve fibers within the vagus nerve. They may be used in diabetic gastroparesis (DGP) when all other drugs have failed to provide symptom relief.

- **Antihistamines**: Antihistamines act on H1 receptors to produce central antiemetic effects. Commonly prescribed antiemetics include diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, and meclizine. These agents are most often used to treat symptoms related to motion sickness. Side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, difficulty urinating, and constipation.

### Nutritional aspects in patients with gastroparesis [^111SZycf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review was to highlight the most recent updates on nutritional aspects in gastroparesis (GP), focusing on dietary recommendations and the utilization of enteral and parenteral nutrition, as well as endoscopic and surgical interventions.

Recent data have addressed eating patterns and nutritional interventions while clarifying the role of endoscopic and surgical interventions, underscoring their impact on the nutritional management of GP patients. They support the importance of a gastroparesis-specific diet in addition to drug therapy and confirm the benefits of a modified low-fat, low-fiber diet. Guidelines suggest a new approach to GP management based on predominant symptoms. Gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) and surgical gastric electrical stimulator (GES) placement may be considered in individuals with nausea and vomiting before the need for jejunostomy tube placement for enteral feeding or parenteral nutrition.

Literature supports the importance of dietary interventions that focus on low-fat and low-fiber diets, in addition to drug therapies. Severely fiber-restrictive diets may not be necessary. There is an enhanced understanding of when jejunal feeding should be incorporated for refractory cases, with consideration of G-POEM and/or GES even before jejunal tube placement. This approach will require patient evaluation in specialized motility centers.

### Clinical guideline: Management of gastroparesis [^113r51n9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastroparesis, specifically in relation to pre-test preparation, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend discontinuing medications that affect gastric emptying at least 48 hours before diagnostic testing. Depending on the pharmacokinetics of the medication, it may be necessary to stop these medications more than 48 hours before testing.

### Therapeutic strategies in gastroparesis: Results of stepwise approach with diet and prokinetics, gastric rest, and PEG-J: A retrospective analysis [^114taAZh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis can be classified into the following categories: grade 1 (easily controlled symptoms, ability to maintain weight on a regular or slightly adjusted diet); grade 2, which is compensated gastroparesis (moderate symptoms, partial control by medication, ability to maintain nutritional status with dietary adjustments, and occasional hospital admissions); and grade 3, which is decompensated gastroparesis (refractory symptoms, nutritional status cannot be maintained via oral intake, and frequent hospital admissions).

Due to an incomplete understanding of gastroparesis and limited therapeutic options, symptom management is challenging. Nutritional interventions are often necessary. Initial treatment generally consists of dietary interventions (e.g. intake of small and frequent meals) and restoring glycemic control in diabetic patients. Dietary advice is often combined with the use of prokinetic agents, such as dopaminergic-2-antagonists (e.g. domperidone, metoclopramide), motilin-analogues (e.g. erythromycin), or serotonin 4 (5-HT 4)-agonists (e.g. prucalopride). However, the lack of robust evidence for their effectiveness, in addition to potential serious side effects (QT-prolongation) or tachyphylaxis, limits the chances for a therapeutic benefit.

With regard to nutritional support, consensus has been reached that nasoduodenal tube feeding should be considered if patients have significant weight loss (5%-10% in, respectively, 3–6 months), are unable to achieve their target weight, or when repeated hospital admissions for malnutrition or dehydration are necessary.
