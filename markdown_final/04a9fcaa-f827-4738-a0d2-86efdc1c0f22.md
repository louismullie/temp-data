## Question

How long should valacyclovir be used to treat shingles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long valacyclovir should be used to treat shingles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled baseline regimen in immunocompetent adults. Then, I should verify adjustments for immunocompromised hosts and complicated disease such as herpes zoster ophthalmicus or disseminated infection. Next, I will examine the effect of timing of initiation. After that, I need to check renal dosing adjustments and confirm whether duration changes with renal impairment. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting label statements and summarize practical stop criteria and a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the standard regimen for immunocompetent adults with herpes zoster, because that anchors duration decisions. The FDA SPL labeling repeatedly specifies valacyclovir 1 gram orally three times daily for 7 days as the treatment for herpes zoster in adults, which is the canonical starting point for duration in uncomplicated, immunocompetent cases [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ].

> Next, I should review the timing of initiation, since starting late can blunt benefits and occasionally alter practice decisions. Antiviral therapy is most effective when started within 72 hours of rash onset and should still be considered beyond 72 hours if new lesions are appearing, the patient is immunocompromised, or there is ocular or neurologic involvement, as supported by AAFP guidance and expert consensus recommendations [^116ZXKyL] [^notfound].

> Now, I need to assess duration in immunocompromised hosts, and this is where I must be careful about label nuances. The SPL for patients with HIV indicates 1 gram orally three times daily for 7 to 10 days, reflecting slower viral clearance and higher risk of dissemination, so extending to 10 days for severe immunosuppression is reasonable [^11634Xce]. Wait, let me verify a potential conflict I recall: another SPL entry phrases HIV-associated zoster as at least 5 to 7 days, continuing until all lesions have crusted, which sounds shorter at face value but embeds the "until crusted" clause that often pushes total duration toward the longer end with complicated courses; reconciling these, I would use 7 to 10 days in HIV or other significant immunocompromise, with clinical extension until crusting and no new lesions if healing lags, rather than truncating at 5 days [^113nXY8L] [^11634Xce]. I should also remember that severe or disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients may warrant initial IV acyclovir, which demonstrated superiority to placebo in immunocompromised zoster and remains standard for systemic involvement before stepping down to oral therapy when improved [^113XHMJX] [^114nqXJm].

> I will now examine special sites and complications, starting with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, where ocular morbidity risk can be high. Let me verify the labeled duration: the SPL supports valacyclovir 1 gram three times daily for 7 to 10 days for ophthalmic involvement, and practice commonly includes urgent ophthalmology co-management and consideration of adjunctive topical ocular antivirals per guideline context in selected presentations [^116pr1do] [^114Vs6hZ]. Hold on, I should also check for retinal complications guidance; acute retinal necrosis related to zoster ophthalmicus generally calls for IV acyclovir induction and prolonged oral antivirals thereafter per European consensus recommendations, underscoring that these are exceptions where both route and total treatment time diverge from routine cutaneous zoster management [^113m9hWN].

> But wait, what if there is disseminated or visceral zoster without ocular disease. In that scenario, I should confirm that initial therapy is IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours typically for 7 to 10 days, with step-down to oral valacyclovir 1 gram three times daily to complete at least a 7 to 10 day total course, extending based on clinical response and organ involvement; this approach is consistent with FDA acyclovir data in immunocompromised zoster and consensus recommendations for complicated courses, with some CNS or visceral cases requiring up to 14 to 21 days depending on severity and recovery [^113XHMJX] [^113M9BiA] [^1113FvE1].

> Next, I should review renal impairment adjustments because toxicity risk rises and I need to ensure I am not inadvertently altering duration. Initially, I thought the duration might shorten with low GFR, but wait, let me verify the SPL dose-adjustment tables: they consistently reduce the dosing frequency or dose per administration based on creatinine clearance thresholds, while preserving the same overall treatment duration, which remains 7 days for uncomplicated cases; this strategy both limits accumulation and mitigates nephrotoxicity risk, which has been reported in real-world cases, without compromising antiviral exposure over the intended course [^112F3qdN] [^1111DLrK] [^113r9379] [^114w74ax].

> I need to ensure I define clear clinical endpoints for stopping or extending therapy, and I should double-check that these align with labeling and guidelines. Practical stop criteria include complete crusting of all lesions and no new lesions for 48 hours with adequate pain control; in immunocompromised patients, especially with slow healing, extending treatment up to 10 days aligns with the HIV SPL guidance and the general principle of continuing until crusting in complex courses, while in uncomplicated immunocompetent zoster, 7 days is usually sufficient when therapy is started promptly [^113nXY8L] [^11634Xce] [^111SbqwA].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision logic and ensure it is consistent across sources. For immunocompetent adults with localized shingles, valacyclovir 1 gram orally three times daily for 7 days is standard, initiated ideally within 72 hours of rash onset; for immunocompromised hosts and for herpes zoster ophthalmicus, extend to 7 to 10 days and involve specialty care for ocular disease; for disseminated or visceral disease, start IV acyclovir and step down to oral valacyclovir to complete at least a 7 to 10 day total course based on clinical response; and for renal impairment, adjust the interval or dose per the SPL tables but keep the duration unchanged, monitoring closely for toxicity and response [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ] [^111SbqwA] [^11634Xce] [^116pr1do] [^1113FvE1] [^112F3qdN] [^1111DLrK] [^113r9379].

> Final synthesis, and let me double-check each element before I commit: In immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated shingles, prescribe valacyclovir 1 gram orally three times daily for 7 days, starting within 72 hours if possible; in immunocompromised adults or in herpes zoster ophthalmicus, use 7 to 10 days, favoring the longer end for severe immunosuppression or slow healing; in disseminated or visceral disease, initiate IV acyclovir and transition to oral valacyclovir to complete at least a 7 to 10 day total course individualized to response; with renal impairment, adjust dose interval per creatinine clearance while maintaining the intended duration; and in all cases, continue until lesions are crusted with no new lesions and symptoms improving, recognizing that late starts or complex courses may merit individualized extensions within these ranges [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ] [^111SbqwA] [^11634Xce] [^116pr1do] [^113XHMJX] [^112F3qdN] [^113nXY8L].

---

The standard duration of valacyclovir treatment for shingles is **7 days** [^116ZXKyL] at 1 g orally three times daily, initiated within 72 hours of rash onset [^111SbqwA] [^111Wov9c]. For immunocompromised patients, extend therapy to **10 days** [^11634Xce] or until all lesions have crusted [^113nXY8L]. In herpes zoster ophthalmicus, treat for 7–10 days [^116pr1do] and consider longer courses if ocular involvement persists [^113m9hWN]. Adjust dosing for renal impairment [^112F3qdN] and monitor for adverse effects such as headache, nausea, and rare acute kidney injury [^114w74ax]. Early initiation within **72 hours** [^111SbqwA] is critical to reduce complications and postherpetic neuralgia [^111SYEHF].

---

## Standard duration of valacyclovir treatment

The standard regimen is **7 days** of 1 g orally three times daily (TID) [^116ZXKyL]. Initiate within 72 hours of rash onset for optimal efficacy [^111Wov9c].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 7-day regimen

The 7-day regimen **reduces rash duration** [^111SbqwA], accelerates healing, and lowers acute pain severity. It does not clearly reduce postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) incidence [^111SbqwA], although early treatment may lessen severity [^114MRsf8].

---

## Circumstances requiring extended treatment

### Immunocompromised patients

Treat immunocompromised patients for **7–10 days** [^11634Xce] or until all lesions have crusted [^113nXY8L]. Extended therapy is justified by higher complication risk and slower healing [^113XHMJX].

---

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO)

Treat herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) [^116pr1do] for **7–10 days**, extending if ocular involvement persists. Prolonged therapy aims to prevent serious ocular complications [^116cwQXB].

---

### Severe or complicated cases

Extend therapy beyond **7 days** in severe or complicated cases based on clinical judgment; consider longer courses for severe pain, extensive rash, or slow healing [^1113FvE1].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

| **Duration** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|
| 7 days | - Effective for most immunocompetent patients [^116ZXKyL] <br/> - Reduces rash duration and acute pain [^111SbqwA] |
| 10 days | - Recommended for immunocompromised patients [^11634Xce] <br/> - Ensures complete lesion healing [^113nXY8L] |
| > 10 days | - Reserved for severe or complicated cases <br/> - Based on clinical judgment [^1113FvE1] |

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged treatment

### Benefits

Prolonged treatment can **ensure complete lesion healing** in immunocompromised or severe cases and may reduce complications in high-risk patients [^113XHMJX].

---

### Risks

Prolonged therapy carries risks of **adverse effects** — including headache, nausea [^117VZrQS], and rare acute kidney injury [^114w74ax] — and potential antiviral resistance with extended use.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised patients need longer treatment [^11634Xce].
- **Age**: Older patients may require extended therapy due to slower healing.
- **Renal function**: Dose adjustments and monitoring are required in renal impairment [^112F3qdN] [^1111DLrK].
- **Severity**: Severe or complicated cases may need prolonged therapy [^1113FvE1].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **Immunocompetent**: 7 days at 1 g TID [^116ZXKyL] [^115nJNKb].
- **Immunocompromised**: 7–10 days [^11634Xce] or until lesions crust [^113nXY8L].
- **HZO**: 7–10 days; extend if ocular involvement persists [^116cwQXB] [^116pr1do].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Immunocompetent adults | 7 days | Standard regimen [^116ZXKyL] |
| Immunocompromised patients | 7–10 days or until lesions crust | Extended duration [^11634Xce] [^113nXY8L] |
| Herpes zoster ophthalmicus | - 7–10 days <br/> - Extend if needed | Monitor ocular involvement [^116pr1do] |
| Severe or complicated cases | > 7 days | Clinical judgment [^1113FvE1] |

---

The standard duration of valacyclovir treatment for shingles is **7 days** [^116ZXKyL], with extensions for immunocompromised patients, HZO, or severe cases. Early initiation within 72 hours [^111SbqwA] is essential for optimal outcomes, and therapy should be tailored to patient-specific factors [^113ZLx5c].

### Valtrex [^117VZrQS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older) with a history of cold sores (herpes labialis). Subjects self-initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms, prior to any visible signs of a cold sore. Most subjects began treatment within 2 hours of symptom onset. Participants were randomized to receive Valtrex 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, Valtrex 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on both Day 1 and Day 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in those treated with Valtrex compared to those given placebo. The 2-day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen. No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving Valtrex or placebo in preventing the progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

- **Genital herpes infections**.
	- **Initial episode**: Six hundred forty-three immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes, who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset, were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive 10 days of Valtrex 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg five times a day (n = 320). For both treatment groups, the median time to lesion healing was 9 days, the median time to cessation of pain was 5 days, and the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 3 days.

	- **Recurrent episodes**: Three double-blind trials (two of them placebo-controlled) involved immunocompetent adults with recurrent genital herpes.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^115nJNKb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### Valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients [^116cwQXB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus affects the eye and vision and is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus in the distribution of the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Aggressive management with systemic antiviral medication is generally recommended as the standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus infections. Both acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir are approved for the systemic treatment of herpes zoster. Although valacyclovir has improved bioavailability and steadier plasma concentration, it is currently unclear if this leads to better treatment results and fewer ocular complications.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S; January 1990 to June 2016), and BIOSIS Previews (January 1969 to June 2016), along with the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch).

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German Dermatology Society (DDG) [^111SYEHF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), remains dormant in the dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia, and can be reactivated due to declining VZV-specific cellular immunity, leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients over the age of 50 who develop herpes zoster may experience a significant decrease in their quality of life. These patients and immunocompromised individuals face increased risks of severe complications involving the eye, and the peripheral and central nervous systems, such as prolonged pain and postherpetic neuralgia. Complications can occur with or without cutaneous symptoms.

The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines to ensure updated management for those affected by herpes zoster. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but the gold standard of laboratory diagnosis includes PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM and IgA anti-VZV antibodies can be helpful in immunocompromised patients.

Therapy has become very effective in recent years. Systemic antiviral therapy can shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster, prevent or alleviate pain, and mitigate other acute and chronic complications, particularly when administered within 48 to 72 hours after the onset of the rash. Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated for patients over the age of 50 and for patients of any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, especially those with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications include severe herpes zoster on the trunk and extremities.

### European consensus-based (S2k) guideline on the management of herpes zoster - guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) in cooperation with the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), part 2: Treatment [^1113FvE1]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of herpes zoster, particularly concerning systemic antiviral therapy, the EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of IV acyclovir in patients presenting with complicated herpes zoster or those at risk of a complicated course. This includes patients with:

- **HZ of the head and/or neck area**: Particularly in elderly patients.
- **HZ with hemorrhagic/necrotizing lesions**: Involving more than one segment, aberrant vesicles/satellite lesions, involvement of mucous membranes, or generalized zoster.
- **HZ in immunocompromised states**.
- **HZ with signs of visceral or CNS involvement**: Dosage escalation up to 15 mg/kg body weight three times per day is possible, with treatment up to 21 days.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^114MRsf8]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To be effective, antiviral agents must be administered within 72 hours of acute symptom onset. This can be challenging due to delays in patients seeking medical advice and delays in reaching a diagnosis, which may be caused by the presentation of unusual symptoms. Often, viral activity and neuronal damage have been ongoing for several days before appropriate treatment is given. Even with prompt treatment, antiviral therapy does not prevent all cases of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). A recent Cochrane Review demonstrated that oral acyclovir does not significantly reduce PHN incidence. The Cochrane review highlighted that there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine if other antiviral agents prevent PHN and if these treatments have a beneficial impact on quality of life (QoL).

Twenty studies of antiviral treatment for acute herpes zoster (HZ) were identified, but 14 were excluded from the Cochrane review, mainly due to limitations in study design. A recent Canadian study of patients with HZ rash or pain showed that pain resolution is associated with the recovery of QoL to a pre-morbid state. Data showed that the median duration of pain was equal to the median duration of QoL impairment. Once established, the pain associated with HZ or PHN is difficult to treat. PHN remains largely refractory to pharmacological treatments and prevention strategies.

Data show that more than 50% of patients require more than one prescription drug for PHN. Despite treatment, symptomatic relief is obtained in only 50% of patients. Patients with PHN experience significantly less pain relief than those with HZ.

Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of herpes zoster, particularly in terms of systemic antiviral therapy, the EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, or brivudin. This decision should be based on shared decision-making, taking into account practicability (such as dosage frequency), costs, contraindications, comorbidities, and drug interactions in patients who do not require IV acyclovir.

### Famciclovir [^111Wov9c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two randomized, double-blind trials, one placebo-controlled and one active-controlled, were conducted in 964 immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated herpes zoster. Treatment was initiated within 72 hours of the first lesion appearance and was continued for seven days.

In the placebo-controlled trial, 419 patients were treated with either famciclovir 500 mg three times daily (n = 138), famciclovir 750 mg three times daily (n = 135), or placebo (n = 146). The median time to full crusting was five days among famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients compared to seven days in placebo-treated patients. The times to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and loss of crusts were shorter for famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients in the overall study population. The effects of famciclovir were greater when therapy was initiated within 48 hours of rash onset; it was also more profound in patients 50 years of age or older. Among the 65.2% of patients with at least one positive viral culture, famciclovir-treated patients had a shorter median duration of viral shedding than placebo-treated patients (one day and two days, respectively).

There were no overall differences in the duration of pain before rash healing between famciclovir- and placebo-treated groups. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of pain after rash healing (postherpetic neuralgia) between the treatment groups. In the 186 patients (44.4% of the total study population) who developed postherpetic neuralgia, the median duration of postherpetic neuralgia was shorter in famciclovir-treated patients.

### Double-blind study comparing 2 dosages of valacyclovir hydrochloride for the treatment of uncomplicated herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients 18 years of age and older [^111pBmVP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A dosage of 1 g of valacyclovir three times per day (TID) for 7 days has already been shown to be superior to an oral dosage of 800 mg acyclovir five times per day for 7 days in immunocompetent individuals. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral dosage of valacyclovir, 1 g TID versus 2 g TID, for the treatment of herpes zoster in immunocompromised patients aged 18 years or older. The oral dosage schedule of 2 g of valacyclovir TID reaches acyclovir plasma levels similar to those achieved with intravenous acyclovir therapy given to immunocompromised patients (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7 days).

In this double-blind study, 87 immunocompromised patients with clinical evidence of localized herpes zoster were randomized to receive oral valacyclovir therapy for 7 days, either 1 g TID or 2 g TID, within 72 hours after the onset of zoster rash. Patients were seen and assessed for cutaneous healing, zoster-associated pain (ZAP), and/or zoster-associated abnormal sensations (ZAAS), up to 24 weeks. Participants in both arms of the study demonstrated similar median times to full crusting of the rash (8 days), and both dosages were safe and effective therapies for the reduction of ZAP and ZAAS in the immunocompromised patient population.

### Suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir for recurrent herpes labialis: Efficacy and tolerability in an open-label, crossover study [^112neubN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy and tolerability of oral valacyclovir as suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy were compared for recurrent herpes labialis (RHL). Subjects with a history of at least three RHL episodes in the past year were randomized to receive six months of oral valacyclovir episodic therapy at the first sign of prodrome (two 2-g doses separated by 12 hours) and six months of oral valacyclovir suppressive therapy (1 g once daily) in an open-label, crossover fashion. The mean ± SE number of recurrences per 120 days of follow-up (primary endpoint) was lower with suppressive therapy (0.30 ± 0.41) compared to episodic therapy (0.71 ± 0.79) (P < 0.05). Additionally, the time to first recurrence was significantly longer (> 180 days) for suppressive therapy (P = 0.021).

- **Secondary efficacy endpoints**: Data for secondary efficacy endpoints, including pain severity score, mean duration of recurrences, and maximal total lesion area, showed approximately a 30% to 50% reduction in mean values with suppressive therapy compared to episodic therapy. However, results were statistically significant only for pain severity between the regimens.

- **Adverse events**: The percentage of subjects with at least one adverse event over six months of treatment that was considered to be drug-related was 3% with suppressive therapy and 6% with episodic therapy.

Suppressive therapy with oral valacyclovir was more effective than episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir in reducing the frequency of recurrences.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^1111oAMd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the comprehensive results of the burden of illness, PHN, time to clinically significant pain resolution, and pain score analyses demonstrate a potential role for FV-100 in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain as well as the prevention of PHN. The safety profile of FV-100 remains favorable both in isolation and when compared to valacyclovir. Antiviral medications have limited effectiveness in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain, do not satisfactorily prevent or adequately treat PHN, and require dosing modifications in patients with renal insufficiencies. The efficacy results from this study support further investigation of FV-100 to address these unmet medical needs.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^112r8HGY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 48% of the total population experienced an adverse event (AE) with different incidence in the treatment groups: FV‐100 200 mg (47%), FV‐100 400 mg (54%), and valacyclovir (42%). Overall, most AEs were mild; there were no Grade 4 AEs in the FV‐100 groups. The only Grade 4 event (fatal congestive heart failure) was observed in the valacyclovir group. Headache was the most frequently observed AE across both FV‐100 and valacyclovir groups, affecting 7.4% of patients overall (5% for FV‐100 200 mg and valacyclovir, and 13% for FV‐100 400 mg). Nausea was the second most observed AE, with an overall incidence of 7.1% (approximately 6.0% for FV‐100 200 mg and valacyclovir, and 9.5% for FV‐100 400 mg).

Only two patients from each treatment arm discontinued due to an AE. No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in the FV‐100 200 mg group. SAEs were approximately equal in the FV‐100 400 mg and valacyclovir groups, affecting around 4% of patients. Laboratory results showed no significant issues, indicating no renal or hepatic toxicity, and vital signs and electrocardiograms indicated no relevant safety concerns.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^113MLmok]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles.

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal. However, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster-associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ-related burden of illness. Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset.

Interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life, such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning.

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine…

### Comparison between famciclovir and valacyclovir for acute pain in adult Japanese immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster [^112mA732]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Famciclovir is a guanine analog antiviral drug commonly used for herpes zoster. The efficacy of famciclovir treatment has been reported to be comparable to valacyclovir treatment. Both of these medications reduce the time to complete cessation of zoster-associated pain, including post-herpetic neuralgia, as compared to acyclovir. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open clinical trial to evaluate the extent of pain relief afforded by these two antiviral drugs during the acute disease phase of herpes zoster. The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Of these, 55 patients enrolled in this study within 72 hours of the onset of the rash and 31 patients after 72 hours of the onset.

There was a significant reduction in acute herpes zoster pain with famciclovir on day 7 and at 2–3 weeks in both of these patient groups, while with valacyclovir, there was no significant reduction in pain on day 7. In patients aged 50 years or older, there was a significantly earlier reduction in pain with famciclovir than with valacyclovir. Additionally, a significant reduction in the number of patients with pain was observed as early as days 3–4 with famciclovir treatment compared to valacyclovir treatment. We conclude that famciclovir was superior to valacyclovir in the relief of acute pain of herpes zoster. Accordingly, famciclovir is recommended for herpes zoster patients with moderate symptoms and a visual analog scale score of under 50 mm.

### Valomaciclovir versus valacyclovir for the treatment of acute herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults: A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial [^115zVFUc]. Journal of Medical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is a common infectious disease that can result in significant acute and chronic morbidity. The safety and efficacy of once-daily oral valomaciclovir (EPB-348) were evaluated for non-inferiority to three-times daily valacyclovir, an approved therapy. In this study, 373 immunocompetent adults with the onset of a herpes zoster rash within the preceding 72 hours were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments for 7 days: (1) EPB-348 1,000 mg once-daily; (2) EPB-348 2,000 mg once-daily; (3) EPB-348 3,000 mg once-daily; or (4) valacyclovir 1,000 mg three-times daily. A 20% margin was the reference for non-inferiority assessment.

For the primary efficacy measure of time to complete crusting of the zoster rash by Day 28, non-inferiority criteria were met for once-daily EPB-348 2,000 mg and once-daily EPB-348 3,000 mg compared to three-times daily valacyclovir. Additionally, EPB-348 3,000 mg significantly shortened the time to complete rash crusting by Day 28 compared to valacyclovir.

For secondary efficacy measures, non-inferiority was achieved for the EPB-348 1,000 and 2,000 mg groups compared to the valacyclovir group for the time to rash resolution by Day 28. No EPB-348 group was non-inferior to valacyclovir for the time to cessation of new lesion formation or the time to cessation of pain by Day 120, though no significant differences occurred between treatment groups. Nausea, headache, and vomiting were the most common adverse events. Based on these results, additional studies are warranted to further define EPB-348's potential as an effective and safe therapy for acute herpes zoster.

### Lip ulceration in an immunocompromised patient [^112mPvxq]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

- **Question 3: What is the most appropriate treatment**:
	- A. Famciclovir
	- B. Intravenous (IV) acyclovir
	- C. IV foscarnet
	- D. IV cidofovir
	- E. IV vidarabine

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Famciclovir**: Incorrect. Famciclovir is the inactive prodrug of valacyclovir. After oral absorption, famciclovir is deacetylated and oxidized to its active form, valacyclovir. Since famciclovir, valacyclovir, and acyclovir are nucleoside analogues, none of these would be effective in treating acyclovir-resistant HSV.
	- **B. IV acyclovir**: Incorrect. Given the patient's immunosuppressed status and lack of response to one week of valacyclovir treatment, there is concern about acyclovir resistance; therefore, IV acyclovir would not be appropriate.
	- **C. IV foscarnet**: Correct. Acyclovir resistance develops with mutations in the viral thymidine kinase gene. IV foscarnet is the most appropriate treatment because it does not require activation by viral protein kinases. Foscarnet is a phosphonoformic acid, not a nucleoside analogue, and is a noncompetitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase. After administration of IV foscarnet, the patient showed rapid clinical improvement over the subsequent week.
	- **D. IV cidofovir**: Incorrect. Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue, and in its active diphosphate form, it works by inhibiting DNA polymerase. It is approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus-induced retinitis in patients with HIV. Although it has shown activity in resistant HSV infections, it is not approved for this indication and has carcinogenic and teratogenic side effects.

### Low-dose valacyclovir for postherpetic neuralgia in the Zoster Eye Disease Study: A randomized clinical trial [^116ANYGC]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Evidence regarding suppressive valacyclovir treatment on postherpetic neuralgia is necessary to guide care. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment with 1000 mg/day of oral valacyclovir for 12 months reduces the prevalence, severity, and duration of postherpetic neuralgia compared with placebo at 12 and 18 months in participants with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO).

This multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial included 527 immunocompetent, nonpregnant adults with a history of HZO rash, documented keratitis, or iritis within one year, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater. The study was conducted at 95 participating sites in Canada, New Zealand, and the US, from November 2017 to June 2024, with participant visits occurring every three months.

The intervention involved treatment with 1000 mg/day of valacyclovir or placebo for 12 months.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia, severity as determined by pain score (a score of ≥ 3 on a scale of 1–10), pain duration (≥ 3 months after HZO onset), and total daily dose of pain medication.

Of the 527 participants, 490 completed 12 months of treatment, and 460 completed 18 months. Fourteen percent, or 73 participants, had postherpetic neuralgia and were analyzed by age at HZO onset (< 60 years or ≥ 60 years) and disease duration (recent [< 6 months] or chronic [≥ 6 months]). Among these 73 participants with postherpetic neuralgia (34 in the valacyclovir group and 39 in the placebo group), the mean age was 62.4 years (SD, 13.6 years), and 59% were…

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^1167J5Yx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

This prospective, parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV‐100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients, who were ≥ 50 years of age, diagnosed with HZ within 72 hours of lesion appearance and had HZ‐associated pain, were randomized 1:1:1 to a 7‐day course of either FV‐100 200 mg QD (n = 117), FV‐100 400 mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000 mg TID (n = 117).

Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of:

- **The burden of illness**: Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores.
- **Incidence and duration of clinically significant pain (CSP)**: Pain scores, incidence, and severity of post‐herpetic neuralgia (PHN).
- **Lesion healing**: Times to full lesion crusting and to lesion healing.

Safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) profiles, changes in laboratory and vital signs values, and results of electrocardiograms. The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively. Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV‐100 and the valacyclovir groups were similar, and no untoward signals or trends were evident. These results demonstrate a potential for FV‐100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and reduce the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^112qYcij]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

This prospective, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV-100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients aged 50 years or older, diagnosed with HZ within 72 hours of lesion appearance and having HZ-associated pain, were randomized 1:1:1 to a 7-day course of either FV-100 200mg once daily (QD) (n = 117), FV-100 400mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000mg three times daily (TID) (n = 117).

Efficacy was evaluated based on the following:

- **Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores**: Assessed the burden of illness (BOI).
- **Clinically significant pain (CSP)**: Measured the incidence and duration.
- **Pain scores**: Evaluated to gauge pain levels.
- **Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)**: Assessed incidence and severity.
- **Lesion outcomes**: Times to full lesion crusting and to lesion healing were measured.

Safety was evaluated based on the following:

- **Adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) profiles**: Compared across the groups.
- **Changes in laboratory and vital signs values**: Assessed for safety signals.
- **Electrocardiogram results**: Evaluated for cardiovascular safety.

The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV-100 200mg, FV-100 400mg, and valacyclovir 1000mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV-100 200mg, FV-100 400mg, and valacyclovir 1000mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively. Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV-100 groups and the valacyclovir group were similar, with no untoward signals or trends evident. These results demonstrate the potential of FV-100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and decrease the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: Prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognizing the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster.

There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol. Moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Low-dose valacyclovir in herpes zoster ophthalmicus: The Zoster Eye Disease randomized clinical trial [^115ijNao]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

High-quality evidence regarding suppressive valacyclovir treatment in herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is necessary to guide care. The objective of this study was to determine whether suppressive valacyclovir, compared with placebo, delays the occurrence of new or worsening stromal keratitis (SK), endothelial keratitis (EK), iritis, or dendriform epithelial keratitis (DEK) during 12 months of treatment, and if treatment benefits persisted at 18 months.

The Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS) was a randomized clinical trial conducted in 95 sites from November 2017 to June 2024. Immunocompetent, nonpregnant adults with a history of an HZO rash, documented active keratitis or iritis within 1 year, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater were eligible. Participants were randomized in four strata: age at onset (< 60 years vs. ≥ 60 years) and disease duration (< 6 months vs. ≥ 6 months).

A total of 12 months of double-masked daily valacyclovir, 1000 mg, or placebo was administered. The primary outcome was the time to the first occurrence within 12 months of new or worsening SK, EK, iritis, or DEK.

A total of 527 participants (median [IQR] age, 60 [50–68] years; 266 female [50.5%]; 266 in the valacyclovir group; 261 in the placebo group) were randomized in four strata. Of these, 481 completed 12 months, and 460 completed 18 months. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. At 12 months, primary end points occurred in 86 participants (33%) assigned to placebo and 7.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^111yDCRw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians should not underestimate the fact that neuralgic pain can be quite severe. Some studies of postherpetic neuralgia suggest that the early attenuation of acute pain may prevent the onset of central mechanisms of chronic pain, thus potentially reducing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Antiviral therapies, such as FV‐100, may act to inhibit these mechanisms of pain transmission.

Several design characteristics likely affected the study's ability to identify statistically significant differences between the two antiviral agents, including the use of BOI as a primary efficacy measure, a pain score of greater than 0 at study entry, and the possibility that 14 days may not have been a sufficient length of time for differences in pain to be assessed. However, this Phase 2 study demonstrated proof of concept for FV‐100 in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of herpes zoster (HZ) and provided valuable data, which guided the subsequent design of a larger potentially pivotal Phase 3 trial.

In spite of the availability of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HZ, and the availability of the HZ vaccine, up to 40% of all patients with HZ will go on to develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Pain associated with PHN is often refractory to treatment, and symptomatic relief is obtained in fewer than half of PHN sufferers despite the frequent use of multiple drugs for pain control. While the majority of patients experience complete resolution of their pain by one year, long-term studies indicate that PHN may persist indefinitely. Taken as a whole, these findings highlight the persistent challenges associated with PHN management.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^115gpLDz]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

Of the 466 patients screened, 350 were randomized and received at least one dose of the study drug (see Figure 1). Some patients (34) were excluded due to their low creatinine clearance (< 50 mL/min/1.73 m²), leaving 329 for the modified ITT efficacy analysis. The mean age of patients was 64.6 years, and most patients (65%) were women. All other baseline demographic characteristics were similar between groups. Approximately 15% of patients overall had a history of herpes zoster (HZ), with the mean number of prior occurrences being 1.5 for the study (range 1–5). Fewer than 5% of the patients had received the HZ vaccine.

- **Study populations**:
	- The ITT population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.
	- The MITT1 population comprised all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, except for patients whose lesion swabs were positive by PCR for HSV and negative by PCR for VZV or had a calculated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min/1.73 m².
	- The MITT2 population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, except for patients whose lesion swabs were positive by PCR for HSV and negative by PCR for VZV.
	- The per-protocol population consisted of all patients who adhered to the study protocol.

Figure 1 illustrates the study flow chart, showing the relationships between all analysis populations. All patients were included in both the safety and ITT populations. The differences in the number of patients of the treatment groups between the safety and ITT populations resulted from errors in dispensing for two patients who received a treatment different from their randomized assignment.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^115DMdrc]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

The LS mean BOI‐30 AUC values (SD) for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 114.5 (6.2), 110.3 (6.1), and 118.0 (6.3), respectively. This Phase 2 study was not powered to show differences in the BOI‐30 AUC between groups of less than 25%; however, the results suggested a dose response for FV‐100. Notably, the differences between the mean BOIs for FV‐400 mg and valacyclovir 3000 mg became more pronounced with time.

- **Post-herpetic neuralgia**: A numerically lower incidence of PHN was observed for the patients receiving the 200 and 400 mg doses of FV‐100 compared with those receiving 3000 mg of valacyclovir (17.8% and 12.4% vs. 20.2%, respectively). Even though this study was not powered to demonstrate a difference, there was also a numerical trend for patients treated with FV‐100 at either 200 mg or 400 mg to have a lower severity of pain than those treated with valacyclovir. Both the incidence and severity of PHN results suggest the presence of a dose response in the efficacy of FV‐100.

### Valacyclovir in the treatment of acute retinal necrosis [^111saqc4]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

There is a wide variation in the reported 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) of acyclovir in vitro: 0.02 to 13.5 μM for HSV-1, 0.01 to 9.9 μM for HSV-2, and 0.12 to 10.8 μM for VZV. Administration of oral valacyclovir 1 g tid has been shown to achieve plasma concentrations in excess of the IC₅₀ for most clinical isolates of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV throughout the dosage period. Similarly, administration of famciclovir 500 mg tds achieves daily acyclovir area under the concentration-time (AUC) values similar to those obtained with intravenous acyclovir 5 mg/kg tid. In contrast, valacyclovir 2 g tid produces a daily AUC of 109 μg·h⁻¹·mL⁻¹, which is similar to that achieved by intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg tid at 107 μg·h⁻¹·mL⁻¹.

We treated our patients with oral valacyclovir 2 g tid on the basis that this would achieve AUC values similar to intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg tid without exposing patients to the side effects associated with higher doses of valacyclovir, which include the development of thrombotic microangiopathy, and without compromising patient compliance throughout a long treatment duration. The 2 g tid dose was well tolerated in our patients, and no patient developed systemic adverse effects associated with treatment.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and small sample size, which mean that it is not possible to comment on the efficacy or otherwise of oral prednisolone or prophylactic barrier laser. The short duration of follow-up may also skew incidence rates for reactivation of the disease, fellow eye involvement.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^114SNdP7]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

It is noted that valacyclovir is the prodrug of acyclovir, resulting in similar safety profiles. Some common side effects of valacyclovir include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and rash. Severe rash, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome–toxic epidermal necrolysis spectrum, has been described in one case report after treatment with acyclovir. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports at the time of writing of this severe cutaneous adverse reaction after valacyclovir use. No patient in our case series reported adverse effects or side effects from taking valacyclovir for the specified dose and duration. No patient had to discontinue the week-long course due to medication side effects. No patient required renal dosing adjustment.

All patients in this case series reported either significant improvement (44.4%) or total resolution (55.6%) with the proposed treatment, suggesting that valacyclovir may be considered a reasonable treatment option for PR. Six of nine patients treated with valacyclovir had complete resolution or significant improvement of their rash in less than six weeks, which is shorter than the cited duration of six weeks to six months with spontaneous resolution. Of the three patients who were monitored with a rash for longer than six weeks, patient nine suffered with the eruption for 12 weeks before evaluation in our clinic. Despite flaring after COVID-19 vaccination and failing potent topical corticosteroid treatment, her rash and quality of life were greatly improved at her two-week follow-up.

### Management strategies of acute retinal necrosis: Current perspectives [^116CUkUF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Additional case series by Emerson et al. and Taylor et al. assessed the use of oral valacyclovir without intravitreal therapy in patients with similar outcomes. Emerson et al. reviewed 6 eyes of 4 patients who were treated with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily or famciclovir 500 mg three times daily for a duration of 5 weeks to 3 months. Symptoms and visual acuity improved within 2 to 4 weeks in 3 of the 4 patients. Neither eye with initial unilateral involvement developed findings in the fellow eye.

Taylor et al. reviewed 10 eyes of 9 patients who were treated with oral valacyclovir. Observed retinitis resolved in 100% of affected eyes, with a median time to complete resolution of 21 days. None of the patients experienced either disease reactivation or second eye involvement over the course of the study.

The body of evidence suggests that oral and intravenous therapy have comparable outcomes and that either is effective for induction therapy. However, future studies should directly compare oral versus intravenous antiviral therapy in the initial management of acute retinal necrosis (ARN).

One patient, with HIV co-infection successfully treated with HAART (CD4 count > 500 cells/mm³ and undetectable viral load), presented with disseminated herpes zoster virus infection and bilateral ARN. The median age at disease onset was 38 years (range 30 to 82 years), and the mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 14 days (range 1 to 28 days). Two patients were HIV positive (patients 6 and 8); however, the remaining seven patients did not have a history suggestive of underlying immune dysfunction. All ten eyes had at least one discrete focus of peripheral retinal necrosis. Four eyes had zone 2 disease and three eyes had zone 1 disease. Three eyes had prominent vitritis, and two of these also had optic disc edema.

- **Clinical findings and response to treatment with oral valacyclovir**:
	- Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was identified as the most likely causative virus in five eyes from four patients. This was proven by PCR in two cases, and presumed in two additional patients: one with disseminated herpes zoster at the time of presentation (patient 8), and one with a history of recent chicken pox infection (patient 2).

	- VZV = Varicella zoster virus; HSV = Herpes simplex virus; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; CFs = count fingers; HMs = hand movements; LP = perception of light; OFSI = Orbital floor corticosteroid injection; RD = retinal detachment.

### Valacyclovir for episodic treatment of genital herpes: A shorter 3-day treatment course compared with 5-day treatment [^112WyJ88]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Valacyclovir, given in a 5-day regimen of 500 mg twice per day, is effective as short-term treatment for episodes of genital herpes. This study compared the efficacy of a shorter, 3-day course (for 402 patients) with that of a 5-day course (for 398 patients) of valacyclovir for individuals with frequent recurrence of symptoms. No significant differences were detected between the two dosing schedules for any of the endpoints measured. Median times to lesion healing, duration of pain, and episode length for the 5-day versus 3-day treatments were 4.7 versus 4.4 days, 2.5 days versus 2.9 days, and 4.4 days versus 4.3 days, respectively. The proportions of patients with aborted lesions were 26.6% and 25.4% in the 5-day and 3-day groups, respectively. A 3-day course of 500 mg of valacyclovir administered twice daily as episodic treatment for genital herpes is equivalent to a 5-day course with regard to key markers of efficacy.

### Standard-dose and high-dose daily antiviral therapy for short episodes of genital HSV-2 reactivation: three randomised, open-label, cross-over trials [^1153rDDL]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Skin and mucosal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) shedding predominantly occurs in short subclinical episodes. We assessed whether standard-dose or high-dose antiviral therapy reduces the frequency of such shedding.

- **Methods**: HSV-2-seropositive, HIV-seronegative people were enrolled at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic (WA, USA). We conducted three separate but complementary open-label cross-over studies that compared no medication with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (standard-dose aciclovir), valaciclovir 500 mg daily (standard-dose valaciclovir) with aciclovir 800 mg three times daily (high-dose aciclovir), and standard-dose valaciclovir with valaciclovir 1 g three times daily (high-dose valaciclovir). The allocation sequence was generated by a random number generator, and study drugs were supplied in identical, numbered, sealed boxes. Study periods lasted 4–7 weeks, separated by a 1-week washout. Participants collected genital swabs four times daily for quantitative HSV DNA PCR. Clinical data were masked from laboratory personnel. The primary endpoint was the within-person comparison of the shedding rate in each study group. Analysis was per protocol. The trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00362297, NCT00723229, NCT01346475).

- **Results**: Of 113 participants randomized, 90 were eligible for analysis of the primary endpoint. Participants collected 23,605 swabs; 1,272 (5.4%) were HSV-positive. The frequency of HSV shedding was significantly higher in the no medication group (n = 384, 18.1% of swabs), than in the standard-dose aciclovir group (25, 1.2%).

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^111w9tUR]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Shingles coverage was modeled as either non-existent (no shingles vaccination) or similar to the estimated coverage values from the United States or the UK. Initial conditions for the vaccinated with shingles class were considered to be either 0 or part of the recovered from chickenpox class, depending on shingles coverage. The model simulated shingles coverage by moving individuals from the existing vaccinated with chickenpox and infected with chickenpox classes to the vaccinated with shingles class. Shingles length of immunity was considered to be either 5 years or lifelong. Lifelong immunity could be interpreted as every individual who received the shingles vaccine will continue to receive their booster dose, removing the possibility of an individual moving into the latent and susceptible to shingles class, or it could represent a new vaccine brought to market. All scenarios that included shingles vaccination also included one form of chickenpox vaccination, though sensitivity analyses were performed where no chickenpox vaccination occurred. All models were run for 100 years and implemented with the R package pomp.

Though most of the results and discussion are focused on the vaccination scenarios listed in the study, overall these simulations varied chickenpox vaccine coverage (0–100%), chickenpox vaccine effectiveness (79.5% or 100%), chickenpox vaccination duration of immunity (20 or 40 years), shingles vaccine coverage (0–100%), and shingles vaccination duration of immunity (5 years or lifetime).

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^117VhEe4]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

The acute HZ burden of illness values over 14, 30, and 90 days, measured by BOI‐14 AUC, BOI‐30 AUC, and BOI‐90 AUC, were evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. This model controlled for age stratified into two categories (50‐69 and ≥ 70 years), sex, and baseline pain.

The main efficacy analyses were conducted on a modified intent‐to‐treat population (MITT2). This population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug, excluding those whose lesion swabs were positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and negative for VZV by PCR. The acute HZ burden of illness over 30 days, measured by BOI‐30 AUC, was evaluated using an F test from an ANCOVA model, controlling for age, gender, and baseline level of pain. BOI‐14 AUC and BOI‐90 AUC were evaluated in the same manner. A sample size of at least 333 patients (111 per arm) was calculated to achieve 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC in the FV‐100 treated group compared to the valacyclovir treated group, with a 2‐sided α of 0.05 and a valacyclovir mean BOI‐30 AUC of 91 (SD 60) in the study.

The incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) at 90 days after lesion appearance was summarized by treatment group and evaluated using the chi‐square test from a logistic regression. The severity of PHN was evaluated using a Poisson model controlling for treatment group, age, sex, and concomitant pain medication. Clinically significant pain (CSP) was defined as a worst pain score greater than 3, as reported on the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI).

For each study day, treatment group means and corresponding data were analyzed.

### Low-dose valacyclovir for postherpetic neuralgia in the Zoster Eye Disease Study: A randomized clinical trial [^113wRzv7]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

The ZEDS (postherpetic neuralgia) study was published in 2025 in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. This research focused on postherpetic neuralgia and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The trial investigated the effect of suppressive valacyclovir treatment in patients experiencing pain secondary to herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The study was designed as a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT).

The study population consisted of 73 patients, 43 female and 30 male. Inclusion criteria required participants to be adult, immunocompetent, nonpregnant individuals with a history of herpes zoster ophthalmicus rash and documented keratitis or iritis within the previous year. Key exclusion criteria included immunocompromised status, renal insufficiency, allergy or adverse reaction to valacyclovir or acyclovir, a history of vaccination against zoster within one month prior to enrollment, keratorefractive surgery, pregnancy or lactation, and incarceration.

The interventions were as follows: 34 patients received valacyclovir (oral dose of 1,000 mg daily for 12 months), and 39 patients received a matching placebo for the same duration. The primary outcome indicated no significant difference in the prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia at 12 months (38% vs. 40%; ARD -2.5, 95% CI -25.8 to 20.8). However, a significant decrease in mean pain duration at 18 months was observed in secondary outcomes (13.6 months vs. 18.7 months; MD -3.3).

### Tomorrow's challenges for herpesvirus management: Potential applications of valacyclovir [^114Fz2WS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Controlled trials suggest that acyclovir/valacyclovir can provide significant clinical benefits when used for prophylaxis in the immunocompromised host. These findings implicate herpesvirus(es) in the pathogenesis of complex medical conditions, including graft rejection and death. However, it is not known which of the eight herpesviruses are important under particular circumstances. Prime candidates for triggering adverse outcomes are cytomegalovirus (CMV) in solid organ transplant recipients (causing rejection) and CMV and human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) in bone marrow transplant patients (causing marrow suppression). Additionally, herpes simplex virus, HHV-6, and CMV in AIDS patients may accelerate the rate of human immunodeficiency virus disease progression and death. Other diseases that may have a herpesvirus component or trigger susceptible antiviral agents include atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis. In the future, clinicians should be alert to novel findings of randomized trials that may provide insight into the pathogenesis of these diseases and the contributions made by clinically silent herpesvirus infections.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^113hPZTF]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

In the post-hoc analysis, the 400 mg dose of FV-100 provided a 20% reduction in the burden of illness for pain in both the 14–90 day periods and 30–90 day periods when compared to valacyclovir. Patients receiving the 400 mg dose of FV-100 experienced on average a 37% reduction in the incidence of PHN over valacyclovir. The proportions of patients on valacyclovir 3000 mg experiencing PHN were comparable to those from previously published reports, which lends validity to the overall design of the study. Average pain scores demonstrated consistent improvement over the 3 months of the study for the FV-100 400 mg group. The consistent advantages of FV-100 over valacyclovir indicate that FV-100 supports a therapeutic role for this new agent in the reduction of subacute and chronic HZ-associated pain.

We acknowledge that the assessment of pain is a relatively subjective measure. However, the ZBPI, developed from the standard Brief Pain Inventory for use in clinical trials for an anti-HZ vaccine, is a validated instrument for the measurement of HZ-associated pain and the effect of that pain on functional activities of daily living. This index measures the impact of HZ and PHN across all four domains of health: physical, psychological, social, and functional, and is a sensitive and reliable measure of the impact of HZ and PHN on patients' daily lives. In addition, the use of a worst pain score of ≥ 3 in the definition of PHN has been validated as part of the development of the ZBPI and reflects a consensus that this level of pain constitutes clinically meaningful impact.

### Zoster prophylaxis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using acyclovir/valacyclovir followed by vaccination [^112Vb8MN]. Blood Advances (2016). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease, usually cutaneous zoster, occurs frequently after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), resulting in postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) that significantly impacts quality of life. The optimal prophylaxis of VZV disease and PHN has not been established.

At our center, VZV prophylaxis before 2008 consisted of approximately 1 year of post-HCT acyclovir/valacyclovir, referred to as the "old strategy". In contrast, post-2008 prophylaxis extended to 2 years of acyclovir/valacyclovir followed by immunization using the varicella vaccine, known as the "new strategy".

We conducted a retrospective study to compare the cumulative incidences of VZV disease and PHN between patients who completed the old strategy (n = 153) and those who completed the new strategy (n = 125). Results demonstrated that patients on the old strategy had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of VZV disease (33% vs. 17% at 5 years, P ≤ .01) and PHN (8% vs. 0% at 5 years, P = 0.02).

In conclusion, VZV prophylaxis consisting of 2 years of acyclovir/valacyclovir followed by vaccination appears to effectively reduce the incidence of VZV disease and may eliminate PHN altogether.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^117E7CsZ]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The duration of pain in vaccine recipients in the Shingles Prevention Study was investigated. The graph compares vaccine recipients who developed herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN; 315/19,254 recipients) with placebo recipients who developed the disease (641/19,247 recipients). Compared with the placebo, Zostavax reduced PHN incidence defined as pain at different cut-off times for the duration of pain. Pain persisting at 90 days was reduced by 67%. For the total population and the sub-groups stratified according to sex, the incidence of PHN in each treatment group (vaccine or placebo) was the weighted average of the observed incidence of PHN stratified according to age group, with weights proportional to the total number of person-years of follow-up in each age group.

In an adverse event substudy of the Shingles Prevention Study, rates of serious adverse events were higher in the vaccine group (1.9%) than in the placebo group (1.3%). Injection site reactions were more frequent among vaccine recipients than those taking placebo (48.3% versus 16.6%, respectively), but were generally mild.

The impact of vaccination on quality of life (QoL) was assessed in the entire study population of the Shingles Prevention Study using ZBPI and ZIQ questionnaires. Mean ZBPI and ZIQ scores, which rated the 'interference' of herpes zoster (HZ) and PHN with activities of daily living (ADL), were used to calculate a 'severity of interference score'. For the entire study population, zoster vaccination reduced the ZBPI severity of interference by 66% (95% confidence interval; CI: 55, 74) and the ZIQ severity of interference by 68% (95% CI: 57, 77).

### Valacyclovir for the suppression of recurrent genital herpes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects [^111wgi6F]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily) for the suppression of recurrent genital herpes simplex virus infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial was conducted. A total of 293 HIV-seropositive subjects receiving antiretroviral therapy were enrolled. The proportion of subjects who did not have a recurrence of genital herpes at 6 months was 65% among valacyclovir recipients versus 26% among placebo recipients (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.8–3.5). The time to first genital herpes recurrence was significantly shorter in the placebo group (median, 59 days) than in the valacyclovir group (median, > 180 days). Valacyclovir was well tolerated; the incidence of adverse events for the two treatment groups was similar when the duration of treatment was considered. There were no episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy. Valacyclovir was safe and effective for the suppression of recurrent genital herpes infection in HIV-infected individuals.

### Viremia in acute herpes zoster [^114Axb19]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

A phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a topical antiviral, sorivudine, as an adjuvant to valacyclovir for the treatment of acute herpes zoster.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 25 patients were treated with either sorivudine or placebo cream. All patients began 7 days of valacyclovir treatment on day 3. Zoster lesion swab samples and samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected periodically throughout the study and were analyzed for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA by use of both qualitative and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples collected periodically throughout the study were analyzed for VZV DNA by use of real-time polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: VZV DNA was detected in all 3 sample types, and the number of viral copies correlated with the progression of herpes zoster. No statistically significant differences were seen between the placebo- and sorivudine-treated groups with respect to clinical characteristics or laboratory test results.

- **Conclusion**: The detection of VZV DNA in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all 25 zoster patients documents that viremia is a common manifestation of herpes zoster. Sorivudine cream appears to be a safe and well-tolerated adjuvant therapy; however, further phase 2 studies are needed to determine its clinical efficacy for the treatment of herpes zoster.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^111GTbap]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia is known to cause the largest burden of illness for patients with herpes zoster. A significant proportion of patients with herpes zoster develop postherpetic neuralgia despite treatment with antiviral agents. These antivirals require dosing regimens (3–5 times daily) that must be modified for patients with renal impairment. The medications used to treat the pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia often fall short in terms of relief for many patients. Additionally, pain medications are only palliative and do not provide a cure for herpes zoster. Hence, a drug with greater antiviral activity, the ability to prevent postherpetic neuralgia, better pain relief, and a more simplified dosing regimen is needed.

Although there was no statistically significant difference among the treatment groups for the primary endpoint of BOI-30 AUC, a difference between the FV-100 400 mg and valacyclovir groups emerged in the 90-day period data (a 14% reduction), suggesting a potential effect of FV-100 on subacute and chronic pain. Numerical differences in the incidence and severity of postherpetic neuralgia at 90 days favored both doses of FV-100 over valacyclovir. These results represent a clinically meaningful reduction in pain with FV-100. Faster resolution of pain in both the FV-100 groups compared to valacyclovir was consistently noted, with potential dose effects observed between the two FV-100 groups. The mean duration of herpes zoster-associated pain was shorter in the FV-100 groups compared with the valacyclovir group. Likewise, the resolution of herpes zoster-associated pain was quicker, and a higher proportion of patients achieved a permanent resolution of this pain in the FV-100 groups.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^117S5dFj]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel‐group, comparative study of FV‐100 versus valacyclovir in patients with HZ conducted at 90 centers in the United States between May 2009 and December 2010. Patients who presented within 72 hours of zoster rash and met all eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups: 1) FV‐100 200 mg QD; 2) FV‐100 400 mg QD; or 3) valacyclovir 3000 mg (1000 mg TID). Patients were centrally randomized by an interactive web response system and stratified by age category.

The primary endpoint was the reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC, a standardized score measuring the overall severity of pain experienced by study subjects during the 30 days after the first dose of study drug (see section 2.3). A sample size of at least 333 patients (111 per arm) was calculated to achieve 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC in the FV‐100 treated group compared to the valacyclovir‐treated group. Estimates of BOI‐30 AUC and SD (constant SD across treatment arms) were extrapolated from the Zostavax Shingles Prevention Study and the ZBPI validation study.

All eligible patients were treated for 7 days and followed through Day 30. Patients who continued to have HZ‐associated pain or whose rashes had not healed by Day 30 were followed through Day 90 or until their rash healed and they had two documented Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) scores.
