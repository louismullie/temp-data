## Question

Signs of testicular torsion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs of testicular torsion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and why it is an emergency. Then, I should verify the cardinal symptoms and their timing. Next, I will examine the key physical findings, including the cremasteric reflex and testicular position. After that, I need to check for atypical presentations and how they mislead clinicians. Then, I will review imaging signs, especially ultrasound features that can be falsely reassuring. Finally, I should integrate decision tools and time-sensitive management implications, and close with a concise synthesis of the most reliable signs and what to do when they are present.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its urgency. Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord that obstructs testicular blood flow, producing ischemia and constituting a surgical emergency where salvage drops with delay; the classic teaching cites a 4–8 hour window before irreversible damage, though salvage can still occur beyond this in some cases, so I should be cautious not to overstate a rigid cutoff [^d09fde52] [^c0328c93].

> I will now examine the cardinal symptoms. Sudden, severe, unilateral scrotal pain is the hallmark, often radiating to the groin or lower abdomen, and frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting; importantly, about 10% of patients present with isolated abdominal pain, which can delay diagnosis, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion in boys with acute abdominal pain and check the scrotum [^d09fde52] [^3d9f8e5f] [^6c2a191f].

> Next, I should review the physical examination findings. Let me verify the most reliable bedside sign: an absent or decreased cremasteric reflex on the affected side is highly suggestive, though not absolutely universal, and I must remember exceptions where the reflex is preserved despite torsion; a high-riding, horizontally oriented testis that is tender and firm is common, and diffuse testicular tenderness with swelling may be present; scrotal erythema and edema can develop later, so their absence early does not reassure me [^d09fde52] [^ce1a9a03] [^b38b4c1d] [^3d9f8e5f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about atypical features. I should double-check for red flags that mislead clinicians: isolated abdominal or flank pain, dysuria or urinary frequency, leg pain, recent trauma, or even a painless scrotal mass in neonates can obscure the diagnosis; in infants and neonates, presentations are often subtle, with minimal pain or just a firm, discolored scrotal mass, and in cryptorchid or inguinal testes, torsion may present as a tender groin mass rather than scrotal pain, so I need to examine the groin and scrotum systematically in all boys with acute pain [^6c2a191f] [^f2a7c18a] [^4a70b524] [^0cb1c778].

> I need to check imaging signs carefully because they can be deceptive. On Doppler ultrasound, absent or markedly decreased intratesticular flow supports torsion, but wait, let me verify the pitfall: preserved or even symmetric flow does not exclude torsion, especially in partial or intermittent torsion; direct visualization of a twisted spermatic cord ("whirlpool" or "snail-shell" sign) is a key diagnostic anchor when flow is preserved, and heterogeneity of testicular echotexture suggests nonviability and late torsion, which should not delay exploration if clinical suspicion is high [^1a862700] [^7caa5cd7] [^9af6b774] [^9029efa9].

> Let me consider decision tools and how they fit. The TWIST score uses five clinical items — testicular swelling, hard testis, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea or vomiting, and high-riding testis — to stratify risk; a score of 5 or more is high risk and warrants immediate urology consultation and exploration, whereas lower scores support ultrasound, but I should confirm that any high-suspicion case should proceed to surgery without waiting for imaging if logistics allow [^e9600f9f] [^f4600cf1].

> I should confirm the time-sensitive management implications. If history and examination suggest torsion, emergent surgical exploration should not be delayed for imaging; manual detorsion can be attempted as a temporizing measure while arranging surgery, and I must remember that salvage is time-dependent but variable, with some testes remaining viable beyond 6 hours depending on torsion degree and tightness, so I should avoid anchoring on a fixed window and instead act urgently when suspicion is high [^d09fde52] [^859a731b] [^0b3b9fd3].

> But wait, what if the presentation is neonatal or perinatal. In neonates, torsion is often extravaginal and frequently prenatal, presenting as a firm, nontransluminant scrotal mass with bluish discoloration and absent cremasteric reflex; salvage is rare, yet bilateral asynchronous torsion is not uncommon, so immediate ultrasound and urgent exploration are still recommended to confirm diagnosis and protect the contralateral testis [^1a621877] [^672b5fce].

> Let me synthesize the most reliable signs so I do not miss the diagnosis. The combination of sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain with an absent or decreased cremasteric reflex and a high-riding, tender, firm testis is the strongest clinical triad; nausea and vomiting increase suspicion, while preserved Doppler flow or atypical pain locations should not reassure me when the clinical picture fits torsion, prompting immediate urologic consultation and exploration without delay [^d09fde52] [^b38b4c1d] [^3d9f8e5f].

---

Testicular torsion presents with **sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain** [^d09fde52] often accompanied by nausea and vomiting [^3d9f8e5f], and an **absent or decreased cremasteric reflex** [^ce1a9a03] is a key physical finding [^b38b4c1d]. The affected testis is typically high-riding, tender, and swollen [^d09fde52], and may lie horizontally [^e354f44c]; scrotal erythema and edema can develop later [^8dff5465]. Prehn's sign is unreliable and should not be used to rule out torsion [^6f31f287]. Prompt recognition is critical because salvage drops sharply after 6–12 hours [^c294a2a5]; if torsion is suspected, **immediate urology consultation and surgical exploration are indicated** [^f4600cf1], even if imaging is normal [^3d9f8e5f].

## Clinical signs and symptoms

### Pain characteristics

- **Sudden onset**: Severe, unilateral scrotal pain that may radiate to the groin, abdomen, or flank [^d09fde52] [^d4a4b208].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common systemic symptoms due to visceral pain [^d09fde52] [^3d9f8e5f].
- **Atypical pain**: Rarely, isolated abdominal or flank pain without scrotal symptoms, especially in children [^6c2a191f] [^52193892].

---

### Physical examination findings

- **Absent or decreased cremasteric reflex**: Highly sensitive for torsion; present in ~100% of cases in some series, though exceptions occur [^ce1a9a03] [^b38b4c1d].
- **High-riding testis**: The affected testis lies higher and more anterior, often horizontally oriented [^d09fde52] [^e354f44c].
- **Tender, swollen testis**: Diffuse tenderness and swelling with a firm, edematous scrotum [^d09fde52] [^8dff5465].
- **Scrotal erythema and edema**: Develop later as ischemia progresses [^8dff5465].
- **Prehn's sign**: Unreliable; pain may lessen with elevation in some cases, but this does not exclude torsion [^6f31f287].

---

## Imaging findings

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** [^1a862700] and typically shows absent or decreased intratesticular flow on color Doppler [^ebd8c252]; however, preserved flow does not exclude torsion, especially in partial or intermittent cases [^7caa5cd7]. Direct visualization of a twisted spermatic cord ("whirlpool sign") is a highly specific sonographic finding [^9af6b774] [^eb9863ab].

---

## Time-sensitive nature

Testicular salvage depends on the **duration of ischemia** [^c3c45d36]. Salvage rates are ~90% if detorsion occurs within 6 hours, drop to 20–50% by 6–12 hours, and fall below 10% after 12–24 hours [^c294a2a5] [^7ce709e8]. Delayed presentation is common and increases orchiectomy risk [^42340593] [^20f139ae].

## Summary of key signs

| **Clinical feature** | **Frequency** | **Reliability** |
|-|-|-|
| Sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain | Very common | High |
| Nausea/vomiting | Common | Moderate |
| Absent cremasteric reflex | Common | High |
| High-riding, tender, swollen testis | Common | High |
| Scrotal erythema/edema | Late finding | Moderate |
| Prehn's sign | Unreliable | Low |

---

Testicular torsion is a clinical emergency characterized by **sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain**, an absent or decreased cremasteric reflex, and a high-riding, tender, swollen testis [^d09fde52]. Immediate urology consultation and surgical exploration are indicated when torsion is suspected, as delays markedly reduce salvage [^f4600cf1].

### In emergency settings, can a negative Prehn's sign be used to aid diagnosis of testicular torsion? [^6f31f287]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Prehn's sign describes the eradication of testicular pain on lifting the scrotum and has been proposed as a method to differentiate causes of acute testicular pain. A short systematic review was conducted to evaluate the question: in patients presenting with acute unilateral testicular pain, is a negative Prehn's sign an accurate sign for diagnosis of testicular torsion (TT)?Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the OVID interface from inception to 26 February 2025. Following the removal of duplicates, the search strategy yielded a total of 11 papers. Study information, participant group, relevant outcomes and study weaknesses were extracted from each article. Four studies addressed the three-part question. The only study that had the full text available for review found that 33% of patients with TT had a positive Prehn's sign, which equated to an OR of 5.941 (95% CI 1.432 to 24.658). Of the three remaining retrospective cohort studies, Prehn's sign was reported to be positive in 10.5%, 37.5% and 100% of patients with TT, respectively. Therefore, the negativity of Prehn's sign ranged from 0% to 89.5% in patients with TT. The clinical bottom line is that Prehn's sign is insufficiently sensitive to rule out TT; however, its negativity increases the likelihood of a TT diagnosis.

### Testicular torsion: diagnosis, evaluation, and management [^d09fde52]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents and is a surgical emergency affecting 3.8 per 100,000 males younger than 18 years annually. It accounts for 10% to 15% of acute scrotal disease in children, and results in an orchiectomy rate of 42% in boys undergoing surgery for testicular torsion. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary for testicular salvage, and torsion must be excluded in all patients who present with acute scrotum. Testicular torsion is a clinical diagnosis, and patients typically present with severe acute unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination may reveal a high-riding testicle with an absent cremasteric reflex. If history and physical examination suggest torsion, immediate surgical exploration is indicated and should not be postponed to perform imaging studies. There is typically a four- to eight-hour window before permanent ischemic damage occurs. Delay in treatment may be associated with decreased fertility, or may necessitate orchiectomy.

Testicular torsion is one of the few emergencies in pediatric urology which requires an accurate and timely diagnosis in order to avoid testis loss. It is not an uncommon event affecting a young male population. In fact, testicular torsion is more common than testicular tumors for this same age group, yet testicular torsion has not been given the public attention it deserves as a male health risk. In this review we highlight the new information published over the past four years regarding testicular torsion. We will discuss a variety of topics associated with torsion including: medical legal issues, etiology and genetics, imaging diagnostics, innovative surgical techniques, management controversies, fertility, and new drug therapies.

### Testicular torsion revisited [^699d7e83]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is routinely used for the assessment and diagnosis of testicular torsion. It has proven to be a reliable and necessary diagnostic tool for the urologist. Problems, however, can arise in the form of misdiagnosis when the basic pathophysiology and clinical presentation of testicular torsion are not clearly understood. In this pictorial review, we present the spectrum of the appearance of testes with testicular torsion. This includes both complete and incomplete torsion. The critical use of Doppler and the interpretation of the Doppler findings will be presented. Other abnormalities that can be potentially confused with testicular torsion, including epididymitis and orchitis, will be shown. An approach to assessing the testis that stresses the critical role of both Doppler examination and an understanding of the clinical presentation will be presented. In particular, in incomplete torsion, a Doppler examination will still demonstrate flow to the testis, potentially leading to a missed diagnosis if the clinical presentation is not considered. Examples of normal and abnormal anatomy will be presented.

### Testicular torsion [^006200bb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Each year, testicular torsion affects one in 4,000 males younger than 25 years. Early diagnosis and definitive management are the keys to avoid testicular loss. All prepubertal and young adult males with acute scrotal pain should be considered to have testicular torsion until proven otherwise. The finding of an ipsilateral absent cremasteric reflex is the most accurate sign of testicular torsion. Torsion of the appendix testis is more common in children than testicular torsion and may be diagnosed by the "blue dot sign" (i.e., tender nodule with blue discoloration on the upper pole of the testis). Epididymitis/orchitis is much less common in the prepubertal male, and the diagnosis should be made with caution in this age group. Doppler ultrasonography may be needed for definitive diagnosis; radionuclide scintigraphy is an alternative that may be more accurate but should be ordered only if it can be performed without delay. Diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on the finding of decreased or absent blood flow on the ipsilateral side. Treatment involves rapid restoration of blood flow to the affected testis. The optimal time frame is less than six hours after the onset of symptoms. Manual detorsion by external rotation of the testis can be successful, but restoration of blood flow must be confirmed following the maneuver. Surgical exploration provides definitive treatment for the affected testis by orchiopexy and allows for prophylactic orchiopexy of the contralateral testis. Surgical treatment of torsion of the appendix testis is not mandatory but hastens recovery.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: testicular torsion [^3d9f8e5f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of testicular torsion, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that occurs with rotation of the testicle along its supporting ligaments leading to obstruction of vascular flow. A key risk factor is the presence of a bell-clapper deformity. The most common population affected includes children in a bimodal distribution with the most cases occurring in the first year of life and between 12 and 18 years, although cases do occur in adults. Acute, severe, unilateral scrotal pain is the most common presenting symptom. Nausea and vomiting are common, but the presence or absence of a cremasteric reflex is not a reliable indicator of disease. The TWIST score may assist with clinical decision making in patients presenting with acute testicular pain but should not be used in isolation. If torsion is suspected or confirmed, consultation with the urology specialist should not be delayed, as outcomes are time sensitive. Ultrasound can be used for diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent urology consultation for surgical exploration and detorsion, as well as symptomatic therapy in the ED. Manual detorsion can be attempted in the ED while awaiting transfer or consultation.

Conclusions

An understanding of testicular torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### Scrotal emergencies [^374fe7e6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as an acute painful swelling of the scrotum or its contents, accompanied by local signs or general symptoms. Early identification and skillful management of testicular torsion is critical, as it may threaten testicular viability and future fertility if not managed expediently and appropriately. The cremasteric reflex and testicular sonography are frequently used, yet imperfect, diagnostic tools in assessing for testicular torsion. Other emergent conditions include incarcerated inguinal hernia, Fournier's gangrene, and any form of genitourinary trauma until proven otherwise. This article reviews the evaluation and management of the acute scrotum in the emergency department.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to suspect spermatic cord (testicular) torsion in patients with a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis, especially in adolescents and patients without evidence of inflammation or infection.

### The nontraumatic, acute scrotum [^85d5c1ca]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Regardless of age, any presentation of an acute scrotum requires prompt triage and immediate evaluation. The potential for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality exists if timely diagnosis and treatment are provided. Often overlooked, an early scrotal examination in the emergency department may produce the most accurate information into the underlying pathologic process, be it systemic or localized to the scrotum. Although the immediately lethal conditions presenting as acute scrotal pain should be considered, the combined incidence and morbidity associated with testicular torsion make its exclusion paramount in acute scrotal presentations. Similarly, a painless scrotal mass must be assumed to be a testicular neoplasm until proven otherwise, with appropriate work-up and rapid urologic follow-up assured.

### Pediatric testicular torsion [^7fd43e2a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The pediatric patient presenting with acute scrotal pain requires prompt evaluation and management given the likelihood of testicular torsion as the underlying cause. Although other diagnoses can present with acute testicular pain, it is important to recognize the possibility of testicular torsion because the best chance of testicular preservation occurs with expeditious management. When testicular torsion is suspected, prompt surgical exploration is warranted. A delay in surgical management should not occur in an effort to obtain confirmatory imaging. When torsion is discovered, the contralateral testicle should undergo fixation to reduce the risk of asynchronous torsion.

### Development and initial validation of a scoring system to diagnose testicular torsion in children [^e9600f9f]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Testicular Workup for Ischaemia and Suspected Torsion score (TWIST score)" for testicular torsion.

The Testicular Workup for Ischaemia and Suspected Torsion score (TWIST score) is a clinical tool designed for the evaluation of acute scrotal pain, specifically to differentiate testicular torsion from other causes. The target patient population includes individuals presenting with acute scrotal pain, where timely diagnosis is crucial to prevent testicular loss.

The primary components of the TWIST score include five clinical findings: testicular swelling, hard testes, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea or vomiting, and high-riding testis. Each of these components contributes to the overall score, which guides the subsequent management strategy.

The Testicular Workup for Ischaemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score calculator evaluates the likelihood of testicular torsion based on user responses to five specific clinical signs or symptoms. Each of these inputs is associated with a predefined point value.

The calculator takes the following inputs:

- **Testicular swelling**: 2 points if true
- **Hard testes**: 2 points if true
- **Absent cremasteric reflex**: 1 point if true
- **Nausea or vomiting**: 1 point if true
- **High-riding testis**: 1 point if true

Each response might be a boolean value (true or false). For every true input, the respective points are added to calculate the total TWIST score, which ranges from 0 to a maximum of 7 points.

The interpretation of the TWIST score is provided based on the cumulative sum as follows:

1. **High risk (score ≥ 5)**: A score of 5 or more indicates a high risk with a 100% positive predictive value for testicular torsion. It suggests that prompt urological consultation and likely surgery are required.
2. **Intermediate risk (score 3–4)**: A score between 3 and 4 signifies an intermediate risk, necessitating an ultrasound for further evaluation.
3. **Low risk (score ≤ 2)**: A score of 2 or less reflects a low risk with a 100% negative predictive value for testicular torsion, typically meaning that an ultrasound is not generally required.

### Testicular torsion: a review [^28eb5afa]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Torsion of the testis, also referred to as torsion of the spermatic cord, is a subject of debate among physicians and surgeons. Testicular torsion is an acute vascular event causing the rotation of the vascular pedicle of the testis, thereby impeding the blood flow to the testis and the scrotal contents. It could be either within or outside the tunica vaginalis. Testicular torsion causes immediate circulatory changes and long-term sequelae such as testicular function and fertility. It is considered a surgical emergency, as a delay causes irreversible testicular damage. The diagnosis and treatment of testicular torsion are discussed in this review, which also illustrates an algorithm and a scoring system for the diagnosis and management of this condition based on current literature.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute onset of Scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^f78e5263]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as 6 hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### What matters in testicular torsion? Association of hospital transfer, race and socioeconomic factors with testicular outcomes in a single center experience [^c0328c93]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that is managed with either septopexy-only or tunica vaginalis flap with septopexy if the testis is potentially viable or orchiectomy if not. Minimizing time from ischemia onset to surgery maximizes the likelihood of testicular preservation. While factors such as time from door to OR can be easily targeted, others such as inequalities in access to care are more difficult to address.

Objective

We sought to determine whether patient transfer affects testicular outcomes intraoperatively and in the long-term. Secondary goals included investigating the impact of race and Child Opportunity Index (COI) on testicular torsion outcomes and defining the optimal time cutoff from symptom onset to presentation that predicts salvage.

Methods

We reviewed our prospective testicular torsion database to identify boys who underwent operative intervention for testicular torsion between January 2015 and March 2022. The association of race and COI with testicular salvage, defined as septopexy-only, was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression controlling for time to presentation, while the association of transfer with salvage was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, time to presentation, and time to OR. To determine the optimal cutoff for time to presentation to predict testicular salvage, the Youden index was calculated.

Results

Race and COI were not associated with testicular salvage on either univariate or multivariate logistic regression that controlled for time to presentation. Transfer status was not associated with salvage, while age, time from symptoms to presentation, and time from institutional arrival to OR were associated with salvage. The optimal time cutoff to predict salvage using the Youden index was 10.5 hours from symptom onset to presentation and 14.5 hours from symptom onset to detorsion.

Discussion

Time to presentation was the strongest, modifiable risk factor associated with testicular salvage. As it may be difficult for children to accurately communicate their symptoms, diagnosis and prompt management of testicular torsion can be delayed. Improvement in outcomes can be achieved by placing greater efforts into patient, parental, and primary care provider education of the signs and symptoms of testicular torsion.

Conclusions

Race, COI, and transfer status were not found to have a statistically significant effect on testicular salvage outcomes in patients presenting with testicular torsion. Despite the common premise of a 6-hour window until testicular loss, we found that intervention within the acute window of 14.5 hours from symptom onset is still associated with salvage.

### Scrotal masses [^7ce709e8]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### Perinatal testicular torsion: a unique strategy [^672b5fce]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Perinatal testicular torsion (PTT) is defined as testicular torsion occurring prenatally or within the first 30 days of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the data obtained from patients with PTT and propose principles of management based on clinical, surgical, and histologic findings.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 27 boys seen between 1990 and 2005 with surgically documented PTT was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 groups: A, prenatal testicular torsion; B, postnatal testicular torsion. The presence of acute scrotal inflammatory signs defined the urgency to operate.

Results

There were 4 clinical pictures in group A: A1, patients with a nubbin testis (n = 3); A2, patients with a small and hard testis (n = 12); A3, patients with a normal-sized and hard testis (n = 8); and A4, patients with an acute scrotum (n = 2). Group B (n = 2) presented no sign after birth and later developed an acute scrotum. Surgical exploration and histologic examination showed clear signs of a long-standing testicular torsion in groups A1, A2, and A3 or a recent-onset testicular torsion in groups A4 and B. Only one testis could be salvaged (group B).

Conclusions

Clinical signs correlated very well with surgical and histologic findings and can define the need and the urgency to operate. Although testicular salvage rate is very low, the affected side always should be explored to confirm the diagnosis and to fix or remove the affected testicle. The contralateral scrotum also should be explored because of the risk of asynchronous contralateral testicular torsion.

Scrotal pain is a common acute presentation for medical care. Testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis are two diagnoses for which early detection is critical and their sonographic imaging features have been thoroughly described in the radiologic literature. Other important conditions for which radiologists must be aware have received less attention.

Testicular torsion is a rare, yet often underrecognized, cause of scrotal pain in adult men. Few reports have commented on testicular torsion in the geriatric population. We report a case of a 68-year-old man initially diagnosed with epididymo-orchitis, who, on surgical exploration, was found to have intravaginal testicular torsion. The diagnosis in this patient population is often delayed, leading to poor salvage rates. The use of color Doppler ultrasonography should be strongly considered if the history and physical examination is suggestive of testicular torsion, regardless of patient age.

### Surge in testicular torsion in pediatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [^d78742be]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion is a pediatric surgical emergency, and prompt diagnosis and treatment is imperative. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric patients with symptoms of testicular torsion may be reluctant to seek medical care which increases the likelihood of delayed presentation and the need for an orchiectomy. This observational study sought to determine whether there was a higher number of testicular torsion cases during COVID-19.

Methods

As the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our facility on March 6, 2020, we identified male children ages 1–18 years with testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 (during COVID-19) compared to the same time period between 2015 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). All patients were evaluated at our Institution's Emergency Department by a pediatric urologist.

Results

There were 38 cases of testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 compared to 15.8 cases on average during the same 10-month period between 2015 and 2019 (a total of 79 cases). There was a statistically significant increase in testicular torsion cases during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to equivalent time periods in 2015–2019 (38 vs. 15.8, p = 0.05). Patients with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic were younger, had a longer duration of symptoms, and had a higher number of orchiectomies (although not statistically significant).

Conclusion

During the COVID-19 pandemic, an escalation in testicular torsion cases was observed. Timely assessment, diagnosis, and surgery are crucial to prevent testicular loss and potential infertility in the future. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the surge in testicular torsion and possible mechanisms.

### Factors associated with delayed presentation and misdiagnosis of testicular torsion: a case-control study [^70ec91ff]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

We identified factors associated with delay in presentation and misdiagnosis of testicular torsion. Compared with acute cases, delayed presentations were more likely to report isolated abdominal pain, developmental disorders, and history of recent genital trauma. Failure to perform a genitourinary examination or scrotal imaging was associated with misdiagnosis.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^7caa5cd7]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Testicular sonography has contributed greatly to the preoperative diagnosis of testicular torsion in the pediatric patient and is the mainstay for evaluation of acute scrotal pain. Despite its high sensitivity and specificity, both false-negative and false-positive findings occur. Presence of documented Doppler flow within the testis might be a dissuading factor for surgical exploration with resultant testicular loss in the false-negative cases. Our goal is to illustrate key sonographic features in the spectrum of testicular torsion with preserved testicular flow, and to describe how to differentiate testicular torsion from epididymitis in order to avoid the under-diagnosis of testicular torsion. We simplify the anatomy of the bell clapper testis. We also describe our sonographic protocol for testicular torsion and share valuable tips from our approach to challenging cases.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^c294a2a5]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion (TT) is a urologic emergency where prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent testicular loss. TT can occur in male patients at any age, but there is a bimodal distribution which has been described with peaks within the first year of life and between ages 13–16 years old. The etiology of TT can be further classified into two broad categories: intravaginal and extravaginal. Intravaginal TT occurs when the testis twists completely within the tunica vaginalis. This mechanism is the most common etiology and is usually seen in individuals with a bilateral anatomic defect known as the bell clapper deformity. In extravaginal TT, there is a loose attachment between the tunica vaginalis and the scrotal wall early in prenatal development that increases the likelihood of the tunica vaginalis and its contents to twist around the spermatic cord, most commonly in the neonatal period.

Management is centered around prompt surgical exploration for every patient with a definitive diagnosis as well as those with inconclusive imaging due to the morbidity associated with delay in management. Delayed intervention can result in permanent ischemic injury of the testis that can lead to long term consequences including testicular loss and infertility. Irreversible ischemia from torsion begins in 6 h from symptom onset and the likelihood of testicular salvage is the highest within the first 6 hours. Based on prior literature, treatment with 6 h of symptom onset correlates with 90–100% chance of testicular salvage. However, treatment within 6–12 h decreases salvage rates to 20–50%, and treatment in the 12–24 h range affords only a 0–10% chance of testicular salvage. If surgery is delayed more than 24 h following symptom onset, testicular non-viability is almost inevitable even if the testicular tissue appears viable during surgical exploration. Due to factors such as patient preference, hospital capacity, and access to health care providers capable of managing TT, over 1/3rd of patients with suspected TT are transferred to a tertiary care facility for management, which increases total time of ischemic damage and morbidity.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^65e19eac]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Testicular gray-scale ultrasound is the modality of choice for the imaging evaluation of acute scrotal pain. The presence of intratesticular flow does not exclude testicular torsion. Testicular vascularity can look symmetrical with the contralateral asymptomatic side with preserved arterial and venous flow and still represent testicular torsion. An integral part of the exam is to look for an abrupt change in configuration of cord at the external inguinal ring or in the scrotal sac. The presence of redundant spermatic cord within the scrotum is highly suspicious for testicular torsion. An enlarged epididymal-cord complex representing the torsion knot/pseudomass is more frequently identified at the sonographic examination compared to the more classic whirlpool sign of twisted spermatic cord. Residual flow might be preserved in parts of the cord when the twist is not tight enough to completely obliterate the flow. An astute analysis of the cord and lie of the testis can prevent the overdiagnosis of epididymitis. We encourage the use of simultaneous cine clips of testes side-by-side at the start of the exam to document lie and assess inherent flow. A group discussion among the radiologist, emergency room physician and urologist is recommended for proper management; manual detorsion of the testis might be considered to improve chances of salvage while the patient awaits surgery.

### Identifying systems delays in assessment, diagnosis, and operative management for testicular torsion in a single-payer health-care system [^f85c66eb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion (TT) is a common pediatric urologic emergency. Management of TT is time sensitive and often confirmed on scrotal Doppler ultrasound (DUS). Acquiring DUS, however, can result in delays in the management of TT, affecting testicular salvage rates.

Objective

The objective of this study is to identify delays in the assessment and diagnosis for patients presenting with TT to a Canadian academic hospital using patient flow analysis.

Study Design

A retrospective review was performed for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) who received a scrotal DUS to rule out possible TT between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome measured cycle-time measurements (median time) between points along the clinical flow pathway for a patient with suspected TT. The secondary outcome assessed diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of standard scrotal DUS components (Doppler flow, arterial waveform, heterogeneous echotexture).

Results

A total of 609 patients presented with an acute scrotum warranting a scrotal DUS to rule out TT; of which, 46 underwent scrotal exploration. Testicular salvage rate was 82.6% in the series (38 testes salvaged, 8 required orchiectomy). Median time from symptom onset to ED presentation for patients with possible TT was 4 h. After triage, a median of 79.8 min was required for ED physician assessment and an additional 48 min for scrotal DUS to be performed. Absence of Doppler flow on scrotal DUS had a 97.4% PPV for diagnosing TT confirmed during scrotal exploration.

Discussion

Almost 4 h of in-ED time is required from triage to surgical intervention for potential TT at the institution. One area of delay is the time needed to conduct a scrotal DUS (48–128 min; Fig. 1). This represents an area of opportunity for patient flow optimization through the use of standardized clinical pathways and diagnostic adjuncts, such as point-of-care ultrasound. This study is limited in its retrospective nature and does not include patients with overt signs of TT who underwent surgical detorsion without need for scrotal DUS.

Conclusion

Patient flow delays to surgical intervention for patients with TT represent a preventable cause of orchiectomy in young men. This study identifies intervention points in patient-care flow pathways where delays to surgical intervention can be potentially reduced by up to 2 h. The findings support the need for further studies into the optimization of patient flow and management protocols to reduce delays in the diagnosis and management of TT.

### A rare cause of acute abdomen: testicular torsion in an inguinal undescended testis [^0cb1c778]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion is well-known urologic emergency. It warrants urgent diagnosis and surgical intervention for successful outcomes. The incidence of undescended testis in new born is 2%-8% and reduces to < 1% by 1 year of age. In majority of cases, it is located in inguinal canal. Though undescended testis is a known risk factor for testicular torsion, there are limited cases reports in the literature. Testicular torsion in undescended testis is difficult to diagnose due to vague symptoms and absence of testicular signs. We report a unique case of testicular torsion in an inguinal undescended testis in a 14-year young male.

### Detection of testicular torsion with preserved intratesticular flow by point of care ultrasound in the emergency department: a case report [^1ba26ada]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasonography is an effective diagnostic tool for testicular torsion (TT), which is typically characterized by the absence of blood flow in the affected testicle on color Doppler mode. However, there are a few reported cases of TT with symmetrical preserved flow. We report a case of TT with the preserved intratesticular flow on color Doppler ultrasound.

Case Report

A 14-year-old boy was admitted due to sudden-onset right scrotal pain. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed that the right testicle was larger than the left. The intratesticular flow in both testicles was preserved. Radiology-performed ultrasound confirmed the preserved intratesticular flow observed on POCUS, but also demonstrated a whirlpool sign of the right spermatic cord. TT was confirmed surgically. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should investigate the presence of intratesticular blood flow and the whirlpool sign of the spermatic cord or other ultrasound features suggestive of TT, even if testicular blood flow is preserved. Suspicion of TT from POCUS findings warrants further evaluation to preserve the patient's fertility.

Recommendation 15: In scrotal emergencies, the radiologist should evaluate the medical history and clinical signs and symptoms of the patient, and perform US to contribute to the diagnosis of testicular torsion, trauma, epididymo-orchitis or malignancy, which could exert a transient or long-lasting negative effect on sperm parameters and male fertility. Scrotal MRI is rarely needed in cases of non-diagnostic US findings.

Recommendation 16: In infertile men, the radiologist should investigate the history of scrotal emergencies/acute scrotum to detect and/or understand related testicular US abnormalities.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^b3fdd10a]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Cases of complete torsion with absent flow in affected testis are usually diagnosed without difficulty by sonography. In late-phase torsion (greater than 24 h), in addition to lack of color flow within the testis, a "halo sign" consisting of a rim of increased pudendal flow surrounding the testis is present. In both situations, the epididymis is also frequently enlarged and avascular. Epididymitis is the most common entity confused with testicular torsion, and a study of relevant malpractice claims found that in 61% of these cases, torsion was misdiagnosed as epididymitis. In case of partial or intermittent torsion with recurrent episodes of testicular pain, sonographic examinations can be difficult and ambiguous: testicular flow may still be present but decreased in comparison to the contralateral side or flow may be apparently symmetrical with the contralateral side (Fig. 9). If the flow is markedly decreased compared to the asymptomatic side, testicular torsion is a more likely diagnosis. If the decrease in flow is subtle, a conclusive diagnosis from sonography is more difficult. In cases with complete torsion and near-symmetrical flow, a high degree of suspicion is necessary for accurate diagnosis (Fig. 10). In addition, flow might be maintained within the epididymis, which is often enlarged and therefore not infrequently results in an erroneous diagnosis of epididymitis. If spontaneous detorsion has occurred, the symptoms resolve and the resultant hyperemia and enlargement of the epididymis and testis can result in the erroneous diagnosis of epididymo-orchitis. Systematic high-resolution sonography of the cord can significantly influence surgical management. The sonographic findings depend not only upon the degree of spermatic cord rotation and the length of time of the torsion, but also upon how tightly the cord is twisted (Fig. 11).

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^26712b45]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Torsion versus Epididymitis: Approach to diagnostic challenges

The clinical features considered predictive for testicular torsion include pain < 24 h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, and high position of the testis. The best predictors for epididymitis include dysuria, a painful epididymis on palpation, altered epididymal echogenicity and increased peritesticular perfusion found on ultrasound exam. Torsion of the appendix testis can be identified by the presence of the blue dot sign, a palpable nodule on the upper pole of the testis, or visualization of a relatively avascular nodule on ultrasound.

Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis (Fig. 8; Video 7, online supplementary material); it occurs more frequently among adolescents but also occurs in younger boys. Sexually transmitted infection is a potential etiology in the adolescent. A urinary tract infection is another potential etiology. In children, infectious epididymitis can result from viral infections or refluxed urine secondary to an underlying anatomical abnormality. Epididymitis is much less common than torsion in the pre-adolescent boys; when advanced, the epididymis adheres to the testis and can result in epididymo-orchitis (Video 8, online supplementary material).

### Should manual detorsion be a routine part of treatment in testicular torsion? [^d4a4b208]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Testicular (spermatic cord) torsion (TT), which was first described by Hunter, is an emergency urological diagnosis that results in ischemic organ injury in the affected testis, and requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Cold weather, activation of the cremasteric reflex, trauma, undescended testis, and fast enlargement of testis during puberty are the known risk factors in susceptible individuals. It shows a bimodal distribution, and peaks in the neonatal period and puberty. Prevalence has been reported as 8.6/ 100,000 between the ages of 10 and 19 years in the United States.

With the exception of neonates, patients usually present with unilateral severe pain that has been present for a few hours. Pain is rarely mild, and it radiates to the inguinal region and abdomen. The most frequent physical examination findings are testicular tenderness and loss of the cremasteric reflex. An abnormal position of the testis is more common than other causes for acute scrotal pain. Doppler ultrasonography (USG), scintigraphy, dynamic magnetic resonance (MR), and high-resolution USG are the diagnostic imaging modalities.

The most important factors for testicular salvage before it atrophies are known to be the duration between the onset of symptoms and detorsion, and the degree of the torsion. Emergency surgery after the diagnosis aims to shorten the duration of ischemia. Manual detorsion (MD), as described by Nash, has been suggested before surgery to return blood flow faster, and some authors have indicated it as an alternative to surgery.

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the efficiency of MD, whether it could be a routine part of treatment or an alternative to surgery in patients with TT due to time saved by the application, and the reliability of elective orchiopexy rather than emergency orchiopexy in the light of information provided in literature.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^0f8199cf]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients who transferred to RMH were 8% less likely to receive follow up than those who presented directly to our facility. Although this number did not reach statistical significance, the mean number of days to follow up care was 99.73 days longer in patients who transferred to RMH than patients who presented directly to RMH. These results suggest that geographic proximity to our facility may play a role in receiving follow up care, but due to many factors including post-surgical counseling and communication with patients and their families, a large percentage of the patients are receiving the follow up care that they need.

Fourteen total patients were excluded from this study solely due to symptom duration in excess of 24 h. Of these patients, 11 (78.6%) were transferred from outside facilities and all 14 patients (100%) had an orchiectomy as their surgical outcome. These results suggest the need for community and rural clinician education on recognizing the signs and symptoms of testicular torsion.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^ca9fe144]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Sonographic protocol for suspected testicular torsion

Swollen epididymis and testis with testicular flow that is only minimally decreased, normal, or increased in boys with incomplete or intermittent testicular torsion can mimic epididymo-orchitis. The most common cause of acute scrotal pain in children is torsion of appendix testis, which can also mimic epididymo-orchitis. Therefore it is important to evaluate for the presence of avascular nodule that might represent the torsed appendage (Fig. 8; videos 9, 10 and 11, online supplementary material). Any time a child presents with acute scrotal pain, and findings resembling epididymitis without findings of torsed appendage, testicular torsion should be excluded. Suspicion of intermittent or incomplete testicular torsion should be raised in a child with a history of recurrent epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, or abrupt pain that resolved or decreased at the time of diagnosis.

### Is there an increased incidence of orchiectomy in pediatric patients with acute testicular torsion during COVID-19 pandemic? – A retrospective multicenter study [^42340593]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is a real emergency condition which requires prompt diagnosis and surgical management to prevent testicular loss. During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, an increased avoidance of the emergency departments for non-COVID-19 illnesses has been reported in the medical literature.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased number of orchiectomies in pediatric patients presenting with acute testicular torsion compared to pre-COVID-19 period.

Study Design

A total number of 119 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute testicular torsion from January 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled in retrospective multi-center study from six institutions in Croatia. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group (pre-COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery before COVID-19 pandemic (n = 68), while the second group (COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 51). Main outcomes of the study were orchiectomy rates and time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation.

Results

During the COVID-19 pandemic period 43.1% (22/51) of the patients underwent orchiectomy while orchiectomy was performed in 16.2% (11/68) of the patients from the pre-COVID group (p = 0.001). Median time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19 periods was 14h (IQR 5, 48) and 6h (IQR 3, 22) (p = 0.007), respectively. A higher proportion of patients waited over 24 h to present to emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (47% vs 8.8%, p = 0.007).

Conclusion

During COVID-19 pandemic a significantly higher rates of orchiectomies and increase in delayed presentations for testicular torsion was found. More patient education during pandemic in regards to management of emergency conditions such as testicular torsion is required.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^be0d8462]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent investigators have emphasized the concept of intermittent and partial testicular torsion, which can be difficult to diagnose with sonography because these cases have either subtle decreased flow or flow that appears to be symmetrical with the contralateral testis, and symptoms can wax and wane. Such cases might present diagnostic dilemmas for both the pediatric radiologist and urologist. Testicular torsion is not an all-or-none phenomenon and can be of complete, partial or intermittent types. The incidence of each type of torsion in isolation is unknown. In a study in which all children with symptoms of acute scrotum underwent surgical revision, torsion of the appendix testis was the most common pathology (57%), followed by torsion of the spermatic cord (27%) and much less commonly epididymitis (11%).

### Mechanisms of testicular torsion and potential protective agents [^c3c45d36]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion is a urological emergency most commonly seen in adolescence, involving a decrease in blood flow in the testis resulting from torsion of the spermatic cord that can result in gonad injury or even loss if not treated in time. Testicular ischaemia-reperfusion injury represents the principle pathophysiology of testicular torsion, with ischaemia caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, and reperfusion on its subsequent release. Many cellular and molecular mechanisms are involved in ischaemia-reperfusion injury following testicular torsion. Studies have investigated the use of pharmacological agents as supportive therapy to surgical repair in order to prevent the adverse effects of testicular torsion. Numerous substances have been proposed as important in the prevention of post-ischaemia-reperfusion testicular injury. A range of chemicals and drugs has been successfully tested in animal models for the purpose of mitigating the dangerous effects of ischaemia-reperfusion in testis torsion.

### Torsion of an undescended testis – A surgical pediatric emergency [^4a70b524]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Torsion of an undescended testis is a surgical emergency whose frequency may be underestimated in the pediatric population. We describe this entity and focus on diagnostic challenges and optimal treatment of torsion of an undescended testis.

Methods

We present a two-center retrospective chart review of patients with torsion of an undescended testis treated between 2013 and 2018. Two instructive cases are used to depict characteristics of this rare entity.

Results

We identified 11 patients with previously diagnosed cryptorchidism undergoing surgery for torsion of an undescended testis, accounting for 9.7% (11/107) of all testicular torsions in the period. Mean age at diagnosis was 9.4 months (1–22 months). Mean duration from onset of symptoms to presentation was 19.3 h (8–48 h). At admission to hospital 10 patients presented with groin lump (10/11, 90.9%) with or without pain leading to a suspected diagnosis of inguinal testicular torsion (5/11, 45.5%), incarcerated inguinal hernia (4/11, 36.4%) and epididymitis (1/11, 9.1%). Ten patients had an ultrasound examination before surgery leading to the correct diagnosis in six patients. Ultrasound findings were misinterpreted as incarcerated inguinal hernia in three patients. In eight patients the testis had to be removed at time of surgery; one of the three salvaged testes atrophied, resulting in a salvage rate of 18%.

Conclusion

Torsion of an inguinal testis is not as rare as it might be presumed. Presentation of these patients is often deferred owing to equivocal signs and symptoms. In addition age at presentation differs from typical testicular torsion. As this might negatively influence testicular salvage rate, we advocate for special attention to this differential diagnosis in children with groin pathologies. Even if the child is not in pain, a tender groin in boys with undescended testes must prompt a quick and thorough examination to rule out torsion of an undescended testis. Ultrasound examination is of limited value and must not delay acute surgical treatment.

### Pediatric high-risk conditions [^fea4ed5c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Meningitis, appendicitis, and testicular torsion are among the most common conditions resulting in malpractice litigation in Pediatric Emergency Medicine. With meningitis, most litigation claims involved patients < 2 years old. Notably, 25% of patients had no fever and many lacked classic signs of meningitis. For appendicitis, nearly 3/4 of litigated cases claimed delayed/missed diagnosis. A non-diagnostic ultrasound (eg, no appendix visualized) has a negative predictive value of only 86%. Finally, testicular torsion carries a 34–42% testicular loss rate and 10% of patients with torsion only present with isolated abdominal pain. Atypical presentations must be considered and clear return precautions are imperative.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^52193892]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete torsion occurs when the testis twists 360° or greater, usually leading to absence of intratesticular flow on color Doppler exam; however sometimes the flow is preserved or decreased. Intermittent torsion is defined as sudden onset of unilateral testicular pain of short duration with spontaneous resolution. In partial or incomplete torsion, the degree of spermatic cord twist is less than 360°, allowing for some residual perfusion to the testis. However there is no spontaneous resolution of pain.

Testicular torsion has been reported to have a bimodal distribution, an initial peak in the first year of age where the torsion is of extravaginal type, and a second surge in adolescence where intravaginal torsion is common. Cases of intravaginal torsion with preserved flow and their critical sonographic findings are described in this review. Preserved flow indicates these cases did not have completely absent flow (which is typically straightforward and diagnostic for testicular torsion) on color Doppler exam. Instead, the affected testis had either decreased or symmetrical preserved flow compared to the contralateral unaffected side, sometimes even increased flow. In many of our cases, it was extremely difficult to decide whether the flow was truly symmetrical to the contralateral side or was subtly decreased. Of all the cases with preserved flow, decreased flow in the affected testis was more commonly observed than symmetrical or increased flow. The patient age in our cases ranged from 3 years to 19 years, the majority being 12 years and older. While studying some of our youngest patients (3–6 years), we noted that they all presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and received the typical workup for pain including ultrasound examination to rule out appendicitis. The nonspecific symptoms resulted in a delayed diagnosis. It is important to remember that intravaginal torsion can occur even in such young patients, though less frequently compared to adolescents, and when presentation is right-sided it can mimic appendicitis. A clinical examination of the scrotum is recommended in all boys with right lower quadrant pain and a low threshold for a scrotal ultrasonography.

### Testicular torsion and ultrasound-assisted manual detorsion [^240b93db]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that requires an immediate and multidisciplinary approach from emergency, surgical, and radiological services. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge and growing value of ultrasound (US) for intravaginal testicular torsion diagnosis and our experience with manual testicular detorsion with US assistance. Testicular torsion requires prompt and accurate diagnosis and quick therapeutic action. Technological advances in US equipment and knowledge of this pathology place the radiologist in an excellent position for its diagnosis and management. During the same medical procedure, the radiologist can both confirm the intravaginal testicular torsion and attempt manual testicular detorsion. US-assisted manual testicular detorsion is a non-invasive, simple, quick, safe, and effective manoeuvre that can rapidly restore testicular blood flow, maximising testicular salvage, relieving the patient's symptoms, and facilitating surgery.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of scrotal ultrasound examinations [^35408978]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) Practice Parameter — indications for scrotal ultrasound include but are not limited to the following: evaluation of scrotal pain, including but not limited to testicular trauma, ischemia/torsion, postsurgical pain, and infectious or inflammatory scrotal disease; evaluation of a palpable inguinal, intrascrotal, or testicular mass; evaluation of scrotal asymmetry, swelling, or enlargement; evaluation of potential intrascrotal hernia; and detection/evaluation of varicoceles. The document is intended to provide the medical ultrasound community with recommendations for the performance and recording of high-quality ultrasound examinations, reflects what the AIUM considers the appropriate criteria for this type of ultrasound examination but is not intended to establish a legal standard of care, and notes that examinations performed in this specialty area are expected to follow the parameter with recognition that deviations may occur depending on the clinical situation.

### Atypical presentation delays treatment of pediatric testicular torsion [^6c2a191f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to identify patient- and care-related factors associated with time to treatment for acute testicular torsion and the likelihood of testicular loss.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected for patients 18 years and younger who had surgery for acute testicular torsion between April 1, 2005, and September 1, 2021. Atypical symptoms and history were defined as having abdominal, leg, or flank pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, local trauma, or not having testicular pain. The primary outcome was testicular loss. The primary process measure was time from emergency department (ED) triage to surgery.

Results

One hundred eleven patients were included in descriptive analysis. The rate of testicular loss was 35%. Forty-one percent of all patients reported atypical symptoms or history. Eighty-four patients had adequate data to calculate time from symptom onset to surgery and time from triage to surgery and were included in analyses of factors affecting risk of testicular loss. Sixty-eight patients had adequate data to evaluate all care-related time points and were included in analyses to determine factors affecting time from ED triage to surgery. On multivariable regression analyses, increased risk of testicular loss was associated with younger age and longer time from symptom onset to ED triage, while longer time from triage to surgery was associated with reporting atypical symptoms or history. The most frequently reported atypical symptom was abdominal pain, in 26% of patients. These patients were more likely to have nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal tenderness but equally likely to report testicular pain and swelling and have testicular findings on examination.

Conclusions

Patients presenting to the ED with acute testicular torsion reporting atypical symptoms or history experience slower transit from arrival in the ED to operative management and may be at greater risk of testicular loss. Increased awareness of atypical presentations of pediatric acute testicular torsion may improve time to treatment.

### Predictors of testicular viability in testicular torsion [^c56a2958]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

Testicular torsion (TT) requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid testicular loss. Most studies have focused on the ideal work up to rule TT out in cases of acute scrotum. We attempted here to define objective criteria to select between orchidopexy and orchidectomy in patients undergoing surgery for TT.

Patients and Methods

Fifteen boys with a median age at presentation of 7.8 (range 6.4–12) years undergoing surgical treatment for TT underwent color-Doppler ultrasound (CDU) preoperatively, and a bleeding test intraoperatively. Duration of preoperative history, degree of torsion, CDU findings and degree of bleeding were analyzed.

Results

Salvageability was independent of the degree of torsion. In patients with a history longer than 10h, no flow on CDU and no bleeding, after orchidectomy all the testicles were necrotic on pathology. When all these variables were negative, all the testicles did well during follow up. In the group of patients with no agreement among the analyzed variables, the outcome was unpredictable. Five out of six underwent orchidopexy, but in two cases the testicle atrophied (in spite of flow on CDU in one).

Conclusions

No predictive parameters were found for testicular salvageability. Taken as a whole, the parameters studied can be of help in treatment choice. In patients with no agreement among the parameters, orchidopexy seems the appropriate option, but parents should be informed of the risk of testicular atrophy during follow up.

### ESPR uroradiology taskforce – imaging recommendations in paediatric uroradiology, part VIII: retrograde urethrography, imaging disorder of sexual development and imaging childhood testicular torsion [^1a621877]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Nuclear medicine studies and MRI with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging are methods that may theoretically be useful in testicular torsion; however, these methods are normally not readily available and will most often cause diagnostic delay, hence are not applicable in the acute setting.

Taking all aspects into account, the imaging algorithm for childhood testicular torsion (Fig. 3) is quite simple. In suspected testicular torsion (after the perinatal period), immediate surgical exploration is advocated when the clinical findings are highly suspicious. In equivocal cases, immediate US should be performed without diagnostic delay by an experienced ultrasonographer. MRI may be an option for complementing the assessment of differential diagnoses such as testicular tumour or undescended testes.

Fig. 3
Recommended imaging of suspected testicular torsion beyond the neonatal age

The algorithm in neonatal torsion (Fig. 4) is slightly different and more controversial. Because of the low prevalence of neonatal torsion there is practically no scientific evidence available regarding imaging and its role in the management of this condition. In neonatal torsion, the testicle is rarely salvageable, except in a few circumstances (e.g. partial torsion or if the torsion occurred during or just after birth and treatment was undertaken immediately). US examination followed by early surgical exploration has therefore become the most generally accepted approach for all cases with non-translucent scrotal swelling. In neonatal torsion, the testicle is often firm on palpation, with some bluish discolouration and lack of a cremasteric reflex. There may be some tenderness or a retracted testicle, but the patient is often asymptomatic. The US examination should be performed with a high-frequency linear transducer (12–18 MHz). The grey-scale findings are the most important because the colour Doppler assessment of a neonatal testicle can be very difficult even when the perfusion is normal. If US demonstrates a unilateral necrotic testis, it may be removed with elective surgery and a contralateral orchidopexy performed simultaneously. If there is bilateral involvement (with reportedly one-third being asynchronous), an immediate exploration is considered justified giving the risk of complete anorchia. In the rare occasion of unilateral disease with US signs of possible viable tissue, based on echogenicity and perfusion of the affected testicle, emergency surgery is also performed. Thus, immediate US should be performed when a neonate presents with non-translucent scrotal swelling, with stratification of further management depending on the US findings.

### Parenchymal echo texture predicts testicular salvage after torsion: potential impact on the need for emergent exploration [^9029efa9]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

In the setting of signs and symptoms of testicular torsion the absence of diastolic flow and/or color flow on Doppler ultrasound has traditionally prompted emergent scrotal exploration. This practice emanates largely from the difficulty on ultrasound of distinguishing salvageable torsed testes from those that are not salvageable. We identified ultrasound findings predictive of testicular viability or the lack thereof.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all boys who underwent scrotal exploration for signs and symptoms of torsion during a 4-year period. In those who underwent preoperative Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum ultrasound findings were reviewed, as were the operative dictations. In patients who underwent orchiectomy the pathology reports were also reviewed. In patients in whom the torsed testis appeared viable and who underwent orchiopexy followup data were reviewed when available. Emergency room charts were also reviewed to ascertain, when documented, the duration of pain before presentation to the emergency room and the interval between ultrasound and operating room.

Results

During this period 55 boys underwent exploration after preoperative scrotal Doppler ultrasound revealed absent diastolic flow and/or color flow Doppler in the symptomatic testis. Assessment of parenchymal echogenicity revealed heterogeneity in 37 testes (67%), of which none were deemed viable at exploration. Orchiectomy was performed in 34 of 37 cases. Pathological examination revealed necrosis in all 34 cases, a finding consistent with late torsion. The remaining 3 testes underwent orchiopexy by parental directive despite nonviability, as confirmed by biopsy and subsequent atrophy. Thus, heterogeneity on preoperative ultrasound was universally predictive of organ loss (chi-square p < 0.001). Of the 18 symptomatic testes (33%) demonstrating homogeneity and isoechogenicity on ultrasound 16 (89%) were deemed viable at exploration. Boys in whom the torsed testicle was nonviable on exploration experienced an average of 27.5 hours of pain preoperatively (range 5 to 72), whereas boys in whom the torsed testis was salvaged experienced an average of 20.5 hours of pain (range 2 to 96) (p = 0.073). The nonviable group underwent surgery an average of 49 minutes after ultrasound, whereas the viable group underwent surgery 52 minutes after ultrasound (p = 0.92). None of the 55 patients experienced any surgical or anesthetic complications and no pathological condition was noted intraoperatively in the contralateral asymptomatic testis.

Conclusions

In the setting of Doppler proven testicular torsion heterogeneous parenchymal echo texture indicates late torsion and testicular nonviability. Therefore, the case may not require emergent scrotal exploration. On the other hand, homogeneous echo texture portends extremely well for testicular viability. Thus, such testes should be explored emergently.

### Testicular loss in children due to incorrect early diagnosis of torsion [^371bb6cf]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background. Testicular torsion is a common surgical emergency in children that requires a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and exploration. Most children present early to their primary pediatricians or physicians. The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the surgical outcome of testicular torsion with early as well as delayed presentation or referral at our pediatric surgical unit. Methods. Records of 50 patients who presented with testicular torsion at our pediatric surgical unit over the span of 10 years (2007–2017) were reviewed retrospectively. The duration and characteristics of symptoms, initial consultation with primary care health professional, time duration between the initial consultation and referral to a tertiary care center, clinical findings prior to surgery, and operative findings were noted. Results. Fifty patients were in the age group ranging from 38 days to 18 years. All the patients consulted the primary care health professionals within 3 to 6 hours after the onset of testicular pain. The patients presented to our hospital within the range of 3.5 hours to 10 days of onset of initial symptoms. Out of 50 patients who presented to our hospital with torsion testis, 45 (90%) patients underwent orchidectomy as the testicle was gangrenous and 5 patients underwent orchiopexy as the testicle was viable. Conclusion. The risk of testicular loss is very high if there is delay in the initial diagnosis of testicular torsion. Greater effort in educating the primary health care professionals may reduce this delay. Primary objective of treating the acute scrotum should be prevention of testicular loss than treating symptoms.

### Sonographic diagnosis of acute spermatic cord torsion. rotation of the cord: a key to the diagnosis [^9af6b774]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although the primary abnormality in testicular torsion is at the spermatic cord, imaging studies up to now have mostly been oriented to evaluation of the testicle itself, with emphasis on color Doppler ultrasonography (US). However, findings can be inaccurate when there is incomplete interruption of testicular flow. Indirect findings, such as morphological changes in the testis alone, are not reliable for the diagnosis since they become evident late in the disease.

Objective

To call to attention to the fact that sonographic visualization of the spermatic cord can be the key for diagnosis in those patients with acute scrotal pain as a result of testicular torsion, particularly when color Doppler US shows that intratesticular flow is present within the affected testis.

Patients and Methods

Six patients who presented clinically with acute scrotal pain and had spermatic cord torsion, proven at surgery. All patients were initially studied with color Doppler US, and intratesticular flow was detected in all of them. Patients who showed structural abnormalities on gray-scale US and/or absence of intratesticular vascular flow in the affected testis were not included. In addition to a conventional study, the spermatic cord was examined.

Results

The spermatic cord was shown to be rotated on the symptomatic side in all patients. Local morphological and vascular flow changes, distal and at the site of the torsion, were found and registered.

Conclusions

The finding of a rotated spermatic cord could be a highly reliable and direct sign for the diagnosis of a testicular torsion, and this is especially important when vascular flow is present within the affected testis on color Doppler US examination. Examination of the spermatic cord should be added to evaluation of the testis in patients with suspected testicular torsion to enhance sensitivity of the examination.

### ESPR uroradiology taskforce – imaging recommendations in paediatric uroradiology, part VIII: retrograde urethrography, imaging disorder of sexual development and imaging childhood testicular torsion [^bb335f98]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

There are institutions and situations where (partial) manual detorsion under US guidance is performed, mostly by surgeons and urologists. This is controversial but may help to increase the salvage rate by shortening the duration of decreased perfusion; however, it will not replace emergency surgery. As complication rates of surgery are very low and — if these occur — usually not severe, there is a low threshold for going to surgery. This is reflected by the European Association of Urology Guidelines 2013 for suspected testicular torsion after the neonatal period, particularly as clinical symptoms remain unspecific.

Imaging by US should only be performed in equivocal cases. Practically speaking, US is often done mainly to confirm epididymo-orchitis when the clinical likelihood of torsion is low. The study must be performed without any delay using a high-frequency, high-resolution linear transducer. Colour Doppler studies with duplex spectral analysis of the testicular parenchyma and vessels are mandatory. Bilateral assessment is standard, for comparison. If performed by experienced investigators, US is a reliable diagnostic method. However, in doubtful cases, immediate surgical exploration is still mandatory. Only if testicular torsion can be ruled out with certainty, and/or other pathology causing the symptoms can be defined, surgery may be postponed. Testicular torsion can be ruled out if a normal spermatic cord (homogenous, linear and without thickening) and symmetrical, normal testicles (both parenchyma and perfusion) are seen on US. Additionally, US can often help to find another entity explaining the clinical symptoms (i.e. epididymo-orchitis).

### Should manual detorsion be a routine part of treatment in testicular torsion? [^35ae666e]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

TT is regarded as a race against time, and the histological changes of testicular injury appear in hours, and even in minutes. It has been reported that irreversible ischemic changes occur 4–6 h after ischemic scrotum, and that 80% of patients need orchiectomy due to necrosis after 24 h if the testis is not detorsioned. Studies have also shown that the duration between onset of symptoms and treatment caused disturbances in semen quality through autoimmune mechanisms.

Emergency scrotal exploration has been recommended as the standard treatment method for derotation of the rotated spermatic cord, and restoration of testicular blood flow. However, minutes and even hours may be needed to prepare for this emergency procedure. Our five-year experience showed there was a significant time loss between diagnosis and treatment (80–90 min, Table 3) and this was reflected in the ischemia time.

### Clinical features of testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis in infants younger than 3 months [^f2a7c18a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Testicular torsion (TT) and orchitis/epididymo-orchitis (EO) are confusing and difficult for physicians to diagnose in infants younger than 3 months. The aim of the study was to delineate the etiology and the clinical features of TT and EO in this age group.

Methods

During the period between April 1994 and September 2004, medical charts of infants younger than 3 months with TT and EO were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

Sixteen patients were eligible for the study, including 9 with TT and 7 with orchitis/EO. Two infants had postnatal torsion, and the testicles were salvaged by emergent surgery. Eighty-six percent (6/7) of infants with EO/orchitis had either abnormal physical signs (fever or scrotal tenderness) or abnormal laboratory findings (leukocytosis or elevated C-reactive protein level). The sensitivity of color Doppler ultrasound to diagnose TT and EO/orchitis was 88% (7/8) and 100% (6/6), respectively. All infants (6/6) with EO/orchitis who were checked for urinary tract infection and sepsis had positive test results.

Conclusions

Pediatricians should examine the testicles meticulously after a baby is born. Orchitis/EO is highly suspected for patients associated with abnormal physical signs and laboratory findings. Prompt prescription of antibiotics is mandatory to avoid serious sequelae.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment analysis of neonatal testicular torsion [^2cb080f7]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal testicular torsion is a rare but critical condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. While early surgical intervention may offer some benefit, in many prenatal cases, preventing testicular loss remains challenging, even with timely intervention. Early recognition remains challenging due to subtle clinical presentations in newborns.

Objective

This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and treatment outcomes of neonatal testicular torsion, providing a reference for early diagnosis and intervention of the disease.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on cases of neonatal testicular torsion admitted to Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital from August 2014 to June 2024. Information collected included the infants' age, at diagnosis onset time, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, surgical treatment, and postoperative follow-up results.

Results

This study included 21 cases of neonatal testicular torsion. Among them, 1 case involved bilateral testicular torsion, and the remaining 20 cases involved unilateral torsion, with 11 cases on the right side and 9 on the left. The median age at diagnosis of the patients was 1 day (IQR: 1–3), and the median onset time was 24h (IQR: 10–60). All patients underwent surgical exploration, revealing a median torsion angle of 720 degrees (IQR: 360–720). The average surgery duration was 57.9min (SD: 25.9). In the case of bilateral testicular torsion, the blood supply was restored after detorsion, and the testicles were preserved. However, in the 20 cases of unilateral torsion, necrotic testicles were removed. Postoperative follow-up over an average period of 31.3 months (SD: 11.5) showed no atrophy in the preserved testicles, with good development of the contralateral testicles and no recurrence of torsion.

Conclusion

Neonatal testicular torsion is rare and urgent, often prenatally occurring with high testicular necrosis risk. Ultrasound is crucial for diagnosing cryptorchid testicular torsion. Clinical uncertainty requires prompt surgical exploration to save the testicle.

### A minimally invasive method in diagnosing testicular torsion: the initial experience of scrotoscope [^937c5794]. Journal of Endourology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

A, testicular torsion was first described in 1840 by Delasiuave and reported in literature first by Scudder et al. The incidence in male under 25 years is ∼1 in 4000. As a delay in diagnosis may result in loss of testicular circulation, with potential risk of infertility and reduced sperm counts, scrotal exploration is considered the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. Thus, once a diagnosis has been reached, many pediatric centers in United States would be most likely to explore "acute scrotum" surgically, to avoid missed diagnosis and potential malpractice-related lawsuit. However, the negative surgical exploration rate is high because the symptoms often overlap with other conditions, including acute epididymo-orchitis. Therefore, the risk of traumatic surgery for children, who could have been treated conservatively, is very high.

To solve this problem, there may be two alternative ways. The first one is to find an alternative noninvasive examination to replace scrotal exploration without significantly increasing missed diagnosis of testicular torsion; and the other one is to invent a minimally invasive surgery to replace the open scrotal exploration. To our knowledge, the diagnosis cannot be ensured with ultrasound or other imaging techniques alone, and current diagnostic improvements, for example, implementing a clinical scoring system based upon certain clinical predictors, can only partially avoid unnecessary surgical explorations; also, Doppler ultrasound depends highly on the operator's experience. Moreover, novel surgical interventions that can replace scrotal exploration are yet to be invented. The purpose of this study is to introduce a minimally invasive method with high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing testicular torsion.

### Scrotal pain in the absence of torsion; need for vigilance [^2b63641c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common presentation of acute testicular pain seen in the emergency department, the differential diagnosis being testicular torsion. The vast majority of young men with epididymitis have an infective aetiology and this settle with antibiotic treatment. The clinical course of a patient who presented with testicular pain is described. At ultrasonography, the patient was found to have the uncommon condition of testicular microlithiasis, a condition that has been linked to malignant disease. Emergency doctors should be aware of the potential consequences of returning scrotal pain consistent with epididymitis to the community on antibiotic treatment alone. All patients with probable epididymitis should have either a scrotal ultrasound or specialist follow up.

### Clinical and sonographic criteria of acute scrotum in children: a retrospective study of 172 boys [^b38b4c1d]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of testicular torsion in children is challenging, as clinical presentation and findings may overlap with other diagnoses.

Objective

To define the clinical and ultrasound criteria that best predict testicular torsion.

Materials and Methods

The records of children hospitalized for acute scrotum from 1997 to 2002 were reviewed. The clinical and ultrasound findings of children who had a final diagnosis of testicular torsion were compared with those of children who had other diagnoses (torsion of the testicular appendix, epididymitis, and epididymo-orchitis).

Results

Forty-one children had testicular torsion; 131 had other diagnoses. Stepwise regression analysis yielded three factors that were significantly associated with testicular torsion: duration of pain ≤ 6 h; absent or decreased cremasteric reflex; and diffuse testicular tenderness. When the children were scored by final diagnosis for the presence of these factors (0–3), none of the children with a score of 0 had testicular torsion, whereas 87% with a score of 3 did. The ultrasound finding of decreased or absent testicular flow had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 99%. Eight of ten children with testicular torsion and normal or increased testicular flow had a coiled spermatic cord on ultrasound.

Conclusion

We suggest that all children with acute scrotal pain and a clinical score of 3 should undergo testicular exploration, and children with a lower probability of testicular torsion (score 1 or 2) should first undergo diagnostic ultrasound. Because the presence of testicular flow does not exclude torsion, the spermatic cord should be meticulously evaluated in all children with acute scrotum and normal or increased testicular blood flow.

### Perinatal testicular torsion: preoperative radiological findings and the argument for urgent surgical exploration [^90a1f9e8]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Perinatal testicular torsion is an infrequent event, the management of which has been controversial. Occurrence is rare, estimated at 1 in 7500 newborns (Kaplan, G. W. Silber, I.: Neonatal torsion — to pex or not? In: Urologic surgery in neonates and young infants. Edited by King, L.R. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co, 1988; Chapter 20, pp. 386–395). The frequency of bilateral perinatal torsion is up to 22% (J Urol. 2005;174:1579). Here, we describe two cases of bilateral asynchronous perinatal torsion, in which the only presenting abnormality on exam after birth was a unilateral scrotal mass. These cases illustrate that contralateral perinatal torsion may be present even when physical exam findings suggest unilateral involvement.

### Ultrasonography of the spermatic cord in children with testicular torsion: impact on the surgical strategy [^07e2a6cb]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many surgeons advocate systematic exploration for acute scrotum rather than risking a misdiagnosis of testicular torsion. Study of testicular vascularization with color Doppler sonography (CDS) can be inaccurate, leading to dangerous false-negative results. We determine whether direct visualization of the twisted cord during emergency high resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) is a reliable sign to diagnose the torsion and whether its absence can dispense with unnecessary surgery.

Materials and Methods

From 1993 to 2002 an average of 35 patients per year presented with acute scrotum, and 44 patients had spermatic cord torsion. CDS and HRUS were performed in all cases. Transversal and longitudinal scans on both sides of the scrotum permitted comparison of testicular echogenicity, size and vascularization. The spermatic cord was studied along its complete length to detect spiral twist. The surgical findings were correlated with the preoperative results.

Results

Spermatic cord torsion at surgery was confirmed in all 44 cases. The time lost by the examination was never more than 30 minutes. Intratesticular blood flow was absent in the affected testis in 31 cases, and CDS was unreliable in the others. In all cases, regardless of CDS findings, HRUS succeeded in detecting the twist as a snail shell-shaped mass measuring 11 to 33 mm.

Conclusions

The finding of a twisted spermatic cord is a highly reliable sign for the diagnosis of testicular torsion. Whereas normal intratesticular perfusion does not dispense with emergency exploratory surgery, direct and complete visualization of a nontwisted spermatic cord strongly indicates that surgery is unnecessary. Strict conditions are required, including time spent on HRUS should not exceed 30 minutes, which generally can only be achieved by a senior pediatric radiologist.

### Scrotal emergencies [^1af9fb21]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

This review describes the clinical, grey-scale and colour Doppler US findings of different conditions that may be the cause of an acute scrotum. The US appearances of testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testis, epididymoorchitis, incarcerated hernia and idiopathic scrotal oedema are described. Some of the major studies regarding the sensitivity and specificity of US in the diagnosis of these diseases are reviewed. Grey-scale and colour Doppler US demonstrate high accuracy in the aetiological diagnosis of an acute scrotum and can differentiate between diseases that require immediate surgical intervention and those that can be treated conservatively.

### Mesorchial testicular torsion: case report and a review of the literature [^4fd6f33c]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion can be extravaginal, intravaginal, or mesorchial. Mesorchial torsion is less well defined and has an atypical presentation. Here we present the case of a 13-year-old with severe, intermittent right scrotal pain, erythema, and a large hydrocele. Color Doppler ultrasound examination showed epididymal enlargement and normal flow. Weeks after presentation, serial color Doppler ultrasound examinations showed epididymal enlargement and decreased perfusion. A literature review for testicular torsion etiology and clinical and radiologic findings documents this as the only recorded case of mesorchial testicular torsion with clinical and radiologic findings. Atypical pain, if persistent, requires careful reassessment, radiologic studies, and surgical exploration.

### A multicenter study of acute testicular torsion in the time of COVID-19 [^20f139ae]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, and time to detorsion is imperative for testicular salvage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may delay emergency care due to stay-at-home orders and concern of COVID-19 exposure.

Objective

To assess whether emergency presentation for testicular torsion was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the rate of orchiectomy increased compared to a retrospective period.

Study Design

Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study from seven institutions in the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were patients two months to 18 years of age with acute testicular torsion from March through July 2020. The retrospective group included patients from January 2019 through February 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression.

Results

A total of 221 patients were included: 84 patients in the COVID-19 cohort and 137 in the retrospective cohort. Median times from symptom onset to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 compared to the retrospective period were 17.9 h (IQR 5.5–48.0) and 7.5 h (IQR 4.0–28.0) respectively (p = 0.04). In the COVID-19 cohort, 42% of patients underwent orchiectomy compared to 29% of pre-pandemic controls (p = 0.06). During COVID-19, 46% of patients endorsed delay in presentation compared to 33% in the retrospective group (p = 0.04).

Discussion

We found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Strengths of the study include the number of included patients and the multicenter prospective design during the pandemic. Limitations include a retrospective pre-pandemic comparison group.

Conclusions

In a large multicenter study we found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a significantly higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Based on the findings of this study, more patient education is needed on the management of testicular torsion during a pandemic.

### Intermittent testicular torsion in the pediatric patient: sonographic indicators of a difficult diagnosis [^eb9863ab]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether intermittent testicular torsion, defined as the sudden onset of unilateral scrotal pain of short duration with spontaneous resolution, has sonographic indicators that can be used to establish the diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective search for pediatric patients presenting with suspected intermittent testicular torsion over a 2-year period was performed. The sonographic findings, medical records for clinical presentation, surgical outcomes, and comorbidities relevant to intermittent testicular torsion were reviewed.

Results

Analysis was performed on two separate categories for intermittent testicular torsion: total patient episodes (n = 19) and surgical cases (n = 10), with a total of 15 patients with 1.26 episodes per patient. Of the 19 episodes of intermittent testicular torsion, 63% (12) had either absent flow followed by normal to increased flow (n = 6, p = 0.18) or increased testicular flow (n = 6), 26% (5) had normal flow, and 10.5% (2) had decreased flow. Of the total episodes of intermittent testicular torsion, 79% (15) had a whirlpool sign or pseudomass, 10.5% (2) had neither a whirlpool sign or pseudomass but a "boggy" thickened cord, and 10.5% (2) had a normal appearance of the spermatic cord with no pseudomass.

Conclusion

The whirlpool sign or an abnormal boggy cord and pseudomass formation below the twisted spermatic cord were both significant findings to support a diagnosis of intermittent testicular torsion. Although change from no perfusion to perfusion during the examination was not statistically significant in our cases, when present it led to the correct diagnosis in each case.

### Differences in clinical characteristics between prepubescent and postpubescent males with testicular torsion [^8dff5465]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion represents a pediatric surgical emergency. In this 6-year study with 140 patients, prepubescent (< 13 years) and postpubescent (≥ 13 years) males with testicular torsion were identified. Prepubescent boys had a longer symptom duration (P = 0.016) and underwent more orchiectomies (P = 0.005) compared with postpubescent boys. The risk of orchiectomy decreased by 15% per 1-year increase in age (P = 0.002). Boys who underwent an orchiectomy had a longer symptom duration (P < .001), were younger (P = 0.002), had scrotal swelling (P = 0.001), scrotal erythema (P < .001), higher degrees of torsion (P = 0.036), and more left-sided surgeries (P = 0.014) compared with those who had an orchiopexy. Postpubescent boys were 63% less likely to receive an orchiectomy versus an orchiopexy compared with prepubescent boys. Pediatricians should be cognizant of the age discrepancies between prepubescent and postpubescent males with testicular torsion and educate parents about the importance of urgent evaluation in the Emergency Department to reduce the likelihood of an orchiectomy.

Scrotal emergencies and male infertility: role of imaging

Emergencies are medical conditions requiring prompt treatment to minimize the likelihood of loss of organ structure or function, and in rare cases, of the patient's life. Scrotal emergencies include different entities, such as testicular torsion, trauma, epididymo-orchitis, and someway, malignancies. The role of these acute conditions and their chronic outcomes in male infertility has been assessed by relatively few studies, reporting various transient or long-lasting negative effects on sperm and, rarely, hormonal parameters, according to the different conditions, severity of the condition, extension of the testicular damage, rapidity and effectiveness of medical or surgical intervention. Besides medical history, sometimes pathognomonic, and clinical signs and symptoms, grayscale and color-Doppler US play a key role in several conditions, eventually supported by contrast-enhanced US and sonoelastography as problem-solving modalities in some equivocal cases. Scrotal MRI is rarely needed for the assessment of acute scrotum or scrotal trauma in cases of non-diagnostic US findings. Scrotal emergencies are usually characterized by scrotal acute pain and swelling. At color-Doppler US, testicular torsion is usually characterized by the absence of blood flow in the symptomatic testis, while epididymo-orchitis by the presence of enhanced blood flow in the affected testis and epididymis. Approximately 10% of patients with a testicular malignancy present with pain, although the typical presentation of a testicular cancer is painless, and a small or large nodule, solid or mixed, with internal vascularization can be detected by color-Doppler US. Testicular trauma can be blunt, penetrating, or degloving, and show typical US features in case of a hematoma, contusion, fracture, or rupture, with or without hematocele, which may change over time. The aforementioned conditions may also lead to testicular infarction, detectable as a hypoechoic wedge-shaped lesion with absent internal vascularization and a peripheral rim of low vascular signal.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### Ultrasound-guided manual testicular detorsion in the emergency department [^859a731b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Scrotal ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of complete testicular torsion and assessment of alternative causes of acute scrotal pain. Early detection of torsion of the testis and reperfusion, either manually or surgically, is paramount to preserving testicular viability. Manual detorsion also offers immediate symptom relief by alleviating ischemia. Bedside ultrasound performed by a trained emergency physician (EP) can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis and reperfusion by means of performing an ultrasound-guided manual detorsion in the emergency department (ED).

Case Report

We report two cases of ultrasound-guided manual detorsion of testis that were performed successfully by EPs in the ED. After manual detorsion, both patients underwent nonemergent orchidopexy and recovered well after surgery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Manual testicular detorsion is a simple, safe, and effective maneuver that can be performed in the ED by EPs. Bedside ultrasound is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of complete torsion of the testicle (no blood flow) and successful reperfusion after manual detorsion. We recommend EPs be trained to perform scrotal ultrasound and manual detorsion of a torted testicle. We strongly emphasize that manual detorsion of the testes is not a substitute for definitive surgical management and should only be used as a temporary measure for reperfusion to allow more time to organize the logistics of surgery, which can be critical in remote settings.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^5ae3d30b]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses can represent a wide range of medical issues, from benign congenital conditions to life-threatening malignancies and acute surgical emergencies. Having a clear understanding of scrotal anatomy allows the examiner to accurately identify most lesions. Benign lesions such as hydroceles and varicoceles are often found incidentally by the patient or physician on routine examination. Epididymitis is bacterial in origin, readily diagnosed on physical examination, and treated with antibiotics. Indirect inguinal hernias usually are palpable separate from the normal scrotal contents and are a surgical emergency if strangulation is suspected based on symptoms of abdominal pain, tenderness, and nonreducibility. Testicular swelling may be caused by orchitis, cancer, or testicular torsion. Orchitis is usually viral in origin, subacute in onset, and may be accompanied by systemic illness. Testicular carcinomas are more gradual in onset; the testis will be nontender on examination. Testicular torsion has an acute onset, often with no antecedent trauma; the involved testis may be retracted and palpably rotated, and will be tender on examination. The swollen testis is always a true emergency. Although history and examination may suggest the diagnosis, testicular torsion can be reliably confirmed only with color Doppler ultrasonography, which must be obtained immediately. If torsion is suspected, surgical consultation should be obtained concurrently with ultrasonography, because the ability to successfully salvage the affected testis declines dramatically after six hours of torsion.

### Factors determining testicular torsion and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients presenting with scrotal pain [^84da2855]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion (TT) is a severe cause of scrotal pain (SP) in children, accounting for 1/4 to 1/3 of pediatric patients presenting with an SP. Testicular torsion must be distinguished from SP of other etiologies – because TT/detorsion is an ischemia–reperfusion process of the testis, which is a time-critical urological emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and surgical intervention. – The annual incidence of TT is approximately from 3.5 to 25 per 100,000 person-years for boys aged younger than 18 years. Two peaks of the age-specific incidence are in young children and adolescents,–; the incidence decreases after age 18 years.

Testicular torsion may lead to testicular ischemic necrosis and permanent testicular damage or consequent orchiectomy in 32% to 64% of patients if testicular blood reperfusion is impaired. The probability of testis salvage (TS) decreases to less than 10% if TT persists for more than 24 hours. To prevent irreversible ischemic changes in TT, prompt evaluation and intervention are crucial in patients presenting with SP. –

Increasing age is a risk factor for orchiectomy due to TT. However, little is known about other factors associated with TT and consequent orchiectomy in children with SP at pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Therefore, we evaluated factors associated with TT and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients who presented with SP at a PED.

### Emergent and nonemergent nonbowel torsion: spectrum of imaging and clinical findings [^a076d9af]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Although bowel torsion is more commonly described in the medical literature, torsion can affect various organs within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, including the testes, ovaries, gallbladder, spleen, heart, and pulmonary lobes. A structural abnormality such as a mass (a "lead point") that promotes twisting around a vascular pedicle often predisposes an organ or other anatomic structure to torsion. Radiologists play a central role in detecting torsion, identifying the anatomy involved, and triaging patients for either emergent surgical intervention, which may be critical for organ salvage, or conservative management. Imaging findings that are suggestive or indicative of emergent torsion include an ectopic location and enlargement or edema of part or all of an organ, decreased blood flow at color Doppler ultrasonography, and a twisted vascular pedicle. Blood flow to an organ is quickly compromised by the constriction of vessels within the twisted pedicle, and ischemia may result; a delay in diagnosis and surgical treatment can lead to complications such as infarction, hemorrhagic necrosis, and abscess. By contrast, torsion of mobile fatty structures such as testicular appendages, epiploic appendages, omental fat, and pericardial fat pads, although it may produce pain mimicking that in an emergent condition, requires only conservative management. Imaging features of this nonemergent condition include a fatty mass, which is usually located alongside the colon when torsion involves the omentum or an epiploic appendage, with associated inflammatory stranding and tenderness at palpation. The radiologist should be familiar with these manifestations of nonemergent torsion to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric testicular torsion: a retrospective case series analysis [^d9e751fb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that warrants prompt treatment. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by ultrasonography interpreted by a radiologist (RADUS); however, in this study, we describe the clinical course of 23 patients for whom point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians during the initial assessment for testicular torsion in the pediatric emergency department (PED).

Methods

A retrospective case series analysis of patients aged 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with acute testicular torsion after undergoing scrotal POCUS through our PED.

Results

Between June 2015 and December 2020, 155 boys received an International Classification of Diseases-9 code of Torsion of Testis after presenting to our PED. Seventy-three patients were imaged preoperatively, of which 50 (68.5%) were diagnosed via RADUS alone. Twenty-three patients (31.5%) underwent POCUS (median age 14.1 years [interquartile range {IQR}: 11.4–15.9 years]), of which 14 (60.9%) were imaged by POCUS alone, whereas the remaining 9 patients (39.1%) underwent POCUS before RADUS. Thirteen of the 23 patients (56.5%) who underwent POCUS had intraoperative findings consistent with acute testicular torsion, whereas another 3 patients (13.0%) required manual detorsion in the PED before orchiopexy. Six patients required orchiectomy. All patients for which POCUS findings were suggestive of acute testicular torsion were correctly classified. The median length of stay from time to admission to orchiopexy for those who received RADUS only versus POCUS only was 184 minutes (IQR: 136–255), and 121 minutes (IQR: 80–202), respectively (P = 0.036). Among the patients who experienced POCUS, the median length of stay for those who underwent RADUS in addition to POCUS compared with those who underwent POCUS alone was 202 minutes (IQR: 136–338.4) (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

Point-of-care ultrasound performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians can be used to expedite surgical management and streamline the management of pediatric patients suspected of acute testicular torsion.

Testicular torsion

Usually colour and power Doppler US are sufficient to diagnose testicular torsion, with CEUS kept to confirm vascularity absence (Fig. 10) in difficult cases, such as in adolescents with small testes where colour Doppler information is suboptimal. Altogether, however, CEUS has not proved to add information in studying complete testicular torsion. Nevertheless, in chronic (initially missed) torsion, CEUS can detect peritesticular increased vascularity, while in incomplete torsion it reveals enhancement discrepancy between normal and abnormal testicle. It can also help in intermittent torsion, with normal or increased flow. In such cases differentiation from orchitis may be needed. It can be difficult to differentiate a segmental infarct with a rounded configuration from a poorly vascularised tumour. CEUS can help in this task, allowing a more confident diagnosis, compared with grey-scale and colour Doppler.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^8c54451f]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from benign conditions to those requiring emergent surgical intervention. Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders.

### Retrospective review of diagnosis and treatment in children presenting to the pediatric department with acute scrotum [^994a41e9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Testicular torsion is a common acute condition in boys requiring prompt accurate management. The objective of this article was to evaluate ultrasound accuracy, findings, and clinical predictors in testicular torsion in boys presenting to the Stollery pediatric emergency department with acute scrotal pain.

Methods

Retrospective review of surgical and emergency department ultrasound records for boys from 1 month to 17 years old presenting with acute scrotal pain from 2008 to 2011 was performed. Clinical symptoms, ultrasound and surgical findings, and diagnoses were recorded. Surgical results and follow-up were used as the reference standard.

Results

Of 342 patients who presented to the emergency department with acute scrotum, 35 had testicular torsion. Of 266 ultrasound examinations performed, 29 boys had torsion confirmed by surgery. The false-positive rate for ultrasound was 2.6%, and there were no false-negative findings. Mean times from presentation at the emergency department to ultrasound and surgery were 209.4 and 309.4 minutes, respectively. Of the torsed testicles, 69% were salvageable. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for testicular torsion were 100%, 97.9%, and 98.1%, respectively. Sonographic heterogeneity was seen in 80% of nonviable testes at surgery and 58% of patients with viable testes (p = 0.41). Sudden-onset scrotal pain (88%), abnormal position (86%), and absent cremasteric reflex (91%) were most prevalent in torsion patients.

Conclusion

Color Doppler ultrasound is accurate and sensitive for diagnosis of torsion in the setting of acute scrotum. Despite heterogeneity on preoperative ultrasound, many testes were considered to be salvageable at surgery. The salvage rate of torsed testes was high.

The ability of US to diagnose the pathogenesis of the acute scrotum is unsurpassed by any other imaging modality. It is the first imaging performed in patients with acute scrotum. Knowledge of the normal and pathologic sonographic appearance of the scrotum and proper sonographic technique is essential for accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum. High-frequency transducer sonography combined with color flow Doppler sonography provides the information essential to reach a specific diagnosis in patients with testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, and testicular trauma.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^d4c95584]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Blunt scrotal trauma — Blunt mechanisms cause up to 75% of testicular injuries and typically only one testis is involved; blunt trauma may also result in testicular torsion, hematocele, dislocation, or intratesticular hematoma. The degree of scrotal pain and swelling does not always correlate with the severity of testicular injury; obtain scrotal ultrasound to evaluate for testicular rupture, and if the scrotal ultrasound is inconclusive, consider an MRI. Ultrasound findings used to identify testicular rupture include parenchymal heterogeneity, loss of contour, and a disruption or defect in the tunica albuginea of the testis; while interruption of the tunica albuginea is the most specific sign of testicular rupture, it may not always be detected; however, do not delay surgical exploration if testicular rupture.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^0b3b9fd3]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Testicular salvage

Likelihood of salvage of the testis is directly related to the time between symptom onset and detorsion. However in our experience salvage is unpredictable depending on how tightly or loosely the cord was twisted, and hence surgery should not be delayed after the diagnosis of torsion is established, even if the time to presentation exceeds the 6- to 10-h window. A testis might become nonviable as early as 4 h after a 720° twist, or it might remain viable for several days if the torsion is incomplete. In one of our cases, salvage was achieved after 3 weeks from initial diagnosis of epididymitis to final diagnosis of incomplete torsion (Fig. 9). Anatomical variability might account for differences in the duration of viability of the torsed testis. Initially after salvage, the testes sometimes appear in good condition; however long-term follow-up of salvaged testes post orchiopexy can be helpful in determining the effects of torsion. Manual detorsion of the testis can restore blood flow while the boy awaits surgical correction. In a study of 133 patients with testicular torsion, successful manual detorsion was associated with a salvage rate of 97% compared with 75% salvage in patients in whom detorsion was not attempted or not successful.

### Sonography of the acute scrotum: the four T's of testicular imaging [^ac0d9a5a]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The scrotum is frequently imaged on an emergent basis. The differential diagnosis of the acute scrotum can be divided into four categories-torsion, trauma, tumor, and "testiculitis" (epididymo-orchitis). Although testicular neoplasms are not imaged emergently, 15% are detected incidentally when performing an emergent scrotal ultrasound. Therefore, the emergent sonographic examination of the testicles should include a thorough search for malignancy. Images demonstrating the sonographic and color Doppler appearances of each of the "four T's" will be reviewed. The radiographic review will focus on the imaging features, which are the keys to arriving at the correct diagnosis.
