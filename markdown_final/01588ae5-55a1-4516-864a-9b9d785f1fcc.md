## Question

In the ORION study, did zanivoril demonstrate a mortality benefit in sepsis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether zanivoril showed a mortality benefit in sepsis in an ORION study. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the ORION trials actually are and whether any of them pertain to sepsis. Then, I should verify whether a drug named zanivoril appears anywhere in the provided evidence base. Next, I will review the sepsis mortality literature in the corpus to see if a similarly named agent or trial could be the source of confusion. Finally, I will synthesize an evidence-based conclusion and outline any necessary clarifications.

> Let me first confirm the context for "ORION". Wait, I should not assume it's a sepsis program; I need to verify the disease area and intervention. The ORION program consistently refers to inclisiran, a small interfering RNA that targets PCSK9 for dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention, with trials such as ORION-9, ORION-10, ORION-11, and the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial ORION-4, none of which study sepsis or septic shock [^1125MFxR] [^116NMPcM].

> Next, I should review whether "zanivoril" appears anywhere in the provided documents. Hold on, I need to check exact spelling variants and near-misses, but I find no occurrence of "zanivoril" in the corpus, and there is no drug by that name linked to sepsis in these materials; instead, the sepsis trials discussed prominently include corticosteroid regimens such as APROCCHSS and CORTICUS, and adjunctive strategies like polymyxin B hemoperfusion in EUPHRATES [^116T6VW4].

> I will now examine whether any sepsis trials here demonstrate a mortality signal that could be misattributed to an "ORION" or a similarly named agent; let me think about the corticosteroid literature first. The APROCCHSS trial reported improved outcomes with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone including lower in-hospital and ICU mortality, whereas CORTICUS did not show a survival benefit and primarily shortened time to shock reversal, and the BMJ guideline synthesis reflects these mixed effects with only a weak recommendation overall for steroids in sepsis or septic shock, which underscores how easy it is to conflate trial signals across different studies if the names are misremembered [^116T6VW4] [^116yLkZk].

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from other adjunctive sepsis interventions reported here; I should double-check key negative and positive trials. The targeted polymyxin B hemoperfusion trial EUPHRATES did not reduce 28-day mortality, the TRISS trial found no difference in 90-day mortality between restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds in septic shock, and ProCESS showed no survival advantage for protocol-based early goal-directed therapy versus usual care; conversely, a multicenter RCT of ulinastatin suggested a mortality reduction, illustrating how heterogeneous the sepsis literature is and how a single positive signal could be mistakenly linked to an unrelated trial name like "ORION" [^111tgs4z] [^112QG2ty] [^1177w1yA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering credibility and context across sources; I need to ensure we weigh high-credibility data appropriately. High-credibility journals and regulatory documents in this set show that mortality effects in severe infections are inconsistent across interventions, with some antibacterial agents even showing numerically higher mortality in certain critically ill infection populations, reinforcing that any claim of a mortality benefit requires precise identification of the agent and trial rather than inference from name overlap alone [^116nTMfP] [^115BSSvb].

> Let me reconsider the original query in light of these checks. The ORION trials in this corpus are cardiovascular inclisiran studies and do not involve sepsis populations, and there is no mention anywhere of a drug named "zanivoril"; taken together, there is no basis here to assert that an "ORION study of zanivoril" demonstrated a mortality benefit in sepsis, and the most plausible explanation is a misattribution or a reference to research outside this document set [^1125MFxR] [^116NMPcM].

> I should confirm the bottom line and propose next steps. Based on the provided references, there is no ORION sepsis trial and no listed agent named zanivoril, so no mortality conclusion can be drawn for that drug-trial combination from this evidence; please verify the exact trial acronym and the drug's spelling or alternative name, and in the meantime, management decisions should continue to rely on the established sepsis evidence base and guidelines reflected here, including neutral results from ProCESS and TRISS and fluid recommendations from ESICM 2024 [^112QG2ty] [^111tgs4z] [^115XApbf].

I can't find a drug named "zanivoril" or a sepsis trial called "ORION". Please confirm:

- **The exact drug name** (spelling or alternative names)?
- **The trial name** or a link/identifier?
- **Whether you meant inclisiran's ORION program** (which is about LDL lowering, not sepsis)? [^116NMPcM]

If you meant a different sepsis agent or trial, **I can summarize mortality outcomes once you clarify** [^116AUoKV] [^1139QZSN].

### New strategies for clinical trials in patients with sepsis and septic shock [^111jcezC]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The difficulty in identifying new treatment modalities that significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity rates associated with sepsis has highlighted the need to reevaluate the approach to clinical trial design. The United Kingdom Medical Research Council convened an International Working Party to address these issues.

- **Data sources**: The subject areas that were to be the focus of discussion were identified by the co-chairs, and group leaders were nominated. Preconference reading material was circulated to group members.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: Small-group discussion fed into an iterative process of feedback from plenary sessions, followed by the formulation of recommendations. Finally, each working group prepared a summary of its recommendations, and these are reported herein.

- **Data synthesis**: There were five key recommendations. First, investigators should no longer rely solely on the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine definitions of sepsis or sepsis syndrome as the basis of trial entry. Entry criteria should be based on three principles: a) all patients should have infection; b) there should be evidence of a pathologic process that represents a biologically plausible target for the proposed intervention, for example, an abnormal circulating level of a biological marker pertinent to the study drug; and c) patients should fall into an appropriate category of severity (usually severe sepsis). Second, investigators should use a scoring system for organ dysfunctions that has been validated and that can be incorporated into the study design.

### Systemic steroids in severe sepsis and septic shock [^114d5wuV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Despite over five decades of study and debate, the role of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial. Data support a beneficial effect on systemic blood pressure in patients with septic shock; however, the ability of corticosteroid therapy to improve mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains contentious, with contradictory results from recent large multicenter clinical trials. High-dose corticosteroid treatment appears to provide no benefit and possibly harm in septic patients. The experimental design flaws and biases of recent low-dose (physiologic) steroid treatment trials limit their ability to provide adequate answers to important questions regarding which septic patients should be treated, the appropriate steroid dosage, and the optimum duration of treatment.

Unfortunately, these critical questions are not readily answered based on current evidence or through the application of meta-analysis to available clinical data. This evidence-based review highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the data to inform practicing clinicians about which patients are likely to derive significant benefit from corticosteroid treatment, while more definitive guidance from future multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trials is awaited to better address these important therapeutic questions.

### Fetroja [^116nTMfP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

An increase in all-cause mortality was observed in patients treated with Fetroja compared to best available therapy (BAT) in a multinational, randomized, open-label trial in critically ill patients with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections (NCT02714595). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia, bloodstream infections, sepsis, or complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) were included in the trial. BAT regimens varied according to local practices and consisted of one to three antibacterial drugs with activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Most of the BAT regimens contained colistin.

The increase in all-cause mortality occurred in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or sepsis. The 28-day all-cause mortality was higher in patients treated with Fetroja than in patients treated with BAT [25/101 (24.8%) vs. 9/49 (18.4%), treatment difference 6.4%, 95% CI (-8.6, 19.2)]. All-cause mortality remained higher in patients treated with Fetroja than in patients treated with BAT through Day 49 [34/101 (33.7%) vs. 10/49 (20.4%), treatment difference 13.3%, 95% CI (-2.5, 26.9)]. Generally, deaths occurred in patients with infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, including non-fermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These were primarily the result of worsening or complications of infection, or underlying comorbidities. The cause of the increase in mortality has not been established.

It is recommended to closely monitor the clinical response of patients being treated with Fetroja.

### Lopressor [^111dGtQp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study involving 1,395 patients, Lopressor was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated.

Subjects were deemed ineligible if they presented with hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of Lopressor or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with Lopressor or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given Lopressor and followed up to 1 year.

The median delay from the onset of symptoms to initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the Lopressor and placebo treatment groups. Among patients treated with Lopressor, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤ 8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with Lopressor, independent of the interval between the onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.

### Effect of hydrocortisone on development of shock among patients with severe sepsis: The HYPRESS randomized clinical trial [^114eW4WL]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The HYPRESS study by Keh D and colleagues, published in JAMA in 2016, investigates the effect of hydrocortisone on the development of shock among patients with severe sepsis. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved a population of 353 patients, consisting of 124 females and 229 males. Patients included had severe sepsis, while key exclusions were septic shock, age below 18 years, known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo), and a history of corticosteroid medication with an indication for continuation or other treatment indications.

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups: 177 received hydrocortisone (continuous infusion at a dose of 200 mg for 5 days, followed by dose tapering until day 11) and 176 received a placebo of lyophilized mannitol.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference was observed in the rate of septic shock within 14 days between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups (21.2% vs. 22.9%; AD -1.8%, 95% CI -10.7 to 7.2).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There were no significant differences in mortality at various time points:
	- Death at 28 days (8.8% vs. 8.2%; AD 0.5%, 95% CI -5.6 to 6.7)
	- Death at 90 days (19.9% vs. 16.7%; AD 3.2%, 95% CI -5.1 to 11.4)
	- Death at 180 days (26.8% vs. 22.2%; AD 4.6%, 95% CI -4.6 to 13.7)

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences were found in secondary infections and weaning failure.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^112W9Li2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

The study, "Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis", was published in 2024 in the journal BMC Anesthesiology. It investigates the impact of conservative oxygen therapy compared to liberal oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis.

- **Study design**: The trial was a single-center, single-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study included 106 patients (37 female, 69 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with sepsis undergoing mechanical ventilation. Key exclusion criteria included age under 18 years, pregnancy, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and lack of informed consent.
- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups — 53 patients received the conservative oxygen strategy (target SaO2 of 88–92%), and 53 patients received the liberal oxygen strategy (target SaO2 of ≥ 96%).
- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in stroke volume at 72 hours (58.26 mL vs. 56.79 mL; AD 1.47 mL, 95% CI -2.35 to 5.29) between the two groups.
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference was found in cardiac output at 72 hours (5.85 L/min vs. 5.75 L/min; AD 0.1 L/min, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.5). There was a significant increase in vasopressor use (84.9% vs. 66%; AD 18.9%, 95% CI 2.46 to 35.34).

The study contributes valuable insights into the management of oxygen therapy in sepsis patients.

### Pentoxifylline for neonatal sepsis [^1176Z4is]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Although the overall incidence of neonatal sepsis has declined over the past decade, mortality remains high in the preterm infant. The high level of mortality and morbidity from sepsis, despite the use of potent antimicrobial agents, and the global emergence of antibiotic resistance, have led to the search for new modalities to boost newborn host defenses. Pentoxifylline, a xanthine derivative and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been shown to possess a broad spectrum of activity modulating inflammation.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to assess the effect on mortality and the safety of intravenous pentoxifylline as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in neonates with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched in October 2002 and again in March 2003. The Science Citation Index for articles referencing Lauterbach 1996 and Lauterbach 1999 was searched, as well as proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies, which were published in Pediatric Research from 1980. Doctoral dissertations and theses were searched from 1980. The reference lists of identified RCTs and personal files were searched. No language restriction was applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included if they were randomized or quasi-randomized trials, assessing the efficacy of pentoxifylline compared to placebo or no intervention as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy of suspected or confirmed sepsis in newborn infants less than 28 days old.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: Systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112QtGKY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Comparison 2**: High dose steroids versus placebo or no intervention. Fourteen trials (2624 patients) evaluated high doses (> 500 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent) of steroids for sepsis. Only one trial had a low risk of bias in all domains. Six trials were considered to have a lower risk of bias (lower risk of bias in four domains). One trial did not report mortality.

- **All-cause mortality within longest follow-up**: Six trials with a lower risk of bias and seven trials with a high risk of bias evaluated mortality in 2537 patients at different lengths of follow-up. No statistically significant beneficial effect from steroid treatment was found (random-effects model RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70–1.07; TSA-adjusted CI 0.38–1.99). Analyses stratified by risk of bias, severity of illness (SIRS and sepsis compared to severe sepsis and septic shock), and type of steroids (excluding trials using dexamethasone) all showed no statistically significant effects.

- **Serious adverse events excluding mortality**: No statistically significant difference was found in the overall proportion of serious adverse events (random-effects model RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90–1.17; TSA-adjusted RR 1.02, CI 0.70–1.48). No statistically significant differences were found in subgroups according to bias risk and disease severity.

- **Other outcomes**: Three trials with a high risk of bias reported mortality at 30 days; no 90-day follow-up data was reported. There was no statistically significant effect. Error matrix plots were constructed for an overview of all available data.

### Hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone for adults with septic shock [^116AUoKV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The study APROCCHSS, published by Djillali Annane and colleagues in 2018 in The New England Journal of Medicine, is related to sepsis and septic shock. The trial question in the APROCCHSS study was: What is the role of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone in adult patients with septic shock? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The study population included 1241 patients (415 female, 826 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with septic shock. Key exclusion criteria included the presence of septic shock for at least 24 hours, a high risk of bleeding, pregnancy or lactation, underlying conditions that could affect short-term survival, or previous treatment with corticosteroids.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 614 received hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h plus fludrocortisone 50 mcg via nasogastric tube once daily).
	- n = 627 received a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- A significant decrease in death at 90 days was observed (43% vs. 49%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.68).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in death at 28 days (34% vs. 39%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01).
	- Significant decrease in ICU mortality (35% vs. 41%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99).
	- Significant decrease in in-hospital mortality (39% vs. 45%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant differences were found in serious adverse events, bleeding, rate or site of superinfection, or new-onset sepsis.

### The effect of early goal-directed therapy on mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: a meta-analysis [^114katzH]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has recommended early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) as an essential strategy to decrease mortality among patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However, three recent multicenter trials failed to show its benefit in these patients. This article aimed to evaluate the effect of EGDT on the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

- **Methods**: Relevant studies from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were identified from January 1, 2001, to June 13, 2015. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were selected, and a meta-analysis of all identified trials was performed. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. In subgroups, RCTs and non-RCTs were analyzed separately.

- **Results**: A total of five RCTs and ten non-RCTs involving 3,285 patients in the EGDT group and 3,233 patients in the control group were identified. Pooled analyses of all studies showed a significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the EGDT group and the control group (risk ratio [RR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94; P = 0.003) with substantial heterogeneity (χ² = 24.93, P = 0.04, I² = 44%). In subgroup analysis, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the EGDT group and the control group in RCTs (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.10; P = 0.51) with no significant difference in heterogeneity (χ² = 6.62, P = 0.16, I² = 40%). In non-RCTs, EGDT significantly reduced in-hospital mortality.

### Comment on "Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008" by Dellinger et al [^116SqNPZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Secondly, the strong recommendation in favor of the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is not, in our view, aligned with the currently available evidence. This recommendation, like that in the guidelines of 2004, is still mainly based on outdated studies from the 1980s, a meta-analysis from 1991, and a large trial in 1998 without a control arm. However, the most recent meta-analysis shows no reduction in clinically important bleeding but is somehow completely ignored. Whether the results of these older trials are applicable today is questionable, as the incidence of stress ulcer-related bleeding has significantly decreased over recent decades due to improved ICU treatment. This definitely affects the balance between the benefit of preventing gastrointestinal bleeding and the increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to higher stomach pH.

Several recent trials show comparable rates of bleeding and endoscopic evidence of stress-related injury between treatment and placebo groups. These results are pathophysiologically plausible since stress ulcers are caused not by increased secretion of gastric acid but by splanchnic hypoperfusion. Unfortunately, many recent trials only compare H2 blockers with proton pump inhibitors, without a placebo group. Altogether, according to the most recent meta-analysis and more recent trials, a strong recommendation not to use stress ulcer prophylaxis would be more appropriate.

Thirdly, we disagree with the strength of the recommendation to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with severe sepsis. On the evidence…

### Intravenous administration of ulinastatin (human urinary trypsin inhibitor) in severe sepsis: a multicenter randomized controlled study [^1177w1yA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). High credibility.

This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ulinastatin in patients with severe sepsis showed that intravenous administration of ulinastatin, in a dose of 200,000 units twice daily for 5 days, was associated with a reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality (the primary endpoint) to 7.3% versus 20.3% in the placebo control group. A few small studies, published in Chinese-language journals, have shown lower mortality in patients treated with ulinastatin. Small randomized controlled trials have also been conducted by a single group of investigators comparing standard treatment with intravenous administration of ulinastatin in combination with alpha thymosin and found a reduction of mortality in patients with severe sepsis. Since these studies have all used a combination of two novel agents, it is unclear whether the survival benefit seen was due to either one of these agents or the combination. A small Korean study showed that mortality was lower in patients with severe sepsis treated with ulinastatin (18.6% vs. 27% in the control group). Our results further corroborate these studies and suggest that treatment with ulinastatin may reduce mortality in severe sepsis in humans.

### Transcriptomic signatures in sepsis and a differential response to steroids. From the VANISH randomized trial [^114rpwtn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection and is a major global health problem. Treatment of septic shock relies on antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors. No new or specific treatments for sepsis are in routine clinical practice.

Corticosteroids have been proposed as an adjunctive treatment for septic shock. However, results of clinical trials have been contradictory regarding their impact on outcomes. Recently, two large clinical trials have been published examining the effect of corticosteroids on mortality in septic shock. The ADRENAL (Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy in Patients with Septic Shock) study compared a hydrocortisone infusion to a placebo, whereas APROCCHSS (Hydrocortisone Plus Fludrocortisone for Adults with Septic Shock) used a combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Both showed clear benefits of corticosteroids on cardiovascular outcomes, demonstrated by shorter durations of shock; however, the effects on survival were inconsistent, with APROCCHSS reporting improved survival with corticosteroid treatment and ADRENAL reporting no difference. We hypothesize that variation in underlying patient phenotypes may account for these differences in outcome.

We have previously identified two transcriptomic sepsis response signatures (SRSs) based on genome-wide expression profiling in patients with sepsis, with community-acquired pneumonia and fecal peritonitis. SRS1 is a relatively immunosuppressed phenotype that is associated with increased mortality, whereas SRS2 is relatively immuno…

### A survival benefit of combination antibiotic therapy for serious infections associated with sepsis and septic shock is contingent only on the risk of death: a meta-analytic/meta-regression study [^112q3DQt]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To assess whether a potential benefit with combination antibiotic therapy is restricted to the most critically ill subset of patients, particularly those with septic shock, data were sourced from OVID MEDLINE (1950-October 2009), EMBASE (1980-October 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to third quarter 2009), the ClinicalTrial.gov database, and the SCOPUS database.

Randomized or observational studies of antimicrobial therapy for serious bacterial infections potentially associated with sepsis or septic shock were selected, with fifty studies meeting the entry criteria. Study design, mortality/clinical response, and other variables were extracted independently by two reviewers. When possible, study datasets were split into mutually exclusive groups with and without shock or critical illness.

Although a pooled odds ratio indicated no overall mortality/clinical response benefit with combination therapy (odds ratio, 0.856; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.03; p = .0943; I = 45.1%), stratification of datasets by monotherapy mortality risk demonstrated substantial benefit in the most severely ill subset (monotherapy risk of death > 25%; odds ratio of death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.64; I = 8.6%).

Among those datasets stratified by the presence of shock/critical illness, the more severely ill group consistently demonstrated increased efficacy of a combination therapy strategy (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.70; p < .0001; I = 0%). An increased risk of death was found in low-risk patients.

### Dexmedetomidine improves the outcomes for pediatric severe sepsis with mechanical ventilation [^1167qveT]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The sedative dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis, but it is not known whether children benefit. This study explored the effects of dexmedetomidine on the outcomes of children with severe sepsis requiring mechanical ventilation.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, children with severe sepsis requiring mechanical ventilation from 2016 to 2020 were categorized into dexmedetomidine and non-dexmedetomidine groups. Propensity score matching was performed to match cases in both groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury, ventilator-free days, and lengths of PICU and hospital stays. The Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used to estimate the 28-day mortality rate and assess between-group differences.

- **Results**: In total, 250 patients were eligible: 138 in the dexmedetomidine group and 112 in the non-dexmedetomidine group. After 1:1 propensity score matching, there were 61 children in each group. The dexmedetomidine group showed significantly lower 28-day mortality (9.84% vs. 26.23%, P = 0.008). During the 7-day observation period after PICU admission, the dexmedetomidine group exhibited significantly lower neurological and renal sub-scores at day 7, and serum creatinine levels at day 3 and day 7. There were no statistical differences in the incidence of acute kidney injury, ventilator-free days, or lengths of PICU and hospital stays between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: Dexmedetomidine treatment in children with severe sepsis is associated with better outcomes and should be considered in this patient population.

### Meta-analysis: The effect of steroids on survival and shock during sepsis depends on the dose [^111XkAu5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Previous meta-analyses demonstrated that high-dose glucocorticoids were not beneficial in sepsis. Recently, lower-dose glucocorticoids have been studied.

- **Purpose**: To compare recent trials of glucocorticoids for sepsis with previous glucocorticoid trials.

- **Data sources**: Systematic MEDLINE search for studies published between 1988 and 2003.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials of sepsis that examined the effects of glucocorticoids on survival or vasopressor requirements.

- **Data extraction**: Two investigators independently collected data on patient and study characteristics, treatment interventions, and outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: The five included trials revealed a consistent and beneficial effect of glucocorticoids on survival (I2 = 0%; relative benefit, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.50]; P = 0.036) and shock reversal (I2 = 0%; relative benefit, 1.71 [CI, 1.29 to 2.26]; P < 0.001). These effects were the same regardless of adrenal function. In contrast, eight trials published before 1989 demonstrated a survival disadvantage with steroid treatment (I2 = 14%; relative benefit, 0.89 [CI, 0.82 to 0.97]; P = 0.008). Compared to earlier trials, the more recent trials administered steroids later after patients met enrollment criteria (median, 23 hours vs. < 2 hours; P = 0.02), for longer courses (6 days vs. 1 day; P = 0.01), and in lower total dosages (hydrocortisone equivalents, 1209 mg vs. 23,975 mg; P = 0.01) to patients with higher control group mortality rates (mean, 57% vs. 34%; P = 0.06) who were more likely to be vasopressor-dependent (100% vs. 65%; P = 0).

### Monotherapy or combination therapy for septic shock? A debate on steroids [^111QKvc6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

In summary, the findings of this meta-analysis are anticipated to spark significant debate. Some clinicians may view the findings as robust enough to start considering a combination of corticosteroids while managing adult patients with septic shock. Others may remain skeptical. Regardless of their clinical stance, one should keep in mind that sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome encompassing several subphenotypes that may respond differently to corticosteroids. Precision medicine research efforts may endeavor to distinguish, among patients with septic shock, those who will be harmed by any corticosteroid regimen, those who will derive benefit from hydrocortisone alone, and those who will gain survival benefit from the combination of fludrocortisone plus hydrocortisone.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine clinical practice guideline on fluid therapy in adult critically ill patients. Part 1: the choice of resuscitation fluids [^115XApbf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for sepsis and septic shock, particularly with respect to fluid resuscitation and the choice of fluids, the ESICM 2024 guidelines recommend administering isotonic crystalloids rather than small-volume hypertonic crystalloids in critically ill patients.

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: A clinical practice guideline [^116nLRpd]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

With the exception of the awaited analysis of quality of life in the ADRENAL trial, there are currently no planned or ongoing RCTs in patients who have sepsis that are likely to substantively change the overall effect estimates for the key outcomes. Given the remaining uncertainty regarding the effect of corticosteroids in different subgroups, additional analyses of existing data to explore heterogeneity of treatment effects are logical next steps before more patients are enrolled in similar trials. Such work mandates individual patient-data meta-analyses that rely on investigators sharing the data from their RCTs and cooperation among research networks.

It is possible that additional adaptive RCTs could help to resolve remaining uncertainty. Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are as follows:

- **What is the impact of corticosteroid therapy on quality of life** in the short and long term?
- **What is the impact of corticosteroid therapy on functional recovery?**
- **What is the impact of corticosteroid therapy on healthcare costs?**
- **Are there subgroups of patients with sepsis who benefit more or less from corticosteroid therapy?**
- **Are there differences between bolus and infusion dosing?**
- **Does the addition of fludrocortisone improve outcomes?**

### (1 → 3)-β-d-glucan-guided antifungal therapy in adults with sepsis: The CandiSep randomized clinical trial [^1162eLYr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In this multicenter randomized trial, BDG guidance in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock and at high risk for invasive Candida infection (ICI) resulted in a more frequent and earlier initiation of antifungal therapy but did not improve 28-day mortality. None of the pre-defined subgroups showed a benefit from the BDG-guided early antifungal therapy. However, we observed a higher antifungal-free survival at day 28 in the control group compared to the BDG group. Thus, BDG-guided patients were more likely to receive antifungal therapy and, thereby, might generate higher costs for antifungal therapy.

International guidelines recommend antifungal therapy in critically ill patients without proven Candida infection but with inherent risk factors. This recommendation is based on the high risk of developing ICI and the high mortality rate in case of untreated ICI in this patient population. Some studies suggested a benefit for risk-based antifungal therapy, while other randomized controlled trials did not show a benefit for such an approach. Our study now demonstrates that a BDG-guided initiation of early antifungal therapy was not superior to a wait-and-see culture-based approach in a sepsis population with a high risk of ICI.

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: A clinical practice guideline [^116yLkZk]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a syndrome of life-threatening infection with organ dysfunction, and most guidelines do not advise the use of corticosteroids to treat it in the absence of refractory shock. Two new trials of corticosteroid treatment for sepsis came to differing conclusions. Corticosteroids may reduce the risk of death by a small amount and increase neuromuscular weakness by a small amount, but the evidence is not definitive. This guideline makes a weak recommendation for corticosteroids in patients with sepsis; both steroids and no steroids are reasonable management options. Fully informed patients who value avoiding death over quality of life and function would likely choose corticosteroids.

- **Corticosteroids and sepsis recovery**: Do corticosteroids reduce death or improve recovery in people with sepsis or septic shock? Our panel makes a weak recommendation to give corticosteroids to people with all types and severity of sepsis, based on new evidence. Because we are not certain that they are beneficial, it is also reasonable not to prescribe them. Patients' values and preferences may guide this decision-making process.

- **Trials influencing recommendations**: This rapid recommendation was triggered by two trials with differing conclusions whose results might change practice:
	- **ADRENAL trial**: Enrolled 3,658 patients with septic shock and found no statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups.
	- **APROCCHSS trial**: Included 1,241 patients with septic shock and found that hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone reduced 90-day mortality.

These trials are incorporated into a linked systematic review comparing corticosteroids with placebo.

- **Subgroup analyses**: In the subgroup analysis stratified by admission to the ICU, patients who had been admitted to the ICU had slightly lower HRs for the composite MACE endpoint (HR 0.84 versus 0.89, P for interaction < 0.001), ischemic stroke (HR 0.79 versus 0.93, P for interaction = 0.001), and myocardial infarction (HR 0.70 versus 0.83, P for interaction < 0.001). However, they had a slightly higher HR for all‐cause mortality (HR 0.72 versus 0.63, P for interaction < 0.001) and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.86 versus 0.80, P for interaction < 0.001) than those who had not been admitted to the ICU.

After stratification by the use of inotropes, inotrope users had slightly lower HRs for the composite MACE endpoint (HR 0.78 versus 0.91, P for interaction < 0.001), myocardial infarction (HR 0.69 versus 0.77, P for interaction < 0.001), and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.73 versus 0.90, P for interaction < 0.001). However, they had a slightly higher HR for all‐cause mortality (HR 0.72 versus 0.66, P for interaction < 0.001) than those who did not use inotropes.

### Lower versus higher hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in septic shock [^111tgs4z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The study TRISS was published by Holst LB and colleagues in 2014 in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine. The study pertains to sepsis and septic shock, transfusion strategies in critical care, and red blood cell transfusion.

The trial investigated the effect of a lower hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in patients with septic shock. It was designed as a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) and included 998 patients (467 female, 531 male). The inclusion criteria were patients in the ICU with septic shock and a hemoglobin concentration ≤ 9 g/dL. Key exclusion criteria included declining transfusion, previous adverse reactions to transfusion, receiving blood transfusion in the ICU, acute coronary syndrome, life-threatening bleeding, and acute burn injury.

- **Interventions**:
	- Restrictive blood transfusion therapy was administered to 502 patients (1 unit of leukoreduced red cells when hemoglobin level ≤ 7 g/dL).
	- Liberal blood transfusion therapy was administered to 496 patients (1 unit of leukoreduced red cells when hemoglobin level ≤ 9 g/dL).

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in death at 90 days (43% vs. 45%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.09).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in the use of life support at day 28 (16.1% vs. 19.9%; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.09).
	- No significant difference in ischemic events in the ICU (7.2% vs. 8%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39).

- **Safety outcomes**: There were no significant differences in severe adverse reactions.

### Effects of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: A systemic review, meta-analysis update, and disease severity subgroup meta-analysis [^116msJGN]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported a survival benefit for polymyxin B hemoperfusion treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However, recently, a propensity-matched analysis and a randomized controlled trial reported no survival benefit for polymyxin B hemoperfusion treatment. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis to determine the effect of polymyxin B hemoperfusion treatment on mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to May 2016.

- **Study selection**: Studies investigating the effect of polymyxin B hemoperfusion on mortality were considered eligible. We searched for terms related to severe sepsis and septic shock, and terms related to polymyxin B hemoperfusion.

- **Data extraction**: The following data were extracted from the original articles: the name of the first author and publication year, subjects and setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, mean age and size of the study population, male percentage, mortality, blood pressure, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, pulmonary oxygenation, and levels of endotoxin and humoral cytokines.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 17 trials were included. The pooled risk ratio for overall mortality was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.70–0.95), favoring polymyxin B hemoperfusion (p = 0.007). Disease severity subgroup meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction of mortality in the intermediate- and high-risk groups (risk ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.92 and risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52–0.78, respectively), but not in the low-risk group.

### Hydrocortisone therapy for patients with septic shock [^116T6VW4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). High credibility.

The study CORTICUS, published by Charles L. Sprung and colleagues in 2008 in The New England Journal of Medicine, addresses the role of hydrocortisone therapy in patients with septic shock. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved a population of 499 patients, comprising 167 females and 332 males. The inclusion criteria required patients to be diagnosed with septic shock. Key exclusion criteria included underlying disease with poor prognosis, life expectancy of less than 24 hours, immunosuppression, and treatment with long-term corticosteroids within the past 6 months, or short-term corticosteroids within the past 4 weeks.

- **Interventions**:
	- 251 patients received hydrocortisone (intravenous 50 mg every 6 hours for 5 days).
	- 248 patients received a placebo (identical placebo intravenous every 6 hours for 5 days).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- No significant difference in death at 28 days among corticotropin non-responders (39.2% vs. 36.1%; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.52).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in death at 28 days among corticotropin responders (28.8% vs. 28.7%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.49).
	- No significant difference in death at 28 days overall (34.3% vs. 31.5%; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.41).
	- Significant decrease in time to reversal of shock (3.3 days vs. 5.8 days; AD -2.5 days, 95% CI -3.98 to -1.02).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- Significant differences were observed in new sepsis incidences.

### Inhibition of sepsis-induced inflammatory response by β1-adrenergic antagonists [^114V6ZZs]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Although previous studies have described potential benefits of nonselective β-adrenergic antagonist therapy in sepsis, there is a paucity of data on the use of β1-selective antagonists (B1AA). The purposes of this study were to describe the effects of B1AA on survival in septic animals and to explore molecular mechanisms of potential treatment benefit.

- **Methods**: C57BL/6 male mice received intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide. A continuous infusion of a B1AA (esmolol) or an equal volume of saline (control) was initiated at 4 hours after injection. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 120 hours was used to explore mortality differences. A subgroup of animals was sacrificed for microarray expression analysis. Top candidate genes were validated in vitro and in silico. Expression of our candidate genes in a human microarray database (GSE28750) was explored.

- **Results**: B1AA infusion resulted in increased survival (p = 0.001) at 120 hours. The mean survival difference was 23.6 hours (p = 0.002). The hazard ratio for mortality with B1AA is 0.43 (95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.72). Immunologic disease (p = 0.0003–0.036) and cell death/survival (p = 0.0001–0.042) were significantly associated with improved survival in septic mice treated with B1AA. Further analysis of the gene structure revealed that eight genes shared common promoter activating sequences for NFKB and/or BRCA1 motifs. Analysis of a human sepsis database identified the up-regulation of CAMP (p = 0.032) and TNFSF10 (p = 0.001) genes in septic patients compared with healthy controls.

- **Conclusion**: Continued analysis and research are needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in B1AA treatment for sepsis.

### Outcome of immediate versus early antibiotics in severe sepsis and septic shock: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134G8se]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Debate exists about the mortality benefit of administering antibiotics within either 1 or 3 hours of sepsis onset. This study aimed to analyze the effect of immediate (0 to 1 hour after onset) versus early (1 to 3 hours after onset) antibiotics on mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

- **Methods**: This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Databases searched included PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and gray literature. Included studies involved consecutive adults with severe sepsis or septic shock who received antibiotics within each period and provided mortality data. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and pooled using random effects. The quality of evidence across all studies was independently assessed by two authors using Cochrane's Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and assessed for risk of bias with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

- **Results**: Thirteen studies were included: five prospective longitudinal and eight retrospective cohort studies. Three studies (23%) demonstrated a high risk of bias (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Overall, the quality of evidence across all studies was low (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data pooling involving 33,863 subjects showed no difference in mortality between patients receiving antibiotics in immediate versus early periods (odds ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.21). Analysis of severe sepsis studies included 8,595 subjects.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: Systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^117DpwVm]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to perform a systematic review according to a published protocol following guidelines from PRISMA and The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We also planned to execute meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) of randomized clinical trials that compared the benefits and harms of high and/or low dose steroids for patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Our primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up and serious adverse events.

Available evidence was to be evaluated in the perspective of the three dimensions of possible risks of errors: systematic errors (bias), design errors (also leading to systematic errors due to outcomes, comparators, etc), and random errors ('the play of chance').

### Efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in three specific populations with sepsis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Hsicj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). High credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy has generally failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall sepsis population. In our study, we conducted separate meta-analyses of anticoagulant therapy in three distinct populations. Survival benefits were only observed in the population with septic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We recommend that further randomized controlled trials focus on specific populations with septic DIC.

Although many preclinical trials have shown the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant therapy as an adjuvant treatment against sepsis, there is scant evidence supporting its efficacy in reducing mortality among the general sepsis population in clinical settings. Nevertheless, several studies suggest that targeted anticoagulant therapy may potentially lower mortality in patients with sepsis-induced DIC.

Our objective was to investigate whether the survival benefits of anticoagulant therapy apply to the coagulopathic population with sepsis. We conducted separate meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials involving anticoagulant therapy in three populations:

- **Overall sepsis population**
- **Population with sepsis-induced coagulopathy**
- **Population with sepsis-induced DIC**:

We searched databases including MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, comparing anticoagulant therapy with placebo or no intervention in sepsis patients. We measured all-cause mortality as the primary outcome, and bleeding complications as the secondary outcome.

We analyzed data from the included studies.

### Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QdzkP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of corticosteroids on clinical outcomes of patients with sepsis remain controversial. We aimed to further determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis by comparison with placebo.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), as well as the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of Science, were searched for all controlled studies that compared corticosteroids and placebo in adult patients with severe sepsis. The primary outcome was the 28-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were mortality at the longest follow-up, occurrence, and reoccurrence of septic shock.

- **Results**: A total of 19 trials involving 7,035 patients were pooled in our final analyses. No significant heterogeneity was found in any of the outcome measures. Compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with a lower 28-day mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.98, Z = 2.57, P = 0.01) both in patients having sepsis and in those who developed septic shock (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–0.99, Z = 2.19, P = 0.03). However, no significant difference was found in mortality with the longest follow-up in patients either having sepsis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–1.00, Z = 1.93, P = 0.05), occurrence (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.56–1.24, Z = 0.90, P = 0.37), or reoccurrence of septic shock (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00–1.16, Z = 1.89, P = 0.06).

- **Conclusions**: Corticosteroids were effective in reducing the 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and in those with septic shock.

### Arterial catheterization and in-hospital mortality in sepsis: a propensity score-matched study [^112u6cV3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, for the primary cohort (Table 2) and all of the secondary cohorts (Fig. 2, Table S1) in the septic shock group, we found no association between arterial catheter (AC) placement and outcomes. One potential interpretation is that AC use does not bring a net mortality benefit to septic shock patients. The blood gas testing and hemodynamic monitoring obtained from indwelling arterial catheters (IAC) do not translate into effects on mortality, or the risks they bring offset their benefits. Alternatively, the results of this analysis may be attributed to unmeasured confounding, despite attempts to adjust for confounders by using multiple logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM). Patients receiving ACs are potentially in more severe condition, which may not be distinguished by indicators and severity scores. The use of ACs ameliorates and covers this imbalance; thus, no mortality effect is detected.

As for the sepsis without shock group, both the primary cohort (Table 2) and 4 of 10 secondary cohorts (Fig. 2) demonstrated that AC was associated with an increased risk of mortality. Hemodynamically stable patients are less likely to benefit from AC, while the use of AC will increase the risk of complications, which might lead to higher mortality. In addition, AC placement seemed to be harmful in hemodynamically stable sepsis patients with AC placement within 24 hours after ICU admission, while some results showed no statistical difference. On the one hand, it may be that the AC placement does not have a significant impact on in-hospital mortality, and the harmful result in the primary cohort may come from the bias caused by measurement.

### Risk and the efficacy of antiinflammatory agents: Retrospective and confirmatory studies of sepsis [^114dWKZ8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We investigated whether a relationship between the risk of death and treatment effect could explain the disparate results between the preclinical and clinical sepsis trials of antiinflammatory agents over the last decade. A metaregression analysis of cited preclinical studies showed that the treatment effects of these agents were highly dependent on the risk of death (p = 0.0001) and that animals were studied at significantly higher control mortality rates than humans (median [25th-75th quartile], 88% [79–96%] versus 39% [32–42%], p = 0.0001). An analysis of the clinical trials showed that antiinflammatory agents were also significantly more efficacious in septic patients with a higher risk of death (p = 0.002) and were harmful in those with low risk.

To test this relationship prospectively, we studied antiinflammatory agents in models employing differing doses of bacterial challenge to produce the full range of risk of death. We found that the efficacy of these agents, although very beneficial at high control mortality rates, was much reduced (p = 0.0001) and similar to those in human trials at moderate control mortality rates (i.e. 30 to 40%). The efficacy of antiinflammatory agents during sepsis is dependent on the risk of death, an observation that explains the apparent contradiction between preclinical and clinical trial results. Accounting for this relationship may be necessary for the safe and effective development of antiinflammatory therapies for sepsis.

### Orilissa [^115fAkCh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were observed in two placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies EM-1 and EM-2). In these studies, 5.5% of subjects treated with Orilissa 150 mg once daily and 9.6% of subjects treated with Orilissa 200 mg twice daily discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions compared to 6.0% of those given placebo. Discontinuations were most commonly due to hot flushes or night sweats (1.1% with 150 mg once daily and 2.5% with 200 mg twice daily) and nausea (0.8% with 150 mg once daily and 1.5% with 200 mg twice daily), with both being dose-related. The majority of discontinuations due to hot flushes or night sweats (10 of 17, 59%) and nausea (7 of 11, 64%) occurred within the first 2 months of therapy.

In the two extension trials (Studies EM-3 and EM-4), discontinuations were most commonly due to decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and were dose-related. In these trials, 0.3% of subjects treated with Orilissa 150 mg once daily and 3.6% of subjects treated with Orilissa 200 mg twice daily discontinued therapy due to decreased BMD.

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: A clinical practice guideline [^113YEgjf]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Our recommendation applies to all patients with sepsis. There was no meaningful difference in the efficacy of corticosteroids in different groups of patients, including those with septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or other sources of sepsis, or those who were sicker. However, the absolute reduction in mortality from corticosteroids will be greater in patients with a higher risk of death. The absolute harm, such as neuromuscular weakness, will also be greater in sicker patients.

The analysis of a subgroup effect showed no convincing evidence of such an effect. Based on published criteria for credible subgroup effects, in the absence of a subgroup effect, the interpretation of the effect of corticosteroids in any particular subgroup should be guided by the effect in the overall population of septic patients.

Several trials of corticosteroids for pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome have enrolled patients who did not have sepsis; we did not consider these trials. Therefore, clinicians treating these conditions should also consider evidence and guidelines applicable to patients who have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Patient values and preferences**: Fully informed patients who place a higher value on avoiding death than on quality of life and function would be more likely to choose to receive corticosteroids. We heard from our patient partners that most patients will want to reduce their risk of death, even if this reduction is small and uncertain. This view is consistent with the experiences of the re[mainder of this sentence is incomplete].

### Drotrecogin alfa (activated) for adults with severe sepsis and a low risk of death [^116h6NoY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In November 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) for adults with severe sepsis and a high risk of death. The FDA mandated a study to evaluate the efficacy of DrotAA for adults with severe sepsis and a low risk of death.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned adult patients with severe sepsis and a low risk of death (defined by an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score < 25 or single-organ failure) to receive an intravenous infusion of placebo or DrotAA (24 microg per kilogram of body weight per hour) for 96 hours in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. The prospectively defined primary endpoint was death from any cause, assessed 28 days after the start of the infusion. In-hospital mortality within 90 days after the start of the infusion was measured, and safety information was collected.

- **Results**: Enrollment in the trial was terminated early due to a low likelihood of achieving the prospectively defined objective of demonstrating a significant reduction in the 28-day mortality rate with the use of DrotAA. The study enrolled 2640 patients and collected data on 2613 (1297 in the placebo group and 1316 in the DrotAA group) at the 28-day follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the placebo group and the DrotAA group in 28-day mortality (17.0 percent in the placebo group vs. 18.5 percent in the DrotAA group; P = 0.34; relative risk, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.28) or in in-hospital mortality (20.5 percent vs. 20.6 percent).

### Avycaz [^113VC7vs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The administration of prior or concomitant Gram-negative antibacterial therapy can confound the assessment of trial results. However, a subgroup analysis of 28-day all-cause mortality in subjects who received 24 hours or less of potentially effective antibacterial therapy prior to randomization and 72 hours or less of concomitant potentially effective antibacterial therapy following randomization produced results similar to the overall ITT population, with AVYCAZ mortality at 10.0% (20/200) and meropenem at 6.2% (12/195) [difference 3.8%; 95% CI: -1.6% to 9.5%].

In the subset of patients who received more than 24 hours of potentially effective antibacterial therapy prior to randomization or more than 72 hours of concomitant potentially effective antibacterial therapy following randomization, results were similar to the overall ITT population (AVYCAZ 9.7% (25/258), meropenem 10.5% (28/266) [difference -0.08%; 95% CI: -6.1% to 4.4%]).

- **All-cause mortality rates**: Of the 382 patients in the micro-ITT population, 36 patients were bacteremic at baseline. In the AVYCAZ arm, 20/21 (95.2%) survived through the day-28 follow-up visit, with 13/21 (61.9%) achieving a clinical cure at the TOC visit. In the meropenem arm, 13/15 (86.7%) patients survived through the day-28 follow-up visit, with 9/15 (60%) achieving a clinical cure at the TOC visit.

### Effect of targeted polymyxin B hemoperfusion on 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and elevated endotoxin level: The EUPHRATES randomized clinical trial [^1139QZSN]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The EUPHRATES study, published by R. Phillip Dellinger and colleagues in JAMA in 2018, investigates the impact of targeted polymyxin B hemoperfusion on patients suffering from septic shock with elevated endotoxin levels.

- **Study background**: The study focuses on diseases such as sepsis and septic shock. The research question was: What is the effect of targeted polymyxin B hemoperfusion in patients with septic shock and high endotoxin activity?

- **Study design and population**: The study employed a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) design. The population included 450 patients (177 females, 273 males). Inclusion criteria involved adult critically ill patients with septic shock and an endotoxin activity assay level > 0.60. Key exclusion criteria included treatment limitations that prevented further escalation in organ support, initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT), or a terminal disease state precluding short-term survival.

- **Interventions**: Patients were divided into two groups:
	- n = 224 received polymyxin B hemoperfusion (2 hemoperfusion treatments within 24 hours with a target duration of 90–120 minutes, plus standard therapy).
	- n = 226 underwent sham hemoperfusion (recirculation of 0.9% saline for 2 hours to simulate hemoperfusion, plus conventional medical therapy).

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality rates (37.7% vs. 34.5%; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39).
	- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality rates among patients with a multiple organ dysfunction score > 9 (44.5% vs. 43.9%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the change in multiple organ dysfunction score for all patients.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: Systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^114DL8LG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: We did not find evidence for a beneficial effect of an intervention with steroids in patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock in this systematic review with meta-analyses and TSA, including 35 randomized trials with 4,682 patients. High doses (> 500 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent) and low doses (≤ 500 mg hydrocortisone or equivalent) of steroids were evaluated in separate comparisons, and no evidence of a beneficial effect was found. Moreover, TSA suggested that more than 17,000 patients need to be randomized before firm conclusions can be drawn on any present or absent intervention effect with a 10% RRR. Evidence has been reached to refute a 20% RRR with a power of 80%.

Our conclusion contrasts with previous publications suggesting beneficial effects associated with the use of a long course of low-dose steroids. Differences might be explained by another search strategy and different analyses with improved accounting for risks of systematic, design, and random errors. There is accumulating evidence that random error plays an important role in premature conclusions of spurious significant findings. In simulation studies, up to 30% of premature declarations of significant effects are, in fact, overestimations of intervention effects once sufficient evidence has been reached.

### A randomized trial of protocol-based care for early septic shock [^112QG2ty]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The study, ProCESS (septic shock), was published in 2014 by ProCESS Investigators in the journal New England Journal of Medicine. This study relates to the diseases of sepsis and septic shock. In the ProCESS (septic shock) study, the trial examined the role of protocol-based care in patients with early septic shock. The study was designed as a multi-center, open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population consisted of 1,341 patients, with 593 females and 748 males. Patients included were those diagnosed with septic shock in the emergency department. Key exclusion criteria comprised the need for immediate surgery, active gastrointestinal bleeding, contraindications to central venous catheter placement, acute coronary syndrome, major cardiac arrhythmia, seizure, and acute pulmonary edema.

- **Interventions**:
	n = 885 protocol-based therapy consisting of either protocol-based early goal-directed therapy or protocol-based standard therapy; n = 456 received usual care directed by bedside providers.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was no significant difference in in-hospital death at 60 days, with rates being 19.5% and 18.9% respectively (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.31).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference was found in potentially serious adverse events, excluding death.

The conclusion of the ProCESS (septic shock) study was that, in patients diagnosed with septic shock in the emergency department, protocol-based therapy was not superior to usual care with respect to in-hospital outcomes.

### Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in sepsis: Update on clinical trials and lessons learned [^111pfWeU]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important mediator involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis. This paper reviews clinical studies investigating the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in decreasing mortality rates in septic patients.

- **Data sources**: We conducted a computerized bibliographic search of randomized, clinical, multicenter trials studying the effects of anti-TNF therapy in the treatment of sepsis. We included all primary studies, reviewed all published meta-analyses, and contacted primary investigators of multicenter trials where necessary.

- **Data synthesis**: Almost all randomized studies targeting TNF during sepsis show a small, albeit nonsignificant, benefit in decreasing mortality. Strategies using monoclonal antibodies are more effective than those using TNF receptor proteins. Analysis of randomized multicenter trials shows a small but significant benefit with anti-TNF therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, a recent study in 2634 septic patients using a murine anti-TNF antibody shows a 3.6% significant benefit in reducing mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Anti-TNF strategies are only partially effective in patients with sepsis. Although individual studies show small, nonsignificant benefits, analysis of all trial data, as well as data from a recent trial in a large population of septic patients, show that anti-TNF strategies may confer a small survival benefit. Better characterization of patients and a more multimodal approach by concomitantly targeting other mediators involved in sepsis may be helpful in enlarging the clinical benefit of anti-TNF therapy.

### Two phase 3 trials of inclisiran in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol [^1125MFxR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The study ORION-10 was published in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease. The ORION-10 trial explored the role of inclisiran in patients with increased LDL-C despite statin therapy. It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 1561 patients (478 female, 1083 male). The inclusion criteria required patients with ASCVD who had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. Key exclusion criteria included uncontrolled or serious disease, NYHA class IV heart failure, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled severe hypertension, active liver disease, and treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed toward PCSK9 within 90 days before screening.

The interventions included 781 patients receiving inclisiran (284 mg administered subcutaneously on day 1, day 90, day 270, and day 450) and 780 patients receiving a matching placebo administered subcutaneously.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in the reduction of LDL cholesterol at day 510 (51.3% vs. -1%; absolute difference [AD] 52.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 55.7).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in time-adjusted LDL cholesterol reduction from day 90 to 540 (51.3% vs. -2.5%; AD 53.8%, 95% CI 51.3 to 56.2).
	- Significant increase in the reduction of absolute LDL cholesterol level at day 510 (56.2 mg/dL vs. 2.1 mg/dL; AD 54.1 mg/dL, 95% CI 50.9 to 57.4).

### Tygacil [^115BSSvb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in TYGACIL-treated patients versus comparator-treated patients. In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4.0% (150/3788) of patients receiving TYGACIL and 3.0% (110/3646) of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, the adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2) between TYGACIL and comparator-treated patients. An analysis of mortality in all trials conducted for approved indications (cSSSI, cIAI, and CABP), including post-market trials, showed an adjusted mortality rate of 2.5% (66/2640) for tigecycline and 1.8% (48/2628) for comparator, respectively. The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2).

The cause of this mortality difference has not been established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection, or underlying co-morbidities. TYGACIL should be reserved for use in situations when alternative treatments are not suitable [see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Sepsis in the 21st century: Recent definitions and therapeutic advances [^115QLdp9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sepsis as a disease has received renewed interest following recent publications of a revised clinical definition and crucial clinical trials showcasing the benefits of early goal-directed resuscitation, recombinant human activated protein C, and low-dose corticosteroids. The epidemiology of sepsis has also been further examined. Management guidelines and international quality improvement efforts have been developed with the goal of increasing disease identification, enhancing clinician education, and optimizing patient care. These efforts have led to a decrease in patient mortality. The evidence suggests that early recognition and early intervention are most significant in affecting outcomes. This article summarizes these developments in the diagnosis and management of sepsis at the turn of this century.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: Systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1114vmtD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the intensive care unit (ICU), up to 25% of admissions are related to sepsis, and an additional 12% of patients develop sepsis during their stay. Sepsis, and if deteriorating, septic shock, have a high morbidity and mortality. Depending on the definition of sepsis, mortality varies from 27% to 54%. To decrease this high rate of morbidity and mortality, several interventions have been suggested. Bundled interventions, like those of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, aim to improve the outcome of patients by, among others, early antibiotics, glucocorticosteroids (steroids), and supportive care.

Based on supposed pathophysiological mechanisms, two rationales for steroids in sepsis have been put forward. The first rationale is that high-dose steroids may suppress the excess inflammatory response in sepsis. In the 1970s and the early 1980s, high-dose steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent dose) were used in sepsis. In the late 1980s, the use declined on the basis of negative results of randomized clinical trials; however, in some centers, high-dose steroids are still used in clinical practice today. The second rationale, introduced in the 1990s, is that low-dose steroids may recover a relative adrenal insufficiency. Many trials have been conducted, but the pathophysiological basis of the second rationale is still questioned. Possibly, both high and low-dose steroids can have beneficial or harmful effects in sepsis.

Despite the lack of evidence for the underlying mechanism, the use of low doses of 200–300 mg hydrocortisone is recommended in patients with sepsis.

### Clinical potential of inclisiran for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^116NMPcM]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). High credibility.

Based on data from the phase 3 ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 trials that have confirmed the tolerability and efficacy of inclisiran in the long term, inclisiran (Leqvio®, inclisiran 284 mg/1.5 mL solution for injection in a prefilled syringe) was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2020 and by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2021 for primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. It needs to be stored at room temperature of 20–25 °C (68–77 °F) with allowable excursions between 15 and 30 °C (59–86 °F).

- **ORION-4 Trial**: The ORION-4 trial (NCT03705234) is an ongoing double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial which has enrolled approximately 15,000 patients with established ASCVD in the United Kingdom and United States to assess the effect of inclisiran on the cardiovascular outcomes over a median follow-up duration of 5 years. The estimated primary completion date is December 2024. This result is expected worldwide, as it will provide valuable information on the clinical benefits of inclisiran in cardiovascular event prevention.

- **VICTORION program**: Currently, the VICTORION program, including part of the ORION studies, is underway to assess the benefit of inclisiran therapy on the life of high-risk patients.

	- **VICTORION-2PREVENT trial**: The VICTORION-2PREVENT trial (NCT05030428) is a phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trial for patients with established ASCVD in multiple countries. This global study is designed to assess whether inclisiran reduces the risk of 3-point-major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

### Effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on long-term major adverse cardiovascular events in sepsis survivors [^114CfhRX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The study explored the impact of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals who survived sepsis. The findings suggest potential benefits of RAAS inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular risks, highlighting the importance of managing cardiovascular health in this patient population.

### Reassessing the value of short-term mortality in sepsis: comparing conventional approaches to modeling [^115dyyAq]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study recognizes that clinical trials targeting therapies for sepsis have largely been unsuccessful in significantly impacting mortality. This may be partly attributed to the use of insensitive mortality endpoints. The research explores whether modeling survival outcomes is more sensitive than traditional endpoints in detecting mortality differences among cohorts of patients with sepsis.

Patients were stratified into seven a priori defined paired subgroups that reflected high and low mortality risk based on known clinical risk factors. An exponential survival model was applied to the high- and low-risk cohorts in each subgroup, providing estimates related to the rate of dying, long-term survival, and excess day 1 mortality. Mortality comparisons between high- and low-risk cohorts within each subgroup were conducted using model parameters, fixed-point mortality, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

The setting for this study included eight intensive care units within a university teaching institution. A total of 130 patients were involved, all diagnosed with severe sepsis or suspected Gram-negative bacteremia. No specific interventions were applied during the study.

Measurements and main results reveal an overall mortality rate of 58.5% at 28 days. The survival of the entire cohort was aptly described by an exponential model (r² = 0.99). The modeling approach identified differences between high- and low-risk cohorts in five out of the seven paired subgroups, whereas conventional endpoints detected differences in only two.

The conclusions drawn from the study suggest that modeling survival is more sensitive than conventional endpoints in identifying survival differences between high- and low-risk subgroups. The researchers advocate for further evaluation of modeling to uncover more sensitive methods.

### Improving empiric antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with abdominal infection: The INSPIRE 4 cluster randomized clinical trial [^111V8vhK]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The study INSPIRE 4, published by Shruti K. Gohil and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Surgery, relates to the following diseases: acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, acute diverticulitis, and intra-abdominal abscess. The trial investigated the role of a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) stewardship bundle in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infections. This multi-center, open-label randomized clinical trial included a population of 105,004 patients, comprised of 62,101 females and 42,903 males. The inclusion criteria specified noncritically ill patients hospitalized with an abdominal infection, while key exclusion criteria included age under 18 years and orders to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics for abdominal infection.

- **Interventions**:
	- CPOE stewardship bundle (n = 50,620) featured computerized patient order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics, coupled with clinician education and feedback.
	- Routine stewardship (n = 54,384) involved educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities per national guidelines.

- **Primary outcome**: The study observed a significant increase in the reduction of extended-spectrum days of therapy, from 169.3 days per 1,000 empiric days to 19.8 days per 1,000 empiric days (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.66).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was also a significant increase in the reduction of vancomycin days of therapy, from 29.7 days per 1,000 empiric days to 11.8 days per 1,000 empiric days (RR 1.2).

### The effect of early goal-directed therapy on outcome in adult severe sepsis and septic shock patients: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1167ejn5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis showed no significantly reduced all-cause mortality in patients resuscitated with early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) when compared with control therapy. This meta-analysis differs considerably from those of recently published meta-analyses, but we obtained similar results.

- **Trial sequential analysis**: In our meta-analysis, TSA indicated a lack of firm evidence for our results because of considerable heterogeneity between groups. Our results suggest that although three recent multicenter randomized controlled studies reported negative results, conclusive evidence regarding the benefit of EGDT is not possible, and more randomized controlled trials are needed.

- **Patient subgroup analysis**: Our results, however, suggest that some patient subgroups may benefit from EGDT. For example, we found a trend toward the longest complete follow-up mortality benefit with EGDT in patients with a higher severity of disease (APACHE II score ≥ 20). In addition, EGDT was associated with decreased ICU mortality when compared with control care. These results suggest that EGDT may have some benefits in more critically ill patients.

- **Recommendations and guidelines**: As the cornerstone for resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, EGDT has been recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines. Studies have suggested that every 10% increase in compliance is associated with a significant decrease in the odds ratio for mortality. However, the role of EGDT in the treatment of sepsis remains controversial. Different study time periods may influence the value of EGDT. Earlier trials supported EGDT for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Effect of treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone on mortality in patients with septic shock [^112b4peY]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

The Annane Trial, published by Djillali Annane and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA, focused on sepsis and septic shock. The study sought to determine the role of low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone on mortality in patients with septic shock. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved a population of 300 patients, composed of 100 females and 200 males. The inclusion criteria targeted patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. Key exclusion criteria included pregnancy, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, advanced cancer, AIDS infection, and contraindications or formal indications for corticosteroids.

- **Interventions**
- **Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone group (n = 151)**: Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours and fludrocortisone 50 mcg PO once daily for 7 days.
- **Placebo group (n = 149)**: Matching placebos for 7 days.

- **Outcomes**
- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in mortality was noted (53% vs. 63%; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95).
- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in the rate of withdrawal of vasopressor therapy within 28 days (57% vs. 40%; HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.84).
- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in adverse events was observed.

- **Conclusion**: In patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency, hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were found to be superior to placebo.

### Ramelteon exposure and survival of critically ill sepsis patients: A retrospective study from MIMIC-IV [^1176ybGt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Overall, this retrospective study, based on a large sample size, revealed an association between ramelteon exposure and 30-day and 90-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Additionally, there is limited evidence indicating that ramelteon exposure may be linked to decreased in-hospital mortality but increased length of ICU time and overall length of stay when compared with the ramelteon-unexposed group. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations of statistical methodologies and data sources in observational studies. To establish a more robust and definitive understanding, further investigation through rigorous randomized controlled trials is warranted.

### Intensive insulin therapy and pentastarch resuscitation in severe sepsis [^1148uoq6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). High credibility.

The study VISEP was published by Frank M. Brunkhorst and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the diseases sepsis and septic shock. The trial question was whether intensive insulin therapy is superior to conventional insulin therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis.

The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 537 patients (215 female, 322 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Key exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, pre-existing kidney failure requiring dialysis, intracerebral hemorrhage, severe head trauma with edema, and heart failure.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Intensive insulin therapy group (n = 247)**: Blood glucose target of 80–110 mg/dL.
	- **Conventional insulin therapy group (n = 290)**: Blood glucose target of 180–200 mg/dL.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- No significant difference in death at day 28 (24.7% vs. 26%; absolute risk difference -1.3, 95% CI -8.6 to 6).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in death at day 90 (39.7% vs. 35.4%; absolute difference 4.3%, 95% CI -3.93 to 12.53).
	- No significant difference in mean SOFA score (7.8 points vs. 7.7 points; mean difference 0.1, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.3).
	- No significant difference in acute renal failure (31.1% vs. 26.6%; absolute difference 4.5%, 95% CI -3.12 to 12.12).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- Significant differences in severe hypoglycemia (17.0% vs. 4.1%).
	- Significant differences in serious adverse events (10.9% vs. 5.2%).

The conclusion was that in adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, intensive insulin therapy showed no benefit over conventional insulin therapy in terms of mortality, but was associated with a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia and serious adverse events.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: A nationwide observational study [^112KcPtR]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

As causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis, carbapenems are commonly used as an initial treatment. To reduce indiscriminate use of carbapenems, the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens, such as piperacillin-tazobactam and fourth-generation cephalosporins, should be elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the survival effect associated with carbapenems as initial therapy for sepsis compared with these antibiotics.

- **Design**: Multicenter retrospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary hospitals in Japan.

- **Patients**: Adult patients diagnosed with sepsis from 2006 to 2019.

- **Interventions**: Administration of carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy.

- **Measurements and main results**: This study used data of adult patients with sepsis extracted from a large-scale database in Japan. Patients were divided into two groups: those receiving carbapenems and those receiving noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial treatment. In-hospital mortality was compared between the groups using a logistic regression model adjusted by an inverse probability treatment weighting using propensity scores. To evaluate heterogeneity of effects according to patient characteristics, logistic models were fitted in several subgroups. Among 7,392 patients with sepsis, 3,547 received carbapenems, and 3,845 received noncarbapenem agents. The logistic model showed no significant association between carbapenem therapy and lower mortality (adjusted OR 0.88, p = 0.108).

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: What needs to be done [^114F6J9r]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Attention to the pre-hospital phase in patients with sepsis is clearly critical. The initial link in this chain is to increase awareness of the symptoms of sepsis amongst the general public. Organizations such as the Global Sepsis Alliance and initiatives like World Sepsis Day play a crucial role in alerting the general public about the importance of seeking medical attention when they or a loved one displays the symptoms of sepsis. Pre-hospital care also plays an important role in recognizing and providing prompt care for patients with sepsis.

Approximately 50% of the patients who present to the emergency department with sepsis arrive via an Emergency Medical Service (EMS). This exposure provides an excellent opportunity to improve early recognition of sepsis and to commence an integrated system of care for these complex patients. For example, in a pilot prospective cohort study conducted in the pre-hospital setting, early identification of patients with severe sepsis by EMS providers utilizing a screening tool and a point-of-care venous lactate meter was shown to be feasible. Once identified, there is scope for interventions, such as intravenous cannulation and initiation of intravenous fluids provided pre-hospital, to influence the outcomes of patients with sepsis.

An enhanced focus on the identification of sepsis in the emergency department setting, as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, has been shown in numerous studies to be associated with improved outcomes. Identifying patients with sepsis in a bu
