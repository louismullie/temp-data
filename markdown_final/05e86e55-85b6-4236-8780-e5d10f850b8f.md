## Question

A 72-year-old woman with hypertension comes to the physician because of swelling and pain in both legs for the past year. The symptoms are worse at night and improve in the morning. Current medications include losartan and metoprolol. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 142/88 mm Hg. Examination shows normal heart sounds; there is no jugular venous distention. Her abdomen is soft and the liver edge is not palpable. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting edema and prominent superficial veins. The skin is warm and there is reddish-brown discoloration of both ankles. Laboratory studies show a normal serum creatinine and normal urinalysis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
A. Decreased lymphatic flow
B. Decreased intravascular oncotic pressure
C. Decreased arteriolar resistance
D. Increased venous valve reflux

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathophysiologic mechanism best explains chronic bilateral pitting edema with prominent superficial veins and reddish-brown ankle discoloration in a 72-year-old woman with hypertension, and to choose among decreased lymphatic flow, decreased intravascular oncotic pressure, decreased arteriolar resistance, or increased venous valve reflux. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical pattern and whether it points to venous, lymphatic, or systemic disease. Then, I should verify which bedside and laboratory features support chronic venous insufficiency versus alternatives. Next, I will review the pathophysiology of venous hypertension and its cutaneous sequelae. Finally, I will examine each option against the evidence and conclude with the most likely mechanism and why the others are less likely or incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. Chronic, bilateral, pitting edema that worsens with dependency and improves with elevation, accompanied by prominent superficial veins and reddish-brown ankle discoloration, is a classic presentation of chronic venous insufficiency with stasis dermatitis and hemosiderin deposition, which aligns with CEAP classes 3–4 and the natural history of venous disease progression [^116vqgUN] [^113EweB2] [^111xAYWC].

> Wait, let me verify the supportive bedside findings. Prominent superficial veins indicate venous reflux and dilated tributaries, while reddish-brown ankle discoloration reflects hemosiderin deposition from extravasated red cells under venous hypertension. The absence of jugular venous distention and normal heart sounds argue against decompensated heart failure as the primary driver, and normal renal function and urinalysis make nephrotic syndrome or significant hypoalbuminemia unlikely, which helps exclude systemic causes of edema in this case [^111xAYWC] [^113EweB2] [^113cEMx8].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Chronic venous insufficiency is driven by venous valve incompetence causing ambulatory venous hypertension, which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure, promotes interstitial fluid filtration, and leads to edema. Over time, red cell extravasation and iron deposition produce hyperpigmentation, and inflammatory changes manifest as stasis dermatitis, consistent with this patient's findings [^114Zp13i] [^114xiUbZ] [^113EweB2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should examine each option against the evidence. Option D, increased venous valve reflux, directly explains pitting edema, varicosities, and hemosiderin deposition via venous hypertension and is the most coherent unifying mechanism here, supported by guideline-based descriptions of reflux-driven chronic venous disease and its cutaneous sequelae [^116vqgUN] [^111xAYWC] [^114xiUbZ].

> Let me consider Option A, decreased lymphatic flow. Lymphedema typically presents with nonpitting edema and characteristic skin thickening; early lymphedema can pit, but the Stemmer sign is often positive and the edema does not fully resolve with elevation in more advanced stages, which does not match this patient's purely pitting, elevation-responsive edema without reported skin thickening or a positive Stemmer sign, making primary lymphedema less likely as the principal cause here [^112DswHr] [^112SqNPM] [^116gpPru].

> I should double-check Option B, decreased intravascular oncotic pressure. Hypoalbuminemia from nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, or protein-losing enteropathy would cause generalized edema and often other systemic features; normal serum creatinine and urinalysis in this case make significant proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome unlikely, and there are no stigmata of liver disease, so decreased oncotic pressure is not supported by the data [^113cEMx8] [^116vfBua].

> Next, I should review Option C, decreased arteriolar resistance. Systemic vasodilation with decreased arteriolar tone would tend to cause warm, flushed skin and may redistribute volume, but it does not by itself explain dependent pitting edema, varicosities, or hemosiderin deposition; moreover, there is no clinical evidence of warm, flushed extremities or a hyperdynamic state here, and this mechanism is not a recognized cause of the specific constellation of stasis changes seen in this patient [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there is a mixed venous-lymphatic component, so-called phlebolymphedema? That can occur in longstanding venous disease, yet the dominant phenotype here remains venous, with pitting edema, varicosities, and hemosiderin deposition pointing primarily to reflux rather than primary lymphatic failure. If suspected, imaging such as lymphoscintigraphy or CT features could be used, but the initial question is about the most likely underlying mechanism, which remains venous valve reflux in this presentation [^1156JSLi] [^1119JUfW] [^112DswHr].

> In summary, after verifying the clinical pattern, bedside features, and pathophysiology, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's chronic bilateral pitting edema with prominent superficial veins and reddish-brown ankle discoloration is increased venous valve reflux causing chronic venous insufficiency with stasis dermatitis and hemosiderin deposition, which best accounts for all observed findings in a coherent, reference-aligned manner [^116vqgUN] [^111xAYWC] [^113EweB2].

---

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is **increased venous valve reflux** (D), consistent with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) [^116vqgUN]. The combination of bilateral pitting edema, prominent superficial veins, and reddish-brown ankle discoloration (hemosiderin deposition) [^113EweB2] is classic for CVI, driven by venous hypertension from valve incompetence [^114Zp13i]. The symptoms worsen with dependency and improve with elevation, and the absence of heart failure or renal/hepatic disease signs further supports a venous etiology [^117RKRvY].

---

## Clinical features supporting increased venous valve reflux

- **Bilateral pitting edema**: Characteristic of venous hypertension from valve incompetence, worsening with dependency and improving with elevation [^117RKRvY].

- **Prominent superficial veins**: Reflect venous reflux and dilatation from valve failure [^112DRWeJ].

- **Reddish-brown ankle discoloration**: Hemosiderin deposition from chronic venous hypertension and extravasation of red blood cells [^114xSWvK].

- **Symptom pattern**: Worse at night, improving with morning elevation, consistent with venous insufficiency [^117RKRvY].

---

## Pathophysiology of increased venous valve reflux

In CVI, **valve incompetence** causes retrograde flow and venous hypertension, increasing capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid transudation into interstitial tissues, producing pitting edema [^114Zp13i]. Chronic venous hypertension also causes **inflammation, fibrosis, and hemosiderin deposition**, leading to skin changes and discoloration [^114arMam].

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical correlation** | **Exclusion rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A. Decreased lymphatic flow | Impaired lymphatic drainage causing lymphedema | Non-pitting edema, skin thickening, Stemmer sign | Patient has pitting edema without lymphedema features [^113EweB2] |
| B. Decreased intravascular oncotic pressure | Reduced plasma proteins (e.g. nephrotic syndrome, liver disease) | Generalized edema, hypoalbuminemia | Normal renal and hepatic function, no proteinuria [^notfound] |
| C. Decreased arteriolar resistance | Peripheral vasodilation increasing capillary hydrostatic pressure | Warm, flushed skin, bounding pulses | No signs of vasodilation or hyperdynamic circulation [^notfound] |
| D. Increased venous valve reflux | Venous valve incompetence causing reflux and hypertension | - Pitting edema <br/> - Varicosities <br/> - Hemosiderin deposition | All clinical features match CVI [^113EweB2] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Duplex ultrasonography with reflux assessment is the **diagnostic test of choice** to confirm venous reflux and guide management [^112haf2y]. Compression therapy is **first-line** to reduce edema and prevent progression, with adjuncts such as leg elevation, skin care, and exercise [^112haf2y]. If reflux is significant, consider venous ablation or sclerotherapy per guidelines [^113P7ZvC].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's presentation is best explained by **increased venous valve reflux** causing chronic venous insufficiency, accounting for the edema, varicosities, and hemosiderin deposition. This is supported by the clinical pattern, normal renal/hepatic function, and absence of lymphedema or systemic causes [^113EweB2].

## References

### Compartment syndrome in all four extremities: a rare case associated with systemic capillary leak syndrome [^111rmmPW]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

While isolated limb injuries often lead to suspicion for and treatment of compartment syndrome, multi-limb compartment syndrome induced by a systemic disease is a rare entity, in which lack of immediate diagnosis can have catastrophic consequences to the patient. We present a patient with idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) resulting in compartment syndrome in all four extremities. Treatment required bilateral hand, forearm, calf, and thigh fasciotomies. Presenting symptoms included pain in all four extremities, malaise, and confusion. Laboratory data included polycythemia, hypoalbuminemia, leukocytosis, and elevated creatinine, but not a monoclonal spike on serum electrophoresis as is common in SCLS. Thus, when faced with clinical evidence of multiple extremity compartment syndrome, the surgeon should consider systemic disorders, such as SCLS, and aggressively treat the compartment syndrome as well as the underlying disease.

### Peripheral edema: evaluation and management in primary care [^112haf2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Edema is a common clinical sign that may indicate numerous pathologies. As a sequela of imbalanced capillary hemodynamics, edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial compartment. The chronicity and laterality of the edema guide evaluation. Medications (e.g., antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones) can contribute to edema. Evaluation should begin with obtaining a basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function testing, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and a urine protein/creatinine ratio. Validated decision rules, such as the Wells and STOP-Bang (snoring, tired, observed, pressure, body mass index, age, neck size, gender) criteria, can guide decision-making regarding the possibility of venous thromboembolic disease and obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. Acute unilateral lower-extremity edema warrants immediate evaluation for deep venous thrombosis with a d-dimer test or compression ultrasonography. For patients with chronic bilateral lower-extremity edema, duplex ultrasonography with reflux can help diagnose chronic venous insufficiency. Patients with pulmonary edema or elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels should undergo echocardiography to assess for heart failure. Lymphedema is often a clinical diagnosis; lymphoscintigraphy can be performed if the diagnosis is unclear. Treatment of edema is specific to the etiology. Diuretics are effective but should be used only for systemic causes of edema. Ruscus extract and horse chestnut seed demonstrate moderate-quality evidence to improve edema from chronic venous insufficiency. Compression therapy is effective for most causes of edema.

ACC HFpEF decision pathway — evaluation of edema versus lymphedema: The first step should be to differentiate edema from lymphedema. Lymphedema is defined as the abnormal accumulation of interstitial fluid and fibroadipose tissue resulting from injury, infection, or congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system and is most commonly unilateral. A useful physical examination finding to distinguish edema from lymphedema is the Stemmer sign; a positive sign is characterized by a thickened skin fold at the base of the second toe or second finger, and the examiner's inability to lift the skin of the affected limb compared with the contralateral limb is considered to reflect fluid accumulation due to lymphedema. However, obesity may cause a false-positive Stemmer sign, and patients with a negative Stemmer sign and a high clinical suspicion for lymphedema warrant referral for lymphoscintigraphy.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: what the dermatologist should know [^114xFipW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a subtype of complex regional pain syndrome, a condition characterized by persistent post-injury extremity pain. Temperature and sweating changes, edema, mobility changes, and a variety of hair, nail, and skin sequelae have been described. Only 23 articles published since 1990 describe dermatologic changes in CRPS. Given this paucity of literature, we present a case to further elucidate cutaneous manifestations of CRPS. Our patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian woman with a 19-year history of reflex sympathetic dystrophy who has presented with several dermatologic complaints. She was first referred to the clinic due to episodic, mildly tender, clustered, non-blanching, and non-palpable petechiae on the legs bilaterally, which was histologically consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. No systemic involvement was identified and symptoms resolved with topical steroids. The patient was also noted to have severe ten toenail dystrophy without any evidence of onychomycosis based on multiple cultures and PAS staining of clipped nails. Avulsion of the great toenail was performed to provide symptomatic relief. Incidentally, the patient was found to have lower extremity and facial hypotrichosis on physical exam. Further, she required increased lidocaine administration in addition to pre and post-procedure lidocaine and prilocaine 5% emulsion cream for various office procedures, suggestive of lidocaine insensitivity. This case captures previously described cutaneous manifestations of CRPS such as vasculitis, nail dystrophy, extremity hypotrichosis, and telangiectasia, along with newly described potential manifestations about which dermatologists should be aware, including facial hypotrichosis and lidocaine insensitivity.

Iliac vein or inferior vena cava (IVC) stenting for obstructive disease — first-line appropriateness by CEAP class is as follows: In symptomatic patients with skin or subcutaneous changes, healed or active ulcers (CEAP classes 4–6) without superficial truncal reflux, first-line stenting is Appropriate. In symptomatic patients with edema due to venous disease (CEAP class 3) with or without superficial truncal reflux, first-line stenting May be appropriate, provided careful clinical judgment is exercised because of the potential for a wide range of coexisting nonvenous causes of edema. In asymptomatic patients with incidental findings by imaging or telangiectasia (CEAP class 1), first-line stenting is Never appropriate.

1 Case Presentation

An 11‐year‐old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the 6 weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low‐grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for 3 weeks, 1 year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. The patient was normotensive and intermittently febrile without consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C). On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet (Figure 1), with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema (Figure 2). An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] > 130 mm/h; C‐reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL). He had an elevated anti‐streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken (Figures 3 and 4).

### Edema… [^116vfBua]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Edema, also spelled oedema, and also known as fluid retention, swelling, dropsy and hydropsy, is the build-up of fluid in the body's tissue. Most commonly, the legs or arms are affected. Symptoms may include skin that feels tight, the area feeling heavy, and joint stiffness. Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause. Causes may include venous insufficiency, heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels, liver problems, deep vein thrombosis, infections, kwashiorkor, angioedema, certain medications, and lymphedema. It may also occur in immobile patients, or with temporary immobility such as prolonged sitting or standing, and during menstruation or pregnancy. The condition is more concerning if it starts suddenly, or pain or shortness of breath is present. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.

If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention, decreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used. Elevating the legs and support stockings may be useful for edema of the legs. Older people are more commonly affected. The word is from the Ancient Greek οἴδημα oídēma meaning 'swelling'. It can occur due to diminished venous return of blood to the heart due to congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. It can also occur in people with increased hydrostatic venous pressure or decreased oncotic venous pressure, due to obstruction of lymphatic or venous vessels draining the lower extremity. Certain drugs can cause edema of the feet.
- Pulmonary edema occurs when the pressure in blood vessels in the lung is raised because of obstruction to the removal of blood via the pulmonary veins. This is usually due to failure of the left ventricle of the heart. It can also occur in altitude sickness or on inhalation of toxic chemicals.

Pulmonary edema produces shortness of breath. Pleural effusions may occur when fluid also accumulates in the pleural cavity. It has been suggested that the edema that occurs following use of aspirin-like cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, such as ibuprofen or indomethacin, may be due to inhibition of lymph heart action.
- Foot two weeks post-surgery.
- The distal phalanx of the right finger exhibits edema due to acute paronychia.
- Severe edema in the legs and feet. Generalized A rise in hydrostatic pressure occurs in cardiac failure. A fall in osmotic pressure occurs in nephrotic syndrome and liver failure. Causes of edema that are generalized to the whole body can cause edema in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure can cause pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites and peripheral edema. Such severe systemic edema is called anasarca. In rare cases, a parvovirus B19 infection may cause generalized edemas.

Cause Heart The pumping force of the heart should help to keep a normal pressure within the blood vessels. But if the heart begins to fail the pressure changes can cause very severe water retention. In this condition water retention is mostly visible in the legs, feet and ankles, but water also collects in the lungs, where it causes a chronic cough. This condition is usually treated with diuretics; otherwise, the water retention may cause breathing problems and additional stress on the heart. Liver Cirrhosis of the liver is a common cause of edema in the legs and abdominal cavity. The venous pressure in the legs changes dramatically while standing compared to lying down. How much pressure there is depends on the person's height, in the average adult person, it is 8 mm Hg while lying down and 100 mm Hg while standing.

### Lymphedema: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations [^116gpPru]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited.

### Lower extremity changes experienced during pregnancy [^116u2idW]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The anatomic and physiologic changes occurring with pregnancy result in a variety of symptoms affecting the lower extremity. The purpose of this investigation is to provide a comprehensive look at the lower extremity changes experienced during pregnancy and correlate symptoms with underlying etiology in a literature review. In this retrospective study, 100 postpartum women were interviewed regarding the lower extremity changes experienced in pregnancy. The interview included dermatologic, vascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal portions. Results demonstrate more than 50% of women reported faster toenail growth, roughened toenail texture, increased dryness of the skin, swelling of the foot, ankle, and leg, unsteady gait, increased foot width, and hip pain. Though a majority of patients did not experience the remaining symptoms represented in the interview, all results are pertinent and deserve understanding to provide better insight and care for the pregnant woman. Therefore, a thorough literature review is presented to correlate the outcomes of the present study with previously published research.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations and statements

1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins

1.1. Classification and grading of clinical severity of chronic venous disorders

1.1.1. We recommend the use of the 2020 updated CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classification can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system should be used for clinical research.

Good Practice Statement

Rationale and evidence

The CEAP classification was designed at a consensus meeting of international experts in 1994, it was updated in 2004, and most recently in 2020. The classification is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classification reports the single highest C class, and the advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb. Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and < 3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, < 1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥ 3 mm in diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP Class C2. CVD is defined as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6. The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a). Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning, cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg or itching. The most important of these have been identified as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching. CEAP is a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring system, or an outcome measure that reflects changes over time. For a table of the updated CEAP classification please see Part I of the Guidelines.

1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.

### Longitudinal assessment of health-related quality of life and clinical outcomes with at home advanced pneumatic compression treatment of lower extremity lymphedema [^112AvJAc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Veterans with a diagnosis of primary or secondary, unilateral or bilateral, LED were eligible to participate if they were aged > 18 years, an ability to provide informed consent, and willing to participate in all aspects of the prescribed treatment protocol. The exclusion criteria were as follows: active cancer, active skin or limb infection, recent (prior 6 months) venous thromboembolism, critical limb ischemia, pulmonary edema, heart failure, poorly controlled asthma, previous use of the study APCD, pregnancy, and/or participation in a concomitant drug or device trial.

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of lower extremity LED were screened and enrolled after they completed the informed consent form. LED was classified as primary or secondary. Secondary categories included chronic venous insufficiency, trauma, surgery, cancer, cancer treatment, and/or radiation therapy. Compression garments were provided. The study participants were instructed in routine LED treatment, including the appropriate use of compression garments and proper skin care. The recorded skin changes at each visit included hyperpigmentation, discoloration, hyperkeratosis, dermatitis with eczema, ulceration with blisters, a positive Stemmer sign, squaring of toes, deep creasing at flexion points, papilloma, puffy forefeet, swelling on the dorsum of the foot, increased fat or muscle bulk, and lymphorrhea or weeping edema. Beginning in the latter half of the study, LED was staged from I to III using the International Society for Lymphology staging system. Stage 0 is latent with no swelling. Stage I is soft swelling (pitting) that resolves with elevation. Stage II is spongy swelling (pitting and nonpitting) that does not resolve with elevation; fibrosis might or might not be present. Stage III consists of static elephantiasis where pitting is absent and trophic skin changes develop; extensive fibrotic swelling, blistering, ulceration, lymphorrhea, papilloma, and/or recurrent infections could be present.

### Successful treatment of post thrombotic syndrome with sequential lumbar sympathetic block [^114Cn94b]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An underappreciated sequelae of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is the pain associated with the blood clot in the peripheral extremity. Although most frequently acute in nature, DVT occasionally presents with chronic pain in the affected limb. Furthermore, many individuals suffering from prothrombotic states often have recurring pain from DVT. Thus far there has been a paucity in the medical literature in how to treat post thrombotic pain. Post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) can cause a significant decrease in quality of life in individuals who have had a history of a DVT. Symptoms will typically include edema, pain, heaviness of the affected limb, skin changes, ulcers, varicosities, and gait abnormality. An underappreciated approach to treating PTS is the utilization of lumbar sympathetic blocks (LSB). A 68-year-old male who had a history of recurrent right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis presented with complaints of excruciating pain, discomfort, and erythema in his right lower extremity, which was negatively affecting his quality of life and prohibiting him from mobility. The patient attributed his lack of mobility secondary to the thrombotic pain. Compression boot/stocking therapy was not combating the discomfort associated with the PTS, often increasing the severity of the patient's pain. Sequential right lumbar sympathetic blocks were performed, which nearly completely resolved the patient's symptoms and improved the patient's ambulatory status and ability to perform activities of daily living. Sympathetic nerve blocks should be considered as a treatment option for patients who suffer with pain from PTS.

C3 edema — panel ratings and clinical considerations: The panelists rated interventions for treatment of leg edema due to venous disease (CEAP class 3) as may be appropriate for several scenarios in considering saphenous vein ablations and perforator, iliac, and IVC treatments. Panelists indicated that swelling may be multifactorial and can be associated with numerous coexisting nonvenous causes that would not be expected to benefit from venous interventions. In contrast, when a patient presents with varicose veins, reflux, and edema, the group thought intervention more likely to be of benefit with improved reduction of swelling, in which case the indication for treating venous reflux would be stronger. Unilateral limb swelling was also noted by panelists to be a potential predictor of a favorable response. The response of edema C3 to either ablation for isolated below-knee GSV reflux or segmental vein reflux is not supported by data and led to a rating of may be appropriate, and more research is needed to determine its usefulness for these indications. In general, for several C3 indications, a wide dispersion of ratings was observed, which may at least in part have been due to differences in how C3 was perceived.

### A case of progressive lower leg edema [^116x7tw2]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the clinical presentation and histology, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lipodermatosclerosis
B. Lymphedema
C. Stasis dermatitis
D. Kaposi sarcoma
E. Bilateral lower leg cellulitis

Answers:
A. Lipodermatosclerosis – Incorrect. Although lipodermatosclerosis is a diagnostic consideration in our patient's clinical presentation, CD31 and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) positivity indicate KS. Interestingly, there are increasing reports of KS mimicking other clinical and histologic entities including lymphangioma-like KS, pyogenic granuloma–like KS, lipodermatosclerosis–like KS, and ecchymotic KS.
B. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Our patient has woody, nonpitting edema, which is characteristic of lymphedema, but the findings of CD31 and HHV-8 positivity in the neoplastic capillaries are diagnostic of KS. Therefore, our patient's lymphedema is a complication of his KS.
C. Stasis dermatitis – Incorrect. Stasis dermatitis is an intensely pruritic, eczematous disorder related to chronic venous insufficiency. Our patient does not complain of significant pruritus, and CD31 and HHV-8 should not be positive in stasis dermatitis. Interestingly, there are several reports of KS arising in the setting of arterial, venous, or lymphatic insufficiency with associated stasis dermatitis–like changes.
D. Kaposi sarcoma – Correct. The development of a new patch on the thigh at 6-month follow-up and the histologic findings of a patchy capillary proliferation in a tiered distribution are suggestive of KS. CD31 and HHV-8 immunohistochemical stains are positive in the neoplastic capillaries, and HHV-8 also demonstrates a focally strong positivity throughout the dermis in a tiered distribution, which confirms the diagnosis of KS (Fig 3).
E. Bilateral lower leg cellulitis – Incorrect. Clinically, the patient does not have other stigmata of acute infection such as fever, pain, or malaise, and histology does not show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate to support an acute infectious process.

### Surgical management of idiopathic ulcerative calcinosis cutis in the lower extremity: a case report [^115gXDUh]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this case study is to describe the surgical treatment of idiopathic ulcerative cutaneous calcinosis or calcinosis cutis of the lower extremity. A 77-year-old Latin American female who reported no significant past medical history presented to our hospital's emergency department from her home complaining of worsening right lower extremity erythema, edema, increased temperature, and pain. It was noted that the patient presented with multiple cutaneous calcified nodules to bilateral lower extremities, which she stated has been present for approximately 40 years. At the time of evaluation, 1 of the nodules on the lateral aspect of the right lower extremity ulcerated and became infected with unknown etiology, which lead to cellulitis of this limb. Radiographic imaging studies of the bilateral lower extremities showed extensive sheetlike soft tissue calcification overlying the middle to distal lower extremities. Serology reports showed the patient was positive for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, SS-A/Ro antibody, and SS-B/La antibody. Because of the evidence of frank purulence and cellulitic changes to the infected nodule, the patient was taken to surgery the following day for sharp debridement and biopsy of the site. Postoperatively, there were minimal signs of improved healing to the wound base, although there was evidence of decreased erythema and edema to the extremity after the initial debridement and biopsy. Four days after the initial surgical invention, the patient was taken for a second operative procedure, which included a wide excisional biopsy with application of acellular dermal matrix and negative-pressure therapy. It was during this secondary debridement that further calcified deposits were encountered and specimens were submitted to pathology. Pathologic examination diagnosed the submitted specimen as cutaneous calcinosis. At this time, the patient is currently undergoing local wound care of the soft tissue deficient to her right lower extremity with the assistance of negative-pressure wound therapy with biweekly clinical follow-up.

### Gemcitabine-associated acute lipodermatosclerosislike eruption: an underrecognized phenomenon [^114arMam]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Classically, lipodermatosclerosis, or sclerosing panniculitis, occurs in the setting of venous insufficiency. The pathogenesis likely involves reduced fibrinolytic activity from venous hypertension and increased vascular permeability. In the acute phase, painful, erythematous plaques develop above the medial malleoli or other dependent sites, whereas the chronic phase manifests with sharply demarcated induration and hyperpigmentation caused by hemosiderin deposition. Lipodermatosclerosis may be distinguished from a pigmented purpuric dermatosis such as Schamberg disease, which presents with discrete, yellow-brown petechial patches, without tender plaques or sclerosis of the dermis and subcutis. Lipodermatosclerosis is diagnosed clinically, and biopsy is not routinely performed. Histologically, stasis changes with both septal and lobular panniculitis may be seen, and lipomembranous changes are found in advanced lesions.

We reviewed the literature for gemcitabine-related "pseudocellulitis", "erysipeloid", "lipodermatosclerosis", and "scleroderma", and created a table that includes the clinical features, demographics, risk factors, and treatment response of what we believe to be all previously described cases (Table I). Radiation recall events were excluded, as we believe they represent a separate category of cutaneous reactions and can be distinguished based on clinical history and physical findings.

Table I
Summary of acute lipodermatosclerosislike eruptions in the setting of gemcitabine therapy

Skin reactions involved the lower extremities in all 20 patients (100%). Seventeen (85%) of 20 patients had bilateral lower extremity involvement. Preexisting edema was reported in 10 (50%) of 20 patients. In a patient with malignant ascites but no peripheral edema, the eruption occurred on dependent areas of the abdomen, genitalia, and medial thighs. Another patient with endometrial carcinoma and iliac lymph node dissection was noted to have skin changes in the pelvis. Preexisting lymphedema is hypothesized to interfere with the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine, with accumulation of the drug and its metabolites in the interstitial fluid.

### Losartan… [^117K5mba]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Losartan, sold under the brand name Cozaar among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. It is in the angiotensin receptor blocker family of medication, and is considered protective of the kidneys. Besides hypertension, it is also used in diabetic kidney disease, heart failure, and left ventricular enlargement. It comes as a tablet that is taken by mouth. It may be used alone or in addition to other blood pressure medication. Up to six weeks may be required for the full effects to occur. Common adverse effects include muscle cramps, stuffy nose, dizziness, cough, high blood potassium, and anemia. Severe adverse effects may include angioedema, low blood pressure, and kidney problems. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding. It works by blocking angiotensin II. Losartan was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995.

It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the eighth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 56 million prescriptions. A version combined with hydrochlorothiazide is available which, in 2023, was the 65th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. Medical uses Losartan is used for hypertension, including in people with left ventricular hypertrophy, and kidney dysfunction among type II diabetics. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy. It is a suitable pharmacological agent for the reduction of kidney disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria or proteinuria.

Although evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as losartan is recommended as first-line treatment in people under the age of 55 who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. One study demonstrated losartan was superior to atenolol in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events, with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3–6 weeks of starting losartan. Adverse effects The most common adverse effects for losartan in adults are upper respiratory infections, dizziness, and back pain. People with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease may experience diarrhea, fatigue, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, elevated potassium, chest pain, or allergic reaction.

Losartan should not be taken by people who are diabetic and taking aliskiren. Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system. As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, losartan may injure the liver, although this effect appears to be rare. Electrolyte imbalances may occur in people with kidney problems who take losartan. Adverse outcomes do not differ by sex, age, or race. Pregnancy In October 2014, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning that losartan can cause fetal toxicity and should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected. Using losartan while pregnant could result in fetal injury or death. Overdose Overdosing would most likely result in decreased blood pressure, which could manifest as an increased heart rate, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, or loss of consciousness.

### Chronic exertional compartment syndrome requiring bilateral fasciotomy: an atypical complication of familial stiff skin syndrome in a father and son [^116fFwcb]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Stiff skin syndrome (SSS) is a rare cutaneous disorder characterized by cutaneous fibrosis resulting in the early onset of thickened and indurated skin, joint mobility restrictions, and contractures. We describe a father and son with familial SSS who presented with bilateral exertional pain and a confirmed diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome on 4-compartment pressure testing. Patients experienced restored functionality with bilateral 4-compartment fasciotomy. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with SSS and chronic pain of the lower limbs.

Unlabelled

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a condition that is often associated with the extremities. This chronic pain syndrome, when localized to the lower extremity, includes peripheral changes such as edema, temperature alterations, limited range of motion, loss of or excessive perspiration, pain out of proportion to any stimulus, and trophic alterations of the skin, hair, and nails. In this report, we describe the case of a patient who developed complex regional pain syndrome following an ankle injury and surgery. This case report highlights treatment options that are available to patients experiencing complex regional pain, including the use of a spinal cord stimulator.

### Computed tomography scanning in the diagnosis of lower extremity phlebolymphedema [^1119JUfW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurements

Three raters blinded to the patients' ISL stage and LSG results collected data from the CT images in the thigh (20 cm above the apex of the patella), leg (10 cm below the apex of the patella), and ankle (5 cm above the lateral malleolus). Values taken at each level included the skin thickening (present/absent), subcutaneous interstitial edema (also termed 'honeycombing': grades 0 to 2) and MC edema (grades 0 to 2). The severity of honeycombing and MC edema were subjectively assessed. Honeycombing was categorized as 0– no honeycomb pattern; 1– focal areas of honeycombing; and 2– circumferential/near circumferential areas of honeycombing. MC edema was categorized as 0– absent; 1– partial blurring of muscular compartments; and 2– no differentiation between muscular compartments/complete blurring of muscle compartments. The grading of each variable is considered in Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3. These CT variables have been previously noted to be suggestive of a diagnosis of lymphedema. Agreement from two of three raters determined values of skin thickening, honeycombing, and MC edema used for analysis. In the case of total disagreement, the three raters met, and regraded the limb to come to single value which was then used for the analysis. Skin thickening, honeycombing, and MC edema scores for each limb were determined by taking the most severe value of the three levels. Overall CT grade for analysis was determined by the median value between skin thickening, honeycombing, and MC edema. Clinical metrics evaluated included the CEAP clinical class in addition to the International Society of Lymphedema stage for each limb as well as grade of swelling (GOS). ISL grade was categorized as 0– latent or subclinical condition with no swelling evident; 1– early accumulation of fluid that subsides with elevation (pitting may occur); 2– involves changes in solid structures where limb elevation rarely reduces swelling and pitting is present; and 3– lymphostatic elephantiasis and skin changes have developed. LSG was graded into normal, mild, moderate, or severe disease for each limb based on five variables (Table I). GOS was evaluated as 0– no swelling; 1– pitting with nonobvious swelling; 2– visible ankle swelling; 3– gross swelling involving the leg up to the knee; and 4– gross swelling involving the entire leg including the thigh.

### Magnetic resonance imaging features of primary lower extremity lymphedema: a retrospective analysis of 228 patients [^1114C9Fz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Image analysis

Two senior radiologists analyzed MR characterization using coronal and transverse axial STIR sequences without knowing the clinical staging of the patient. The area of interest was the most severe region of edema, and the analysis included the following.
(1) The extent of edema involvement, evaluated in terms of longitudinal range (accumulation on one side of the knee joint and less than one-half of the limb or more than one-half of the limb) and transverse range (horizontal infiltration at < 50%, 50%-75%, or 75%-100% of the circumference).
(2) Evaluation of skin thickening in the area of interest, defined as dermal thickness of > 2 mm.
(3) Observation of edema infiltration morphology in the subcutaneous soft tissues and fascial areas of interest, using several signs such as the parallel line sign, grid sign, honeycomb sign, band sign, lymphatic lake, and crescent sign (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4). Each sign was defined as follows:

- The parallel lines were thin, 1 to 2 mm wide, and parallel to the superficial fascia, not forming a network.
- The grid signs were multiple intertwined lines, ≤ 3 mm wide, with the largest meridian parallel to the superficial fascia and a width-to-length ratio of less than 2:3.
- The honeycomb signs represented a further thickening of the grid in more than two directions, with a wall thickness of > 3 mm and a width-to-length ratio of greater than 2:3.
- The band sign is an accumulation of fluid on the fascial surface with a strip-like structure observed at the axial level.
- The crescent sign is a subfascial accumulation observed at the axial level.
- The lymphatic lake is a large, structureless area of edema located in the subcutaneous soft tissue.

Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is estimated to occur in 1 in 1000 persons annually in adult populations, with prevalence predicted to double by the year 2050. While acute DVT and pulmonary embolism are a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the long-term prognosis for patients with venous thromboembolism is in part determined by the development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which occurs in up to 50% of patients. PTS refers to a chronic syndrome complex, invariably characterized by intractable edema, pain, stasis dermatitis, and venous stasis ulceration when severe.

The differential diagnosis of lipedema includes conditions presenting with swelling or excessive adiposity of lower limbs, mainly represented by lymphedema and obesity (Table 2). In cases of more advanced edema, other classical causes (i.e. chronic venous insufficiency, idiopathic cyclic edema, edema because of cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease, miyedema, and orthostatic edema) should also be considered.

Table 2
Differential diagnosis of lipedema

In lymphedema, the skin is usually altered and thickened, while it remains relatively normal in lipedema. Nevertheless, distinguishing lipedema from lymphedema may be difficult because the two conditions may coexist in advanced stages of disease. Compared with lymphedema, digital pressure typically induces pain in patients with lipedema. Lymphoscintigraphy and green indocyanine lymphofluoroscopy may show impaired lymphatic flow in the affected extremity of patients with lipedema. Impaired lymphatic flow in affected patients is generally less severe than in patients with lymphedema, and imaging may show lymphatic dysfunction that is not yet clinically evident 77, 78. In light of these findings, imaging techniques may be considered as a useful tool when diagnosis is doubtful or for lipedema staging. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and high‐resolution cutaneous ultrasonography have been also used to differentiate lymphedema from lipedema, although these are seldom applied in the clinic 79, 80.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Blood pressure… [^116qPJm2]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Blood pressure is one of the vital signs — together with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature — that healthcare professionals use in evaluating a patient's health. Normal resting blood pressure in an adult is approximately 120 millimetres of mercury systolic over 80 millimetres of mercury diastolic, denoted as "120/80 mmHg". Most of these semi-automated methods measure blood pressure using oscillometry. Blood pressure is influenced by cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, blood volume and arterial stiffness, and varies depending on person's situation, emotional state, activity and relative health or disease state. In the short term, blood pressure is regulated by baroreceptors, which act via the brain to influence the nervous and the endocrine systems.

Blood pressure that is too low is called hypotension, pressure that is consistently too high is called hypertension, and normal pressure is called normotension. Both hypertension and hypotension have many causes and may be of sudden onset or of long duration. Long-term hypertension is a risk factor for many diseases, including stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. Long-term hypertension is more common than long-term hypotension. High blood pressure Arterial hypertension can be an indicator of other problems and may have long-term adverse effects. Sometimes it can be an acute problem, such as in a hypertensive emergency when blood pressure is more than 180/120 mmHg. Levels of arterial pressure put mechanical stress on the arterial walls. Higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth that develops within the walls of arteries.

The higher the pressure, the more stress that is present and the more atheroma tend to progress and the heart muscle tends to thicken, enlarge and become weaker over time. Persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, and arterial aneurysms, and is the leading cause of chronic kidney failure. Even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy. At severely high pressures, mean arterial pressures 50% or more above average, a person can expect to live no more than a few years unless appropriately treated. For people with high blood pressure, higher heart rate variability is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Both high systolic pressure and high pulse pressure are risk factors.

Elevated pulse pressure has been found to be a stronger independent predictor of cardiovascular events, especially in older populations, than has systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure. In some cases, it appears that a decrease in excessive diastolic pressure can actually increase risk, probably due to the increased difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. If systolic blood pressure is elevated with a normal diastolic blood pressure, it is called isolated systolic hypertension and may present a health concern. According to the 2017 American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines state that a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mmHg with a diastolic pressure of 80–89 mmHg is "stage one hypertension". For those with heart valve regurgitation, a change in its severity may be associated with a change in diastolic pressure.

### Is iPad-based three-dimensional scanning the future for evaluating lower extremity volume or edema in clinic? [^116Jy7gW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

As mentioned by the authors, objectively measuring lower extremity volumes may be beneficial, particularly for patients with venous disease, because edema is one of the most cumbersome symptoms that our patients suffer from. It is difficult to evaluate the success of treatment, particularly when the main symptom is limb swelling. Traditionally, lower extremity edema or volume has been quantified by measuring the extremity diameter at different points including the ankle, calf, and thigh and comparing those values with previous measurements. However, based on varying techniques, this approach can cause large variations, rendering the measurements inaccurate and unreliable as a way to quantify limb volumes. Specifically for venous disease the Clinical Etiological Anatomical Pathophysiological score is used, but does not really make a differentiation on the severity of edema. The revised Venous Clinical Severity score takes into consideration the severity of the edema: edema is scored as mild if it is limited to the foot and ankle, moderate if it extends above the ankle but below the knee, and severe if it extends to the knee and above. Much clinical decision-making is also based on patient perception of their symptoms. Usually, patients can tell if their edema is stable, improving, or worsening. However, no objective data can be collected based on patient report. Therefore, the authors' attempt to measure lower extremity edema objectively can be very useful in the clinic setting to correlate volume with symptoms and even gauge treatment result.

### The role of iliac vein stent placement in pelvic venous disorder management [^116t161D]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis: clinical evaluation

What follows is an approach to the clinical evaluation of the patient with suspected pelvic venous disease, beginning with a complete history and physical exam (Fig 1). A common descriptor of venous etiology pelvic pain is a dull ache that worsens with standing. The combination of postcoital ache and ovarian point tenderness (one-third of the way between the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine) on physical exam is reportedly 94% sensitive and 77% specific for venous origin pelvic pain. Of note, these symptoms are classically associated with reflux-related PeVD, and obstructive etiology PeVD may present differently. For example, patients with iliac vein obstruction may describe lower extremity dominant symptoms. The patient may report lower extremity edema, pruritus, or skin changes such as wounds. Perineal, posterior labial, and vulvar varices (V 3a) may be observed after having the patient stand for approximately 10 minutes prior to examination. Atypical extremity varicosity patterns such as sciatic and/or superficial medial/posterior thigh varices (V 3b) should raise suspicion for venous reflux transmitting through pelvic escape points.

Systematic clinical evaluation of pelvic venous disorder (PeVD). This algorithm is a simplified general approach for evaluating patients with potential PeVD. BNP, Brain natriuretic peptide; CBC, complete blood count; CHF, congestive heart failure; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome.

Due to the nonspecific nature of chronic pelvic pain, it is important to evaluate for non-venous etiologies of the patient's symptoms. The primary gynecologic differential consideration is pelvic floor myalgia. Other common gynecologic causes of pelvic pain include fibroids and adenomyosis. If a patient describes pain during intercourse, endometriosis should be considered. Unlike PeVD, endometriosis pain is cyclic and generally has a pain-free interval each month. Consider gastrointestinal etiologies if the symptoms relate to food intake, are sensitive to dietary changes, or are associated with bowel movements. Lower extremity swelling from underlying venous disease must be distinguished from lymphedema, lipedema, and medical comorbidities that can result in volume overload such as congestive heart failure. Some degree of asymmetry in lower extremity edema is highly likely to relate to venous/lymphatic disease rather than systemic disorders. A thorough medication reconciliation will also help identify common pharmacologic sources of swelling, such as calcium channel blockers.

### Acute inflammatory edema: a mimicker of cellulitis in critically ill patients [^115RaJs9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inpatient dermatology consultations for treatment-refractory or atypical cellulitis are common. In critically ill patients, differentiating cellulitis from its mimickers can be challenging.

Objective

We describe acute inflammatory edema, a likely underrecognized variant of pseudocellulitis.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of 15 patients with this diagnosis, seen by the inpatient dermatology consultation service at the University of California at San Francisco between 2009 and 2017.

Results

The cohort consisted of 9 women and 6 men with an age range of 52–73 years. Acute inflammatory edema presents as bilateral, erythematous, and edematous plaques, most commonly involving the thighs and lower abdomen, sparing areas of increased pressure on the skin. There is a predilection for patients with high body mass index and those with clinical or quantitative findings of fluid overload.

Conclusion

We propose a 3-part pathogenesis of acute inflammatory edema: 1) acute-onset volume overload 2) in patients with impaired lymphatic return 3) leads to dermal edema, microtears in connective tissue, and an influx of inflammation.

### Unilateral lower extremity swelling as a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111zuGgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity oedema is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The challenge is to correctly identify the aetiology of oedema, and hence correctly manage the cause. Oedema can be classified as venous oedema and lymphoedema. Lymphoedema of the lower extremities is usually bilateral. Unilateral leg lymphoedema may occur secondary to radiation, surgery, compression by a tumour or early filariasis infection. Unilateral lower extremity lymphoedema has been reported as a rare initial presentation for lymphoma, mostly in women, usually without B-symptoms, and often with inguinal lymphadenopathies or abdominal masses. In this paper, we report a rare case of unilateral lower extremity oedema in a healthy male presenting to the outpatient clinic following trauma; further work-up revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac veins.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^114ge5AX]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute Charcot arthropathy — clinical diagnosis relies on characteristic unilateral inflammatory changes in an insensate foot, frequent pain despite neuropathy, and awareness of ulceration that can mimic osteomyelitis. The initial diagnosis is often clinical, based on profound unilateral swelling, increased skin temperature, erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot; these characteristics in the presence of intact skin are often pathognomonic of acute neuroarthropathy. In more than 75% of cases, the patient will present with some degree of pain in an otherwise insensate extremity, and diagnosis can be complicated when patients first present with a concomitant ulceration, raising questions of potential contiguous osteomyelitis.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) — foot infection management: In patients with PAD, prompt diagnosis and treatment of foot infection are recommended to avoid amputation. Because of the consequences associated with untreated foot infection — especially in the presence of PAD — clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, and foot infection should be suspected if the patient presents with local pain or tenderness; periwound erythema; periwound edema, induration or fluctuance; pretibial edema; any discharge (especially purulent); foul odor; visible bone or a wound that probes-to-bone; or signs of a systemic inflammatory response (including temperature > 38°C or < 36°C, heart rate > 90/min, respiratory rate > 20/min or Paco2 < 32 mm Hg, white blood cell count > 12,000 or < 4,000/mcl, or > 10% immature forms).

### Edema of the face and extremities secondary to pemetrexed [^115jm6au]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case

A 54-year-old Dominican male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung was initially treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to brain metastases and 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab. He responded well without significant toxicity and began maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Four months later, a new brain metastasis was found, and he received a second treatment of SRS and 6 months of bevacizumab. Pembrolizumab and pemetrexed were continued during and after these additional treatments. Of note, the patient was given dexamethasone with all pemetrexed infusions.

Thirty-seven months after initiating pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, the patient presented to his oncologist with 1 week of non-tender edema and erythema of his right upper extremity. Ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis, and the patient was prescribed a 5-day course of cephalexin for suspected cellulitis. No improvement was noted after the antibiotics, and mild edema was appreciated in his left upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities. His malignancy was stable, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 month after first reporting symptoms showed no evidence of new metastatic disease.

Two months after edema onset, the patient was referred to the Skin Toxicities Program. He reported new pain in the upper extremities. On exam, there was significant bilateral periorbital edema, central forehead pitting edema with blanching erythema, pitting and doughy edema of the bilateral hands, forearms, and distal upper arms, peau d'orange changes on the proximal forearms, and edema with blanching erythema of bilateral feet and lower legs (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3).

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema of the lower leg: an international cross-sectional study [^114L1eia]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and chronic oedema are common conditions with considerable morbidity. The number of studies designed to assess the epidemiology of cellulitis in chronic oedema is scarce.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of cellulitis in chronic leg oedema, including lymphoedema.

Methods

A cross-sectional study included 40 sites in nine countries during 2014–17. Adults with clinically proven unilateral or bilateral chronic oedema (oedema > 3 months) of the lower leg were included. The main outcome measures were frequency and risk factors for cellulitis within the last 12 months.

Results

Out of 7477 patients, 15.78% had cellulitis within the last 12 months, with a lifetime prevalence of 37.47%. The following risk factors for cellulitis were identified by multivariable analysis: wounds [odds ratio (OR) 2.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.03–2.78], morbid obesity (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.27–1.80), obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.41), midline swelling (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04–1.66), male sex (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15–1.52) and diabetes (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.49). Controlled swelling was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51–0.67). In a subgroup analysis, the risk increased with the stage of oedema [International Society of Lymphology, stage II OR 2.04 (95% CI 1.23–3.38) and stage III OR 4.88 (95% CI 2.77–8.56)].

Conclusions

Cellulitis in chronic leg oedema is a global problem. Several risk factors for cellulitis were identified, of which some are potentially preventable. Our findings suggest that oedema control is one of these. We also identified that advanced stages of oedema, with hard/fibrotic tissue, might be an important clinical indicator to identify patients at particular risk.

### Venous thrombosis… [^114AeJoa]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The initial treatment for VTE is typically either low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, or increasingly with direct acting oral anticoagulants. Those initially treated with heparins can be switched to other anticoagulants, although pregnant women and some people with cancer receive ongoing heparin treatment. Superficial venous thrombosis or phlebitis affects the superficial veins of the upper or lower extremity and only require anticoagulation in specific situations, and may be treated with anti-inflammatory pain relief only.
- Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Trauma and minor leg injury
- Previous VTE
- Oral contraceptives
- Hormonal replacement therapy, esp. oral
- Central venous catheters
- Inflammatory diseases/some autoimmune diseases
- Nephrotic syndrome

- Myeloproliferative neoplasms including essential thrombocytosis and polycythemia vera
- Chemotherapy
- Heart failure.

Diagnosis A provider uses multiple tools for the diagnosis of thromboembolism. They take a detailed medical history, assess the patient's symptoms and inspect the area of concern. Diagnostic testing tools include a blood test called a D-dimer. Elevated D-dimer levels can indicate a clot presence. This test is useful for ruling out a thromboembolism when other clinical indications are low. The standard upper limits of the test are 500 ng/ml, but there are guidelines to adjust based on the age of the patient. If clinical indications are high for acute thromboembolism, D-dimer testing should be bypassed and the provider should proceed with imaging. Prevention Numerous medications have been shown to reduce the risk of a person having a VTE; however, careful decision making is required in order to decide if a person's risk of having a VTE outweighs the risks associated with most thromboprophylaxis treatment approaches.

It is recommended that people should be assessed at their hospital discharge for persistent high-risk of venous thrombosis and that people who adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle might lower their risk of venous thrombosis. Surgery Evidence supports the use of heparin in people following surgery who have a high risk of thrombosis to reduce the risk of DVTs; however, the effect on PEs or overall mortality is not known. In hospitalized non-surgical patients, mortality does not appear to change. It does not appear, however, to decrease the rate of symptomatic DVTs. Using both heparin and compression stockings appears better than either one alone in reducing the rate of DVT.
- that hospitalized patients be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis;
- that heparin or a related drug is used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms;
- and that graduated compression stockings not be used.

In adults who have had their lower leg casted, braced, or otherwise immobilized for more than a week, LMWH may decrease the risk and severity of deep vein thrombosis, but does not have any effect on the incidence of pulmonary embolism. Prior VTE Following the completion of warfarin in those with prior VTE, the use of long-term aspirin has been shown to be beneficial. For people who are having surgery for cancer, it is recommended that they receive anticoagulation therapy in order to prevent a VTE. LMWH is recommended for at least 7–10 days following cancer surgery, and for one month following surgery for people who have a high risk of VTEs. Specifically for patients with various types of lymphoma, there is a risk assessment model, ThroLy, to help providers determine how likely a thromboembolic event is to occur. Anticoagulation If diagnostic testing cannot be performed swiftly, many are commenced on empirical treatment.

Patient 2

A 79-year-old woman with a history of adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head with liver metastases presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and pain. Her initial treatment regimen included nivolumab, gemcitabine, and abraxane; however, nivolumab was discontinued secondary to severe infusion hypersensitivity reaction. Two weeks after receiving her second dose of gemcitabine and Abraxane, she had 2+ edema, tenderness, and mild erythema of the bilateral lower extremities (Fig 2). The patient was admitted for presumed cellulitis, and, after no improvement with empiric sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, she was referred to the Yale Onco-Dermatology Clinic. The leading diagnosis was changed to gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption, and the patient was treated with compression therapy, high-potency topical steroids twice daily, discontinuation of antibiotics, and resumption of gemcitabine. Follow-up 1 week later found resolution of the erythema and tenderness, with mild residual edema. She was encouraged to use compression socks daily for maintenance therapy and leg elevation as often as possible.

### Complex regional pain syndrome or limb pain: a plea for a critical approach [^1178E4oy]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A Clinical Examination is Mandatory for CRPS

In particular, with red flags, a comprehensive clinical examination must be performed. The first steps are inspection and palpation. For instance, a skin lesion as an entrance for an infection could be found by inspection. If the "refractory" CRPS patient presents with an overprotected arm fixed to the body but without muscle wasting or contractures and with rough palms indicating physical work, there might be a mismatch between reported symptoms and objective findings. Objective typical CRPS findings are skin color changes, temperature difference, sweating, edema and reduced range of motion. However, those signs alone cannot differentiate between CRPS and localized inflammation like infection or arthritis. It is the distal limb generalization, which characterizes CRPS (see Figure 3 for illustration of non-CRPS where fingers are not affected).

Figure 3
Example of a toxic-induced skin ulcer. This painful extremity is red, swollen and has extensive hair growth, and the proximal skin was dry. The CRPS criteria 1–3 would be fulfilled but notice that the distal fingers have normal color and are without edema. The lack of a distal generalization of the symptoms speaks against CRPS. The obvious etiology in this case is a skin ulcer which developed after erroneous subcutaneous infusion of mitoxantrone and was finally cured with skin transplantation. In less obvious cases, when the phenomenon of distal generalization is ignored, such a constellation of symptoms could lead to a false CRPS diagnosis.

Sweating might be of particular interest. A local trauma does not induce hyperhidrosis, a peripheral nerve lesion causes sweat loss within the innervation territory, while sympathetic chain lesion causes sweat loss in the respective quadrants of the body. This means that hyperhidrosis might be relatively specific for CRPS while hypohidrosis is unspecific. Affected distal and proximal joints and trigger points in muscles of the affected limb (possibly involved in guarding mechanisms) should be manually investigated. A generalized joint affection in connective tissue disease should be recorded. The peripheral arterial pulses should be palpated and the capillary responses have to be noticed in some cases. Signs of deep venous thrombosis with pain in the lower leg should be looked for particularly after immobilization or after travelling a long distance.

Thereafter, patients should be exposed to a full neurological examination looking for upper and lower motor neuron signs and sensory symptoms including the spatial distribution of sensory loss or gain.

### Cutaneous dermatomycosis with concurrentandin a patient with longstanding diabetes [^1124Gii2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 68-year-old woman with longstanding type 2 diabetes, diabetic polyneuropathy, and lower-leg edema presented with a 10-month history of painful, pruritic sores on the bilateral lower extremities. These initially arose as hyperkeratotic papules and nodules on the bilateral shins. Subsequent lesions developed over the calves and became ulcerated. The patient was otherwise healthy, without fever, cough, or lymphadenopathy.

The patient initially presented to an outside clinic where the lesions were thought to reflect eczematous changes with bacterial superinfection. Therapies included topical triamcinolone, topical compounded mupirocin/clindamycin/ivermectin/gentamicin, oral ciprofloxacin, and a 7-day course of oral fluconazole 150 mg, with minimal improvement. A computed tomography angiogram and duplex ultrasound with Doppler were unremarkable. A biopsy revealed stasis dermatitis and extensive fungal hyphae, but long-term systemic antifungal therapy was not initiated prior to presentation at our clinic.

The patient lives in middle Tennessee with her spouse and their cat, and is an avid gardener who tends to rosebushes. She frequently wears capri pants when gardening. The patient has never used tobacco or illicit substances, rarely drinks alcohol, and denies any recent travel. The patient's medications include dulaglutide, omeprazole, pain medications, and vitamin supplements; the patient does not take immunosuppressive medications. Further, she elevates her legs nightly with ice therapy for symptomatic relief of diabetic neuropathy.

Physical exam of the lower legs showed vegetative and hyperkeratotic papules and plaques with a size of up to 10 cm in diameter, some with central ulceration, on a background of erythema and stasis changes (Fig 1, A to C). The plaques were non-tender and cool to touch. No nail or additional skin changes were observed.

Case presentation

A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital in December 2008 with a fever, cough, right-sided chest pain, and swelling of both lower extremities. The patient stated that he had schistosomiasis 20 years previously, which resolved after administration of medication. His medical and family histories were otherwise unremarkable. The patient denied recent dental work and was on no medications at that time. On admission, his body temperature was 38°C and pulse was 105 bpm. Abnormal physical findings included bibasal lung crackles and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. He had normal heart sounds without a murmur. There were no dermatologic manifestations, nasopharyngeal abnormalities, or inflamed joints. Initial laboratory test results revealed a urine sediment protein of 1+ without blood cells or casts. His hemoglobin was 8.3 mg/dL. His biochemistry profile revealed a normal serum creatinine level and an albumin level of 3.1 mg/dL. Chest X-ray revealed right lower lobe pneumonia with minimal pleural effusion on both sides. He was thus diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusion. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was started immediately, after which the patient improved significantly and was discharged. However, the patient returned to our hospital 1 year later with intermittent bilateral lower extremity edema and skin rashes.

### Valvar bypass surgery to ameliorate persistent lower limb edema caused by post-thrombotic syndrome: a case report and literature review [^112oCNfk]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CVI pathophysiology is represented by events that occur within larger superficial and deep veins and events that subsequently occur in the microcirculation and surrounding skin tissue. PTS is a set of CVI symptoms and signs caused by impaired venous outflow due to deep venous obstruction and/or reflux following a DVT. Typical signs are pain with calf compression, varicose veins, edema, and skin color change, like Venous Leg Ulcers (VLUs). This syndrome occurs in 20–50% of DVT patients, maybe more, of whom 5–10% develop severe PTS, such as VLU. Our patient had CVI symptoms before DVT. Therefore, we considered that CVI disease before DVT was one of the DVT causes on the patient's right side. Three years after right lower extremity DVT, the patient had obvious lower limb edema, heaviness, pain, varicose veins, and pigmentation before surgery, which was completely consistent with a PTS diagnosis. The Villalta scale was 15 points before surgery which indicated severe PTS.

In patients with PTS, conservative treatment is the first option and consists of supervised exercise training, compression treatment (usually with elastic compression stockings), and pharmacotherapy, including venoactive drugs (e.g. horse chestnut extract). The patient had tried all conservative treatment in the previous 2 years, with no positive outcomes, thus life and work were seriously affected. Therefore, urgent effective treatments were required.

Surgically treating deep vein incompetence (DVI) is required if patients without outflow obstruction or previously corrected outflow obstruction, and conservative DVI lower limb management has failed, and also severe chronic venous disease (CVD) symptoms and signs persist. Only selected patients with axial reflux at thigh level, across the popliteal vein, and into calf veins are considered for intervention with endovenous or surgical techniques. An ultrasound examination of our patient showed that the thrombus had disappeared completely. An angiography also showed that the right femoral vein flowed back to the distal part of the calf veins, consistent with surgical intervention indications.

Case report

A 51-year-old Taiwanese male smoker with dyslipidemia presented with 2 weeks of painful ulcers and cyanosis of the distal lower extremities associated with 7 months of pruritic papulosquamous eruptions of the trunk and extremities refractory to doxycycline, terbinafine, topical and intralesional triamcinolone, ivermectin, and low-dose prednisone. One month before presentation, he experienced hand and foot numbness and progression of rash on the lower extremities with hyperkeratosis, scale, and erythema. Home medications were atorvastatin and as-needed oxycodone and acetaminophen, with no recent changes; past medical history and review of systems were otherwise unremarkable.

Physical examination was notable for retiform purpura and edema of the bilateral lower extremities, with ulcerations on a background of livedo and cyanosis. The trunk and extremities had firm, erythematous, hyperpigmented, dome-shaped, excoriated papules and nodules (Fig 1). Right dorsalis pedis pulse was undetectable on Doppler studies. The patient was admitted for ambulation-limiting pain, Doppler studies suggesting complete vascular occlusion, and prominent eosinophilia.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^111xBork]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Pain amplification syndromes

Many pediatric patients with severe chronic musculoskeletal pain do not have an identified cause. The cause of amplified musculoskeletal pain is unknown, but minor trauma, underlying chronic illnesses and psychological distress have been associated. This condition has been called many terms including reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), reflex neurovascular dystrophy (RND), complex regional pain syndrome, and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome with or without autonomic dysfunction. Typically, an affected child sustains minor trauma to the lower extremity which results in pain out of proportion to the injury.

On physical examination, patients may be unwilling to weight bear, manifest allodynia (pain generated by normally non-painful stimuli), and autonomic changes such as excessive perspiration, edema, cyanosis, mottling, and coolness of the skin. General and neurovascular exam are normal.

Diagnostic studies are typically not helpful. X-rays may show osteopenia but only in chronic cases with significant disability. MRI can show regional bone marrow edema, and a technetium bone scan may show decreased uptake.

Tumors

Benign and malignant tumors are rare causes of knee pain. Symptomatic benign bone lesions include osteochondroma, nonossifying fibroma with stress fracture, osteoid osteoma and chondroblastoma. Malignant bone tumors, include local osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma, leukemia or metastases from neuroblastoma. Benign synovial tumors include pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and hemangioma. Malignant synovial tumors include sarcomas.

### PRACTICE GUIDELINES chronic deep venous obstruction [^113yEE7o]. AVLS (2024). High credibility.

Non-thrombotic and post-thrombotic venous obstruction — clinical manifestations of femoroiliocaval veins (FICV) obstruction: Obstructions of the femoroiliocaval veins (FICV) cause chronic venous hypertension and high venous pressures in the tissues peripheral to the site of obstruction, which can result in inflammatory changes that can be a major cause of physical disability and chronic pain. The common clinical manifestations of chronic venous hypertension include pain in the lower extremities (LE), vulva, pelvis, or low back at rest, with standing or walking, and occasionally pain with intercourse. Lower extremity edema and/or lymphedema secondary to venous obstruction and venous hypertension may reduce physical activity due to the heaviness or stiffness of the lower extremities. In addition, FICV obstruction predisposes patients to recurring cellulitis of the lower extremity, and long-standing venous hypertension can lead to inflammatory skin changes including stasis dermatitis, which may progress to venous leg ulceration (VLU).

### Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated localized extremity edema and erythema [^116wQ7EU]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Our cases exhibit the variability in disease course of localized extremity edema and erythema in the setting of BTK inhibitor therapy. Both cases began with a well-demarcated, irregularly bordered, erythematous-violaceous plaque that presented proximally and progressed distally, but only one case progressed to debilitating edema that persisted despite discontinuation of therapy. Overall, this presentation is quite distinct from typical peripheral edema. Although early findings were clinically suggestive of an inflammatory etiology such as a pigmented purpuric dermatosis, or less likely angiosarcoma, later findings in case 1 were more suggestive of eosinophilic cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis. As histopathology showed no evidence of inflammation or neoplastic cells, imaging was done to evaluate for thrombosis or obstruction that could produce this irregular edema with duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Although age may have contributed to their risk of venous insufficiency, they had no clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal insufficiency or hypoalbuminemia and their clinical presentation was not typical of standard peripheral edema. Awareness of the initial disease presentation, which is clinically suggestive of an inflammatory dermatosis, will allow early initiation of compression therapy, and potentially improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in these patients. Further research into the pathogenesis of this adverse effect is necessary to improve treatment options for these patients.

### Gemcitabine-associated acute lipodermatosclerosislike eruption: an underrecognized phenomenon [^114qsZHp]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analogue that blocks progression of cells through the G1/S phase. It is active against many solid organ malignancies including breast, ovarian, non–small cell lung, transitional cell bladder, pancreatic, and biliary tract cancers, as well as various sarcomas and hematologic malignancies. Like other chemotherapeutics, it may be associated with alopecia, mucositis, and cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. It is also important to be familiar with the less common cutaneous adverse effects.

Gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption is likely an underrecognized condition that is often mistakenly treated as cellulitis. The differential diagnosis includes infectious cellulitis, drug hypersensitivity, toxic erythema of chemotherapy, and other panniculitides such as erythema nodosum. It commonly presents with a sudden onset of erythematous and tender plaques of the lower extremities (often bilateral). In addition, patients usually have lower extremity edema and slight induration of the involved sites. Unlike cellulitis, fever and leukocytosis are usually absent; however, gemcitabine may cause a drug-induced fever and myelosuppression, which can complicate the diagnosis. Historically, the term pseudocellulitis has been used to describe reactions to gemcitabine that presented as radiation recall, erysipeloid eruptions, sclerodermalike changes, and ALDS; however, for cases such as ours, we encourage the diagnosis ALDS-like eruption to more accurately depict the etiology and clinical findings, while guiding the appropriate management. In addition, unlike cutaneous sclerosis, which may warrant discontinuation of therapy, patients with ALDS-like eruption can generally continue treatment without dose adjustment.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^115Gat1N]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BLEIL was first described in 2015 among military basic trainees after prolonged periods of standing or marching. The physical exertion, well beyond accustomed levels, resulted in decompensated strain on the venous and lymphatic systems. Clinically, the condition resembles cellulitis of bilateral lower legs, ankles, and feet, showing a rapid onset of diffuse tenderness, erythema, warmth, and edema. The pathophysiology results from prolonged venous congestion from the upright position, leading to interstitial edema, leakage of proteins and cytokines into the interstitial space, overload of the lymphatic system, and a subsequent inflammatory leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Endurance running has been shown to induce strain and subsequent adaptations on the vascular and lymphatic systems. A recent study compared venous and lymphatic system characteristics in habitual long-distance runners 5 days after running a marathon with those of sedentary controls. The marathoners demonstrated increased capillary and venous flow capacity at rest and greater increase in venous and lymphatic flow after exercise (via Doppler and plethysmography studies).

On initial evaluation, the differential diagnosis often includes contact dermatitis, cellulitis, and rhabdomyolysis. The bilateral symmetric distribution, diffuse erythema and prominent edema, lack of fever, and normal or mildly elevated CK levels are important clues to the diagnosis of BLEIL. Exercise-induced vasculitis (EIV), also known as "Golfer's vasculitis" or "Disney rash", can also present with erythema and edema of the lower legs after prolonged activity. However, BLEIL and EIV differ in a few key ways. First, EIV presents with very distinct purpuric lesions interspersed among patchy erythema and mild edema, typically sparing the skin covered by clothing, such as socks. In contrast, BLEIL presents with bilateral diffuse and confluent erythema and a more significant and painful pitting edema of the lower extremities and lacks any purpuric or petechial lesions. Also, EIV (but apparently not BLEIL) is associated with exertion in hot weather. Additionally, there are histologic differences. Biopsy specimens of patients with EIV reveal a classic leukocytoclastic vasculitis, with predominance of neutrophils and karryorhectic debris around the small venules of the superficial dermis, which correspond to the palpable purpuric lesions described clinically. Conversely, biopsy specimens of BLEIL reveal a mixed perivascular and perieccrine infiltrate concentrated in the deep reticular dermis.

### Acute inflammatory edema in the setting of bilateral lung transplantation [^114xSWvK]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

AIE is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Typical findings include erythematous and edematous plaques localized to fluid-dependent areas, such as the lower abdomen and proximal lower extremities. In all 15 patients reported by Marchionne et al, the bilateral thighs were involved, similar to what was observed in this patient. Classic sparing of areas of pressure such as sites of contact with external objects and the inguinal folds is typically seen in patients with AIE. Elevation of inflammatory markers and leukocytosis are variably present, reflecting an underlying inflammatory rather than infectious process. Skin biopsy may prove helpful in distinguishing AIE from cellulitis and other infectious dermatoses for which antimicrobials would be indicated, especially since this condition is found to be associated withpatients who are critically ill.

AIE is clinically differentiated from cellulitis, which is usually unilateral, by its bilateral distribution that spares areas of pressure. On histopathology, cellulitis demonstrates neutrophilic infiltration, capillary dilatation, and bacterial invasion of tissue. Another finding that that differentiates AIE from cellulitis is the abnormal dilation of lymphatic channels.LDS and stasis dermatitis can share a common distribution with AIE. These conditions can present on the thighs and pannus but typically manifest on the distal lower extremities and fail to spare skin folds. Additionally, the course of LDS and stasis dermatitis is usually chronic rather than acute, as seen in AIE. Histopathology of AIE typically shows findings of papillary and upper reticular dermal edema. An inflammatory infiltrate composed of scattered neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes may be present. LDS demonstrates a lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis, lipomembranous change, and septal fibrosis. In stasis dermatitis, there are an increased number of thickened capillaries, red blood cell extravasation, and siderophages.

Management of AIE involves a supportive approach centered around optimization of volume status. Fluid restriction, diuresis, frequent repositioning, and increased mobility are the mainstays of therapy. AIE may be misdiagnosed as cellulitis in patients who are critically ill, underscoring the importance of early dermatology consultation in improving patient outcomes and excluding clinical mimickers.

### An unusual presentation of stewart-treves syndrome on the lower extremity [^114WAcpD]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A 94-year-old African-American woman was admitted for cellulitis of the right lower extremity and a 3-month history of painful and bleeding cutaneous lesions in the same area. The lesions developed rapidly and spread proximally. There was no history of trauma, malignancy, pelvic surgery, long-standing infection, or thrombosis of the lower extremities. The patient's chronic bilateral lower extremity lymphedema appeared at age 34, shortly after the birth of her son, but she denied any significant birth trauma. She also denied a family history of lymphedema. Significant medical history included diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and chronic venous stasis with ulcerations.

Physical examination found an ulcerated plaque with jagged borders, studded with multiple firm black nodules above the right medial malleolus. Smaller skin-colored to black nodules and a few bullae were dispersed around the lesion and extended up the proximal right lower leg (Fig 1). Diffuse nonpitting edema and hyperpigmented macules and patches were present on the bilateral lower extremities. No popliteal or inguinal lymphadenopathies were noted. Our differential diagnosis included acroangiodermatitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and angiosarcoma.

Two punch biopsies were performed at the edge of the tumor, which found an inflamed scale/crust with underlying epidermal hyperplasia and prominent ectasia of the superficial vasculature. In the mid to deep reticular dermis there were poorly formed vessels lined by pleomorphic and hyperchromatic endothelial cells (Figs 2 and 3). Occasional mitotic figures were noted and the vessels dissected between the dermal collagen bundles. The atypical endothelial cells were positive for CD31 and negative with pan cytokeratin stains. Based on the clinical and pathologic findings, a diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma was made, which had arisen within an area of chronic lymphedema of the lower extremity.

Further workup included computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which were unremarkable. The patient declined surgical intervention and chemotherapy because of her age and medical comorbities. She did receive palliative radiation treatments.

### Neurovascular, muscle, and skin changes on [18F] FDG PET / MRI in complex regional pain syndrome of the foot: a prospective clinical study [^114uEzMm]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our imaging findings may facilitate specific subtyping or staging of CRPS. All abnormal PET uptake was locally confined except the case of Patient 3 presenting the global uptake on multiple neurovascular bundles (Figure 3B). This likely supports the reported heterogeneity in the disease mechanism of CRPS, which could impart differing management approaches. High [18 F]FDG uptake on the edematous skin and subcutaneous tissue (Figure 4) is another feature that could be unique to a specific subtype or stage of CRPS. Hypermetabolic edema as shown in Figure 4 may also indicate a possibility to identify an inflammatory subtype of CRPS because edema is supposedly composed of body fluid, lacking the cellular components for increased metabolism. However, this may need further validation because the elevated uptake of [18 F]FDG can be also related to extravasated blood pool or increased volume of inflammation/infection. It should be also noted that three cases of CRPS type I showed abnormal [18 F]FDG uptake on peripheral nerves, while the only case of CRPS type II presented both PET and MRI abnormalities at the suspected nerve. This suggests that our method may provide the increased sensitivity to the causative nerve damage for the improved distinction between CRPS type I and II.

Our study has a few limitations. First, the number of enrolled patients and healthy controls was insufficient to conduct an age-sex matched comparison or group our heterogenous findings and associate them with specific aspects of CRPS. Our validation of the detected abnormalities regarding their potential contribution to pain is supported by their location, radiologic review and statistical comparison. However, a more direct evaluation of their association with pain, such as the outcome assessment of local anesthetic injection to detected abnormalities, would be desirable. Rescanning of the patient after treatments to associate the change of the abnormal uptake with the pain assessment could be another option. There may be a chance that factors other than inflammation, such as increased muscle recruitment from limping, could result in increased muscular uptake of [18 F]FDG in the favored limb. It is also possible that the asymptomatic contralateral limb may have nonspecific increase of [18 F]FDG uptake due to limping, compensatory movements, and overuse. Therefore, additional diagnostic information, potentially through developments of novel MRI techniques in our case, might be necessary to improve the specificity.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^117TPNBA]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A clinical diagnosis of BLEIL was made. HyperCKemia versus possible mild exertional rhabdomyolysis was considered, although this was unlikely to be the cause of his profuse subcutaneous edema and erythema. His mild proteinuria was considered benign and due to the extreme exertion. He was released to home with instructions to compress and elevate the legs for 72 hours. He was instructed to perform ankle pumps and calf raises to increase lymphatic drainage.

The following day (day 4 after the race), serum CK level was 1964 U/L. The patient followed up in the clinic on day 9 after the race. He experienced significant improvement of symptoms but continued to experience mild pain and swelling (right > left). He was now ambulating, although still with slightly antalgic gait. Examination revealed persistent but markedly improved erythema and edema of bilateral legs and improved strength at the ankles. At the 1-month follow-up, symptoms and examination findings had resolved, and CK and urinalysis had normalized. He was then cleared to resume light conditioning, progressing gradually as tolerated, with follow-up as needed.

### Oedema: a rare complication of plasma donation in an adolescent female [^117PCkiD]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Plasma donation has been widely used to recover medically vital components, such as immunoglobulins and clotting factors. Although generally well tolerated, there have been reports in the medical literature of reactions following blood and plasma donation. We present the first case, to our knowledge, of lower extremity oedema as the only complication noted following plasma donation in an adolescent female without underlying risk factors. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable with the exception of decreased total serum protein. Symptoms resolved with conservative management and avoidance of plasma donation. Our case highlights the importance of screening for all sources of income in adolescents to assess for health disparities, evaluate risk factors and provide appropriate guidance.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^112SQW9H]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old male ultramarathoner presented with severe swelling, redness, and pain in bilateral lower extremities. Symptoms began a few hours after finishing a 100-mile trail-running race in eastern Texas. The race occurred in February, with ambient temperatures ranging from 44 to 76 °F. The swelling progressively worsened, and he presented to the clinic approximately 3 days after finishing. He reported having run almost continuously for > 30 hours but denied any specific injury. He denied any changes in urine color, fever, severe/focal pain, or numbness/tingling. He reported running 3 prior races of 100+ miles but denied any history of similar symptoms. His medical and surgical histories were unremarkable.

The patient arrived in a wheelchair but transitioned to the examination table unassisted. His vital signs were normal, and he was in no distress. Upon inspection, prominent 4+ pitting edemas and moderate diffuse erythema and warmth were noted from the knees to the toes bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no purpura. The knees, ankles, and feet were nontender, and there was only mild tenderness to palpation of the lower leg muscular compartments. There was mild pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Strength testing revealed mild weakness (4+/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Neurovascular examination was unremarkable.

Fig 1
Photographs taken of the patient's legs on day 5 after completion of the 100-mile ultramarathon race. Mild confluent erythema and pitting edema, with lack of petechiae or purpura.

Initial laboratory testing revealed a serum creatine kinase (CK) level of 5800 U/L and urinalysis positive for protein (30 mg/dL). Urine was negative for hemoglobin, and only rare red blood cells were present in sediment. A basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were completely normal.

Bilateral tibia/fibula x-rays were normal. Ultrasound of the lower legs showed widespread thickening of the subdermal adipose layer with prominent streaky anechoic signal interspersed among the hypoechoic fat lobules bilaterally and mild anechoic tenosynovial effusion of the anterior, medial, and lateral ankle tendons. Muscles in all 4 compartments demonstrated normal architecture throughout.

### Exercise in clinical reasoning: getting a foothold on lower extremity weakness [^1113rm9V]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The elevated white blood cell count, CRP, and ESR point toward a systemic inflammatory response. Prior to admission, the patient was prescribed prednisone, which could explain the rise in white blood cells secondary to neutrophil demargination. Certain leukemias and lymphomas are possibilities, but one would expect B-type symptoms and abnormal cells on the differential.

Occam's razor and Hickam's dictum can be helpful clinical reasoning tools to explore. Does the patient have a unifying diagnosis or multiple concurrent diseases? The evaluation thus far has identified numerous findings that are abnormal. Revisiting the patient's initial problem representation with new data can aid in identifying the proper evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Initial representation: "An 88-year-old man with hypertension presented to the emergency room with six weeks of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness".

Updated representation: "An elderly man with a history of uncontrolled hypertension presents with subacute, progressive motor weakness of the lower extremities, worsening pitting edema, hematuria, and acute kidney injury with labs concerning for a systemic inflammatory syndrome".

Although a biopsy of the muscle would likely be helpful obtaining a diagnosis, the results would not return in time to help with management of the disease process that appears to be rapidly progressing. The patient now has worsening edema, acute kidney injury, and hematuria which raises the concern for glomerulonephritis.

Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a disease process that involves the abrupt onset of hematuria, acute renal failure, and fluid retention (edema and hypertension). Proteinuria and pyuria can also occur. Given the patient's rapid decline in renal function, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) should be considered. This rare disorder can occur as a primary disorder or be associated with other primary glomerular diseases. RPGN can also be associated with vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Pemetrexed-induced pseudocellulitis reaction with eosinophilic infiltrate on skin biopsy [^112hUuRd]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema with painful erythema is an increasingly recognized but poorly understood cutaneous adverse reaction to the antifolate agent pemetrexed. It is frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis, and when it occurs, it is often dose-limiting. The authors report the case of a patient with preexisting lower extremity edema who developed extensive painful, bilateral erythema 5 days after administration of pemetrexed. An eosinophil-rich dermal inflammatory infiltrate was noted histologically. The authors review previously reported cases of pemetrexed-induced pseudocellulitis and discuss possible pathophysiology.

### The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural history of chronic venous disease [^114Zp13i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic venous disease includes a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from varicose veins through chronic lower extremity pain and edema to venous skin changes and ulceration. Such manifestations may result from primary venous insufficiency or be secondary to other disorders, primarily acute deep venous thrombosis. Regardless of etiology, chronic venous disease has significant socioeconomic consequences and is among the most common problems encountered in surgical practice. Ambulatory venous hypertension underlies most of the sequelae of chronic venous disease, although such hemodynamic derangements may result from either valvular incompetence or venous obstruction. Unfortunately, the factors responsible for the progression of disease from mild to severe manifestations are only beginning to be understood. However, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of chronic venous disease is essential in its management.

### Edema: diagnosis and management [^113EweB2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^117RKRvY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluation — venous leg ulcers (Guideline 3.1) We recommend that for all patients with suspected leg ulcers fitting the definition of venous leg ulcer, clinical evaluation for evidence of chronic venous disease be performed. Clinical evaluation should differentiate primary, secondary, or congenital venous problems and establish presence or absence of venous reflux, obstruction, or both. A thorough medical history should be performed to identify symptoms potentially related to venous disease, including extremity pain, burning, aching, throbbing, cramps, heaviness, itching, tiredness, fatigue, and restless legs. Venous symptoms are usually exacerbated by limb dependency and relieved by rest or elevation. Medical history should also include risk factor assessment for venous disease, including age, body mass index, prior venous thromboembolism, family history of venous thromboembolism, family history of varicose veins, episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis, spontaneous venous rupture, prior use of compression therapy, prior venous operative interventions, use of venotonic medications, presence of other systemic diseases associated with leg wounds, and other possible associated medical factors that may contribute to nonhealing leg wounds. Physical examination for signs of venous disease should include inspection for telangiectasia, varicose veins, edema, chronic venous skin changes (skin discoloration, inflammation, eczema, hyperpigmentation, malleolar flare, corona phlebectatica, atrophie blanche, lipodermatosclerosis), healed ulcer, and active ulcer; palpation for varicosity; palpable venous cord, tenderness, induration, edema, and pulses; auscultation for bruit and reflux; and evaluation of ankle mobility.

### Hypertension… [^115XQ3mL]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Blood pressure is classified by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures. For most adults, normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140 millimeters mercury systolic and 60–90 mmHg diastolic. For most adults, high blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/80 or 140/90 mmHg. Different numbers apply to children. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office-based blood pressure measurement. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy. The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 130/80 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit and others finding unclear or no benefit. High blood pressure affects 33% of the population globally.

About half of all people with high blood pressure do not know that they have it. In 2019, high blood pressure was believed to have been a factor in 19% of all deaths. Hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, fast heart rate, bulging eyes, and tremor. Renal artery stenosis may be associated with a localized abdominal bruit to the left or right of the midline, or in both locations. Coarctation of the aorta frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses. Pheochromocytoma may cause abrupt episodes of hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pale appearance, and excessive sweating. In hypertensive urgency, there is no evidence of end-organ damage resulting from the elevated blood pressure. In these cases, oral medications are used to lower blood pressure over 24 to 48 hours gradually.

In a hypertensive emergency, there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs. The most affected organs include the brain, kidney, heart, and lungs, producing symptoms that may include confusion, drowsiness, chest pain, and breathlessness. In a hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure must be reduced more rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence for this approach. Blood pressure rises with aging in societies with a western diet and lifestyle, and the risk of becoming hypertensive in later life is substantial in most such societies. Several environmental or lifestyle factors influence blood pressure. Reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure; as does weight loss, exercise training, vegetarian diets, increased dietary potassium intake and high dietary calcium supplementation.

Increasing alcohol intake is associated with higher blood pressure, but the possible roles of other factors such as caffeine consumption, and vitamin D deficiency are less clear. Average blood pressure is higher in the winter than in the summer. Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta, excessive eating of liquorice, excessive drinking of alcohol, certain prescription medicines, herbal remedies, and stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine. A 2018 review found that any alcohol increased blood pressure in males, while over one or two drinks increased the risk in females. These individuals may develop the typical features of established essential hypertension in later life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance rises with age. Whether this pattern is typical of all people who ultimately develop hypertension is disputed.

### MRI of suspected lower extremity musculoskeletal infection in the pediatric patient: how useful is bilateral imaging? [^116j44xw]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bilateral abnormalities in children with suspected lower extremity musculoskeletal infection and the impact of detection of contralateral abnormalities by MRI on patient management.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of 165 consecutive bilateral lower extremity MRI examinations performed for suspected musculoskeletal infection in pediatric patients (64% boys and 36% girls; mean age, 7.5 years; age range, 0–18 years) in 2010 at a children's hospital was performed. Imaging findings were compared with the final clinical diagnosis and management.

Results

The MRI examination was normal in 2% (4/165). Osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 33% (54/165) of the MRI examinations; among these examinations 20% (11/54) had both ipsilateral septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, 2% (1/54) had bilateral osteomyelitis, and 67% (111/165) of the examinations were negative for osteomyelitis. Bilateral abnormalities were detected in 20% (22/111) of patients without osteomyelitis, with 18% (4/22) presenting with bilateral signs or symptoms. Abnormalities in the contralateral extremity included myositis (18%, 4/22), stress reaction (18%, 4/22), subcutaneous edema (18%, 4/22), leukemia (14%, 3/22), reactive joint effusion (14%, 3/22), Baker cyst (5%, 1/22), and osteonecrosis (5%, 1/22). Identification of clinically unsuspected abnormalities of the contralateral extremity by MRI was not associated with alterations in medical or surgical management in children with or without osteomyelitis.

Conclusion

Clinically unsuspected abnormalities of the asymptomatic contralateral lower extremity are common in children referred for MRI of suspected musculoskeletal infection. However, detection of these abnormalities is not associated with alterations in patient management.

### Antihypertensive… [^116WFPH1]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Antihypertensives are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and myocardial infarction. Evidence suggests that a reduction of blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34% and of ischaemic heart disease by 21%. Which type of medication to use initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and resulting national guidelines. The fundamental goal of treatment should be the prevention of the important endpoints of hypertension, such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure. Patient age, associated clinical conditions and end-organ damage also play a part in determining dosage and type of medication administered. The several classes of antihypertensives differ in side effect profiles, ability to prevent endpoints, and cost.

The choice of more expensive agents, where cheaper ones would be equally effective, may have negative impacts on national healthcare budgets. As of 2018, the best available evidence favors low-dose thiazide diuretics as the first-line treatment of choice for high blood pressure when drugs are necessary. Medications that are classified as potassium-sparing diuretics which block the epithelial sodium channel, such as amiloride and triamterene, are seldom prescribed as monotherapy. ENaC blocker medications need stronger public evidence for their blood pressure reducing effect. In the VALUE trial, the ARB valsartan produced a statistically significant 19% relative increase in the prespecified secondary end point of myocardial infarction compared with amlodipine. The CHARM-alternative trial showed a significant +52% increase in myocardial infarction with candesartan despite a reduction in blood pressure.

Although beta blockers lower blood pressure, they do not have a positive benefit on endpoints as some other antihypertensives do. In particular, beta-blockers are no longer recommended as first-line treatment due to relative adverse risk of stroke and new-onset of type 2 diabetes when compared to other medications, while certain specific beta-blockers such as atenolol appear to be less useful in overall treatment of hypertension than several other agents. A systematic review of 63 trials with over 35, 000 participants indicated β-blockers increased the risk of mortality, compared to other antihypertensive therapies. They do, however, have an important role in the prevention of heart attacks in people who have already had a heart attack.

In the United Kingdom, the June 2006 "Hypertension: Management of Hypertension in Adults in Primary Care" guideline of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, downgraded the role of beta-blockers due to their risk of provoking type 2 diabetes. Aldosterone receptor antagonist Aldosterone receptor antagonists, also known as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist can lower blood pressure by blocking the binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor. Spironolactone and eplerenone are MRAs that causes a block in the reabsorption of sodium, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure.
- eplerenone
- spironolactone Aldosterone receptor antagonists are not recommended as first-line agents for blood pressure, but spironolactone and eplerenone are both used in the treatment of heart failure and resistant hypertension. Endothelium receptor blockers Bosentan belongs to a new class of drugs and works by blocking endothelin receptors.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^114AHrQT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Varicose veins of the lower extremities are among the most frequent medical conditions affecting millions of people worldwide. Chronic venous disease (CVD) may cause minimal symptoms, but varicose veins may often also be the source of discomfort, pain, swelling, thrombosis, bleeding, and ulcerations, causing disability and a negative impact on physical, psychological, and social functioning components of quality of life (QOL). Patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may progress to phlebolymphedema, skin changes with chronic inflammation, and venous leg ulcerations.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society have collaborated to update the 2011 SVS/AVF guidelines on CVD, and recently published Part I of the 2022 clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. All recommendations in Part I were based on a new, independent systematic review and meta-analysisthat provided the latest scientific evidence to support updated or completely new guidelines on evaluation with duplex scanning and on the management of superficial truncal reflux in patients with varicose veins. The writing committee recognized, however, that several additional important clinical issues need to be addressed, but many have varying levels of scientific evidence. When a systematic review was not available, the writing committee based ungraded statements on a comprehensive review of the literature, combined with unanimous consensus of the expert panel.

### Parkes-Weber syndrome in the emergency department [^111JgJgh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 20-year-old woman with no relevant previous medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with 1 day of painful, acute worsening of her chronic left thigh swelling without an identifiable trigger. She denied additional symptoms, trauma, personal and family history of thrombosis or coagulopathy, and tobacco or illicit substance use. A routine workout 2 days prior was unchanged from her usual described intensity. The pain was described as 'tightness', which was relieved by rest and aggravated by movement. The patient reported that her chronic asymmetry was never investigated by previous physicians because it was only slightly wider in girth and non-painful since childhood. Her only prescribed medication was a levonorgestrel intrauterine device, and family history was significant for ulcerative colitis and coronary artery disease.

The physical examination revealed her to be in no acute distress with normal vital signs. Relevant findings included a left thigh, which was roughly double the circumference, but the same length, as the right. Otherwise, both thighs had soft compartments without erythema, crepitus, warmth or tenderness to palpation (figure 1). Her neurovascular function was normal bilaterally, there was no pitting oedema or calf swelling, and no discomfort was noted behind the knee on forced dorsiflexion. Finally, no urine colour changes were noted. All other findings were either normal or not clinically relevant. Notably, capillary malformations in the patient's left thigh had been present since birth but were not noted on the treating physician's examination.

### Treatment of distal radius fracture: does early activity postinjury lead to a lower incidence of complex regional pain syndrome? [^116x2sw6]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we observed no patients with CRPS-1 when using an active approach, including a home exercise program started immediately after a nonoperatively treated DRF. Twelve (9.2%) patients had disproportionate pain and scored positive on the subjective items of the Budapest Diagnostic Criteria during a telephone interview. None of these 12 patients were diagnosed with CRPS-1 during an outpatient visit more than 3 months postinjury. In 8 patients, an underlying diagnosis could be found, whereas in 4 patients, the pain was associated with stiffness in the hand and wrist. Therefore, we agree with Teunis et althat CRPS-1 is less common than expected and that to eradicate the stigma on CRPS-1, it is advisable to describe the disproportionate pain and rule out possible existing disability.

Type 1 complex regional pain syndrome is characterized by excessive pain, edema, changes in skin blood flow, and abnormal sudomotor activity after excluding other more common causes of these signs and symptoms. Despite extensive research, the exact mechanism of the pathophysiology of CRPS-1 remains unclear. Recent literature shows that CRPS-1 should be seen as a multifactorial disease after injury (upper or lower extremity injuries). As it is difficult to provide an effective treatment, it might be important to seek recent evidence for possible factors that are correlated with the onset and possible prevention of CRPS-1. Catastrophic thinking, cast tightness, level of education, disuse, and higher pain intensity are examples of factors correlated with a higher incidence of CRPS-1 after wrist fractures.- Terkelsen et alshowed that even in healthy volunteers, immobilization of an upper extremity with a plaster cast for 4 weeks causes transient changes in skin temperature, mechanosensitivity, and thermosensitivity. In line with the study of Terkelsen et al, it seems highly likely that immobility and disuse can be an important factor in the development of CRPS-1 (including disproportionate pain) after a DRF. One way to treat these symptoms and prevent disuse is PEPT. Pain exposure in physical therapy was developed as a countermeasure for disuse and pain-avoidance behavior. It is based on the assumption that behavioral and psychological factors can exacerbate pain and dysfunction. It was shown to be a good and cost-effective treatment for patients with CRPS-1 in the upper or lower extremity.-

### Peripheral edema [^115bmCRU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### Adult woman presenting progressive enlargement of mass on the left leg [^11591ZXF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Lower extremity lymphedema is caused by the excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. The initially affected area of lower extremity lymphedema was the distal part of the leg such as the ankle, foot, and toes. The foot of the patient is completely spared.
B. Chronic venous disease (CVD) – Incorrect. CVD is associated with telangiectasias, varicose veins, swelling, and skin changes. Leg swelling of CVD often occurs in ankles and calves, while the feet are usually spared, and it can be effectively improved by leg elevation.
C. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) – Correct. PNs are benign nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The family history of NF1 is significant in her father and aunt. The MRI result showed a well-demarcated, encapsulated, ≥ 3 cm lesion matching the imaging features of PNs. Histologically, they exhibit a typical composition of spindled with wavy, tapered, and comma-shaped nuclei.
D. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) – Incorrect. KTS is a congenital disorder characterized by capillary, lymphatic, and venous system malformation, as well as bone and/or soft tissue hypertrophy. MRI can identify the asymmetric soft tissue hypertrophy and osteohypertrophy of the leg. Leg function impairment secondary to hypertrophy can be observed in KTS, but many patients demonstrated a reduced body area rather than increased growth. By comparison, most PNs are characterized by continuous growth and PN shrinkage mainly occurs in adults. Vascular masses, dilated superficial veins, and flat hemangiomas can also be assessed by color duplex ultrasound and venography. These vascular anomalies are significant clinical features of KTS but are rarely present in PNs.
E. Lipedema – Incorrect. Lipedema is associated with abnormal deposition of subcutaneous adipose, leading to the disproportional increase of lower extremities in the volume. Digital pressure on the affected limbs can induce leg pain. Leg swelling worsens with standing and cannot be effectively alleviated by limb elevation therapy.

### Minimal change disease following the moderna COVID-19 vaccine: first case report [^111EkPJk]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old Ethiopian man, with no significant past medical history, presented to our hospital, 3 weeks after receiving the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, with both bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. He initially developed a sudden-onset bilateral lower limb swelling on day 7 post-vaccine. Following on from that, he developed dyspnea on exertion and scrotal swelling over a time span of 2 weeks. He denied fever, chills, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, joint pain, change in the color or amount of urine, hematuria or dysuria. The patient did not report any recent viral infection, and he did not travel or come in contact with any sick people. Furthermore, he denied taking any herbals or over the counter medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient also denied having a similar episode in the past or having a family history of kidney diseases. He is married and works in an office. He occasionally drinks alcohol, but he does not smoke cigarettes.

Upon presentation, his temperature was 36.8 degree Celsius, blood pressure was 150/92 mmHg, heart rate was 87 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. On physical examination, he had a decreased air entry at both lung bases, and massive bilateral lower limb pitting edema extending to above the knees and scrotal swelling. The rest of the exam was unremarkable with no palpable lymph nodes. The initial laboratory investigations (Table 1) revealed serum creatinine of 80 μmol/L, blood urea nitrogen of 3.9 mmol/L and albumin of 8 g/L. His urinalysis showed 3+ protein and 2+ blood. He only had 4 red blood cells per high power field on urine microscopy, while his 24-h urine protein was 15 g. His immunologic workup, including complements (C3, C4), antinuclear and anti-phospholipase A2 antibodies, was normal. Additionally, HIV, hepatitis B, C and nasopharyngeal COVID-19 polymerase chain reactions were all negative. Chest x-ray revealed prominent vascular markings and mild bilateral pleural effusion, while abdominal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys with normal echogenicity and corticomedullary differentiation. The patient did not have previous lab results or imaging prior to this hospitalization.

### Computed tomography scanning in the diagnosis of lower extremity phlebolymphedema [^1156JSLi]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Phlebolymphedema, the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in Western societies, seldom gets the attention it deserves. Diagnosis is often missed and when evaluated is through lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) which is cumbersome. This study aims to assess the role of computed tomography (CT) scanning in the diagnosis of phlebolymphedema of the lower extremities by comparing CT characteristics with the International Society of Lymphology (ISL) grading system and LSG.

Methods

Patients presenting with chronic venous disease who underwent a CT scan and LSG of the lower extremities (diagnostic testing) formed the study cohort. Three assessors blinded to the patients' ISL stage and LSG results evaluated the CT for skin thickening (present/absent), subcutaneous interstitial edema (honeycombing; graded 0–2), and muscle compartment (MC) edema (graded 0–2), in the thigh (20 cm above apex of patella), leg (10 cm below apex of patella), and ankle (5 cm above lateral malleolus). Agreement from two of the three raters determined the value used for analysis. Additionally, the final score used for each variable for each limb was determined by taking the most severe value of the three levels. The three CT variables were then compared independently and together with ISL stage and LSG to determine their diagnostic potential for phlebolymphedema. Also assessed was the severity of each CT variable across each limb in addition to the evaluation of the extent of their inter-rater agreement.

Results

Of the 35 patients (50 limbs), 28 were female, with left laterality noted in 22 limbs. Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and Pathophysiological clinical class for the cohort included C0 to 2, 4 limbs (8%); C3, 13 limbs (26%); C4, 17 limbs (34%); C5, 9 limbs (18%); and C6, 7 limbs (14%). Thirty-one limbs underwent stenting for chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction after having failed conservative therapy. Of the 50 limbs, 8 (16%) were ISL stage 0, 10 (20%) ISL stage 1, 2 (4%) ISL stage 2, and 30 (60%) ISL stage 3. With LSG, 6 (12%) had a normal study, 21 (42%) mild disease, 0 (0%) moderate disease, and 23 (46%) severe disease. Correlation between LSG and ISL stage was poor (r = 0.18; p = 0.20). With ISL stage as a reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT in diagnosing phlebolymphedema were as follows: skin thickening (95%/75%/92%), honeycombing (100%/0%/84%), MC edema (100%/0%/84%), any one CT variable (100%/0%/84%), any two CT variables (100%/0%/84%), and all three CT variables (93%/63%/88%). With LSG as a reference, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT in diagnosing phlebolymphedema were as follows: skin thickening (82%/0%/72%), honeycombing (100%/0%/88%), MC edema (100%/0%/88%), any one CT variable (100%/0%/88%), any two CT variables (100%/0%/88%), and all three CT variables (82%/0%/72%). For CT variables, there was no significant difference between skin thickening in the thigh vs calf vs ankle (P = 0.5). MC edema, however, worsened from thigh to calf (P < .0001) without a difference between the calf and the ankle (P = 0.3). The severity of honeycombing was worst in the ankle and least in the thigh, with a significant difference between all 3 sites (P = 0.008). The inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic) varied from 0.2 for skin thickening to 0.7 for honeycombing.

Conclusions

CT scanning can be used as a screening tool for phlebolymphedema in the lower extremities. However, such a diagnosis depends on the reference standard used, ISL stage vs lymphoscintigram. Although skin thickness offered the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy when the ISL stage was used, honeycombing or MC edema had high sensitivity and accuracy but low specificity when LSG was used as the reference. Factoring in inter-rater agreement as well, honeycombing was noted to be the best CT variable to diagnose phlebolymphedema.

### Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae [^117MJQyx]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

A 69-year-old woman presented with shivering and pain in the lower extremities on 5 April 2006; she was referred to the dermatology division of our hospital on the following day with difficulty in walking. She had been suffering from non-viral, non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis, and was being treated by the Division of Internal Medicine. Physical examination showed edema in the lower extremities and light purpuras on the groin and legs. Low blood pressure had been observed since admission. Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) was suspected on the basis of the skin symptoms, systemic conditions, and magnetic resonance imaging. During surgical debridement under general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary arrest occurred, and the patient died 12 h after admission. NF, in its early stages, exhibits few skin changes. In order to differentiate it from other skin infections, it is necessary to take into account blood pressure, abnormal systemic conditions, and severe pain out of proportion to its minor skin changes. In the present case, Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected by blood culture. Soft tissue infectious diseases caused by S. pneumoniae, especially NF, are very rare. We have reviewed reported cases of NF caused by S. pneumoniae.

### Edematous lower extremities with overlying verrucous plaques [^115qYa7T]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa – Incorrect. While this patient's clinical presentation closely resembles elephantiasis nostras verrucosa with enlarged, disfigured extremities with a fibrotic, cobblestone-like appearance, the presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos hints toward a different diagnosis.
B. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema – Correct. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema presents with verrucous papules and plaques, most commonly on the anterior aspects of the lower legs, on a background of non-pitting edema. The presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos further supports a diagnosis of underlying GD. Histological examination demonstrates abundant mucin accumulation in the dermis, collagen attenuation, and stellate fibroblasts.
C. Lymphatic filariasis – Incorrect. Filariasis is a parasitic infection, common in tropical countries, and caused by the filarial parasites Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi/timori, presenting as elephantiasis. While clinically, the condition may be similar to the one presented here, the patient's history does not support a diagnosis of filariasis.
D. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides – Incorrect. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides describes a form of verrucous carcinoma, secondary to the human papilloma virus, which presents as verrucous papules and plaques involving the lower extremities. While the clinical appearance may be similar to the condition presented here, the disease is often unilateral and asymmetric, and the histologic findings in this case do not support the diagnosis of papillomatosis cutis carcinoides.
E. Lymphedema not otherwise specified – Incorrect. Lymphedema not otherwise specified can present with unilateral and bilateral lower extremity swelling. Without proper treatment, it may take on a similar presentation. However, the histopathologic findings do not support this diagnosis.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114xiUbZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians. The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis.

### Elephantiasis nostra verrucosa in sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease [^113yCEDv]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 74-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia underwent a matched sibling donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with peripheral blood stem cells and reduced-intensity conditioning 9 years ago. The patient attained sustained acute myeloid leukemia remission, however, despite prophylaxis with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, she experienced progressive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) affecting her skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia, joints (Fig 1), mouth, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract/liver. She was treated with multiple lines of systemic therapy including corticosteroids, sirolimus, extracorporeal photopheresis, ibrutinib, ruxolitinib, belumosudil, axatilimab, methotrexate, rituximab, and imatinib without significant success. She presented to the hospital with worsening sclerodermatous cGVHD (ScGVHD) while on sirolimus and low-dose prednisone. Examination revealed painful nonpitting edema, erythema, and disfigurement of the bilateral lower extremities along with pink papulonodular lesions and hyperkeratotic skin changes (Fig 2, A and B). Dermatology consultation confirmed the clinical diagnosis of elephantiasis nostra verrucosa (ENV) in the setting of ScGVHD. The patient declined a skin biopsy because of concerns for bleeding and infection. She continued cGVHD therapy with sirolimus, prednisone, and triamcinolone, as ENV was attributed to evolving deep tissue sclerosis from her underlying cGVHD.
