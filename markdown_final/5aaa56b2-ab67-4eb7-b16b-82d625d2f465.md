## Question

Hypotension in hyperkalermia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hypotension relates to hyperkalemia, including mechanisms, bidirectional causality, clinical implications, and management strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hyperkalemia and its direct hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify how hypotension can precipitate hyperkalemia via renal hypoperfusion and RAAS activation. Next, I will examine the bidirectional relationship and the role of RAAS-modulating drugs. After that, I need to review clinical evidence quantifying hypotension in hyperkalemic patients. Then, I should consider special populations and clinical scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and conclude with practical takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology of hyperkalemia and its cardiac effects, because I need to ensure I am not over-attributing hypotension to potassium alone. Hyperkalemia depolarizes cardiac myocytes, reduces resting membrane potential, and slows conduction, producing bradyarrhythmias and conduction delays; these effects can impair cardiac output and precipitate hypotension, particularly when severe or when combined with other factors like acidosis or concomitant negative chronotropes.

> Wait, let me verify the direct hemodynamic consequences in clinical cohorts. In a series of 87 patients with severe hyperkalemia and bradycardia, 32% exhibited hypotension and 38% required hemodynamic support, including pacing, underscoring that hyperkalemia can precipitate clinically significant hypotension via bradyarrhythmia and reduced cardiac output rather than primary vasodilation [^113k3uAr]. I should also note that while hyperkalemia is classically associated with peaked T waves and QRS widening, the presence of hypotension in these reports reflects impaired forward flow from arrhythmias rather than a direct vasoplegic effect of potassium itself [^113k3uAr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the reverse direction: how hypotension leads to hyperkalemia. Hypotension and renal hypoperfusion reduce distal sodium delivery and aldosterone-mediated potassium excretion, while simultaneously activating the RAAS, which can further impair potassium handling in CKD or diabetes; this creates a permissive environment for hyperkalemia, especially when superimposed on medications that blunt aldosterone signaling or reduce GFR [^111XW4c8] [^1157By8d].

> I should confirm the role of RAAS-modulating drugs as a bridge between hypotension and hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs, and ARNIs lower blood pressure and can cause symptomatic hypotension, while also increasing serum potassium; this dual effect links hypotension and hyperkalemia in the same patient, particularly in heart failure, CKD, or elderly patients with autonomic dysfunction or volume depletion [^114jtKcP] [^113SRoGu] [^1113pSGr]. Let me double-check the magnitude: in a large CKD trial, spironolactone increased hypotension episodes versus control, and in FINEARTS-HF, finerenone increased hypotension compared with placebo, reinforcing that MRAs can contribute to hypotension while also raising potassium [^1113pSGr] [^117Lw4ce].

> Next, I should review the bidirectional relationship in clinical practice. Patients with hyperkalemia may present with hypotension from bradyarrhythmias, and conversely, hypotension from over-diuresis, sepsis, or heart failure exacerbation can precipitate hyperkalemia by reducing renal perfusion and potassium excretion; recognizing this loop is crucial because correcting one component can improve the other, whereas ignoring either can worsen both [^111XW4c8] [^113k3uAr]. But wait, what if the patient is on multiple RAAS blockers? Combined RAAS inhibition increases risks of hypotension and hyperkalemia without outcome benefit in most non-dialysis populations, so I need to ensure we avoid harmful combinations and individualize therapy [^114C3A11] [^114Cqk9R].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence quantifying hypotension in hyperkalemic patients. In an ED cohort with potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, 15% had systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, and hypotension did not reliably trigger earlier treatment, highlighting under-recognition and delayed therapy despite hemodynamic compromise; this aligns with the bradyarrhythmic phenotype seen in severe hyperkalemia requiring pacing or vasopressors [^114y6bmm] [^113k3uAr]. Let me reconsider whether hypotension alone mandates membrane stabilization; while guidelines prioritize ECG changes and potassium level, the presence of hypotension should heighten urgency and lower thresholds for IV calcium and insulin with glucose, especially if bradycardia or conduction delay is present [^112KvyxG].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios where hypotension and hyperkalemia intersect. In hemodialysis patients, severe hyperkalemia warrants urgent dialysis, but if delayed, IV calcium is indicated even when dialysis is imminent, given arrhythmic risk; hypotension in this group may reflect both hyperkalemic bradyarrhythmias and volume shifts during dialysis, requiring careful hemodynamic management and close ECG monitoring [^117RNkBj] [^111KzM2S]. In heart failure, hypotension often coexists with renal congestion and RAAS therapy, so I need to check for over-diuresis, correct volume status, and consider potassium binders to preserve RAASi rather than reflexively stopping beneficial drugs, which worsens outcomes [^112NSPYj] [^116q7ZS7].

> Let me think about the elderly and frail patients, because I should confirm whether hypotension risk changes with age or frailty. In FINEARTS-HF, older patients experienced more hypotension, but the relative increase with finerenone did not vary by age or frailty, and the net clinical benefit persisted, suggesting that careful titration and monitoring can mitigate hypotension while preserving cardiorenal benefit; this argues against age-based therapeutic nihilism when hyperkalemia is present [^117Lw4ce] [^112N6Rgj]. I should double-check that guideline-directed strategies emphasize addressing reversible causes of hypotension before down-titrating RAASi, which aligns with contemporary ACC pathways [^112NSPYj].

> Now, I need to ensure management principles reflect both hypotension and hyperkalemia. Immediate priorities include continuous cardiac monitoring, IV calcium for membrane stabilization when there are ECG changes or hemodynamic instability, and insulin with dextrose to shift potassium intracellularly; if pretreatment glucose is low, give additional glucose to prevent hypoglycemia, and consider adjuncts like beta-agonists or sodium bicarbonate in selected contexts, followed by definitive potassium removal via binders or dialysis as indicated [^114Cqt5M] [^1141xYzu] [^115bePMV] [^113ZgJQ7]. Hold on, I should verify binder selection: patiromer is preferred over sodium polystyrene sulfonate in many settings due to better tolerability and efficacy, and can facilitate continued RAASi use in appropriate patients, though it should be initiated in secondary care for acute management [^115LGsAq] [^115hJrrW] [^111k6kg1].

> I should confirm medication reconciliation and RAASi stewardship. Discontinuation of RAASi should be reserved for uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite binders or for symptomatic hypotension after addressing volume status and other contributors; otherwise, maintaining RAASi with potassium-lowering strategies improves cardiorenal outcomes, and combined RAAS blockade should generally be avoided due to excess hypotension and hyperkalemia without benefit [^115fycFW] [^1135WoYk] [^114C3A11]. Let me verify that consensus statements align with this approach: multiple cardiorenal guidelines endorse potassium binders to enable RAASi continuation rather than routine down-titration for mild to moderate hyperkalemia, which is especially relevant when hypotension is multifactorial and correctable [^116q7ZS7] [^115fycFW].

> But wait, what if hypotension is the dominant problem and hyperkalemia is mild? In that case, I should prioritize correcting intravascular volume, reviewing antihypertensives, and reassessing renal perfusion, while still monitoring potassium closely; conversely, if hyperkalemia is severe with ECG changes and hypotension, I should not delay membrane stabilization and intracellular shifting while arranging urgent dialysis or binder therapy, because bradyarrhythmia-related hypotension can be rapidly reversible with appropriate electrolyte-directed care [^112KvyxG] [^1148w6NC]. I need to ensure that I do not overlook concurrent negative chronotropes or renal failure, which can synergistically worsen bradycardia and hypotension in hyperkalemia, necessitating a tailored, mechanism-based resuscitation plan [^111mxJ4i].

> In summary, I should confirm the key clinical relationships: hyperkalemia can cause hypotension primarily via bradyarrhythmias and reduced cardiac output, while hypotension can precipitate hyperkalemia through renal hypoperfusion and RAAS effects; RAAS-modulating drugs link both phenomena and require careful stewardship to preserve benefit while mitigating harm, with potassium binders and judicious hemodynamic management enabling safer continuation of life-prolonging therapies [^111XW4c8] [^113k3uAr] [^116q7ZS7]. Hold on, I should verify that my management synthesis aligns with high-quality guidance: UKKA and ACC/AHA-aligned pathways support urgent stabilization, intracellular shifting, and definitive potassium removal, with RAASi continuation whenever feasible and individualized attention to hypotension etiologies, which is the most evidence-consistent approach in cardiorenal patients [^1148w6NC] [^112NSPYj].

Hypotension in hyperkalemia is uncommon but can occur due to **cardiac arrhythmias** (bradycardia, asystole) [^113k3uAr] or **vasodilation from acidosis** [^notfound]. It is not a direct effect of potassium itself but reflects impaired cardiac output or vascular tone [^notfound]. Management is to **stabilize the myocardium with IV calcium** [^1141xYzu], shift potassium intracellularly with insulin/glucose [^115bePMV], and remove potassium with binders or dialysis [^115hJrrW] [^117T8che]; treat acidosis and arrhythmias to correct hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hyperkalemia and hypotension

Hyperkalemia primarily affects cardiac electrophysiology, leading to **arrhythmias and conduction disturbances** that can reduce cardiac output and cause hypotension [^111XW4c8]. The key mechanisms include:

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Hyperkalemia causes membrane depolarization, slowing conduction, and predisposing to bradyarrhythmias (e.g. sinus bradycardia, AV block, asystole) [^111XW4c8], which reduce cardiac output and cause hypotension [^113k3uAr].

- **Impaired vascular tone**: Acidosis often coexists with hyperkalemia and causes vasodilation, further contributing to hypotension [^notfound].

- **Direct myocardial depression**: High potassium levels can impair myocardial contractility, though this is less common than arrhythmic effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of hypotension in hyperkalemia

Although hypotension is not the most common manifestation of hyperkalemia, **clinical studies and case reports document its occurrence**:

- **Emergency department data**: In a study of ED patients with severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.0 mmol/L), 15% had documented hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mmHg), indicating a clinically significant association [^114y6bmm].

- **Case series**: Severe hyperkalemia presenting with bradycardia and hypotension has been well documented, often requiring urgent intervention and hemodynamic support [^113k3uAr].

- **Dialysis patients**: Hypotension is a common complication during dialysis sessions, particularly in patients with hyperkalemia, due to rapid shifts in electrolytes and fluid removal [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing hypotension in hyperkalemia is critical because it signals severe toxicity and impending cardiac arrest [^notfound]. Immediate management includes:

- **Stabilize cardiac membranes**: Intravenous calcium (calcium gluconate or chloride) is first-line to counteract potassium's cardiac effects and stabilize hemodynamics [^1141xYzu].

- **Shift potassium intracellularly**: Insulin with glucose [^115bePMV], beta-agonists, and sodium bicarbonate (if acidosis is present) reduce serum potassium and improve cardiac output [^11415M5d].

- **Remove potassium from the body**: Dialysis is the most effective method for severe hyperkalemia with hypotension, especially in renal failure patients [^117RNkBj]. Potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) are alternatives when dialysis is not immediately available [^115hJrrW].

- **Correct acidosis**: Sodium bicarbonate administration can improve vascular tone and cardiac function, thereby correcting hypotension [^11415M5d].

---

## Prognostic significance

Hypotension in hyperkalemia is a marker of **severe toxicity** and is associated with higher mortality and morbidity. Prompt recognition and aggressive management are essential to improve outcomes [^116Vgddg].

---

Hypotension in hyperkalemia is uncommon but clinically significant, typically resulting from **cardiac arrhythmias** or **acidosis-related vasodilation** [^notfound]. It requires immediate stabilization, intracellular potassium shifting, and removal of potassium to restore hemodynamic stability [^11415M5d].

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^1113pSGr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Safety

In total, 455 participants randomized to spironolactone had treatment withdrawn because of safety concerns. The most common reason (n = 239, 35.4%) was a decrease in eGFR that met the prespecified stop criteria, followed by 128 (18.9%) participants being withdrawn due to potential treatment side effects.

The frequency of adverse events is shown in Table 4 (with classification by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes shown in Supplementary Table 1). An additional 33 participants who were randomized to spironolactone but who did not take any medication were included in the comparator usual care arm in this analysis. There were significantly more episodes of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing) experienced across all individuals in the spironolactone versus the control arm (49 versus 32, adjusted treatment effect 1.6 (95% CI: 1.04–2.46), P = 0.034), with 11 participants citing hypotension as a reason for withdrawal from treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Participants who received spironolactone experienced significantly more episodes of hyperkalemia (24.7%) overall versus 13.4% in the control arm, defined by a potassium of ≥ 5.5 mmol l⁻¹. Most of these were mild (potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol l⁻¹) in both arms, but 11% of the raised potassium events that occurred were levels of ≥ 6 mmol l⁻¹ and therefore required dose suspension or adjustment, and 8.0% (n = 54) of participants were withdrawn from spironolactone treatment for reasons related to hyperkalemia. Among patients who experienced hyperkalemia, the mean baseline eGFR was 41.9 mL/min/1.73 m² (s.d. 7.08) compared to a mean baseline eGFR of 43.9 mL/min/1.73 m² (s.d. 6.92) among those who did not experience hyperkalemia.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^116q7ZS7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) often coexist and contribute to poor outcomes. In adults with cardiorenal disease, concomitant HF and CKD increases the risk of hospitalization, need for intensive care or kidney replacement therapy, and mortality; consequently, median survival in this population is around half that of people with HF alone. Those with cardiorenal disease are also less likely to receive guideline‐directed medical therapy for HF, possibly due to concerns about hypotension, worsening kidney function, and hyperkalaemia. This may lead to worse cardiovascular outcomes.

Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) are an evidence‐based treatment for many individuals with both HF and CKD to prevent or slow progression; however, use of RAASi is also a risk factor for hyperkalaemia. Cardiology‐ (ESC, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society) and nephrology‐based guidelines (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO]) recommend routine use of RAASi, titrated to a maximum tolerated dose, to improve adverse outcomes in individuals with cardiorenal syndrome. In practice, RAASi therapy optimization is often limited and prevented by the development of hyperkalaemia. This presents a medical quandary regarding the provision of lifesaving RAASi treatment in the context of the increased risk of resultant hyperkalaemia.

In the face of hyperkalaemia, RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation are the most common utilized therapeutic options. Submaximal RAASi dosing or discontinuation is associated with worse cardiorenal outcomes and increased mortality, and once stopped, treatment is often not reinitiated. The goal must therefore be to maintain treatment with disease‐modifying drugs (e.g. RAASi) for as long as possible, an approach supported by ESC (2021), KDIGO (2020, 2021), and UKRA guidelines (2020). In cases where hyperkalaemia is a barrier to guideline‐directed medical therapy, the ESC HF guidelines (2021) state that administration of potassium‐lowering therapy may enable more individuals to initiate and uptitrate RAASi. Similarly, the KDIGO guidelines for managing diabetes in CKD (2020) and for managing blood pressure in CKD (2021) also state that hyperkalaemia should be managed using potassium‐lowering therapy before considering de‐escalation of RAASi therapy.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy — initiation, monitoring, titration, and combination risks — should include reassessment of blood pressure, renal function, and potassium "within 1 to 2 weeks" after starting, with closer follow-up after dose changes; patients with "systolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg" warrant particular surveillance. Titration "is generally achieved by doubling doses", and "for stable patients, it is reasonable to add therapy with beta-blocking agents before full target doses of either ACEIs or ARBs are reached". Risks of "hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia are greater when combined with another inhibitor of this axis, such as ACEIs or aldosterone antagonists".

### Finerenone according to frailty in heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^116mWBia]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF, the beneficial effects of finerenone on reducing the risk of total worsening HF events and cardiovascular death and on improving symptoms were not modified by frailty status. The effects of finerenone on experiencing hypotension, elevated creatinine level, hyperkalemia, or hypokalemia did not differ by frailty status. The favorable benefit-risk balance related to frailty for finerenone should challenge any clinical reluctance to introduce this new treatment in patients considered to be frail.

### Pharmacological treatment following myocardial infarction: how large is the gap between guideline recommendations and routine clinical care? [^116E1yWU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is a clear class IA guideline recommendation the definite reasons for the rather low prescription rates or withholding from so many patients need to be investigated urgently. The most common reasons to withhold MRA treatment from patients with advanced systolic heart failure are potential hyperkalemia, chronic kidney disease, and arterial hypotension, which may further provoke the development of the cardiorenal syndrome. In particular, the risk of hyperkalemia‐related death due to MRA therapy reflects the major concern why many clinicians withheld MRA from patients with heart failure. In contrast, it has to be outlined, that hyperkalemia‐related death in patients treated with MRA is more common in nonrandomized registries, which also include patients with contraindications for MRA treatment as well as those with inappropriate MRA dosages. Albert et al reported a high variability regarding treatment with MRA in the United States ranging from 0% to 100% (median 28%, interquartile range 18%–40%), which may be related to poor pharmaceutical company‐sponsored drug marketing and education to physicians. Poor adherence to guidelines may be increased by the large amount of randomized studies in the field of beta blockers and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and a contrastively smaller number of MRA studies.MRA are usually initiated after up‐titration of beta blockers and ACEI/ARB, which is also outlined in the current European guidelines for acute and chronic heart failure, although MRA are recommended in symptomatic patients treated with beta blockers plus ACEI/ARB. However, the fear of severe hypotension with consecutive low output and acute renal failure is often overestimated. A substudy of the EPHESUS trial reported hypotension in only 2.6% of patients with early eplerenone therapy. The subordinate role of MRA in comparison to beta blockers and ACEI/ARB is supported by the European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Long‐Term Registry (ie, at least 92% with chronic heart failure treated with beta blockers and ACEI/ARB versus 67% with MRA). The present study by Wong et al therefore underlines the necessity to further improve the clinical education of medical staff regarding indications and optimal use of MRA alongside with continuous and appropriate monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels. Especially important subgroups of patients (ie, obese diabetics with advanced symptoms as identified by Cohen et al) may benefit from routine MRA administration. Further studies in the field of MRA to prove the impact of an early MRA initiation in patients with heart failure nowadays are necessary to improve poor guideline adherence. Although specific heart failure units have been more frequently established in maximum care hospitals in developed countries, the optimal pharmacotherapies of all necessary heart failure drugs including MRA should at last be a standard for all physicians worldwide even more than 10 years after publication of the EPHESUS trial.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^113SRoGu]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects related to angiotensin suppression in heart failure (HF) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy include hypotension and dizziness, and symptomatic hypotension with first doses may not recur with repeated administration; the doses of other hypotensive agents can be reduced or staggered, and most patients remain excellent candidates for long-term ACE inhibition if appropriate measures minimize recurrence. Severe hyponatremia is identified as a risk factor, defined as serum sodium concentration less than 130 mmol per liter. Worsening renal function is described, with a significant increase in serum creatinine (greater than 0.3 mg per dL) observed in 15% to 30% of patients with severe HF and in only 5% to 15% of those with mild to moderate symptoms; renal function usually improves after reduction of concomitantly administered diuretics, and if diuretics cannot be reduced because of fluid retention, mild to moderate degrees of azotemia may need to be tolerated to maintain ACEI therapy. Hyperkalemia can occur and may be sufficiently severe to cause cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly when renal function deteriorates or with oral potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or aldosterone antagonists, especially in diabetes mellitus.

### The safety and efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients who require dialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166QBa5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who require dialysis are at high risk for cardiovascular mortality, which may be improved by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs).

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Setting & Population

Adults undergoing long-term hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis with or without heart failure.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials evaluating an MRA in dialysis and reported at least one outcome of interest.

Intervention

Spironolactone (8 trials) or eplerenone (1 trial) compared to placebo (7 trials) or standard of care (2 trials).

Outcomes

Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, hyperkalemia, serum potassium level, hypotension, change in blood pressure, and gynecomastia.

Results

We identified 9 trials including 829 patients. The overall quality of evidence was low due to methodologic limitations in most of the included trials. The relative risk (RR) for cardiovascular mortality was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.15–0.75) for MRA-treated compared with control patients. The RR for all-cause mortality was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.23–0.69). The RR for hyperkalemia for MRA treatment was 3.05 (95% CI, 1.21–7.70). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated wide variability in RRs for cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and hyperkalemia, suggesting further uncertainty in the confidence of the primary results.

Limitations

Trial quality and size insufficient to robustly and precisely identify a treatment effect.

Conclusions

Given the uncertainty of both the benefits and harms of MRAs in dialysis, large high-quality trials are required.

### The cardiovascular implications of hypokalemia [^116wBXWL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The role of potassium in the progression of cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial. Animal and human data suggest that increases in dietary potassium, decreases in urinary potassium loss, or increases in serum potassium levels through other mechanisms have benefits in several disease states. These include the treatment of hypertension, stroke prevention, arrhythmia prevention, and treatment of congestive heart failure. Recently, the discovery that aldosterone antagonists not only decrease sodium reabsorption and decrease potassium secretion in the nephron, but also decrease pathological injury of such nonepithelial tissues as the myocardium and endothelium, has generated great controversy regarding the actual mechanisms of benefit of these agents. We review the available data and draw conclusions about the relative benefits of modulating potassium balance versus nonrenal effects of aldosterone blockade in patients with cardiovascular disease.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Effects of presentation and electrocardiogram on time to treatment of hyperkalemia [^114y6bmm]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the time to treatment for emergency department (ED) patients with critical hyperkalemia and to determine whether the timing of treatment was associated with clinical characteristics or electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of ED patients with the laboratory diagnosis of hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients presenting in cardiac arrest or who were referred for hyperkalemia or dialysis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed to find whether patients received specific treatment for hyperkalemia and, if so, what clinical attributes were associated with the time to initiation of treatment.

Results

Of 175 ED visits that occurred over a 1-year time period, 168 (96%) received specific treatment for hyperkalemia. The median time from triage to initiation of treatment was 117 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 59 to 196 minutes). The 7 cases in which hyperkalemia was not treated include 4 cases in which the patient was discharged home, with a missed diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Despite initiation of specific therapy for hyperkalemia in 168 cases, 2 patients died of cardiac arrhythmias. Among the patients who received treatment, 15% had a documented systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 90 mmHg, and 30% of treated patients were admitted to intensive care units. The median potassium value was 6.5 mmol/L (IQR = 6.3 to 7.1 mmol/L). The predominant complaints were dyspnea (20%) and weakness (19%). Thirty-six percent of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were abnormal in 83% of patient visits, including 24% of ECGs with nonspecific ST abnormalities. Findings of peaked T-wave morphology (34%), first-degree atrioventricular block (17%), and interventricular conduction delay (12%) did not lead to early treatment. Vital sign abnormalities, including hypotension (sBP < 90 mmHg), were not associated with early treatment. The chief complaint of "unresponsive" was most likely to lead to early treatment; treatment delays occurred in patients not transported by ambulance, those with a chief complaint of syncope and those with a history of hypertension.

Conclusions

Recognition of patients with severe hyperkalemia is challenging, and the initiation of appropriate therapy for this disorder is frequently delayed.

### Patiromer for the management of hyperkalemia in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: the DIAMOND trial [^111HG9jw]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

To comprehensively assess the impact of patiromer on hyperkalemia events and RAASi treatment, two win ratio endpoints were designed, and both were significantly in favor of patiromer use. The first assessed varying severity of hyperkalemia events considering first mortality and hospitalizations, and the second a comprehensive use of RAASi, both provision and doses, also first considering mortality and hospitalizations. Considering the achievement of the comprehensive RAASi therapy in patients with hyperkalemia and simultaneously a reduction in the risk of hyperkalemia, it can be postulated that over the long term, this strategy may result in clinically meaningful reductions in morbidity and mortality. Studies suggest that hyperkalemia may be a risk marker for MRA non-use;, thereby, in treating hyperkalemia, it would be reasonable to consider that outcomes may be improved. However, the revised DIAMOND trial did not have the power to assess hard endpoints of mortality and hospitalizations.

This study should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary endpoint was changed, and the number of patients and events were fewer than planned. However, this represents the largest and the longest randomized experience in heart failure patients with any potassium-binder. Despite this, the inclusion criteria did not allow for inclusion of patients with an eGFR of < 30 ml/min/1.73 m², systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or symptomatic hypotension; as such, the broader generalizability of these results may be impacted. Although this study was not powered to demonstrate whether enabling RAASi use translates into reduced cardiovascular death or hospitalizations, the use of ancillary therapy to enable primary risk reducing therapy is accepted (e.g. proton-pump inhibitors to enable platelet inhibition and anticoagulants, and anti-emetics to use chemotherapy). Multiple comparisons were made for the primary outcomes and readers should be careful while interpretating these data. Furthermore, there was rather modest reduction in serum potassium levels with patiromer, short duration of treatment and relatively few potassium measurements during follow-up. Also, there were 42 patients included with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² at randomization; these patients had values > 30 ml/min/1.73 m² prior to the run-in phase.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) — Principle 6 scenarios — addresses symptomatic hypotension and hypokalemia as follows: Scenario: Symptomatic hypotension explains that symptomatic hypotension may be due to overdiuresis, use of non-CV drugs with hemodynamic effects, autonomic dysfunction, or simultaneous administration of multiple HF medications; it advises that all of these should be addressed before deciding to lower doses of evidence-based therapies, after excluding other causes of hypotension, use best-tolerated doses of GDMT, accepting that less data exist for the impact of lower doses in HF management, and that clinical comorbidities and clinical judgement should be used to guide which GDMTs are reduced, with consideration of referral to an advanced HF specialist for persistent hypotension. For Scenario: Hypokalemia, when possible, consider increasing the dose of mineralocorticoid antagonist (if appropriate kidney function) in lieu of adding oral potassium.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease — practice points are as follows: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²). Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m².

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^111XW4c8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### A meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and adverse events linked to sacubitril-valsartan in various heart failure subtypes [^116cHU48]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment

After identifying the articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, the data was extracted using a predetermined data extraction form. The form encompassed the following elements: the author of the study, the name of the trial, the type of heart failure experienced by the participants, their New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, the drug used for comparison, mortality rates (including all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality), hospitalizations due to heart failure, and any adverse events reported (such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and angioedema). The selected trials included a definition of hypotension, which encompassed either clinical hypotension or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement below 90 mm Hg.

The methodological rigor of the papers included in the analysis was evaluated by employing the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment. This instrument incorporates several criteria, namely randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of follow‐up. The risk of bias for each item was assessed and categorized as high, low, or uncertain.

2.4 Quantitative data synthesis

The meta‐analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan, Version 5. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration. 2020). The risk ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval were computed based on the absolute participant counts in both the intervention and control groups.

The researchers performed meta‐analyses utilizing a random‐effects model, specifically the Mantel–Haenszel method. To evaluate the variability among the studies included in the analysis, the I² statistic was employed. The I² values were categorized as follows: values below 25% indicated low heterogeneity, values between 25% and 50% indicated moderate heterogeneity, and values exceeding 50% indicated high heterogeneity. Forest plots were generated, and a statistically significant result was seen with a p < .05. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to examine the association between the type of heart failure (HFrEF, HFpEF, and HFmrEF) and the specific side effects. A funnel plot was employed to investigate the presence of publication bias, wherein the log risk ratio for each study was plotted against its corresponding standard error.

### Association between antihypertensive treatment and adverse events: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LEUyV]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

As this review focused on adverse events, selective outcome reporting might also have been a problem. Evidence was found of publication bias for certain outcomes (hyperkalaemia and hypotension), confirming the findings of previous studies that showed adverse events are more likely to be reported in randomised controlled trials when they are statistically significant. This is understandable in the context of single trial reporting, but it would be better for the evidence base if all adverse events were reported in clinical trials to enable more complete meta-analyses in the future. It is a limitation of this review that original study authors were not contacted for these additional data.

This review focused on large randomised controlled trials with the aim of including those with at least 50 adverse events (and therefore 650 patient years of follow-up). This restriction on study size was chosen to make the review more manageable in terms of screening and analysis and avoid inclusion of numerous small early phase mechanistic studies of varying methodological quality. The cut-off for this inclusion was chosen to ensure studies provided adequately powered estimates of association between treatment and outcomes. It is possible that some useful trials could have been excluded, although many relevant trials were still available for inclusion.

Across all included trials, adverse events were poorly defined and probably varied across studies. For instance, many studies referred to syncope as an outcome, but did not say what type of syncopal event this might have included. A conservative approach to inclusion of outcomes was taken when possible, and only those explicitly stating the outcome of interest were included. For example, trials reporting hypotension or acute kidney injury were included, but those reporting hypotension or dizziness or renal impairment were excluded. Despite this approach, some studies were included that did not specify the thresholds used to define hypotension or acute kidney injury. This could have resulted in some relevant data for certain outcomes being missed, but this meant those that were included were likely to be sufficiently similar to enable pooling in a meta-analysis. Although the quality of adverse event ascertainment is likely to have varied between trials, it would not be expected to vary between treatment arms within trials. Thus it is unlikely that differences in the quality of adverse event ascertainment would have affected the relative treatment effects presented in this review.

### Sacubitril and valsartan [^114jtKcP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypotension

Sacubitril and valsartan lowers blood pressure and may cause symptomatic hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), are at greater risk. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of sacubitril and valsartan or start at a lower dose. If hypotension occurs, consider dose adjustment of diuretics, concomitant antihypertensive drugs, and treatment of other causes of hypotension (e.g., hypovolemia). If hypotension persists despite such measures, reduce the dosage or temporarily discontinue sacubitril and valsartan. Permanent discontinuation of therapy is usually not required.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), decreases in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with sacubitril and valsartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In patients whose renal function depends upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. Closely monitor serum creatinine, and down-titrate or interrupt sacubitril and valsartan in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As with all drugs that affect the RAAS, sacubitril and valsartan may increase blood urea and serum creatinine levels in patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis. In patients with renal artery stenosis, monitor renal function.

5.5 Hyperkalemia

Through its actions on the RAAS, hyperkalemia may occur with sacubitril and valsartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately, especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia such as severe renal impairment, diabetes, hypoaldosteronism, or a high potassium diet. Dosage reduction or interruption of sacubitril and valsartan may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### Combined blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduced all-cause but not cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients: a mediation analysis and systematic review [^117JhJbo]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Full blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is believed to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic kidney disease. In non-dialysis patients, combined RAAS blockade with two different RAAS blockers causes more adverse events without improving survival, but its role in maintenance dialysis patients is still unclear. We conducted a systematic review and mediation analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of combined RAAS blockade in dialysis patients.

Methods

Comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library database to June 2017 to identify relevant studies. Studies comparing combined with single RAAS blockade and reporting all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hypotension or hyperkalemia in dialysis patients were included. Effect sizes were calculated with randomized effects model and summarized as odd ratios (OR).

Results

A total of 9 studies with 13,050 dialysis patients were included. Compared with single blockade, combined blockade significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.93, p = 0.01), while cardiovascular mortality remained unchanged (0.85, 0.45–1.59, p = 0.61). Combined blockade tended to increase odd of hypotension but not odd of hyperkalemia (1.54, 1.00–2.38, p = 0.05; 0.89, 0.76–1.05, p = 0.17). Further mediation analysis indicated that hypotension might exert a suppression effect on the survival benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus angiotensin receptor blocker treatment on cardiovascular mortality.

Conclusions

Combined RAAS blockade might be a promising treatment in dialysis patients to further reduce mortality if blood pressure was well controlled.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

HFrEF — kidney function changes during therapy and dose adjustment triggers: During initiation and titration of agents that affect kidney function, a decrease in eGFR of > 30% or development of hyperkalemia should alert clinicians that a dose reduction may be necessary; short-term, transient eGFR changes during intense diuretic therapy or initiation of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitor do not predict longer-term adverse outcomes nor necessitate dose reduction; in hypovolemia, the dose of diuretic agents should be reduced, and the ARNI dose may also need to be reduced in kidney insufficiency or hypotension; although trial experience is lacking for those with < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², consensus has developed around continuing SGLT inhibitors even below this eGFR threshold.

ACE inhibitors/ARBs and aldosterone blockade — "ACE inhibitors should be used (unless contraindicated) in women after MI and in those with clinical evidence of heart failure, LVEF ≤ 40%, or diabetes mellitus (Class I; Level of Evidence A)", and "In women after MI and in those with clinical evidence of heart failure, an LVEF ≤ 40%, or diabetes mellitus who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, ARBs should be used instead (Class I; Level of Evidence B)". The guideline notes, "ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy and ought to be used with caution in women who may become pregnant". For select post–MI patients, "Use of aldosterone blockade (e.g., spironolactone) after MI is indicated in women who do not have significant hypotension, renal dysfunction, or hyperkalemia who are already receiving therapeutic doses of an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker and have LVEF ≤ 40% with symptomatic heart failure (Class I; Level of Evidence B)".

### A standardized framework for risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in observational healthcare databases [^116fUBSg]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Overview

The proposed framework defines 5 distinct steps: (1) definition of the research aim; (2) identification of the databases within which the analyses will be performed; (3) prediction of outcomes of interest; (4) estimation of absolute and relative treatment effects within risk strata; (5) presentation of the results. We developed an open-source R-package for the implementation of the proposed framework and made it publicly available. An overview of the entire framework can be found in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Framework overview.

Illustration of the framework's application on two observational databases, preferably mapped to OMOP-CDM.

As a demonstration, we evaluated treatment effect heterogeneity of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics compared to ACE inhibitors using acute MI risk quarter-specific effect estimates, both on the relative and on the absolute scale. We focused on three efficacy outcomes (acute MI, hospitalization with heart failure, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) and nine safety outcomes (acute renal failure, kidney disease, cough, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, hypotension, and angioedema). We used data from three US-based claims databases.

Step 1: General definition of the research aim

We considered the following research aim: "compare the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics to the effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with established hypertension with respect to 12 outcomes ". The required cohorts are:
Treatment cohort: Patients receiving any drug within the class of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics with at least one year of follow-up before treatment initiation and a recorded hypertension diagnosis within that year.
Comparator cohort: Patients receiving any drug within the ACE inhibitor class with at least one year of follow-up before treatment initiation and a recorded hypertension diagnosis within that year.
Outcome cohorts: We considered three efficacy and nine safety outcome cohorts. These were patients in the database with a diagnosis of: acute MI; hospitalization with heart failure; ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (efficacy outcomes); acute renal failure; kidney disease; cough; hyperkalemia; hypokalemia; gastrointestinal bleeding; hyponatremia; hypotension; angioedema (safety outcomes).

All cohort definitions were identical to the ones used in the multinational LEGEND-HTN study. More information can be found in the Supplementary Results (Sections A and B) and Supplementary Tables 1–19.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^1166E1WJ]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

MR blockers, including the new agent esaxerenone, have antihypertensive activity and organ protective effects. However, a careful approach to therapy and proper management of serum potassium is required to ensure safe clinical use of these agents. This includes awareness of at-risk patient groups, choosing appropriate dosages for therapy initiation and dosage titration, and monitoring of serum potassium during therapy. It is important that physicians take these important factors into consideration to optimize MR blocker therapy in patients with hypertension.

### The safety of eplerenone in hemodialysis patients: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^115uJD67]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, but the safety of these drugs in patients receiving dialysis is unclear. This study evaluated whether hyperkalemia and/or hypotension limited the use of eplerenone, a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, in hemodialysis patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a randomized controlled trial of prevalent patients receiving hemodialysis at five Canadian centers. Participants were randomly allocated to 13 weeks of eplerenone titrated to 50 mg daily (n = 77) or a matching placebo (n = 77). The primary outcome was permanent discontinuation of the drug because of hyperkalemia or hypotension. Secondary outcomes included hyperkalemia, hypotension, and cardiovascular events.

Results

Seventy-five eplerenone-treated patients and 71 placebo-treated patients were included in the per protocol population. The primary outcome occurred in three patients (4.0%) in the eplerenone group and two (2.8%) in the placebo group, for an absolute risk difference of 1.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -4.7 to 7.1 percentage points). Eplerenone was interpreted as noninferior to placebo with respect to the primary outcome (i.e., a discontinuation rate for these reasons > 10% was excluded). In the eplerenone group, nine patients (11.7%) developed hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.5 mEq/L), compared with two patients (2.6%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 20.2). There was no significant effect on predialysis or postdialysis BP.

Conclusion

Eplerenone increased the risk of hyperkalemia but did not result in an excess need to permanently discontinue the drug. Further trials are required to determine whether mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving long-term dialysis.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^114uuScR]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings

In patients with hyperkalemia and impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic.

The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment.

Note: There is no conclusive evidence that potassium supplements lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

### Time to benefit for stroke reduction after blood pressure treatment in older adults: a meta-analysis [^1175d9xJ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Individualizing hypertension treatment decisions

Our results can help inform and individualize hypertension treatment discussions. There is overwhelming evidence that improved blood pressure control can significantly reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. For most older adults, the benefit of avoiding stroke and subsequent permanent disability is of paramount importance. Since these older adults place great value in avoiding stroke, they may focus on a relatively small ARR (i.e. ARR = 0.002) as clinically significant and choose to initiate or continue hypertension treatment as long as their life expectancy is > 0.9 years. In contrast, other older adults with a preexisting fear of falling may feel that the risks of hypotension and falls are substantial. They may focus on larger ARRs for stroke (i.e. ARR = 0.01) instead, and choose to initiate or continue hypertension treatment as long as their life expectancy is > 3.0 years. By presenting a spectrum of times to benefit across a range of ARRs, our study can inform treatment discussions for older adults prioritizing avoiding stroke as well as for older adults prioritizing avoiding hypotension and falls.

Hypertension treatment decisions need to be informed by benefits and harms beyond stroke prevention and falls. Hypertension treatment benefits beyond stroke include decreased all‐cause mortality and decreased major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure and myocardial infarction, and decreased incidence of cognitive impairment. Hypertension treatment harms beyond hypotension, syncope, and falls include hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury, which are usually reversible. For older adults with substantial frailty or comorbidities, contextual factors such as polypharmacy may also be important considerations. Thus, individualized hypertension treatment decisions should account for the benefits beyond stroke prevention as well as for the risks beyond falls and fractures.

Renin–angiotensin system blockade combinations in type 2 diabetes, CKD and high cardiovascular risk — The combined use of renin-angiotensin system blockers such as an ACEI plus ARB or ARB plus renin inhibitor has failed to show a benefit on nephropathy progression and is associated with increased risk of side effects. In ALTITUDE, a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 8,561 participants adding aliskiren or placebo to RAS-blocking therapy, the trial was stopped early after the second interim analysis when no differences in the primary end point was noted despite lower blood pressure and greater albuminuria reduction in the aliskiren group, and those randomly assigned to aliskiren experienced higher rates of hyperkalemia and hypotension than the placebo group. The VA-NEPHRON-D study of combined ACEi/ARB therapy was also recently stopped by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Evolving therapeutic strategies for patients hospitalized with new or worsening heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction [^116gLTQC]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several practical considerations are worth noting for deployment of these lifesaving therapies in clinical practice. Although hypotension remains source of clinical hesitancy, MRA and SGLT2i have had virtually no important impact on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in clinical trials among those with lower baseline BP. Although ARNI introduction is associated with more significant hypotension and orthostasis, it is usually tolerable and safe with appropriate patient education. Evidence‐based β‐blockers without α adrenergic effects may also be prioritized to augment tolerance of other agents. The risk of incident hyperkalemia may be managed by transitioning from ACEI/ARB to ARNI and initiation of SGLT2i, which both have been shown to reduce hyperkalemia risks. Introduction of potassium binders may further augment tolerance of RAAS inhibitors, a strategy being investigated in the REALIZE‐K (NCT04676646) and LIFT (NCT05004363) trials, and recently shown to be effective in DIAMOND (NCT03888066). CKD constitutes an important comorbidity for those facing worsening HF; however, evidence and labeling have supported use of therapies such as the SGLT2i down to eGFR 20 ml/minute/1.73 m². The safety and efficacy of SGLT2i in hemodialysis populations is being in the RENAL LIFECYCLE and EMPA‐HD (NCT05179668) trials.

### Novel therapeutics for the treatment of hypertension and its associated complications: peptide-and nonpeptide-based strategies [^114hZUNY]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is responsible for maintaining blood pressure and vascular tone. Modulation of the RAAS, therefore, interferes with essential cellular processes and leads to high blood pressure, oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. Consequently, these conditions cause fatal cardiovascular and renal complications. Thus, the primary purpose of hypertension treatment is to diminish or inhibit overactivated RAAS. Currently available RAAS inhibitors have proven effective in reducing blood pressure; however, beyond hypertension, they have failed to treat end-target organ injury. In addition, RAAS inhibitors have some intolerable adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia and hypotension. These gaps in the available treatment for hypertension require further investigation of the development of safe and effective therapies. Current research is focused on the combination of existing and novel treatments that neutralize the angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor-mediated action of the angiotensin II peptide. Preclinical studies of peptide- and nonpeptide-based therapeutic agents demonstrate their conspicuous impact on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in animal models. In this review, we will discuss novel therapeutic agents being developed as RAAS inhibitors that show prominent effects in both preclinical and clinical studies. In addition, we will also highlight the need for improvement in the efficacy of existing drugs in the absence of new prominent antihypertensive drugs.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ypRXH]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115Gkirr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized PROBE trial, we found that low-dose spironolactone did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome of death, hospitalization for CVD or new cardiovascular events compared to usual care among a community cohort of people (mean age = 74.8 years) with moderate CKD and a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity. We also found no reduction in risk in any component of the composite outcome nor in our prespecified subgroups of participants with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In the within-trial economic analysis, spironolactone was not effective compared to usual care. Although difficulties with recruitment left the study underpowered, based on the anticipated effect size, this is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. The conditional power calculation suggests that there is an 11.8% probability that a statistically significant result would have been found if the trial had reached its recruited target and the observed event rate remained constant with the participants who were recruited. Spironolactone appeared to be poorly tolerated among the study population, and only a third of participants continued on treatment beyond 6 months post-randomization. Participants randomized to spironolactone did have a small but statistically significant greater deterioration in eGFR across follow-up. These participants were also more likely to have hyperkalemia and hypotension. Our results suggest that spironolactone should not be used in people with CKD without another specific indication, such as heart failure.

Hypertension management options and adverse effects in older adults: although pharmacologic versus nonpharmacologic treatments were not specifically addressed, several nonpharmacologic strategies are available, including lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, the DASH diet, and increased physical activity, and ideally they are included as the first therapy or used concurrently with drug therapy; effective pharmacologic options include thiazide-type diuretics (adverse effects include electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal discomfort, rashes and other allergic reactions, sexual dysfunction in men, photosensitivity reactions, and orthostatic hypotension), ACEIs (adverse effects include cough and hyperkalemia), ARBs (adverse effects include dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia), calcium-channel blockers (adverse effects include dizziness, headache, edema, and constipation), and β-blockers (adverse effects include fatigue and sexual dysfunction).

Tolerability and Safety According to Age Category

The occurrence of prespecified laboratory safety measures and hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg) according to age group are shown in Table 4. Older patients were more likely to have hypotension than younger patients, but there was no notable age gradient in the predefined laboratory safety measures. Patients randomized to finerenone were more likely to experience hypotension and hyperkalemia than those assigned to placebo, but less likely to experience hypokalemia. These between-treatment differences did not vary across age categories.

Further exploratory analyses of these safety outcomes in the oldest patients showed a similar pattern.

### Hyperkalemia and blood pressure regulation [^116BHWeV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is common in the general population. Management of hypertensive patients at risk of hyperkalemia is challenging due to potential life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrest. Chronic hyperkalemia is often associated with impaired renal ability to excrete excessive potassium ions (K+). This may refer to chronic kidney disease or certain pharmacological interventions, including broadly used renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and calcineurin inhibitors. Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms permitting kidney adaptations to hyperkalemia is critical for choosing therapeutic strategies. Valuable insights were obtained from the analysis of familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) syndrome, which became a classic model for coincidence of high blood pressure and hyperkalemia. FHHt can be caused by mutations in several genes, all of them resulting in excessive activity of with-no-lysine kinases (WNKs) in the distal nephron of the kidney. WNKs have been increasingly recognized as key signalling enzymes in the regulation of renal sodium ions (Na+) and K+ handling, enabling adaptive responses to systemic shifts of potassium homoeostasis consequent to variations in dietary potassium intake or disease. The WNK signalling pathway recruits a complex protein network mediating catalytic and non-catalytic effects of distinct WNK isoforms on relevant Na+- or K+-transporting proteins. In this review article, we summarize recent progress in understanding WNK signalling. An update of available models for renal adaptation to hyperkalemic conditions is presented. Consequences for blood pressure regulation are discussed. Pharmacological targeting of WNKs or their substrates offers promising options to manage hypertension while preventing hyperkalemia.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive adverse effects and clinical considerations for older adults: Some of the adverse effects associated with antihypertensive medications include (but are not limited to) the following — thiazide-type diuretics: electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal discomfort, rashes and other allergic reactions, sexual dysfunction in men, photosensitivity reactions, and orthostatic hypotension; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): cough and hyperkalemia; angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs): dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia; calcium-channel blockers: dizziness, headache, edema, and constipation; and β-blockers: fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Accurate measurement of BP is important before initiating treatment for hypertension, some patients may have elevated BP in clinical settings, and ambulatory measurement may be appropriate; clinicians should consider treatment with nonpharmacologic options, including weight loss, dietary changes, and an increase in physical activity, initially or concurrently with pharmacologic treatment; clinicians should consider treatment burden and drug interactions when deciding on treatment options; when selecting pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should prescribe generic drugs where available; and evidence for adults who are frail or with low overall risk without multimorbidity is limited.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### Is there a new dawn for selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism? [^116r83k2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor contribute to resistant hypertension and cardiovascular mortality, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists effectively reduce these complications. Their use is limited in certain populations with a higher risk of hyperkalemia or renal dysfunction. This review will highlight recent developments in extra-renal mineralocorticoid receptor research and the development of novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Recent Findings

Tissue-specific knockout-out models provide definitive evidence that the vascular mineralocorticoid receptor directly contributes to hypertension and vascular remodeling, independent of renal effects. Several nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are in preclinical development or early-stage clinical trials. Several nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have demonstrated preserved cardiovascular benefit with a reduced incidence of hyperkalemia in preclinical studies.

Summary

Novel, potent nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are in development, although their effect on cardiovascular and adverse drug events requires further investigation.

c Per protocol set

d Contraindication

Thus, MR blockers have an important role in the management of hypertension, particularly in patients who cannot achieve adequate blood pressure reduction. Hyperkalemia is, however, recognized as a potential side effect during treatment with MR blockers. Publication of data from the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study showed that spironolactone reduced mortality by 30% compared with the mortality rate associated with placebo in patients with severe heart failure already receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. As a consequence, a marked increase in the prescription of spironolactone was observed in Canada; however, this increase was associated with an increase in hyperkalemia-related hospitalizations and deaths. Regarding esaxerenone, during the phase III clinical studies conducted in Japan, blood potassium increased was the most common side effect (occurring in 4.1% of patients). As such, concerns about the occurrence of hyperkalemia during therapy are growing, but there is a lack of understanding and guidance about the appropriate management of hyperkalemia during antihypertensive therapy with MR blockers, especially with the newer agent esaxerenone. Therefore, this article highlights risk factors for hyperkalemia and approaches for its prevention and management and summarizes currently available data for esaxerenone.

### Finerenone improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction irrespective of age: a prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF [^114r7hsW]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

The benefit of finerenone on the primary outcome was driven by a reduction in worsening HF events with no significant benefit on cardiovascular mortality. More importantly, we found that the benefit of finerenone, expressed as a relative risk reduction, was consistent across all age categories, with a greater absolute risk reduction in older patients. This highlights the potential risk-treatment paradox commonly identified in older patients who often have more to gain from therapies because of their higher baseline risk yet a lower probability of being prescribed such treatments.

An additional therapeutic objective in HF is to alleviate symptom burden, enhance physical function, and improve health-related quality of life, thereby improving the patient's overall health status. In the FINEARTS-HF trial, the increase in KCCQ-TSS was greater with finerenone compared with placebo, with a consistent increase observed across all age groups, including in the oldest patients. The mean overall increase in KCCQ-TSS was relatively small, but this may reflect generally mild symptoms of patients at baseline (69% NYHA functional class II), and the improvement in KCCQ-TSS was similar to that seen in other trials of pharmacotherapy for HFmrEF/HFpEF. –

The analysis of tolerability and safety was also favorable in the context of the aforementioned benefits of finerenone. For example, the proportion of patients ≥ 80 years exceeding a serum creatinine threshold of ≥ 3.0 mg/dL was 1.8% in the finerenone group versus 0.7% in the placebo group.

Additionally, while hypotension and hyperkalemia occurred more frequently with finerenone compared with placebo, across all age groups, there was no significant interaction between age and the effect of treatment on these measures. Kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension are often particular concerns in elderly patients and lead to reluctance to initiate treatment (or discontinuation of treatment). Indeed, several recent trials have shown a markedly lower use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in older compared with younger patients, for example, in the VICTORIA trial, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were used in 81% of patients < 65 years versus 56% of patients ≥ 75 years. –

Many other studies have demonstrated lower usage of a range of guideline-recommended therapies in older patients with cardiovascular disease relative to younger patients, raising concerns about ageism in prescribing. – Hopefully, the present findings are reassuring for the management of a growing and particularly high-risk population, which is often undertreated with effective therapies.

### Finerenone according to frailty in heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF randomized clinical trial [^112N6Rgj]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

In keeping with findings from prior trials in HFmrEF and HFpEF, the benefit of finerenone on clinical outcomes was mainly driven by a reduction in worsening HF events in FINEARTS-HF. However, the finding that frailty status did not modify the beneficial effect of finerenone on worsening HF events is of great importance in frail individuals given the role of hospital admission in accelerating frailty.

Improvement of health status is a key goal of the management of patients with HF, and this is all the more important in patients with a greater degree of frailty, who have a much greater symptom burden and worse physical function and quality of life than individuals without frailty, as evidenced by the extremely low baseline mean KCCQ scores in the frailest patients. In FINEARTS-HF, the improvements in symptoms, physical function, and quality of life (as assessed by the change in KCCQ scores from baseline to 12 months) with finerenone, compared with placebo, were not modified by frailty status. These findings are important because symptom control, maintenance of physical function, and continuation of daily activities may help prevent or slow the development of frailty and progression of existing frailty in these individuals.

Kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension are often particular concerns in frail individuals and may lead to reluctance to initiate treatment (or discontinuation of treatment). As expected, patients with greater frailty were more likely to experience an increase in creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and hypokalemia, but they were less likely to experience hypotension. While these adverse events (except hypokalemia) occurred more frequently with finerenone compared with placebo, reassuringly there was no significant interaction between frailty status and the effect of treatment on these events.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in CKD [^116UzEA7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) use in CKD with diabetes — Recommendation 3.2.3: "We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with high BP, CKD, and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B)". For implementation, the work group notes it is "necessary to prescribe the highest tolerated, approved dose of ACEI or ARB therapy", and KDIGO "recommends monitoring for changes in serum creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation and escalation of therapy and discontinuing therapy if the creatinine increases by more than 30%", and also "recommends considering reduction or discontinuation of therapy in those with symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, and uremic symptoms". Additionally, "most patients with CKD require triple antihypertensive therapy with an ACEI or ARB in addition to a CCB and diuretic, as a single pill combination or as individual pills".

### Severe bradycardia from severe hyperkalemia: patient characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hemodynamic support [^113k3uAr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Bradycardia is an under-studied manifestation of hyperkalemia potentially associated with adverse outcomes. We sought to systematically describe emergency department (ED) patients that present with severe bradycardia (heart rate < 50) associated with severe hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 6.0 mEQ/L) and identify factors associated with the receipt of hemodynamic support.

Methods

Retrospective, single-center, case series performed at an urban, tertiary-care hospital from 1/1/2014 to 6/30/2020. We included consecutive adult ED patients presenting simultaneously with severe bradycardia and severe hyperkalemia. Patients with prehospital cardiac arrest, hemolyzed potassium specimens, or only point-of-care lab results were excluded. Detailed information, including chronic medications, electrocardiogram (ECG) features, and potassium/heart rate-directed treatments, was abstracted from the ED medical record. Intensive care utilization and in-hospital outcomes were also recorded. Factors associated with receipt of bradycardia-targeted treatment in the ED were determined with univariate comparisons.

Results

We screened 319 records and included 87 patients [mean age 72.5 (95% CI 53–92), 55% female, median heart rate 43 (38–47) beats/min, mean potassium 7.1 (95% CI 5.6–8.7) mEQ/L]. Cardiovascular (hypertension 82%, congestive heart failure 28%) and renal (dialysis dependence 30%) comorbidities were common. Many patients were prescribed negative chronotropic agents (84%) or potassium-retaining (52%) chronic medications. Common presenting scenarios were missed hemodialysis, isolated acute renal failure, or acute renal failure in the setting of concomitant critical illness. ECG revealed: junctional rhythm (39%), peaked T waves (27%), and QRS prolongation (30%). Twenty-eight (32%) patients exhibited hypotension and 34 (40%) altered mentation. Thirty-three (38%) patients received hemodynamic support, including 12 (14%) requiring temporary cardiac pacing. Forty-two (48%) patients received emergent renal replacement therapy and 57 (66%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital mortality was 10%. Factors associated with receipt of hemodynamic-targeted treatment included a lack of dialysis dependence, junctional rhythm, and concomitant presentation with hypothermia, acidemia, or sepsis.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with severe bradycardia represent a unique phenotype of ED patients with hyperkalemia that may require significant resuscitation and critical care resources. Further research on the treatment of this uncommon, but potentially life-threatening condition is needed.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^116osiB2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone, are recommended by hypertension and heart failure clinical guidelines 1, 2, 3, 4 owing to their capacity to lower blood pressure and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality in large randomized, placebo‐controlled trials. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, MRAs may induce hyperkalaemia, and fear of hyperkalaemia likely limits their use.

Randomized controlled trials of MRAs report rates of hyperkalaemia that may not reflect the heterogeneous reality of clinical practice. 10 'Real‐world' observational studies show suboptimal MRA use, dose titration and poor clinical follow‐up 11, 12, 13 that may increase hyperkalaemia risk. Current management of hyperkalaemia is most often centred on eliminating modifiable causes, e.g. lowering dietary potassium (K +) intake, and/or discontinuing or lowering the dose of hyperkalaemia‐inducing medications. 14 Some of these measures involve therapeutic compromises, in that the cessation of MRAs deprives patients of their beneficial cardiovascular effects. Understanding the extent of this practice and identifying patients at risk of MRA discontinuation is clinically important. However, rates of MRA discontinuation after hyperkalaemia in real‐world settings have been poorly quantified. 15, 16

Studies with broader coverage, such as those derived from healthcare records, may be relevant to inform clinical practice. We constructed a large, contemporary and region‐representative cohort of unselected new users of MRA (i) to estimate the 1‐year incidence and clinical predictors of hyperkalaemia, and (ii) to describe changes in drug utilization patterns (e.g. MRA discontinuation, switching, or dose adjustment) thereafter.

### Consequences of recurrent hyperkalemia on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality [^115iYFre]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the potentially fatal consequences, determining the risk of severe clinical outcomes associated with HK recurrence in patients with CKD — especially those with additional cardiorenal risk — is important so that appropriate management strategies can be implemented. To this end, the present study investigated the clinical impact of HK recurrence in CKD by comparing mortality (primary endpoint) and CV outcomes (secondary endpoint) between patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD diagnosed with HK and those with normokalemia, and in substudies of patients with HF, hypertension, RAASi use, and proteinuria.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker initiation — refractory heart failure (HF): treatment with either type of drug should not be initiated in patients who have systolic blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg or who have signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, and patients should not be started on a beta-blocker if they have significant fluid retention or if they recently required treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Treatment with an ACEI or beta-blocker should be initiated in very low doses, and patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of intolerance, and clinical trials suggest that even low doses may provide important benefits. For patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs or beta-blockers, a combination of nitrates and hydralazine has been reported to have favorable effects on survival in mild to moderate symptoms not taking an ACEI or beta-blocker. Spironolactone has been reported to prolong life and reduce HF hospitalization in advanced disease, but the evidence was derived in patients with preserved renal function, and the drug can produce dangerous hyperkalemia in impaired renal function. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently considered as alternatives to ACEIs because of the low incidence of cough and angioedema, it is not clear that ARBs are as effective as ACEIs, and they are as likely as ACEIs to produce hypotension or renal insufficiency.

### Synergistic bradycardia from beta blockers, hyperkalemia, and renal failure [^111mxJ4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bradycardia is a common vital sign encountered in the emergency department. These patients are often hemodynamically stable and require no emergent intervention. On occasion, bradycardia can cause hemodynamic instability, and there are established treatment pathways involving atropine, ionotropic and vasopressive infusions, and eventual mechanical pacing, if necessary. However, these pathways fail to account for the many and varied causes of bradycardia and their treatment.

Case Report

A 24-year-old man presented to our emergency department with syncope caused by symptomatic bradycardia. This was caused by a largely unrecognized synergistic bradycardia resulting from renal failure, AV nodal blocker use, and hyperkalemia. Our patient's worsening renal failure caused accumulation of both potassium and beta blocker, which resulted in bradycardia and hypotension, in turn worsening renal failure secondary to poor renal perfusion and potentiating his hyperkalemia and beta blocker toxicity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? There is a growing number of cases that suggest this is an underrecognized synergistic and potentially lethal mechanism of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and the treatment falls outside of typical algorithms for handling bradycardia. Understanding the multiple causes of these patients' hemodynamically unstable bradycardia allows for maximal medical management and can prevent unnecessary invasive management for these patients.

CHF in Patients With ESRD

It is estimated that up to 36% of all patients with ESRD have CHF at the initiation of dialysis 76 — 12 to 36 times higher than the rate in the general population. 9 Another 25% of patients on dialysis develop de novo CHF with an incidence of 7% per year. 77 The underlying causes of CHF in patients with ESRD at the initiation of dialysis are similar to those in the general population including advancing age, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease. 9, 77 More specific to CKD, toxins from the uremic milieu may affect myocardial contractility and function, 7 and anemia secondary to CKD is associated with a higher incidence of CHF in this population. 76 Chronic volume overload and poorly controlled hypertension are also major risk factors for CHF in patients with CKD and ESRD. Therefore, it is important to control hypertension and volume status through diuresis and dialysis to reduce the risk of incident CHF.

Management of CHF in Patients With CKD

Medical treatment of CHF in patients with advanced CKD is similar to patients without renal disease. A meta‐analysis of 8 studies conducted in patients with CKD (stages 3–5) and CHF showed that beta blocker therapy lowered all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality with an increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension. 78 Nevertheless, there is a paucity of data regarding beta blocker therapy in patients with ESRD on dialysis. The clinical use of ACE inhibitors in this population is also variable, perhaps due to the potential adverse effects on renal function in patients with advanced CKD who are not yet on RRT. ACE inhibition, however, has been shown to be effective at preventing progression of CKD in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 20 mL/min. 79 A drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate of > 25% or development of hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mmol/L) is an indication for discontinuing therapy. 79

### Aliskiren [^111URBmd]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hypotension

Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with aliskiren tablets in patients with marked volume depletion, patients with salt depletion, or with combined use of aliskiren and other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of aliskiren tablets, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.

A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

5.5 Impaired
Renal Function

Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with aliskiren tablets. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAAS. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or patients receiving ARB, ACEI or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), therapy may be at particular risk for developing acute renal failure on aliskiren tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function.

5.6 Hyperkalemia

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren tablets. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.3)], NSAIDs, or potassium supplements or potassium sparing diuretics.

5.7 Cyclosporine
or Itraconazole

When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

8 HYPERKALEMIA MANAGEMENT: FOCUS ON NEW TREATMENTS

The treatment of chronic hyperkalemia can be difficult and may be life‐threatening if left untreated. Potassium binders such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate is mainly used in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. This substance is only suitable for short‐term treatment since its use is associated with hypernatremia, volume overload and gastrointestinal complications. A suggested management of chronic hyperkalemia in HF patients is presented in Figure 1. However, their use is associated with adverse effects, their efficacy is ascertain and their effects are transient. In this regard, the introduction of patiromer, acting at the level of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular in the colon lumen, is relevant, 20, 21, 23, 24 may decrease serum potassium levels and enable treatment with RAASi and MRAs in significantly higher doses. Patiromer for oral suspension is a non‐absorbed, sodium‐free potassium binding polymer that exchanges calcium for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract. Patiromer beads are insoluble, have an average particle size of ≈100 μm and so are too large to be absorbed, excreted ≈24 to 48 h after intake and bind potassium predominantly in the lumen of the colon and this increases fecal potassium excretion, reducing levels of free potassium. 20, 21, 23, 24 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by patiromer in large clinical trials was in the range 0.45 to 1 mmol/L. 52

Zirconium cyclosilicate (SCZ, former ZS‐9) — an inorganic cation that allows a thermodynamically favorable catching of potassium ions‐ represent another significant pharmacologic advancements in the treatment of hyperkalemia. More specifically SCZ is an oral, nonabsorbed, high‐capacity cation‐binding compound that selectively exchanges K + for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract and has rapid onset of action. A single treatment with SCZ may reduce serum K + levels at 1 h after the initial dose, results in a continued and sustained reduction in serum K + levels for up to 48 h after the initial dose and has a favorable safety profile. 53 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by SCZ in large clinical trials was in the range 0.3 to 1.1 mmol/L. 52

### Hyperkalemia | AAFP… [^111ysrgx]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Causes of Hyperkalemia The first step in the evaluation of a patient with elevated serum potassium is to exclude spurious potassium elevation. HYPERKALEMIA CAUSED BY DECREASED EXCRETION OF POTASSIUM Effective excretion of potassium is dependent on aldosterone and sufficient distal delivery of sodium and water within the nephron. Hyperkalemia may occur when one of these mechanisms is impaired because of renal failure, renal hypoperfusion, or hypoaldosteronism. Hypoaldosteronism may be the cause of hyperkalemia in patients who do not have advanced renal failure or hypoperfusion. 11 Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a syndrome associated with type IV renal tubular acidosis, may be part of the mechanism behind hyperkalemia in patients with mild renal failure, particularly diabetic nephropathy.

Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism can cause patients who have diabetic nephropathy to develop acute elevations of potassium because of medications or stress.
12. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY The possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in all patients with hyperkalemia. Clinical suspicion is increased by the presence of hyponatremia and muscular weakness. 17 Primary adrenal insufficiency is best screened for with a standard cosyntropin-stimulation test, 18 in which 0. 25 mg of synthetic cosyntropin is given as an intravenous bolus. Plasma cortisol is measured 45 to 60 minutes later, and values less than 20 mcg per dL suggest adrenal insufficiency.
19. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism should be considered in patients with diabetes and hyperkalemia, who generally have a low serum aldosterone.

A trial of oral fludrocortisone is generally the most practical way to empirically establish this diagnosis; if the patient has hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, potassium levels will return to normal in a day or two after initiation of fludrocortisone. The principal side effects are hypertension and f luid retention, which may respond to an added diuretic. Although the question of appropriate treatment duration with f ludrocortisone has never been studied, one approach to management would be to slowly taper f ludrocortisone on an outpatient basis, and reinstate f ludrocortisone if potassium rises.

### Parathyroid disorders… [^1112D9qf]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Initial Approach to Calcium Abnormalities Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. 1, 2, 4–6 Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a paraneoplastic syndrome mediated by PTH-related peptide, should be considered in patients with low PTH levels, rapid onset of symptoms, and other signs and symptoms of malignancy. It is most often associated with squamous cell carcinoma and solid tumors of the lung, breast, esophagus, skin, cervix, and kidney. 4 Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of hypocalcemia.
5. Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia should be managed acutely with intravenous fluids, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, denosumab, or dialysis.

6 Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, which can present acutely with carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures, and a prolonged QT interval, should be managed with intravenous calcium gluconate while the cause is being determined.
12. Hyperparathyroidism PRIMARY Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common condition and the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism and mild hypercalcemia. 1, 13 In primary hyperparathyroidism, calcium levels are usually elevated without appropriate suppression of PTH levels, which can be normal or high. 13 However, in normocalcemic cases, calcium levels can be normal with elevated PTH levels, which may be encountered incidentally when screening for bone and renal disorders. In nations with readily accessible laboratory services, primary hyperparathyroidism is most often identified in asymptomatic individuals as an incidental finding of hypercalcemia on routine laboratory testing.

All patients should be encouraged to maintain adequate hydration to reduce the risk of nephrolithiasis, maintain adequate physical activity to minimize bone resorption, and avoid medications that increase hypercalcemia. Maintaining adequate dietary calcium intake and vitamin D intake to keep 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at 20 or 30 ng per mL or higher helps avoid further increases in PTH level.
