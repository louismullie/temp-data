## Question

what does cerebellar ataxia cause?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what cerebellar ataxia causes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and cardinal motor manifestations. Then, I should verify ocular motor signs and whether ataxia truly occurs in isolation. Next, I will examine progression and neurodegeneration in genetic cerebellar ataxias and their impact on survival. After that, I should review non-motor complications, including sleep, cognition, mood, and autonomic features. I will then consider disease-specific systemic consequences such as ataxia-telangiectasia, CANVAS, and treatable deficiency-related ataxias. Finally, I need to assess functional and quality-of-life impact and synthesize a coherent, hierarchical view of consequences, while double-checking for any errors and correcting them as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and primary motor consequences: cerebellar ataxia is incoordination and imbalance due to cerebellar dysfunction, leading to gait ataxia with a wide-based, unsteady pattern, truncal instability, dysmetria with kinetic tremor, dysdiadochokinesis, and slurred, poorly coordinated speech, which aligns with the canonical picture of limb and axial incoordination; I initially wrote "Lim ataxia", but wait, that's a typo — I should say limb ataxia, and I should also be precise that not all gait ataxia is cerebellar because peripheral sensory loss can mimic it, so a careful neurological exam helps distinguish sensory from cerebellar etiologies [^116Mzd92] [^116C5UWB].

> Next, I should review cerebellar ocular motor signs; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ataxia rarely occurs in isolation, and cerebellar involvement typically brings abnormal eye movements such as nystagmus, saccadic pursuit, and hypo- or hypermetric saccades, which support the diagnosis in conjunction with dysarthria and dysmetria, so I need to ensure I include that the ocular system is commonly involved and that these signs co-occur with the core ataxic features rather than being incidental [^116Mzd92] [^116C5UWB].

> I will now examine progression and neurodegeneration in hereditary cerebellar ataxias; SCAs are progressive neurodegenerative disorders with degeneration of the cerebellum and connected regions like brainstem and spinal tracts, and disease severity progression strongly predicts mortality, with each standard deviation increase in SARA associated with roughly 1.19–1.30-fold higher death risk across SCA1/2/3/6, so I should double-check that I'm attributing premature death to progression rather than age alone, and yes, natural-history and cohort data support progression as the key driver of disability and survival [^112w9s82] [^113hBBmy] [^116ne2mR] [^111G3yjM].

> Let me consider non-motor neurological complications, because I need to ensure I'm not missing the broader cerebellar syndrome; sleep dysfunction is common in cerebellar ataxia cohorts and correlates with disease severity, with high prevalences of RLS and REM behavior disorder, and poor sleep mediating worse mood symptoms, while cognition often shows a cerebellar cognitive affective profile with executive, linguistic, and visuospatial deficits on systematic review, and I should also verify autonomic dysfunction where indicated — particularly MSA-C, which features severe dysautonomia and rapid progression, distinguishing it from more benign sporadic ataxias; sensory deficits and pyramidal signs can accompany cerebellar features in sporadic adult-onset ataxia, so I need to check for these accompanying signs during evaluation [^115TxEpC] [^115SVMc1] [^113KZ3fj] [^1136KYbC].

> But wait, what if the etiology confers systemic consequences beyond the nervous system; ataxia-telangiectasia is a prime example with immunodeficiency, telangiectasias, respiratory decline, high malignancy risk, and radiosensitivity, requiring multidisciplinary care, whereas CANVAS combines cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia due to biallelic RFC1 expansions, and I should not forget treatable causes: vitamin E deficiency, CoQ10 deficiency, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, gluten-related ataxia, and other immune-mediated forms, where early recognition can alter the disease course — so I should emphasize targeted testing when clinical clues suggest a modifiable condition [^116VTK9p] [^113hDhAq] [^112XvKq1] [^112kZvFT] [^116GrQhV].

> I need to check the functional and social impact to avoid understating the burden; progressive ataxia leads to loss of independence in daily activities, worsening speech and gait, and reduced quality of life that is compounded by sleep and mood disturbances, and the rate of decline is heterogeneous across SCA subtypes with SARA worsening fastest in SCA1 and slowest in SCA6, which has implications for prognosis, care planning, and trial readiness, so I should double-check those progression rates before concluding, and yes, meta-analytic data and longitudinal cohorts support those subtype differences [^115TxEpC] [^114N9m7G] [^116ne2mR].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis captures the hierarchy of consequences: primarily, cerebellar ataxia causes motor incoordination and balance deficits with ocular and speech involvement; secondarily, many forms are progressive neurodegenerations that lead to accumulating disability and increased mortality risk; tertiarily, patients experience sleep, cognitive, psychiatric, autonomic, sensory, and pyramidal complications; and quaternarily, specific etiologies add systemic features and markedly reduce quality of life, with heterogeneity by genotype and by acquired vs hereditary causes, and this framework underscores two clinical imperatives — rule out acquired and treatable etiologies early, and provide multidisciplinary symptomatic therapy including targeted rehabilitation — so I should confirm that structured exercise and balance training are recommended adjuncts, and emerging trials suggest feasibility of home-based regimens though disease-modifying drugs remain limited at present [^112kZvFT] [^115pMecf] [^1158CKWF] [^116ne2mR].

## Motor symptoms

The **primary motor symptoms** of cerebellar ataxia include:

- **Gait ataxia**: Unsteady, wide-based gait with frequent falls and difficulty maintaining balance [^116ne2mR] [^111gCwvB].

- **Limb ataxia**: Incoordination of limb movements, dysmetria, and intention tremor [^116C5UWB] [^116Mzd92].

- **Dysarthria**: Slurred, scanning speech due to impaired coordination of speech muscles [^116ne2mR] [^116C5UWB].

- **Nystagmus**: Involuntary eye movements, often accompanied by impaired smooth pursuit and saccadic abnormalities [^116Mzd92] [^116ne2mR].

- **Hypotonia**: Reduced muscle tone, leading to flaccidity and difficulty maintaining posture [^116C5UWB].

## Progression and severity

The **progression and severity** of cerebellar ataxia vary by underlying cause. Genetic ataxias are **progressive neurodegenerative disorders** [^112w9s82] [^113cbZEM] that often lead to **severe disability and premature death** [^113hBBmy] [^114N9m7G]. In contrast, **acquired ataxias** show variable progression depending on the underlying cause and treatment response [^117GbDiU] [^112kZvFT].

### The genetics of ataxia: Through the labyrinth of the Minotaur, looking for Ariadne's thread [^116Mzd92]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The 'cerebellar ataxias' (CAs) comprise a wide spectrum of neurological disorders, with ataxia as the main symptom. Ataxia is defined as imbalance and incoordination, such as gait ataxia and truncal ataxia, or dysmetria and incoordination of a limb while performing a task, known as limb ataxia. Gait ataxia is usually secondary to a dysfunction or lesion of the cerebellum or its connections, although patients can also experience gait ataxia from peripheral sensory impairment. A neurological examination usually provides an accurate distinction between these two forms. Moreover, CA is typically accompanied by other signs of cerebellar dysfunction, including abnormal eye movements (hypometric or hypermetric saccades, saccadic pursuits), various types of nystagmus, dysarthria, dysmetria (with kinetic tremor), and dysdiadochokinesis.

Once acquired conditions leading to CA are ruled out, making an accurate etiological diagnosis of ataxia may be a challenge given the overlap in phenotypes and the various presentations of CAs. Genetic ataxias are frequently chronic and, usually, progressive diseases. Very rarely, genetic ataxias may be episodic. In apparently sporadic late-onset cases, genetic ataxias can be difficult to discriminate from non-genetic forms, such as multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy with predominant CA, even though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help physicians reach the correct diagnosis. Reliable determination of the transmission mode may also contribute to proper classification and management.

### Spinocerebellar ataxia: an update [^112w9s82]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a subset of hereditary cerebellar ataxias that are autosomal dominantly transmitted. These are progressive neurodegenerative diseases that share the clinical features of ataxia, arising from the progressive degeneration of the cerebellum but also affecting other connected regions, including the brain stem. SCAs represent a highly heterogeneous group of disorders with a complex genotype–phenotype spectrum. Many SCAs are caused by CAG nucleotide repeat expansions that encode polyglutamine and involve the toxic polyglutamine protein (polyQ).

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have identified new genes implicated in SCAs, providing insights into disease transmission and pathogenesis. In this study, we discuss updates in epidemiology, clinical features, molecular mechanisms, and their potential implications for the future.

- **Mechanism of polyglutamine protein expansion repeats**:
	- Normal translation of polyglutamine repeat occurs within the normal repeat range, yielding normal protein transcript and protein folding.
	- Pathogenic polyglutamine expansion repeat length results in the translation of an expanded and abnormal polyQ repeat, causing protein misfolding. Misfolded polyQ proteins form aggregates, leading to dysfunctions in various cellular processes, culminating in cell toxicity and degeneration.

### Cardiovascular autonomic testing in the work-up of cerebellar ataxia: Insight from an observational single center study [^113KZ3fj]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of disorders of both genetic and non-genetic origin. Hereditary forms include a variety of entities with both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns, the most common being the spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2, 3, and 6, which are caused by a CAG triplet expansion in the respective loci. In several patients with adult-onset ataxia, a specific genetic cause cannot be found, suggesting a diagnosis of sporadic degenerative ataxia. In such context, the best characterized disease entity is represented by multiple system atrophy (MSA). MSA is a fatal progressive disorder featuring a variable combination of Parkinsonism, autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar, and pyramidal signs. It is classified as MSA-parkinsonian (MSA-P) if Parkinsonism prevails, or MSA-cerebellar (MSA-C) if cerebellar features predominate.

Sporadic adult-onset ataxias not being diagnosed as MSA-C are defined as SAOA (simply "sporadic adult-onset ataxia"). SAOA is a clinically defined entity since neuropathological studies are lacking. The essential difference between SAOA and MSA-C is the absence of severe autonomic failure in the first. In SAOA, cerebellar features may be accompanied by other neurological findings such as sensory deficits and pyramidal signs. While SAOA generally shows a benign disease course, MSA-C is a severe and rapidly progressive disorder, especially if overt dysautonomia develops early in the disease course. According to an earlier study, up to 25% of SAOA convert to MSA-C later on.

### Cognition in cerebellar disorders: What's in the profile? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SVMc1]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Our search in Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science provided a total of 8,173 articles, and five additional articles were identified through manual search. Of the initial 8,178 articles, 362 were eventually full-text screened, and 129 were included in this review ultimately. Details about the inclusion and exclusion of articles in this review are shown in the PRISMA flowchart in Fig. 1.

- **Study characteristics**: A total of 3,140 patients with cerebellar diseases from the 129 included articles were included in this review. The majority of patients (n = 2,252 from k = 91) had a degenerative cerebellar disorder. At least 990 patients had spinocerebellar ataxia, 387 patients had a recessive ataxia, and 193 patients had MSA-C (not all included papers specified the exact ataxia type, or types were taken together). A smaller proportion of all patients (n = 773 from k = 36) had isolated focal lesions (surgical, ischemic, or hemorrhagic) in the cerebellum. The remaining 115 patients came from four studies in which these etiologies were mixed. Two studies included mixed etiologies but reported outcomes separately for the focal and degenerative groups. The mean age of the patients ranged between 27.0 and 68.2 years for all studies, with an average of 49.9 years. The proportion of men ranged from 20 to 100%. Details regarding characteristics per study are provided in Supplementary Information 4. Most studies (k = 111) used control data of healthy participants (n = 2,644).

### Prediction of survival with long-term disease progression in most common spinocerebellar ataxia [^113hBBmy]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxias are rare, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases that lead to severe disability and premature death. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of disease progression, measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, on survival and to identify different profiles of disease progression and survival.

- **Methods**: Four hundred sixty-two spinocerebellar ataxia patients from the EUROSCA prospective cohort study, suffering from spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and who had at least two measurements of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score, were analyzed. Outcomes were change over time in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score and time to death. A joint model was used to analyze disease progression and survival.

- **Results**: Disease progression was the strongest predictor for death in all genotypes. An increase of 1 standard deviation in total Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score increased the risk of death by 1.28 times (95% confidence interval: 1.18–1.38) for patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1; 1.19 times (1.12–1.26) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; 1.30 times (1.19–1.42) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; and 1.26 times (1.11–1.43) for spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Three subgroups of disease progression and survival were identified for patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1: "severe" (n = 13; 12%), "intermediate" (n = 31; 29%), and "moderate" (n = 62; 58%). Patients in the severe group demonstrated the highest risk.

### The effects of sleep dysfunction on cognition, affect, and quality of life in individuals with cerebellar ataxia [^115TxEpC]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebellar ataxia comprises a group of debilitating diseases resulting from progressive cerebellar degeneration. Recent studies suggest that, like other neurodegenerative diseases, sleep impairments are common in cerebellar ataxia. In light of the role of sleep in mood regulation and cognition, we sought to assess interactions between sleep, cognition, and affect in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.

- **Methods**: A survey of 176 individuals with cerebellar ataxia was conducted. The battery of instruments included a modified International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Restless Leg Syndrome Questionnaire, REM Behavior Disorder Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and a Composite Cognitive Questionnaire.

- **Results**: Fifty-one percent of individuals indicated significant sleep disturbances on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 73% of participants had two or more symptoms of restless leg syndrome, and 88% had two or more symptoms of REM behavior disorder. Ataxia severity, based on the modified International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, predicted scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and REM Behavior Disorder Questionnaire. Median split analyses revealed that cognitive function appeared to be reduced and depressive symptoms were greater for those individuals with poor subjective sleep quality and severe RLS. Importantly, sleep appears to play a mediatory role between disease severity and depressive symptoms.

These results suggest that dist

### An overview of the patient with ataxia [^116C5UWB]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Ataxia, a neurological sign characterized by the incoordination of voluntary movements, is the most prominent manifestation of cerebellar disease. The cardinal features of cerebellar dysfunction involve disturbances of stance, gait, eye movements, muscle tone, skilled movements, and speech. Classification and differential diagnosis of ataxic syndromes have intrinsic complexity owing to the variability in phenotypic presentations and in etiologies, which include trauma, toxic and metabolic causes, neoplasms, immune mechanisms, and genetic diseases. Pure cerebellar symptoms are rarely observed, while the clinical picture of both genetic and sporadic ataxia syndromes is sometimes complicated by the presence of extracerebellar neurological or multisystem extraneural pathology. Clinical presentation and assessment of the patients, together with classification, genetic aspects, and principles in differential diagnosis of ataxias, are briefly reviewed.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated cerebellar ataxia [^113A4eTh]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebellar ataxia is a common neurological presentation and can be acute, subacute, or chronic. Neurological complications of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are well-recognized and manifest in various forms. Acute cerebellar ataxia is a rare, yet established complication, and has been noted as the sole manifestation of EBV infection, presenting without the systemic features of infectious mononucleosis. Although the pathophysiology remains unclear, the illness may persist for several months with generally benign outcomes, though serious complications can occur. We present a case of a 38-year-old man who developed acute cerebellar ataxia due to EBV infection, along with a review of the literature.

### Diagnostic approach to childhood-onset cerebellar atrophy: A 10-year retrospective study of 300 patients [^113y6Foz]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Hereditary ataxias associated with cerebellar atrophy represent a heterogeneous group of disorders. The selection of appropriate clinical and genetic tests for patients with cerebellar atrophy poses a diagnostic challenge. Neuroimaging serves as a crucial initial investigation in the diagnostic evaluation of ataxia in childhood, with the presence of cerebellar atrophy guiding further investigations. We conducted a detailed review of 300 patients with confirmed cerebellar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging over a 10-year period. A diagnosis was established in 47% of patients: mitochondrial disorders were the most common, followed by neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, ataxia telangiectasia, and late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis. We review the common causes of cerebellar atrophy in childhood and propose a diagnostic approach based on correlating specific neuroimaging patterns with clinical and genetic diagnoses.

### Natural history and epidemiology of the spinocerebellar ataxias: Insights from the first description to nowadays [^111G3yjM]. Journal of the neurological sciences (2020). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant inherited diseases characterized by the degeneration of the cerebellum and its connections. We performed a detailed description of the natural history of the main SCAs, focusing on epidemiology, progression, haplotype analysis and its correlation with the founder effect, and future treatment perspectives. References for this review were identified through an in-depth literature search on PubMed, selected based on their relevance to the topic and the authors' judgment.

More than 40 SCAs have been described so far. SCA3 is the most common subtype worldwide, followed by SCA2 and SCA6. To evaluate the natural history and estimate the progression of the main SCAs, consortiums were created globally. Clinical rating scales have been developed to precisely estimate cerebellar clinical deficits, evaluating both cerebellar and non-cerebellar signs.

Natural history studies revealed that SCA1 patients' functional status worsened significantly faster than in other SCA subtypes, followed by SCA3, SCA2, SCA6, and SCA10. The number of CAG repeats, age of onset, and ataxia severity at baseline are strong contributors to the risk of death in most SCAs.

Understanding the natural history of SCAs is critically important. Although these are rare diseases, the impact on affected individuals is enormous. Advances in the field of genetics are aiding in the understanding of neuronal functions and dysfunctions and facilitating the study and development of possible therapies.

### Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias: Translating genes to therapies [^112wCaLq]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The cerebellum plays a critical role in the integration of sensory input and motor output to generate smooth and coordinated movement. Damage to the cerebellum leads to cerebellar ataxia, which is an impairment of balance and coordination despite normal muscular strength. An extensive and diverse array of causes can lead to this condition; however, approximately half are due to Mendelian genetic etiologies stemming from an ever-expanding catalog of causative mutations involving nearly 600 genes and 1,000 phenotypes. Over 200 of these genes result in more than 600 phenotypes associated with autosomal recessive inheritance (see Supplemental Material).

As this number has grown, individual recessive disorders were initially categorized under the heading of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs). More recently, the term spinocerebellar ataxias, recessive (SCARs) has been used partly, primarily in the diagnostic laboratory setting. However, in clinical practice, this can lead to confusion with the dominant cerebellar ataxias, commonly designated as the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Ultimately, all these nomenclature systems have their respective drawbacks, and direct use of the gene name, rather than a separate numbering system, appears to be the most informative and least confusing approach, which we adopt here.

Although individually these disorders are rare, genetic cerebellar ataxia as a whole is not, with an estimated 6 to 13 per 100,000 persons affected worldwide, both adults and children. Up to 1.0 million persons may be affected globally, a number that is likely an underestimate.

### Integrative network and brain expression analysis reveals mechanistic modules in ataxia [^112WsEdu]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Genetic cerebellar ataxias are a group of disabling disorders characterized by progressive incoordination of movement due to dysfunction and degeneration of the cerebellum. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has greatly advanced the identification of genes involved in ataxia. However, despite the increasing number of genes identified, treatment attempts are still limited to alleviating symptoms and do not target the underlying biological mechanisms. The development of effective therapies is hindered by enormous genetic heterogeneity, the rarity of some subtypes, and limited knowledge of the biological processes where ataxia genes exert their function.

Identifying shared biological modules between genes mutated in ataxia (hereafter referred to as ataxia genes) could provide a basis for therapeutic strategies applicable to larger cohorts of ataxia patients, despite their heterogeneous genotypic backgrounds. In recent years, efforts have been made to identify common denominators of genetic ataxias. A number of ataxia genes have been found to share interaction partners at the protein level and to be involved in processes such as RNA splicing, regulation of transcription, and the cell cycle. When impaired in animal models, these processes lead to neurodegeneration, suggesting that these shared biological pathways are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the cerebellum and its connections. Nevertheless, previous studies primarily focused on protein networks among specific ataxia genes and subtypes, with only a few probing the influence of these networks.

### Treatable causes of cerebellar ataxia [^112kZvFT]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The cerebellar ataxia syndromes are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by cerebellar dysfunction. Initial assessment of patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia is complex due to the extensive list of potential diagnoses. A detailed history and comprehensive examination are necessary for accurate diagnosis and hierarchical diagnostic investigations. Although no cure exists for most of these conditions, a small group of metabolic, hereditary, inflammatory, and immune-mediated etiologies of cerebellar ataxia are amenable to disease-modifying, targeted therapies.

Over the past years, disease-specific treatments have emerged. Clinicians must become familiar with these disorders because maximal therapeutic benefit is achievable only with early intervention. In this article, we review disorders where cerebellar ataxia is a prominent clinical feature requiring targeted treatments, along with specific management recommendations.

### Home training for cerebellar ataxias: A randomized clinical trial [^1158CKWF]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines advise balance training for cerebellar ataxia, but little is known regarding high-intensity aerobic exercise. The objective of this study was to compare home high-intensity aerobic training to home balance training on improvements of ataxia symptoms using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).

This assessor-masked randomized clinical trial was conducted between January 1, 2021, and September 1, 2024, through home training, with in-person assessments at a single ataxia care center in a large urban US city. Individuals with various cerebellar ataxia types were eligible for inclusion. Data analysis was performed from November 2024 to February 2025.

- **Interventions**: Individuals in the aerobic group trained for 30 minutes per session, 5 times per week, at up to 85% predicted maximum heart rate. Individuals in the balance group performed 30 minutes of balance exercises of varying difficulty 5 times per week. Participants were given study support through biweekly phone calls for only the first 6 months of this 12-month study.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the SARA score to measure ataxia symptoms (range, 0–40 points, with higher scores indicating more ataxia). Secondary outcomes included the number of adverse events, training adherence, balance measures, gait speed, quality of life, fatigue, and fitness levels (assessed via V̇o2max). Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6, 9, and 12 months.

A total of 114 individuals with various cerebellar ataxia types were approached, with 52 individuals declining participation. Further results and conclusions would typically be included here, but this excerpt ends before detailed results are provided.

### Clinical and genetic analyses of a Swedish patient series diagnosed with ataxia [^111Zpfj6]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Hereditary ataxia is a heterogeneous group of complex neurological disorders. Next-generation sequencing methods have become a great help in clinical diagnostics, but it may remain challenging to determine if a genetic variant is the cause of the patient's disease. We compiled a consecutive single-center series of 87 patients from 76 families with progressive ataxia of known or unknown etiology. We investigated them clinically and genetically using whole exome or whole genome sequencing. Test methods were selected depending on family history, clinical phenotype, and availability. Genetic results were interpreted based on the American College of Medical Genetics criteria. For high-suspicion variants of uncertain significance, renewed bioinformatical and clinical evaluation was performed to assess the level of pathogenicity.

Thirty (39.5%) of the 76 families had received a genetic diagnosis at the end of our study. We present the predominant etiologies of hereditary ataxia in a Swedish patient series. In two families, we established a clinical diagnosis, although the genetic variant was classified as "of uncertain significance" only, and in an additional three families, results are pending. We found a pathogenic variant in one family, but we suspect that it does not explain the complete clinical picture.

We conclude that correctly interpreting genetic variants in complex neurogenetic diseases requires genetics and clinical expertise. The neurologist's careful phenotyping remains essential to confirm or reject a diagnosis, also by reassessing clinical findings following a candidate gene is identified.

### The mutant Moonwalker TRPC3 channel links calcium signaling to lipid metabolism in the developing cerebellum [^1129muX5]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Cerebellar ataxia defines a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders that affect the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent connections, manifesting primarily as progressive gait and limb incoordination. The inherited forms of cerebellar ataxia encompass a growing list of genetically diverse disorders, with more than 35 genetic loci known to cause the autosomal dominant ataxias alone, which are also referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Despite this genetic heterogeneity, common pathological mechanisms that may be shared among the different forms of cerebellar ataxia are beginning to emerge. Notably, disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and signaling in Purkinje cells has been proposed as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of SCAs.

The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPC3 is a non-selective cation channel that is highly expressed in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. TRPC3 is required for metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1)-dependent synaptic transmission in Purkinje cells. Both genetic loss of Trpc3 and the dominant Moonwalker (Mwk) gain-of-function point mutation in Trpc3 result in cerebellar ataxia in the mouse, highlighting the importance of Purkinje cell calcium homeostasis for proper cerebellar function. Recently, we have identified the first functionally pathogenic variant (R672H) in the human TRPC3 gene in a patient with adult-onset cerebellar ataxia. The human R672H mutation likely acts through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism similar to the Mwk mutation.

### Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias: Translating genes to therapies [^112PrTSj]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) represent over 200 clinically heterogeneous genetic conditions involving degeneration of the cerebellum and associated tracts, resulting in impairment of balance and coordination. Advancements in genomic testing have enabled rapid identification of the majority of known recessive disorders, shifting research focus to the development of targeted mechanistic treatments addressing underlying physiological pathways. Molecular classification allows for the recognition of cellular, biochemical, and genetic targets for the development of high-effect precision therapies.

ARCAs represent a significant global health burden, necessitating the establishment of a robust pathway for novel therapeutic discovery through the modification of disease pathogenesis mechanisms and subsequent clinical trial development.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia: Recommendations for multidisciplinary treatment [^116VTK9p]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare, neurodegenerative, and multisystem disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, progressive respiratory failure, and an increased risk of malignancies. It demands specialized care tailored to the individual patient's needs. Besides the classic ataxia-telangiectasia phenotype, a variant phenotype exists with partly overlapping but some distinctive disease characteristics. This guideline summarizes frequently encountered medical problems in the disease course of patients with classic and variant ataxia-telangiectasia, in the domains of neurology, immunology and infectious diseases, pulmonology, anaesthetic and perioperative risk, oncology, endocrinology, and nutrition. Furthermore, it provides a practical guide with evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the follow-up and treatment of all these different clinical topics.

### Clinical trials for cerebellar ataxia [^115pR8cK]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

This month's journal club explored three recent trials in cerebellar ataxia, with two negative and one positive outcome. These papers reveal lessons for future trials in cerebellar ataxia, including considerations such as population (single ataxia vs. a diverse range) and the establishment of baseline features. Factors like the intensity and quality of physical and speech therapy emerge as relevant considerations while pursuing potential disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) in cerebellar ataxia.

### Structural and functional MRI abnormalities of cerebellar cortex and nuclei in SCA3, SCA6 and Friedreich's ataxia [^115C97fJ]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and Friedreich's ataxia are common hereditary ataxias. Different patterns of atrophy of the cerebellar cortex are well known; however, data on cerebellar nuclei are sparse. Although cerebellar nuclei have long been thought to be preserved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, histology shows marked atrophy of the nuclei in Friedreich's ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

In the present study, susceptibility-weighted imaging was used to assess atrophy of the cerebellar nuclei in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (n = 12, age range 41–76 years, five female), Friedreich's ataxia (n = 12, age range 21–55 years, seven female), spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (n = 10, age range 34–67 years, three female), and age- and gender-matched controls (total n = 23, age range 22–75 years, 10 female). T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were used to calculate the volume of the cerebellum.

In addition, ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed with optimized normalization methods to assess the function of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei during simple hand movements. As expected, the volume of the cerebellum was markedly reduced in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, preserved in Friedreich's ataxia, and mildly reduced in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The volume of the cerebellar nuclei was reduced in the three patient groups compared to matched controls (P-values < 0.05; two-sample t-tests). Atrophy of the cerebellar nuclei was most pronounced in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. On a functional level, hand-movement testing revealed further insights into the effects of atrophy in these conditions.

### Acute ataxia in childhood [^111vCap1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Acute childhood ataxia is a common cause of presentation to the pediatric emergency room or child neurologist. The primary concern during the initial assessment is to exclude serious causes of this clinical syndrome, such as central nervous system infections and mass lesions, while recognizing the essentially benign nature of acute ataxia in most children.

Childhood ataxia can be diagnostically approached by considering the temporal course and the presence or absence of associated neurologic abnormalities. In all forms of childhood ataxia, the outcome is largely determined by etiology. This review describes the various causes and syndromes of acute ataxia in childhood, with a discussion of diagnostic considerations and an approach to investigation, treatment, and prognosis.

### Spinocerebellar ataxias: Prospects and challenges for therapy development [^1144FFqr]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise more than 40 autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorders that present principally with progressive ataxia. Within the past few years, studies of pathogenic mechanisms in the SCAs have led to the development of promising therapeutic strategies, especially for SCAs caused by polyglutamine-coding CAG repeats. Nucleotide-based gene-silencing approaches that target the first steps in the pathogenic cascade are one promising approach not only for polyglutamine SCAs but also for the many other SCAs caused by toxic mutant proteins or RNA. For these and other emerging therapeutic strategies, well-coordinated preparation is needed for fruitful clinical trials.

To accomplish this goal, investigators from the United States and Europe are now collaborating to share data from their respective SCA cohorts. Increased knowledge of the natural history of SCAs, including the premanifest and early symptomatic stages of disease, will improve the prospects for success in clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs. In addition, investigators are seeking validated clinical outcome measures that demonstrate responsiveness to changes in SCA populations. Findings suggest that MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers will provide objective biological readouts of disease activity and progression, but more work is needed to establish disease-specific biomarkers that track target engagement in therapeutic trials. Together, these efforts suggest that the development of successful therapies for one or more SCAs is not far away.

### Exome sequencing in undiagnosed inherited and sporadic ataxias [^111k2ZuC]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

The inherited ataxias are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, presenting at any age, and usually without features pointing to a specific molecular diagnosis. Defining the genetic aetiology is important because clinically similar disorders can have different recurrence risks, and in some instances, there are treatment implications.

The first step in investigating patients is the exclusion of structural, toxic, and inflammatory disorders. Following this, testing for the more common trinucleotide repeat neurometabolic disorders provides a diagnosis in up to approximately 60% of familial cases. After excluding the more common genetic causes, over 40 different loci are implicated. Subsequent investigation usually proceeds on a gene-by-gene basis, which takes considerable time and is expensive. Many patients do not receive a genetic diagnosis for many years, if at all, limiting genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.

Targeted next-generation sequencing panels have been shown to increase the diagnostic yield in suspected inherited ataxia, particularly in those with adolescent onset and a family history. However, after excluding common forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), the overall detection rate remains less than 20% in routine clinical practice. This may be due to the limited portfolio of genes included on custom-designed platforms, but the clinical overlap of different neurogenetic syndromes presents a further challenge. In some patients, ataxia may develop in conjunction with spastic paraplegia or a neuropathy, and the initial clinical presentation may mislead the clinician.

### Conventional MRI findings in hereditary degenerative ataxias: A pictorial review [^1112FSNT]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Cerebellar ataxias are a large group of disorders characterized by various clinical presentations, ranging from the presence of a pure cerebellar phenotype to a heterogeneous combination of cerebellar signs along with extra-cerebellar symptoms. Although still very challenging, different workflows have been proposed to help clinicians in identifying the cause of the clinical presentation and reach a proper diagnosis. In all cases, the in vivo evaluation of brain parenchyma via MRI plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic assessment of cerebellar ataxias. It is mandatory to exclude that the observed cerebellar involvement could be due to structural damage secondary to non-degenerative conditions (e.g. stroke, neoplasm, metabolic, or toxic disorders).

Once these possible causes are ruled out in determining the cerebellar symptoms, the diagnosis is usually researched in the wide range of hereditary or sporadic ataxias, which are all usually characterized only by the presence of non-specific and sometimes overlapping imaging findings, with cerebellar atrophy being the least common denominator. Nevertheless, although challenging, a proper evaluation of imaging data and the integration of the patient's clinical history could allow the neuroradiologist to identify some conditions and exclude others, guiding the neurologist towards more appropriate genetic testing.

Given this background, we propose a review of the main clinical and conventional imaging findings of the most common hereditary degenerative ataxias to highlight the main features in these conditions.

### Hereditary ataxias: Overview [^116GrQhV]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary ataxias are highly heterogeneous disorders, phenotypically characterized by gait ataxia, incoordination of eye movements, speech, and hand movements, and usually associated with cerebellar atrophy. There are more than 35 autosomal dominant types, frequently termed spinocerebellar ataxia, typically with adult onset. The most common subtypes include spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, all nucleotide repeat expansion disorders.

Autosomal recessive ataxias often have childhood onset. The most prevalent subtypes are Friedreich's ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1, and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2. Four autosomal recessive types have dietary or biochemical treatments: ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Refsum's disease, and coenzyme Q10 deficiency. However, there are no specific treatments for other ataxias.

Diagnostic genetic testing is complex due to the large number of relatively uncommon subtypes and extensive phenotypic overlap. The most effective testing strategy involves assessing relative frequencies, ethnic predilections, and recognizing associated phenotypic features such as seizures, visual loss, or movement abnormalities.

### Molecular pathology of ataxia telangiectasia [^113hDhAq]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is one of a group of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias. Presentation usually occurs by the age of 2 years, and ataxia of both upper and lower limbs develops, such that by early teenage years, most patients require a wheelchair for mobility. Speech and eye movements are also affected. Other important features include t(7;14) translocations, immunodeficiency, high serum alpha fetoprotein concentration, growth retardation, telangiectasia — most noticeably on the bulbar conjunctiva — and a very high risk of developing a lymphoid tumour. Patients also show increased sensitivity to ionising radiation.

The classic form of A-T results from the presence of two truncating ATM mutations, leading to a total loss of the ATM protein, a protein kinase. Importantly, A-T exhibits clinical heterogeneity, including milder forms where neurological progression may be slower or of later onset. In these cases, there is a correlation between the preservation of neurological function, decreased radiosensitivity, and the degree of retained ATM protein kinase activity. Considerable scope remains for understanding the progress of the disorder in relation to the types of ATM mutation present.

### Exome sequencing in an SCA14 family demonstrates its utility in diagnosing heterogeneous diseases [^11223Kv7]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Genetic heterogeneity is common in many neurologic disorders, particularly for hereditary ataxias where at least 36 disease genes or loci have been described for spinocerebellar ataxia, and over 100 genes exist for neurologic disorders primarily presenting with ataxia. Traditional genetic testing of many candidate genes delays diagnosis and is costly. In contrast, recently developed genomic techniques, such as exome sequencing that targets only the coding portion of the genome, offer a faster alternative strategy to sequence all genes comprehensively. Here, we describe the use of exome sequencing to investigate a large, 5-generational British kindred with autosomal dominant, progressive cerebellar ataxia where conventional genetic testing had not revealed a causal etiology.

- **Methods**: Twenty family members were examined; two affected individuals were clinically investigated in detail without identifying a genetic or acquired cause. Exome sequencing was performed in one patient with comprehensive coverage across the known ataxia genes, excluding the known repeat loci which should be examined using conventional analysis.

- **Results**: A novel p. Arg26Gly change in the PRKCG gene, mutated in SCA14, was identified. This variant was confirmed using Sanger sequencing and showed segregation with disease in the entire family.

- **Conclusions**: This work demonstrates the utility of exome sequencing to rapidly screen heterogeneous genetic disorders such as ataxias. Exome sequencing is more comprehensive and faster.

### Exome sequencing and network analysis identifies shared mechanisms underlying spinocerebellar ataxia [^115EosnB]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias in genetic nomenclature, are a rare group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of balance and coordination. Despite the identification of numerous disease genes, a substantial number of cases still remain without a genetic diagnosis. Here, we report five novel spinocerebellar ataxia genes: FAT2, PLD3, KIF26B, EP300, and FAT1. These genes were identified through a combination of exome sequencing in genetically undiagnosed families and targeted resequencing of exome candidates in a cohort of singletons. We validated almost all genes genetically, assessed the damaging effects of the gene variants in cell models, and further consolidated a role for several of these genes in the etiology of spinocerebellar ataxia through network analysis. Our work links spinocerebellar ataxia to alterations in synaptic transmission and transcription regulation, identifying these as the main shared mechanisms underlying the genetically diverse spinocerebellar ataxia types.

### Frequency of rare recessive mutations in unexplained late onset cerebellar ataxia [^117VXVAo]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Sporadic late onset cerebellar ataxia is a well-described clinical presentation with a broad differential diagnosis that adult neurologists should be familiar with. However, despite extensive clinical investigations, an acquired cause is identified in only a minority of cases. Thereafter, an underlying genetic basis is often considered, even in those without a family history. Here we apply whole exome sequencing to a cohort of 12 patients with late onset cerebellar ataxia. We show that 33% of 'idiopathic' cases harbor compound heterozygous mutations in known ataxia genes, including genes not included on multi-gene panels or primarily associated with an ataxic presentation.

### Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias: Translating genes to therapies [^112zqaq2]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

A focus on molecular mechanisms as drug targets with potentially high-effect size opens a new perspective for translational ARCA research and allows for prioritization of research and treatment development on molecular pathways. In particular, attention is given to molecular themes that might be shared across several ARCAs. Clinical neurology has seen a rapid increase in the development of molecular therapies targeting the underlying genes or genetic mutations responsible for specific disorders, with clinically effective United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies already available that use antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, or gene replacement strategies.

- **Molecular disease themes for potential ARCA drug targets**: Targeted disease-modifying therapies for ARCAs follow a mechanistically inspired approach based on underlying genes, molecular mechanisms, and pathways. This section focuses on molecular disease themes in ARCAs that (1) recur in a number of distinct diseases (i.e. ≥ 2 ARCAs genotypes) and (2) where key ARCAs of each theme have potential molecular treatments that follow a mechanistically sound approach, are at least in pre-clinical stages, and/or would impact a large number of patients.

Although these criteria encompass the most clinically relevant disorders, not all well-established ARCAs (e.g. PNPLA6, POLR3A, SYNE1, SPTBN2, TWNK, VLDLR, etc) could be included; however, these are covered in detail elsewhere.

### Canvas: A late onset ataxia due to biallelic intronic AAGGG expansions [^112XvKq1]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The ataxias are a group of disorders that manifest with balance, movement, speech, and visual problems. They can arise due to dysfunction of the cerebellum, the vestibular system, and/or the sensory neurons. Genetic defects are a common cause of chronic ataxia; particularly common are repeat expansions in this group of conditions. The co-occurrence of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome has been termed CANVAS. Although CANVAS is a rare syndrome, upon discovery of biallelic expansions in the second intron of the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene, we and others have found the phenotype is broad, and RFC1 expansions are a common cause of late-onset progressive ataxia.

We aim to provide a review and update on recent developments in CANVAS and populations where the disorder has been reported. We have also optimized a protocol for RFC1 expansion screening, which is described herein, and expanded the phenotype after analyzing late-onset ataxia patients from around the world.

### Acquired ataxias: The clinical spectrum, diagnosis and management [^117GbDiU]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Acquired ataxias represent a large group of disorders defined by the common clinical feature of ataxia and the absence of a clear genetic basis for it. Based on the etiology, the group can be subdivided into autoimmune, toxic, infectious, and vitamin deficiency causes. Cerebellar ataxia may occur as an isolated syndrome in this spectrum of disorders but is often accompanied by additional neurological manifestations. Clinical work-up is challenging and mainly includes biochemical analyses, whereas imaging is of minor significance. Diagnosis is essential as many of these disorders represent potentially treatable conditions, and early therapy may prevent progressive cerebellar ataxia. The clinical findings and the implications for diagnosis and management of this heterogeneous group of disorders are discussed in this review.

### Frequency of rare recessive mutations in unexplained late onset cerebellar ataxia [^115xgWaF]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Unrelated individuals with sporadic ataxia beginning at 30 years of age or over were identified from routine referrals to our regional neurogenetic service in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Acquired causes of ataxia were excluded and all participants had negative genetic testing for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, DRPLA, and Friedreich's ataxia (FA). In addition, all adult males had negative FMR1 testing.

Blood genomic DNA was fragmented, exome enriched, and sequenced using Nextera Rapid Exome Capture 37 Mb with HiSeq 2000, 100 bp paired-end reads. In-house bioinformatic analysis included alignment to UCSC hg19, using BWA as the aligner and GATK to detect SNV and INDELs across all samples using standard filtering parameters according to GATK Best Practice Recommendations (see supplementary methods). Further analysis was performed on variants with a minor allele frequency < 0.005 in several reference databases and 302 unrelated in-house controls (see supplementary methods).

Rare heterozygous, homozygous, and compound heterozygous variants were defined, and protein-altering and/or putative 'disease-causing' mutations as predicted by at least three out of four software programs were included. Pathogenicity was defined in accordance with American College of Medical Genetics guidelines (see supplementary methods). Genes known or suggested to cause ataxia as a primary or secondary phenotype in humans from two suggested clinical panels, together with additional genes in which ataxia may result as part of the phenotype (list in supplementary methods), were assessed for variants.

### Exome sequencing: An efficient diagnostic tool for complex neurodegenerative disorders [^1129Voi2]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA) comprises a large and heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. We studied three families diagnosed with ARCA.

- **Methods**: To determine the gene lesions responsible for their disorders, we performed high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and exome sequencing.

- **Results**: We identified a new mutation in the SACS gene and a known mutation in SPG11. Notably, we also identified a homozygous variant in APOB, a gene previously associated with ataxia.

- **Conclusions**: These findings demonstrate that exome sequencing is an efficient and direct diagnostic tool for identifying the causes of complex and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases, even in early-stage disease or cases with limited clinical data.

### Natural history of most common spinocerebellar ataxia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114N9m7G]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are rare dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders that lead to severe disability and premature death. To better characterize the natural history of the most common SCAs — SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 — a meta-analysis of literature was performed to determine disease progression, provide data for sample size calculations for interventional trials, and study the impact of geographical locations and study follow-up on disease progression.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for longitudinal natural history studies of SCA patients was conducted. Studies using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) as an outcome measure were considered. A random-effect (RE) meta-analysis was applied to estimate pooled disease progression.

- **Results**: Six studies with 1,215 SCA patients enrolled between 2005 and 2016 were selected. The annual pooled SARA score increase was 1.83 (1.46–2.20) in patients with SCA1, 1.40 (1.19–1.61) in patients with SCA2, 1.41 (0.97–1.84) in patients with SCA3, and 0.81 (0.66–0.97) in patients with SCA6. For patients with SCA3, disease progression was faster in studies conducted in Asia and Europe than in the US. Two-arm interventional trials of 1-year duration, with an 80% power and α level of 5%, would require 92 patients per group with SCA1, 97 with SCA2, 115 with SCA3, and 430 with SCA6 to detect a 50% reduction in disease progression.

- **Conclusion**: This meta-analysis provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias.

### Clinical features and molecular genetics of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias [^113cbZEM]. The Lancet Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Among the hereditary ataxias, autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxias comprise a diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical phenotypes vary from predominantly cerebellar syndromes to sensorimotor neuropathy, ophthalmological disturbances, involuntary movements, seizures, cognitive dysfunction, skeletal anomalies, and cutaneous disorders, among others. Molecular pathogenesis also ranges from disorders of mitochondrial or cellular metabolism to impairments of DNA repair or RNA processing functions. Diagnosis can be improved by a systematic approach to the categorization of these disorders, which is used to direct further, more specific, biochemical, and genetic investigations. In this review, we discuss the clinical characteristics and molecular genetics of the more common autosomal recessive ataxias and provide a framework for assessment and differential diagnosis of patients with these disorders.

### Clinical trials for cerebellar ataxia [^115pMecf]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Cerebellar ataxias comprise a heterogeneous group of sporadic and inherited neurodegenerative diseases with both cerebellar and non-cerebellar features, including extrapyramidal weakness and reduced cognition. A number of pathogenic models have been proposed to explain these deficits, but no pharmacological disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are currently available. In this month's journal club, we explore three recent clinical trials that have focused on these disorders.

- **Riluzole in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2**: The first trial investigates riluzole in participants with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
- **Acetyl-leucine and cerebello-spinal stimulation**: The second and third trials explore acetyl-leucine and cerebello-spinal stimulation in a broader group of participants with varying causes of cerebellar ataxia.

### Clinical and genetic analyses of a Swedish patient series diagnosed with ataxia [^111gCwvB]. Journal of Neurology (2024).

Ataxia is a neurological sign characterized by incoordination of movements resulting from dysfunction of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent pathways. Based on the location of the underlying dysfunction, ataxias can be classified as cerebellar, sensory, and vestibular. The main manifestations of ataxia include gait impairment, limb incoordination, nystagmus, and slurred speech. Ataxia can be subdivided into sporadic, hereditary, and acquired forms. Monogenetic ataxias are chronically progressive neurological disorders that can be further categorized by their inheritance patterns and underlying genetic causes into autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs), autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs), X-linked cerebellar, and mitochondrial ataxias. The hereditary ataxias represent a large and heterogeneous group of diseases with variable genetic, clinical, pathogenic, pathophysiologic, and neuropathologic features.

Massively parallel sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS), is increasingly being used for clinical diagnostics and greatly facilitates the identification of the underlying genetic causes. However, the diagnostic yield of NGS for ataxia is between 12% and 52%, with approximately 30% of patients with clinical suspicion of ADCAs and 50% of ARCAs remaining undiagnosed. In recent years, the technical methodology to identify various types of genetic variants through NGS has dramatically improved, but it remains challenging to firmly decide if a detected genetic variant is indeed the cause of the examined patient's or family's disorder.

### Molecular pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxias [^114nkKv6]. Brain (2006). Low credibility.

The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. They are characterized by a loss of balance and motor coordination due to dysfunction of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent connections. Despite a well-described clinical and pathological phenotype, the molecular and cellular events underlying neurodegeneration remain poorly understood.

Compelling evidence suggests major etiological roles for interference with transcriptional regulation, protein aggregation and clearance, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and alterations in calcium homeostasis in the neuronal loss observed during the neurodegenerative process. Novel molecular routes that might be disrupted during disease progression are also being identified. These pathways could act independently or, more likely, interact and enhance each other, triggering the accumulation of cellular damage. This damage eventually leads to dysfunction and, ultimately, the demise of neurons through a series of multiple events.

Simultaneous targeting of several pathways might be therapeutically necessary to prevent neurodegeneration and preserve neuronal function. Understanding how dysregulation of these pathways mediates disease progression is leading to the establishment of effective therapeutic strategies in vivo, which may prove beneficial in the treatment of SCAs. Herein, we review the latest evidence for the proposed molecular processes contributing to the pathogenesis of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias.

### Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias: Translating genes to therapies [^115ee3ux]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

With improved genetic diagnosis of virtually all patients with mutations in known ARCA genes, the clinical focus now needs to be shifted to developing targeted therapies for these genetically stratified ARCA patients and making them clinical trial-ready. We have outlined a set of molecular themes for the organization of many common ARCAs, which implicate specific pathways for therapeutic treatment that are both achievable and effective.

The development of patient registries to enhance cohort building, in conjunction with longitudinal outcome validation using more sensitive metrics to capture changes in a patient-meaningful fashion, is needed to prepare and design future mechanistic clinical trials. In addition, given the rarity and complexity of these diseases and patient populations, the field must develop novel methodologies for innovative therapy approaches, outcome measures, and disease and trial modeling specifically tailored to small sample sizes. This represents a paradigm shift in neurology, with diagnostics serving as a gateway into the development of clinical trials, reflecting a more theragnostic view of genetic testing.

Although ARCAs had long been considered untreatable, these diseases are now increasingly lending themselves to becoming paradigmatic models for the general development of targeted, molecular precision therapies for rare neurological diseases due to their defined genetic and molecular etiology. Given the rarity of individual ARCAs — most of them contributing less than 2% of all cases — this provides a general blueprint for development.

### Inherited cerebellar ataxia in childhood: A pattern-recognition approach using brain MRI [^1137P8g4]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2013). Low credibility.

Ataxia is the principal symptom of many common neurologic diseases in childhood. Ataxias caused by dysfunction of the cerebellum occur in acute, intermittent, and progressive disorders. Most of the chronic progressive processes are secondary to degenerative and metabolic diseases. In addition, congenital malformation of the midbrain and hindbrain can also be present, with posterior fossa symptoms related to ataxia. Brain MR imaging is the most accurate imaging technique to investigate these patients, and imaging abnormalities include size, shape, and/or signal of the brain stem and/or cerebellum. Supratentorial and cord lesions are also common. This review will discuss a pattern-recognition approach to inherited cerebellar ataxia in childhood, providing a comprehensive discussion that ultimately could help neuroradiologists better manage this important topic in pediatric neurology.

### Multiple system atrophy: An update and emerging directions of biomarkers and clinical trials [^1136KYbC]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Multiple system atrophy is a rare, debilitating, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that manifests clinically as a diverse combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. It is pathologically characterized by oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions containing abnormally aggregated α-synuclein. According to the updated Movement Disorder Society diagnostic criteria for multiple system atrophy, the diagnosis of clinically established multiple system atrophy requires the manifestation of autonomic dysfunction in combination with poorly levodopa-responsive parkinsonism and/or cerebellar syndrome.

Although symptomatic management of multiple system atrophy can substantially improve quality of life, therapeutic benefits are often limited and ephemeral, failing to modify disease progression or eradicate underlying causes. Consequently, effective breakthrough treatments that target the causes of the disease are needed. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies are currently focusing on key hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases with the aim to slow or halt the progression of multiple system atrophy: pathological protein aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, aberrant proteostasis, neuronal inflammation, and neuronal cell death. Meanwhile, specific biomarkers and measurements with higher specificity and sensitivity are being developed for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy, particularly for early detection of the disease. More intriguingly, a growing number of new disease-modifying candidates are emerging, which can be used to design multi-targeted, personalized therapies.

### Spinocerebellar ataxia: an update [^1147h1HW]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative ataxic disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. We aim to provide an update on the recent clinical and scientific progress in SCA, where numerous novel genes have been identified using next-generation sequencing techniques. The main disease mechanisms of these SCAs include toxic RNA gain-of-function, mitochondrial dysfunction, channelopathies, autophagy, and transcription dysregulation. Recent studies have also demonstrated the importance of DNA repair pathways in modifying SCA with CAG expansions. In addition, we summarize the latest technological advances in detecting known and novel repeat expansions in SCA. Finally, we discuss the roles of antisense oligonucleotides and RNA-based therapy as potential treatments.

### Common mitochondrial DNA and POLG1 mutations are rare in the Chinese patients with adult-onset ataxia on Taiwan [^115vDv7C]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by adult-onset cerebellar ataxia. Many patients with clinically suspected SCA are eventually diagnosed with common SCA gene mutations. Previous reports suggest that some common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gene (POLG1) mutations might be additional underlying genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia. We investigated whether mtDNA point mutations A3243G, A8344G, T8993G, and T8993C, or POLG1 mutations W748S and A467T are present in patients with adult-onset ataxia who did not have common SCA mutations.

- **Methods**: Four hundred seventy-six unrelated patients with suspected SCA underwent genetic testing for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, and DRPLA gene mutations. After excluding these SCA mutations and patients with paternal transmission history, 265 patients were tested for mtDNA mutations A3243G, A8344G, T8993G, T8993C, and POLG1 W748S and A467T mutations.

- **Results**: No mtDNA A3243G, A8344G, T8993G, T8993C, or POLG1 W748S and A467T mutation was detected in any of the 265 ataxia patients, suggesting that the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the prevalence of these mitochondrial mutations in Chinese patients with adult-onset non-SCA ataxia is no higher than 1.1%.

- **Conclusions**: The mtDNA mutations A3243G, A8344G, T8993G, T8993C, or POLG1 W748S and A467T are very rare causes of adult-onset ataxia in Taiwan. Routine screening for these mutations in ataxia patients of Chinese origin is of limited clinical value.

### Mutations in MT-ATP6 are a frequent cause of adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia [^111572um]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Hereditary adult-onset ataxias are a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of movement disorders. They can be transmitted as autosomal-dominant, autosomal-recessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial traits. Autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by gait and limb ataxia, associated with dysarthria and abnormal eye movements in most patients. Additional signs and symptoms may comprise aberrant reflexes, seizures, dystonia, tremor, myoclonus, and cognitive impairment. Mutations have been described in various genes in SCAs. The types of mutations observed are repeat expansions, point mutations, deletions, and insertions in nuclear genes. No obvious genotype/phenotype correlations can be established in most cases. Exceptions include SCA7 characterized by ataxia concurring with retinopathy, and SCA34, which frequently presents with erythrokeratodermia in addition to ataxia.

Mutations of mitochondrial DNA frequently underlie ataxia-associated syndromes, even if ataxia is not the major sign. One of the genes affected, mitochondrial ATP synthase 6 (MT-ATP6), codes for ATP synthase subunit-α, which is a subunit of the F1F0 ATP-synthase complex responsible for mitochondrial energy production. MT-ATP6 mutations, including point mutations, deletions, and truncations, have also been described in adult-onset ataxia patients. The phenotype of ataxia caused by mutations in MT-ATP6 can frequently not be distinguished from ataxias caused by nuclear gene mutations. In other cases, however, ataxia is associated with various symptoms such as combin.

### Parkinsonism and ataxia [^113RRxLr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

Ataxia is not a common feature in Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, some rare forms of parkinsonism have ataxia as one of the main features in their clinical picture, especially those with juvenile or early-onset. On the other side, in cerebellar degenerative diseases, parkinsonism might accompany the typical symptoms and even become predominant in some cases. Many disorders involving different neurological systems present with a movement phenomenology reflecting the underlying pattern of pathological involvement, such as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, neurodegeneration associated with calcium deposition, and metabolic and mitochondrial disorders. The prototype of sporadic disorders that present with a constellation of symptoms due to the involvement of multiple central nervous system regions is multiple system atrophy, whose motor symptoms at onset can be cerebellar ataxia or parkinsonism.

Clinical syndromes encompassing both parkinsonian and cerebellar features might represent a diagnostic challenge for neurologists. Recognizing acquired and potentially treatable causes responsible for complex movement disorders is of paramount importance, since an early diagnosis is essential to prevent permanent consequences. The present review aims to provide a pragmatic overview of the most common diseases characterized by the coexistence of cerebellar and parkinsonism features and suggests a possible diagnostic approach for both inherited and sporadic disorders.

### Recent advances in hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias [^112wSNoG]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years, molecular genetic research has unraveled a major part of the genetic background of autosomal dominant and recessive spinocerebellar ataxias. These advances have also allowed insight into the pathophysiologic pathways assumed to be involved in these diseases. For the clinician, the expanding number of genes and genetic loci associated with these diseases and the enormous clinical heterogeneity of specific ataxia subtypes complicate management of ataxia patients. This review describes the clinical and neuropathologic features of the recently identified spinocerebellar ataxias and discusses the various molecular mechanisms demonstrated to be involved in these disorders.

### Primary episodic ataxias: Diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment [^113FYMCU]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

Primary episodic ataxias are autosomal dominant channelopathies that manifest as attacks of imbalance and incoordination. Mutations in two genes, KCNA1 and CACNA1A, cause the best-characterized forms and account for the majority of identified cases of episodic ataxia. We summarize knowledge of clinical and genetic diagnosis, genotype-phenotype correlations, pathophysiology, and treatment of episodic ataxia syndromes. We focus on unresolved issues including phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, lessons from animal models, and technological advancement. Additionally, we explore the rationale and feasibility of various treatment strategies and shared mechanisms underlying episodic ataxia and other far more prevalent paroxysmal conditions such as epilepsy and migraine.

### Childhood cerebellar ataxia [^114hqDa3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Childhood presentations of ataxia, an impairment of balance and coordination caused by damage to or dysfunction of the cerebellum, can often be challenging to diagnose. Presentations tend to be clinically heterogeneous, but key considerations may vary based on the child's age at onset, the course of illness, and subtle differences in phenotype. Systematic investigation is recommended for efficient diagnosis. In this review, we outline common etiologies and describe a comprehensive approach to the evaluation of both acquired and genetic cerebellar ataxia in children.

### Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias: Translating genes to therapies [^115zX1Qy]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This manuscript explores the translation of genetic discoveries into therapeutic interventions for autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias. The authors emphasize the significant role of recent advances in genomics and molecular biology in identifying potential therapeutic targets.

- **Definition and prevalence**: Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are a group of disorders characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum, leading to impaired coordination and balance. These disorders represent a significant proportion of hereditary ataxias, with varying prevalence across different populations.

- **Genetic findings**: Recent studies have identified numerous genes responsible for these conditions, providing a deeper understanding of their pathophysiology.

- **Therapeutic implications**: The identification of causative genes has enabled the development of targeted therapies. Strategies include gene therapy, RNA interference, and small molecule drugs aimed at modifying disease progression.

In conclusion, while challenges remain, ongoing research continues to advance our understanding and treatment of these debilitating disorders.

### Temporal dynamics of the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia in spinocerebellar ataxias [^116DTdoB]. Movement Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are progressive, neurodegenerative, and heterogeneous diseases that mainly affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. At the time of writing, at least 50 distinct genetic SCAs have been identified. The most common are SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6, which together affect more than half of all families with dominantly inherited ataxia and are due to translated CAG repeat expansions in the respective genes. With a global prevalence from 1 to 5 per 100,000, SCAs are rare. Temporal dynamics of onset and progression are different depending on the genetic subtype: SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 CAG repeat-expansion carriers typically develop ataxia in the fourth decade of life, whereas the onset of ataxia in SCA6 is about 20 years later. These diseases progressively affect the daily lives of participants, with increasing gait and speech difficulties; abnormal eye movements; and non-ataxia symptoms, such as spasticity and parkinsonism. The repeat-expansion SCAs lead to premature death, and there is no known cure at the time of writing, with only a few options of symptomatic treatment with modest effects. New therapies targeting the underlying pathology are currently in development.

In 2006, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was developed to assess the presence and severity of ataxia. SARA was validated for participants with SCA, translated into several languages, and validated in related diseases such as Friedreich ataxia. It is, at present, the reference scale for the clinical evaluation of ataxia. Most studies assessed the global progression of ataxia through this scale.

### The genetic nomenclature of recessive cerebellar ataxias [^111jGypy]. Movement Disorders (2018). High credibility.

The recessive cerebellar ataxias are a large group of degenerative and metabolic disorders, the diagnostic management of which is difficult due to the enormous clinical and genetic heterogeneity. **Classification systems**: Current systems provide insufficient guidance for clinicians and researchers, presenting several limitations. Here, we propose a new nomenclature for genetically confirmed recessive cerebellar ataxias according to the principles and criteria established by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Classification and Nomenclature of Genetic Movement Disorders.

- **Criteria and classification**: We apply stringent criteria for establishing an association between gene and phenotype. The newly proposed list of recessively inherited cerebellar ataxias includes 62 disorders, each assigned an ATX prefix followed by the gene name, as these typically present with ataxia as a predominant and/or consistent feature. An additional 30 disorders that often combine ataxia with another predominant or consistent movement disorder received a double prefix (e.g. ATX/HSP).

- **Identification of nonataxia phenotypes**: We identified a group of 89 entities that usually present with complex nonataxia phenotypes but may occasionally present with cerebellar ataxia. These are listed separately without the ATX prefix.

This new, transparent, and adaptable nomenclature of the recessive cerebellar ataxias will facilitate the clinical recognition of recessive ataxias, guide diagnostic testing in ataxia patients, and help in interpreting genetic findings. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder.

### Acute cerebellar ataxia following meningococcal group C conjugate vaccination [^1122rtfK]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute cerebellar ataxia is the most common cause of childhood ataxia, usually resulting from infections or vaccinations. Cases of acute cerebellar ataxia have been reported as a consequence of several viral and bacterial infections, as well as immunizing agents such as varicella, influenza, hepatitis B, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccines. Although immunization with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccines has been associated with several neurological side effects, acute cerebellar ataxia has not been previously reported.

The authors describe a case of a 12-year-old girl exhibiting acute cerebellar ataxia following meningococcal group C conjugate vaccination. In this patient, cerebellar symptoms began within 24 hours of vaccination, and infective causes were ruled out by serum and liquoral analyses. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were normal. Progressive clinical improvement was obtained after corticosteroid treatment. This case increases the small number of post-vaccinal ataxias and contributes to further clarifying the complex pathogenesis of this disorder.

### Movement disorders with neuronal antibodies: Syndromic approach, genetic parallels and pathophysiology [^115wRmpS]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic or paraneoplastic autoimmunity is an important etiology of cerebellar ataxia, where age, tempo of disease progression, and associated signs dictate the differential diagnosis. The most frequently identified autoimmune ataxia is associated with GAD antibodies and is often accompanied by other autoimmune disorders such as diabetes, thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, and vitiligo. It can present with a slowly progressive course or subacutely, with either isolated cerebellar signs or additional signs such as pyramidal tract involvement or features of stiff person syndrome. Often, there is up- or downbeat nystagmus. Episodes of brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction are a red flag, as they precede the chronic course in one-third of patients and enter the differential diagnosis of episodic ataxia type 2.

A similar phenotype, with early vertigo or ataxia episodes and concomitant autoimmunity, can also be seen in ataxia with coeliac disease or gluten-related ataxia, often with additional pyramidal signs or neuropathy. The pathophysiology and role of neuronal autoantibodies in this entity are unclear, but DPPX antibodies would clearly come into the differential diagnosis of ataxia and prolonged diarrhea.

A subacute onset of ataxia with progression over weeks to months and severe disability is often seen with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD). PCD associates with almost all of the classical onconeuronal antibodies. A pure cerebellar syndrome occurs classically in females with gynecological tumors and Yo antibodies, or in males with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

### Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome in children with acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia [^113E5xLz]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia is the most common cause of acute ataxia in childhood. One previous case study has suggested that cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome may be comorbid with acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia, but this was not confirmed by formal assessments.

- **Methods**: Children aged three to 15 years with a confirmed diagnosis of acute postinfectious cerebellar ataxia were invited to participate. Three patients were included and assessed by a pediatrician, neuropsychologist, and logopedist at the subacute stage (less than 14 days post-onset) and after six months and one year of follow-up.

- **Results**: All three children complied with the diagnostic criteria of cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. The cognitive and affective symptoms persisted longer than the motor symptoms. Child A (girl, aged three years and eight months) was most severely affected with slow progression of motor cerebellar symptoms; the cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms had not entirely remitted at one-year follow-up. Child B (boy, aged four years and four months) had more subtle motor cerebellar symptoms that swiftly remitted within the first week; the cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms were also more subtle. Child C (boy, aged seven years and eleven months) was considerably affected by motor cerebellar symptoms but showed marked improvement within the first month; the cerebellar cognitive affective symptoms had not entirely remitted at one-year follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Cognitive affective cerebellar syndrome may be an overlooked complication of acute post.

### Inherited ataxias in children [^115pSiBh]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to describe the diagnostic approach to inherited ataxias during childhood. With the expanding use and availability of gene testing technologies, including large sequencing panels, the ability to arrive at a precise genetic diagnosis in this group of disorders has been improving. We have reviewed all the gene sequencing studies of ataxias available by a comprehensive literature search and summarize their results. We provide a logical algorithm for a diagnostic approach in the context of this evolving information.

We stress the fact that both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant mutations can occur in children with ataxias and highlight the need to consider nucleotide repeat expansions, which cannot be detected by sequencing technologies, as a possible cause of progressive ataxias in children. We discuss the traditional phenotype-based diagnostic approach in the context of gene testing technologies. Finally, we summarize those disorders in which a specific therapy may be indicated.

### Spinocerebellar ataxia [^116ne2mR]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2019). Low credibility.

The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited progressive disorders, the clinical hallmark of which is the loss of balance and coordination accompanied by slurred speech; onset is most often in adult life. Genetically, SCAs are grouped as repeat expansion SCAs, such as SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and rare SCAs that are caused by non-repeat mutations, such as SCA5. Most SCA mutations cause prominent damage to cerebellar Purkinje neurons with consecutive cerebellar atrophy, although Purkinje neurons are only mildly affected in some SCAs. Furthermore, other parts of the nervous system, such as the spinal cord, basal ganglia, and pontine nuclei in the brainstem, can be involved.

As there is currently no treatment to slow or halt SCAs (many SCAs lead to premature death), the clinical care of patients with SCA focuses on managing the symptoms through physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Intense research has greatly expanded our understanding of the pathobiology of many SCAs, revealing that they occur via interrelated mechanisms (including proteotoxicity, RNA toxicity, and ion channel dysfunction), and has led to the identification of new targets for treatment development. However, the development of effective therapies is hampered by the heterogeneity of the SCAs; specific therapeutic approaches may be required for each disease.

### Exome sequencing in the clinical diagnosis of sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia [^111whp3q]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Cerebellar ataxias are a diverse collection of neurologic disorders with causes ranging from common acquired etiologies to rare genetic conditions. Numerous genetic disorders have been associated with chronic progressive ataxia, which consequently presents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians in terms of how to approach and prioritize genetic testing in patients with such clinically heterogeneous phenotypes. Additionally, while the value of genetic testing in early-onset and/or familial cases seems clear, many patients with ataxia present sporadically with adult onset of symptoms, and the contribution of genetic variation to the phenotype of these patients has not yet been established.

- **Objective**: To investigate the contribution of genetic disease in a population of patients with predominantly adult- and sporadic-onset cerebellar ataxia.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We examined a consecutive series of 76 patients presenting to a tertiary referral center for evaluation of chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Next-generation exome sequencing coupled with comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, phenotypic analysis, and clinical correlation.

- **Results**: We identified clinically relevant genetic information in more than 60% of patients studied (n = 46), including diagnostic pathogenic gene variants in 21% (n = 16), a notable yield given the diverse genetics and clinical heterogeneity of the cerebellar ataxias.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: This study demonstrated that clinical exome sequencing in patients with adult-onset and sporadic presentation of cerebellar ataxia can provide valuable diagnostic insights.
