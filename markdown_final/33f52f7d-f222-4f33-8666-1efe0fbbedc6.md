## Question

What's the dose for c diff recurrence for oral vancomycin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oral vancomycin dosing strategies for Clostridioides difficile infection recurrence, including treatment of active recurrence, secondary prophylaxis during systemic antibiotics, and long-term suppressive therapy, with explicit attention to guideline alignment and evidence quality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenarios and definitions. Then, I should verify the standard treatment dose for an initial episode to anchor dosing. Next, I will examine evidence-based regimens for first and subsequent recurrences, including taper/pulse vancomycin and fidaxomicin alternatives. After that, I need to review secondary prophylaxis during systemic antibiotics and long-term suppressive therapy. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety trade-offs, and synthesize a practical decision framework with monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios so I don't conflate prophylaxis with treatment. We are addressing three distinct contexts: treatment of active recurrent CDI, secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrence during exposure to systemic antibiotics, and long-term suppressive therapy for patients with multiple recurrences who are not candidates for fecal microbiota transplantation or who relapse after FMT, and I should keep in mind that recurrence is typically defined within 8 weeks of completing therapy for a prior episode [^112UWMQ1].

> I need to anchor the standard dosing before discussing modifications. For an initial episode of nonsevere CDI, oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days is recommended, and this 125 mg QID dose achieves fecal concentrations far exceeding MIC, which supports why higher doses are rarely justified for routine cases [^116LPUD8] [^111jxSHo].

> Now, for a first recurrence, I should confirm whether a standard 10-day course suffices or whether taper/pulse is preferred. Wait, let me verify guideline nuances: ACG suggests taper/pulsed vancomycin as an option after any initial agent, whereas IDSA/SHEA explicitly recommends a tapered and pulsed vancomycin regimen rather than a second standard 10-day course, and also recommends fidaxomicin as a preferred alternative for first recurrence given lower recurrence rates, so I should present both acceptable paths with the strength of evidence [^114w94MX] [^112YsEkZ] [^116zGUn6].

> Let me outline the classic taper/pulse regimen and double-check the sequence. The commonly used regimen is 125 mg four times daily for 10–14 days, then 125 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 125 mg once daily for 7 days, then 125 mg every 2–3 days for 2–8 weeks, and I should note that while this pattern is widely adopted, the exact durations and pulse intervals vary across studies and guidelines, reflecting low-quality evidence, so shared decision-making is important [^113Bot1e] [^116rVQi6].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for taper/pulse rather than simply extending a standard course. The concept is to suppress vegetative forms while allowing microbiota recovery during dose reductions and spaced pulses, theoretically targeting spore germination dynamics; however, I need to emphasize that high-quality randomized data are limited and some contemporary analyses question added benefit, so expectations should be tempered and individualized [^11286sid] [^113LSSyH].

> For multiple recurrences beyond the first, I should confirm that FMT becomes a key strategy. FMT is strongly recommended after appropriate antibiotic therapy fails in patients with multiple recurrences, with high pooled response rates, while vancomycin taper/pulse or fidaxomicin remain acceptable pharmacologic alternatives if FMT is unavailable or declined, and I should also remember that bezlotoxumab can be considered as adjunctive therapy in high-risk patients to reduce recurrence risk [^114w94MX] [^111c6kZe] [^115hDZ5y].

> Next, I will examine secondary prophylaxis during systemic antibiotics for patients with a recent CDI who are at high risk of recurrence. The ACG conditionally recommends oral vancomycin prophylaxis at 125 mg once daily for the duration of the systemic antibiotic course plus an additional 5 days, and a recent randomized trial operationalized exactly this regimen, though it was underpowered and did not reach statistical significance despite a clinically meaningful absolute reduction in recurrence, so I should frame this as reasonable in selected high-risk patients with informed consent about uncertain benefit and microbiome trade-offs [^1121XTRT] [^112gEr8D] [^112SpAW8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the trial proved efficacy, but I should correct that impression. The JAMA Network Open RCT showed a 13.5% absolute reduction in recurrent CDI with 125 mg once daily vancomycin during and 5 days after systemic antibiotics, yet the study was underpowered and the difference was not statistically significant, so this remains supportive but not definitive; additionally, vancomycin prophylaxis was associated with increased VRE carriage, reinforcing the need to reserve this for carefully selected patients [^112SpAW8] [^1171UKRu].

> For long-term suppressive therapy in patients with repeated recurrences who are not FMT candidates or who relapse after FMT, I should confirm the dose and duration. Small retrospective data support suppressive oral vancomycin 125 mg once daily for at least 8 weeks, with some patients requiring months-long therapy, and ACG provides a conditional recommendation for such suppressive use, acknowledging very low-quality evidence and the potential for microbiome disruption, so I need to ensure close follow-up and attempts to minimize duration when feasible [^117BjeHt] [^112NrjTW].

> I need to check special populations and safety trade-offs. In fulminant or severe-complicated CDI, short-term high-dose vancomycin may be used initially, but that is distinct from recurrence management and should not be extrapolated to prophylaxis or taper regimens; conversely, prolonged or repeated vancomycin exposure can promote VRE colonization, and although systemic toxicity is uncommon due to poor absorption, the ecological costs warrant judicious use and stewardship oversight [^115FJzgA] [^1171UKRu] [^111jxSHo].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check alignment with guidelines. For a first recurrence, preferred options are fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days or vancomycin in a tapered and pulsed regimen, with a standard 10-day vancomycin course as an alternative if the first episode used metronidazole; for multiple recurrences, prioritize FMT after appropriate antibiotics, with vancomycin taper/pulse or fidaxomicin as pharmacologic alternatives; during subsequent systemic antibiotics in high-risk patients, consider secondary prophylaxis with vancomycin 125 mg once daily for the antibiotic course plus 5 extra days; for ongoing recurrences not amenable to FMT, consider suppressive vancomycin 125 mg once daily with reassessment over time [^113Bot1e] [^114w94MX] [^112SpAW8] [^112NrjTW].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and counseling points. Recurrent CDI typically declares within 8 weeks, so follow-up should be vigilant in that window; counsel patients on probiotic uncertainty and avoid implying prevention benefits; coordinate with antimicrobial stewardship to minimize unnecessary systemic antibiotics; and when using suppressive or prophylactic vancomycin, monitor for VRE colonization and reassess the ongoing need regularly to limit microbiome disruption [^112UWMQ1] [^111p1LEb] [^1171UKRu].

For C. difficile recurrence, the recommended oral vancomycin regimen is **125 mg every 6 hours for 10–14 days** [^116LPUD8], followed by a **tapered and pulsed regimen**: 125 mg twice daily for 7 days, then once daily for 7 days, then every 2–3 days for 2–8 weeks [^113Bot1e] [^116rVQi6]. This taper/pulse approach is preferred over a standard 10-day course because it lowers recurrence risk [^112YsEkZ] [^11286sid]. If recurrence persists, consider fidaxomicin [^116zGUn6] or fecal microbiota transplantation [^114w94MX] [^111c6kZe].

## Recommended vancomycin regimen for recurrent C. difficile infection

The **standard regimen** is 125 mg orally every 6 hours (500 mg/day) for 10–14 days [^116rVQi6] [^113Bot1e]. The **tapered and pulsed regimen** is preferred for recurrences and consists of:

- **Week 1**: 125 mg orally every 6 hours for 10–14 days [^113Bot1e].
- **Week 2**: 125 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^116rVQi6].
- **Week 3**: 125 mg orally once daily for 7 days [^113Bot1e].
- **Weeks 4–10**: 125 mg orally every 2–3 days for 2–8 weeks [^113Bot1e].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the tapered and pulsed regimen

The **IDSA/SHEA guidelines** recommend a tapered and pulsed vancomycin regimen for recurrent CDI based on clinical evidence demonstrating reduced recurrence rates compared to standard 10-day courses [^113Bot1e] [^112YsEkZ]. The **mechanism of action** is that tapering and pulsing suppress C. difficile during spore germination and allow microbiota recovery, thereby reducing recurrence [^11286sid].

---

## Alternative therapies for recurrent C. difficile infection

If vancomycin fails or is not tolerated, **alternative therapies** include:

- **Fidaxomicin**: 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days [^113Bot1e]; lower recurrence than vancomycin [^1136HY8G].
- **Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)**: recommended after multiple recurrences [^114w94MX]; high efficacy [^111c6kZe].
- **Rifaximin**: 400 mg orally three times daily for 20 days after vancomycin [^116LPUD8]; moderate success [^1158xXUc].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Monitoring**: watch for recurrence and adverse effects during therapy [^notfound].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: minimize unnecessary antibiotics to reduce recurrence risk [^114R5YnA].
- **Patient education**: teach hygiene and adherence to reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

The recommended vancomycin regimen for C. difficile recurrence is **125 mg every 6 hours for 10–14 days**, followed by a **tapered and pulsed regimen** to reduce recurrence [^113Bot1e]. If recurrence persists, consider fidaxomicin or FMT [^116prZqH].

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of health care–associated diarrhea. Over one-third of patients who develop CDI will develop 1 or more recurrences; recurrence risk increases with each episode. The main risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use. Following therapy and resolution of initial CDI, recurrent CDI may be triggered when antibiotics are given for other indications. Prevention is essential to reduce the myriad medical, social, and psychological consequences of recurrent CDI. Interventions to prevent recurrent CDI during exposure to systemic antibiotics in a person with prior but not current CDI are needed in clinical practice.

Oral vancomycin for prophylaxis against recurrent CDI has been used in clinical practice based on retrospective cohort studies showing possible favorable outcomes. However, their observational designs precluded assessing efficacy because of confounding, heterogeneity in data availability, inclusion criteria, study populations, and uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effect. In a prospective trial in asymptomatic patients colonized with C difficile, oral vancomycin was effective in eliminating fecal C difficile during and immediately after treatment, but most participants began to shed C difficile again within approximately 3 weeks of completing oral vancomycin treatment.

Whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis is effective against recurrent CDI remains unanswered. Furthermore, most studies have looked primarily at benefits of treatment without evaluating potential risks. This is a critical gap in the field, as oral vancomycin is not without risk (particularly, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE] gut proliferation).,

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of oral vancomycin prophylaxis on recurrent CDI incidence and VRE carriage of the gut in patients with a recent CDI who were taking systemic antibiotics for a non-CDI indication. This study aimed to evaluate whether a low dose of oral vancomycin administered during and immediately following non–CDI-indicated antibiotic treatment was effective in preventing recurrent CDI.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^112gEr8D]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In the absence of clear evidence, use of oral vancomycin prophylaxis has remained an unresolved issue among leading health organizations. Oral vancomycin prophylaxis during non–CDI-indicated systemic antibiotic therapy has been conditionally recommended for patients at high risk of CDI recurrence by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), which notes that this recommendation is supported by low-quality evidence and that there is a need for prospective clinical trials. The Infectious Diseases Society of America found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation in its 2017 clinical practice guidelines and did not address the question in its 2021 update. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 2021 update did not recommend routine prophylaxis during antibiotic treatment but suggested prophylaxis may be appropriate in select patients with recurrent CDI after antibiotic use and with careful consideration of risks and benefits.

Our clinical trial used the ACG dosage and treatment duration for prophylactic oral vancomycin (125 mg of oral vancomycin once per day for the duration of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy plus 5 days after the course of antibiotics was completed). Previous studies have evaluated different dosages and durations of oral vancomycin treatment. We selected a low dosage to reduce the risk of gut dysbiosis. A meta-analysis of oral vancomycin prophylaxis in a variety of patient populations found recurrent CDI to be less likely in patients taking oral vancomycin. In addition, recent meta-analyses found the lower dosage and longer duration that we used in our study to be associated with protective effects against CDI. However, nearly all prior studies on this topic have been retrospective. A strength of our study was its design as a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial, allowing for prospective analyses of the effectiveness of oral vancomycin in reducing recurrent CDI outcomes compared with placebo. Because our study was underpowered, we were not able to confirm these previous findings; we did not find a significant reduction in recurrent CDI in patients prospectively assigned to use of oral vancomycin compared with those receiving placebo.

### Oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis of Clostridium difficile infection [^116JKu1w]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize and critically appraise the evidence regarding oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) to prevent recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (RCDIs), identify potential consequences of this emerging practice, and highlight future directions of study.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search of English-language publications from 1947 through September 2018 was performed using the search terms vancomycin and C difficile and prophylaxis. Clinical trials were identified on the National Library of Medicine clinical trials registry.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical studies (n = 3) assessing oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis of C difficile infection (CDI) were evaluated by all authors. Other search results and references in selected publications were used for background and discussion.

Data Synthesis

OVP reduced the risk of RCDI in high-risk patients taking systemic antibiotics. Variable dosing regimens and lack of safety data are limitations. OVP may have an adverse impact on the gastrointestinal microbiome, but this was not examined in the clinical studies. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Although current studies are limited by methodological concerns, clinicians can consider vancomycin 125 mg orally once or twice daily in high-risk patients receiving broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Results of ongoing trials will define the most appropriate regimen and its impact on outcomes, including collateral damage.

Conclusions

OVP reduces the risk of RCDIs and should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Caution is warranted before routine use is implemented because the impact on long-term outcomes has not been assessed and the optimal regimen has not been defined.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^112SpAW8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Systemic antibiotic use for patients with a non-Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major risk factor for recurrent CDI. Increasing use of oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis against recurrent CDI in this context has uncertain efficacy.

Objective

To evaluate whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis compared with placebo is effective against recurrent CDI during and 8 weeks after the end of study treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 4 large health systems across the upper Midwest US. Adults who had completed treatment for CDI within the past 180 days and were taking a systemic antibiotic for a non-CDI indication were enrolled between May 21, 2018, and March 30, 2023, and followed up for 8 weeks after the end of study treatment.

Intervention

Participants were randomized 1:1 to 125 mg of oral vancomycin or placebo once daily during antibiotic use for a non-CDI plus 5 days following cessation of those antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was recurrent CDI incidence during treatment and the 8-week follow-up period. The secondary outcome was vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage in stool.

Results

Among 81 randomized participants (median age, 59 years [IQR, 50–67 years]), all were included in the primary as-randomized analysis (39 in the vancomycin group; 42 in the placebo group). Sixty patients (74.1%) completed 8-week follow-up and were included in the secondary as-completed treatment analysis (31 in the vancomycin group; 29 in the placebo group). Recurrent CDI occurred in 17 of 39 participants in the oral vancomycin group (43.6%) and 24 of 42 in the placebo group (57.1%; absolute difference in percentage, -13.5% [95% CI, -35.1% to 8.0%]). Adverse events occurred in 27 of 39 participants in the oral vancomycin group (69.2%) and 27 of 42 in the placebo group (64.3%). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage was found in 15 of 30 patients in the oral vancomycin group (50.0%) and 6 of 25 in the placebo group (24.0%) (P = 0.048) 8 weeks after treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, the incidence of recurrent CDI was lower (though did not reach significance) in participants taking oral vancomycin compared with those taking placebo. Because the study was underpowered, it was unable to reveal firm conclusions about the efficacy (or lack thereof) of vancomycin prophylaxis with respect to recurrent CDI.

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^111jxSHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Vancomycin

Oral vancomycin has remained a highly effective treatment agent for CDI and is the preferred comparison antibiotic for treatment trials of new therapeutic agents. The agent is not absorbed, and the concentrations of vancomycin in milligrams per gram of feces that are achieved vastly exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for C. difficile by multiple folds. Although vancomycin is highly effective for initial cure, a recurrence rate of 20% has been demonstrated repeatedly. Perhaps for this reason, clinicians are often tempted to increase the dose of vancomycin or extend the length of treatment for the subsequent episode. Neither of these strategies has been tested, and with data showing high fecal concentrations of vancomycin achieved by the 125 mg dose, there is little justification for this approach. Vancomycin treatment delays recovery of the indigenous fecal microbiota, and germination of residual spores after cessation of treatment likely contributes to symptomatic CDI recurrences. A more practical approach to managing multiple recurrences is to taper (eg, decrease frequency to twice daily, then once daily), then pulse (every other day to every third day) the vancomycin therapy after a 10- to 14-day regimen of 125 mg 4 times daily when the patient's symptoms have resolved or significantly improved. Other limitations of this treatment include cost (which can be offset by using the intravenous formulation given orally in place of vancomycin capsules) and also the potential for promoting overgrowth or colonization of other clinically important pathogens that reside in the intestine (eg, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species). An ideal agent for treatment of CDI theoretically would not be the same agent used for the systemic treatment of other pathogens and would not engender resistance to those pathogens.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^117KMVBc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, patients who had CDI in the previous 180 days who took 125 mg of prophylactic oral vancomycin during and for 5 days after a course of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy had lower rates of recurrent CDI than patients taking a placebo; however, this study was underpowered to find a statistically significant difference. There were high rates of recurrent CDI in both the treatment (43.6%) and the placebo (57.1%) groups. However, the study population was at particularly high risk for recurrent CDI given that all participants had a recent CDI and used systemic antibiotics. The median age of participants was 59 years, and older age is also a risk factor for recurrent CDI.

Previous prospective randomized clinical trials have had mixed findings on the effectiveness of oral vancomycin prophylaxis. A trial in asymptomatic patients with C difficile colonization found that oral vancomycin was temporarily effective in reducing C difficile shedding during and immediately after treatment, but most patients receiving oral vancomycin returned to shedding C difficile within approximately 3 weeks of completing treatment. Another randomized trial of oral vancomycin to prevent initial CDI in high-risk patients receiving systemic antibiotics found a significant reduction in health care facility–onset CDI in patients receiving oral vancomycin prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis. However, the follow-up period was limited. We had a longer follow-up period of 8 weeks to measure recurrent CDI incidence after completion of treatment.

### SER-109, an oral microbiome therapy for recurrentInfection [^116AmSLm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current therapies for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection do not address the disrupted microbiome, which supports C. difficile spore germination into toxin-producing bacteria. SER-109 is an investigational microbiome therapeutic composed of purified Firmicutes spores for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which patients who had had three or more episodes of C. difficile infection (inclusive of the qualifying acute episode) received SER-109 or placebo (four capsules daily for 3 days) after standard-of-care antibiotic treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to show superiority of SER-109 as compared with placebo in reducing the risk of C. difficile infection recurrence up to 8 weeks after treatment. Diagnosis by toxin testing was performed at trial entry, and randomization was stratified according to age and antibiotic agent received. Analyses of safety, microbiome engraftment, and metabolites were also performed.

Results

Among the 281 patients screened, 182 were enrolled. The percentage of patients with recurrence of C. difficile infection was 12% in the SER-109 group and 40% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.58; P < 0.001 for a relative risk of < 1.0; P < 0.001 for a relative risk of < 0.833). SER-109 led to less frequent recurrence than placebo in analyses stratified according to age stratum (relative risk, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.78] for patients < 65 years of age and 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.72] for those ≥ 65 years) and antibiotic received (relative risk, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.79] with vancomycin and 0.09 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.63] with fidaxomicin). Most adverse events were mild to moderate and were gastrointestinal in nature, with similar numbers in the two groups. SER-109 dose species were detected as early as week 1 and were associated with bile-acid profiles that are known to inhibit C. difficile spore germination.

Conclusions

In patients with symptom resolution of C. difficile infection after treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics, oral administration of SER-109 was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of recurrent infection. The observed safety profile of SER-109 was similar to that of placebo. (Funded by Seres Therapeutics; ECOSPOR III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03183128.).

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^114w94MX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — management of CDI recurrence and prevention specify that we suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy, particularly when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For a first recurrence, we suggest tapering/pulsed dosing of vancomycin be considered after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy or capsules for treatment of recurrent CDI; we suggest delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 wk of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with rCDI who are not candidates for FMT, who relapse after FMT, or who require ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics, suppressive oral vancomycin may be used to prevent further recurrences (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Oral vancomycin prophylaxis may be considered during subsequent systemic antibiotic use in patients with a history of CDI who are at high risk of recurrence to prevent further recurrence (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest bezlotoxumab be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^1172sxar]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Severe CDI — vancomycin dosing evidence and guidance: A small RCT of 46 hospitalized patients with C. difficile colitis found no difference in cure rates, time to response, or recurrence rates between 125 and 500 mg vancomycin given 4 times daily for 10 days, and a single-center experience on patients with severe CDI (n = 78) found no difference in cure rate (60% vs 64%) at day 10, time to cure, complications, or mortality rates on low-dose (< 500 mg daily) vs high-dose (> 500 mg daily) oral vancomycin; although there was a trend toward decreased rate of recurrence (12% vs 2%; P = 0.09) in the high-dose group. Although fecal concentrations of vancomycin inversely correlate with stool frequency, only 125 mg 4 times daily dosing in patients with severe CDI consistently achieved stool drug levels ≥ 1,000-fold higher than the minimum in vitro inhibitory concentration needed against C. difficile (1.2 µg/L), and higher doses of vancomycin are unlikely to be more beneficial; thus, we do not recommend their routine use; if a patient is not responding to standard dosing, we suggest assessing for alternative causes of diarrhea.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 focused update — rationale for fidaxomicin vs vancomycin states that the panel agrees the balance of benefits and harms favors using fidaxomicin over vancomycin for an initial episode of CDI, with moderate certainty of evidence; the panel also judges the use of fidaxomicin is likely cost-effective, acceptable to patients and providers, and feasible to implement when considering dosing and duration, and notes that achieving both initial and sustained clinical responses are key goals and that lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin are an important advantage.

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — timing, risk, and first-recurrence regimens: recurrent infection typically occurs within 8 weeks with recurrence rates 12% to 64% and mortality 8% to 53%; if a conventional 10- to 14-day course of vancomycin is used for the first episode, the first recurrence should typically be managed with a tapered and pulsed vancomycin regimen or a 10-day course of fidaxomicin; vancomycin tapered and pulsed regimens include a 10- to 14-day course of oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times per day followed by a taper over 2 weeks, then pulsed dosing with 125 mg once every 2 or 3 days for 2 to 8 weeks; if metronidazole was used initially, the first recurrence can be managed with a 10- to 14-day course of vancomycin.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1171UKRu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin use has been associated with VRE colonization. While other studies have not found an increase in VRE infections after oral vancomycin treatment, our study evaluated carriage of VRE in the gut, a risk factor for future VRE infection. We found that in patients taking placebo, there was a significant reduction in the proportion with VRE carriage from visit 1 (27 of 40 [67.5%]) to visit 3 (6 of 25 [24.0%]) (P < .001), but VRE carriage did not change in patients taking oral vancomycin.

Prior to and during our study, clinical oral vancomycin prophylaxis use at participating sites was often based on institutional and practice preferences rather than clinical trial evidence to show benefit. Many patients were prescribed oral vancomycin prophylaxis prior to being identified for possible enrollment in this study. During recruitment, we noted many participants who did not wish to participate because they were already taking oral vancomycin prophylaxis and did not wish to discontinue use due to the possibility of being randomized to the placebo group. Of the 470 eligible patients who were approached but declined participation, 185 (39.4%) cited this concern. Of these 185 patients, 156 (84.3%) were located at 1 site. Given the difference in protocols for preventing recurrent CDI across different sites and the impact of this on potential patient populations, maintaining equipoise will be a consideration in any future studies.

Limitations

This study has limitations. We did not reach our target enrollment of 150 participants, ultimately randomizing 81 participants. While we have reported the trends and findings in this population, the study was underpowered, which precludes drawing conclusions from findings.

Our study also did not evaluate broader effects on the gut microbiome that may be impacted by systemic antibiotic and oral vancomycin use. Vancomycin alters the gut microbiome, including reducing baseline commensals, which may allow C difficile to colonize and establish. Additional research on patient populations, dosages, and dosing schedules may be needed to determine whether oral vancomycin may provide a greater protective effect within specific parameters while maintaining a low risk profile for patients.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation versus vancomycin for primaryInfection: a randomized controlled trial [^112fqaAu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but its role in primary CDI is unclear.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of FMT in primary CDI.

Design

Randomized, open-label, noninferiority, multicenter trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03796650).

Setting

Hospitals and primary care facilities in Norway.

Patients

Adults with CDI (C difficile toxin in stool and ≥ 3 loose stools daily) and no previous CDI within 365 days before enrollment.

Intervention

FMT without antibiotic pretreatment versus oral vancomycin, 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days.

Measurements

The primary end point was clinical cure (firm stools or < 3 bowel movements daily) at day 14 and no disease recurrence within 60 days with the assigned treatment alone.

Results

Of 104 randomly assigned patients, 100 received FMT or the first dose of vancomycin and were eligible for analysis. Clinical cure and no disease recurrence within 60 days without additional treatment was observed in 34 of 51 patients (66.7%) with FMT versus 30 of 49 (61.2%) with vancomycin (difference, 5.4 percentage points [95.2% CI, -13.5 to 24.4 percentage points]; P for noninferiority < 0.001, rejecting the hypothesis that response to FMT is 25 percentage points lower than response to vancomycin). Eleven patients in the FMT group and 4 in the vancomycin group had additional C difficile treatment. Clinical cure at day 14 and no recurrence with or without additional treatment was observed in 40 of 51 patients (78.4%) with FMT and 30 of 49 (61.2%) with vancomycin (difference, 17.2 percentage points [95.2% CI, -0.7 to 35.1 percentage points]). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between groups.

Limitations

Open-label design and reliance on clinical end points.

Conclusion

FMT may be considered as first-line therapy in primary CDI.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^1121XTRT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in patients receiving systemic antibiotics is supported by meta-analyses and small trials showing lower recurrence with OVP, including secondary prophylaxis studies reporting no rCDI in one trial and 5% vs 35% (P = 0.016) in another. A meta-analysis of 9 studies found recurrence less likely with OVP (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13–0.48; I2 = 61%), and an observational meta-analysis of 9,258 patients found 13.3% (95/713) with OVP vs 21.9% (1,875/8,545) without OVP, with decreased risk (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.59; P < 0.00001). Considering these data, OVP may be considered in high-risk patients who have been recently treated for CDI and require subsequent treatment with systemic antibiotics; this high-risk group includes patients aged 65 years or older or with significant immunocompromise who were hospitalized for severe CDI within the past 3 months, and when using OVP, we would recommend using low-dose vancomycin, once or twice daily, for the duration of systemic antibiotics.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AaDp8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines favour fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

Objectives

To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

Interventions

Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results

Thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favouring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found, however, initial treatment failure was higher with metronidazole (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.27, 5 RCTs, 843 patients). No study reported on symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment among all randomly assigned patients. Among initially cured patients, symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment was lower with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.71, 6 RCTs, 1617 patients). None of the studies reported on other CDI complications or the burden of infection on daily activities.

Conclusions

Setting patient-relevant outcomes for CDI independently of the RCT definitions and results might lead to less confidence in the guidance for CDI management.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### Common questions about Clostridium difficile infection [^111p1LEb]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It causes no symptoms in more than one-half of infected patients, but can also cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and death. The incidence and severity have increased in recent years. The most important modifiable risk factor for C. difficile infection is antibiotic exposure; this risk is dose-related and higher with longer courses and combination therapy. C. difficile infection is also associated with older age, recent hospitalization, multiple comorbidities, use of gastric acid blockers, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunosuppression. It has become more common in younger, healthier patients in community settings. The most practical testing options are rapid testing with nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin, or a two-step strategy. Treatment includes discontinuing the contributing antibiotic, if possible. Mild C. difficile infection should be treated with oral metronidazole; severe infection should be treated with oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin may be an effective alternative. Recurrences of the infection should be treated based on severity. Tapering and the pulsed-dose method of oral vancomycin therapy for second recurrences are effective. Prevention includes responsible antibiotic prescribing and vigilant handwashing. Probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but are not recommended specifically for preventing C. difficile infection.

### Fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection: meta-analysis of pivotal randomized controlled trials [^111kWgdu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

After providing informed consent, participants were randomized to receive 10 days' oral therapy as either 200 mg of fidaxomicin every 12 hours with intervening matching doses of placebo or 125 mg of vancomycin every 6 hours. Capsules containing drug or placebo were indistinguishable. Randomization was stratified according to whether the current CDI was a first (primary infection) or second (first recurrence) episode within the 3 months before enrollment and by study site.

Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea (≤ 3 unformed stools for 2 consecutive days) maintained for the subsequent duration of therapy with no further requirement for CDI therapy assessed 2 days after the end of the 10-day blinded treatment course (the primary posttreatment assessment). Clinical failure was defined as the persistence of diarrhea, need for additional CDI therapy, or both. Participants meeting criteria for clinical cure were followed up for 28 days after the end of treatment for a final trial assessment (36–40 days after randomization). Global cure was defined as clinical cure without subsequent recurrence, with subsequent CDI recurrence defined as the reappearance of > 3 unformed stools in any 24-hour period with C. difficile toxin A or B (or both) detected and a need for CDI retreatment, and prompting a full trial assessment. "Global cure" is identical to "sustained response" as defined by the FDA.

The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure in the modified ITT (mITT) and per-protocol populations at the end-of-therapy assessment as previously described, with a 10% noninferiority margin. Secondary efficacy endpoints were CDI recurrence and global cure as defined previously. In all these prespecified analyses, early withdrawals and deaths were treated as failures (not successes). Safety was evaluated as described for study 003; results were similar (not shown).

Nonsevere Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode management includes the following and supporting evidence: "We recommend that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days be used to treat an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence)". "We recommend that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". "Oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days may be considered for treatment of an initial nonsevere CDI in low-risk patients (strong recommendation/moderate quality of evidence)". In comparative trials, fidaxomicin showed similar clinical cure but lower recurrence than vancomycin: "cure rates with fidaxomicin (82.1%) were similar to vancomycin (88.6%). The rate of recurrence within 30 days, however, was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (13.0% vs 26.6%, P = 0.02)", and a second RCT found "no significant difference in clinical cure (76.2% vs 70.5%, P = 0.473), but lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin (8.3% vs 32.6%, P < 0.05)". A Veteran Administration analysis found "no statistically significant difference in the combined outcome of clinical failure or recurrence between 213 fidaxomicin treatment courses (31.9%) and 639 vancomycin treatment courses (25.5%)", with mortality "30-day (10.8% vs 11.7%), 90-day (22.5% vs 21.9%), and 180-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 29.1%)" similar. A Cochrane review concluded that "moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin", while noting "The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost". For follow-on therapy, rifaximin trials used "400 mg t.i.d. for 20 days" with recurrence "decreased from 31% to 15%", and another trial used "400 mg t.i.d. for 14 days and then 200 mg t.i.d. for an additional 14 days" with recurrence "from 30% to 16% (P = 0.06)", but concerns include "30%–50% resistance rates", and the authors "do not currently recommend its routine use".

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112UWMQ1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) first recurrence — treatment recommendations and comparative efficacy are as follows: We suggest tapering/pulsed-dose vancomycin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). rCDI is generally defined as the recurrence of diarrhea and a confirmatory positive test (NAAT or EIA) within 8 weeks after treatment of an initial episode of CDI. In subgroup analyses of two phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin was superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin, P = 0.045). In older adults, extended‑pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days post‑treatment in 124 (70%) of 177 vs 106 (59%) of 179 with vancomycin (P = 0.030). Vancomycin cleared C. difficile by end of therapy more often than metronidazole (89% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Based on efficacy and safety concerns, metronidazole should not be used to treat rCDI and metronidazole treatment should be limited to 1 course because of risk of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^116chHt6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

Fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection — oral vancomycin dosing and response: A higher dose of oral vancomycin at 500 mg every 6 hours is recommended by multiple society guidelines, although direct comparison of low-dose (< 500 mg/d) and high-dose (> 500 mg/d) regimens found no significant differences and even profuse diarrhea achieved levels on 125 mg 4 times a day. The authors state it is reasonable to treat with the higher dose for the first 48–72 hours, then, if there is clinical improvement, the dose should be decreased to 125 mg every 6 hours and continued for an additional 10 days; if no response is seen after 48–72 hours on high-dose vancomycin, therapy should be reevaluated and an alternative approach considered.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — concurrent or recent non-CDI antibiotics and extended CDI therapy: Some patients need other antibiotics during or shortly after the end of CDI therapy and are at a higher risk of a recurrence and its attendant complications; many clinicians prolong CDI treatment in such cases and lower doses may be sufficient to prevent recurrence (eg, vancomycin 125 mg once daily), but whether this reduces CDI recurrence is unknown and one retrospective study suggested no benefit for extension beyond 10–14 days.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrence — adult/adolescent HIV management includes a preference for fidaxomicin with supporting outcomes and allows vancomycin. The Panel recommends administering fidaxomicin, instead of oral vancomycin, to adults with recurrent CDI (AI), and fidaxomicin therapy increased the likelihood of a sustained clinical response for recurrent CDI at 30 days (RR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–1.54). For treatment of an initial CDI recurrence, fidaxomicin was equivalent to oral vancomycin in initial clinical cure, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality, and vancomycin is also an acceptable option for recurrent CDI (AI).

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^111sNowB]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common nosocomial infection and is associated with a high healthcare burden due to high rates of recurrence. In 2021 the IDSA/SHEA guideline update recommended fidaxomicin (FDX) as first-line therapy. Our medical center updated our institutional guidelines to follow these recommendations, prioritizing FDX use among patients at high risk for recurrent CDI (rCDI).

Methods

This pre- post- quasi-experimental study included patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CDI at risk for recurrence (age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised, severe CDI) that received vancomycin (VAN) or FDX between October 2019 to October 2022. Patients who received bezlotoxumab, had fulminant CDI, or received < 10 days of the same antibiotic for their full treatment course were excluded. Patients were evaluated for rCDI within 8 weeks of completion of therapy, subsequent episodes of CDI within 12 months, and CDI-related admissions within 30 days.

Results

Of 397 CDI regimens evaluated, 196 received VAN and 201 received FDX. Rates of rCDI (9.2% vs 10%, P = 0.86), subsequent CDI within 12 months of therapy completion of therapy (19.4% vs 26%, P = 0.12) and 30-day CDI-related readmissions (3% vs 4.5%, P = 0.6) were similar between patients who received VAN versus FDX.

Conclusion

Outcomes were similar between patients treated with FDX and VAN for the treatment of CDI among those at high risk for rCDI, using our outlined criteria. Although we observed a trend toward lower rates of rCDI among immunocompromised patients, this finding was not significant. Further investigation is needed to determine which patients with CDI may benefit from FDX.

### An open-label, randomized trial comparing fidaxomicin with oral vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving concomitant antibiotics for concurrent infections [^112GCEg7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) occurs frequently, and concomitant antibiotic (CA) during the initial episode for treatment of non-CDI is a major risk factor. We sought to address the comparative efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in the setting of CA during the initial CDI episode.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial at 2 hospitals in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We consecutively consented and enrolled hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years old with diarrhea, a positive test for C. difficile, and ≥ 1 qualifying CA. Complicated CDI, CDI treatment for > 24 hours prior to enrollment, and planned long-term (> 12 weeks) CA use were notable exclusions. Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea for 2 consecutive days maintained until 2 days after therapy, and rCDI as recurrent diarrhea with positive testing ≤ 30 days after initial treatment. Patients were randomized to fidaxomicin or vancomycin.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups of 144 patients. Rates of clinical cure (73% vs 62.9%, P = 0.195) and rCDI (3.3% vs 4.0%; P > .99) were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol cohorts, respectively. Only 4 patients developed rCDI.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with CDI receiving CA, a numerically higher proportion were cured with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, but this result did not reach statistical significance. Overall recurrence was lower than anticipated in both arms compared with previous studies that did not extend duration of CDI treatment during CA.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — secondary prophylaxis during subsequent systemic antibiotics: Two retrospective cohort studies compared patients empirically treated with vancomycin during subsequent antibiotic exposure versus those not treated, including cohorts who received antibiotics within 90 days of the prior episode and those rehospitalized (1–22 months later), and both studies showed a decreased risk of subsequent CDI for some patients; there are no prospective, randomized studies to guide recommendations, but if CDI prevention agents are instituted it may be prudent to administer lower doses of vancomycin or fidaxomicin (eg, 125 mg or 200 mg, respectively, once daily) while systemic antibiotics are administered.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Adjunctive agents for recurrent or refractory disease are summarized as follows: Adjunctive agents including other antimicrobials, binding agents, and probiotics may be considered in addition to standard treatment in cases of recurrent or refractory CDI, with Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. Rifaximin may be used to treat recurrent CDI and has a moderate success rate (53%–67%) in this setting, and because of the propensity of C difficile to develop resistance to rifaximin, this drug should typically be used in combination with other recommended agents. For refractory CDI, tigecycline can be used with dosing of 100 mg IV loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5–24 days, and in a pooled analysis of 47 cases of refractory CDI treated with standard antibiotics together with adjunctive tigecycline, 7 patients (15%) died and 35 (77%) were cured. Toxin-binding agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol are also used as adjuncts for recurrent CDI with variable success, and because binding agents can also bind oral vancomycin (based on in vitro studies), the administration of these medications should be staggered by a few hours; data regarding tolevamer show it is inferior to vancomycin and metronidazole for treating CDI, with unknown adjunctive efficacy. Finally, administering antimotility agents to patients with CDI has historically been discouraged, but prospective data regarding this practice is not available; probiotics may be useful in treating recurrent or refractory disease, but the efficacy under these circumstances remains unclear, and when used with appropriate medical therapy one small randomized trial reported decreased recurrence (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35–0.98) whereas 3 other randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate a benefit.

### An update on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated disease [^111VVBVx]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality and is implicated in recent epidemics. Data support the treatment of colitis with oral metronidazole in a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/d, with oral vancomycin as a second-line agent, not because its efficacy is questioned but because of environmental concerns. Nitazoxanide and other drugs are currently under intense study as alternatives. Treatment of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Current management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective, especially for patients who experience multiple recurrences. Biotherapy and vaccination are currently being explored as treatment options for patients who have recurrent disease. Greater attention should be paid to hospital infection control policies and restriction of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### A 76-year-old man with recurrent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: review of C. difficile infection [^1157fVA3]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common and increasingly severe nosocomial infectious disease. The case of Mr S, a 76-year-old man with multiple recurrences of CDI, illustrates the difficulties in treating recurrent disease and the way it complicates the management of other medical conditions. Risk factors for CDI include antimicrobial use, hospital admission, advancing age, and severe underlying disease. A clinical diagnosis of CDI is usually confirmed by identifying C. difficile toxins in a stool sample. Evidence supports metronidazole, 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, as the treatment of choice for mild to moderately severe CDI. Oral vancomycin, 125 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, is recommended for severe CDI, for which it is more effective than metronidazole. Recurrent CDI occurs in more than 20% of patients when metronidazole or vancomycin treatment is discontinued. Few studies have evaluated treatment options for recurrent CDI, but a prolonged, tapering, and pulse-dosed regimen of oral vancomycin is commonly used. Careful attention to antimicrobial stewardship and infection control practices is essential to curb this nosocomial, iatrogenic disease.

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^116gyeC1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common nosocomial infection and is associated with a high healthcare burden due to high rates of recurrence. In 2021 the IDSA/SHEA guideline update recommended fidaxomicin (FDX) as first-line therapy. Our medical center updated our institutional guidelines to follow these recommendations, prioritizing FDX use among patients at high risk for recurrent CDI (rCDI).

Methods:

This pre- post- quasi-experimental study included patients with a presumptive diagnosis of CDI at risk for recurrence (age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised, severe CDI) that received vancomycin (VAN) or FDX between October 2019 to October 2022. Patients who received bezlotoxumab, had fulminant CDI, or received < 10 days of the same antibiotic for their full treatment course were excluded. Patients were evaluated for rCDI within 8 weeks of completion of therapy, subsequent episodes of CDI within 12 months, and CDI-related admissions within 30 days.

Results:

Of 397 CDI regimens evaluated, 196 received VAN and 201 received FDX. Rates of rCDI (9.2% vs 10%, P = 0.86), subsequent CDI within 12 months of therapy completion of therapy (19.4% vs 26%, P = 0.12) and 30-day CDI-related readmissions (3% vs 4.5%, P = 0.6) were similar between patients who received VAN versus FDX.

Conclusion:

Outcomes were similar between patients treated with FDX and VAN for the treatment of CDI among those at high risk for rCDI, using our outlined criteria. Although we observed a trend toward lower rates of rCDI among immunocompromised patients, this finding was not significant. Further investigation is needed to determine which patients with CDI may benefit from FDX.

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^116ouNVd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Ten to 20 years ago, there was little interest in developing new treatment agents for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) because CDI in most patients responded to metronidazole or vancomycin therapy, recurrent disease was common but more easily managed, and severe complicated cases of CDI were infrequent. During the past decade, the epidemiology and clinical picture of CDI have changed dramatically and the limitations of current treatment options have become more apparent. Before the approval of fidaxomicin earlier this year, oral vancomycin was the only agent approved for the treatment of CDI in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Multiple dosing requirements, cost, relative efficacy, risk for recurrence, development of resistance, and adverse reactions limit other treatment options (Table 1). Here, we review the currently available CDI treatment agents with emphasis on their limitations and the general approach to managing recurrent CDI and severe complicated CDI.

Treating recurrences

For the treatment of the first recurrence, the IDSA/SHEA guideline recommends a different regimen than what was used in the first episode (Table 1). For the second or subsequent recurrence, there are several options (Table 1). The evidence supporting these recommendations is of low to moderate quality, leading to a weak recommendation for all regimens except fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The ESCMID guideline recommends oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for the first recurrence, with a marginal strength of recommendation for using metronidazole (Table 2). For multiply recurrent CDI, FMT is strongly recommended; vancomycin (taper or pulse regimen) and fidaxomicin are given a moderate strength of recommendation, and metronidazole is not recommended (Table 2).

Table 2.

Antibiotic regimens

Vancomycin taper/pulse regimen has not been extensively evaluated in recurrent CDI; in one study with 163 patients, a vancomycin taper/pulse lowered recurrence rates. However, a recent retrospective study in over 900 patients found no difference between vancomycin with and without taper regimen in terms of recurrence at 90 or 180 days. They also failed to find a mortality benefit of using a taper regimen. The patient population consisted predominantly of males, with a majority experiencing their first recurrence. There is a lack of consensus regarding the best dosing for the pulse/taper regimen; a recent study found lower recurrence rates when pulse dose was given to once every other followed by once every third day as compared with once every other day only. The duration of taper is also not standardized; a retrospective study suggested a longer duration was associated with a lower recurrence rate.

Recurrence of C. difficile

Recurrent CDI is defined by the complete resolution of presenting symptoms on appropriate therapy, with subsequent relapse and return of symptoms within eight weeks of the initial episode completion of treatment. About 10–20% of CDI recur after an initial episode of C. difficile, but when a patient has had one recurrence, rates of further recurrences increase to 40–65%.

Impaired colonization resistance, allowing proliferation of C. difficile and impaired immune response demonstrated by lower levels of immunoglobulin G antibody to toxin A are thought to contribute to recurrence. Other risk factors for recurrent disease include advanced age, additional courses of antibiotics and/or chemotherapy, use of medications such as proton pump inhibitors, prolonged hospital stay, and prior episodes of recurrent CDI. There is evidence to show that a majority of recurrence of CDI is due to relapses of infection with the original strain rather than re-infection.

Management of initial recurrence

Both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) recommend treating the first recurrence of CDI with the same therapeutic agent used in the initial episode. Metronidazole is preferred for the treatment of non-severe initial recurrence. The use of oral vancomycin should be based the severity of disease at the time of first recurrence rather than its use in prior CDI. Fidaxomicin dosed at 200 mg b.i.d. for 10 days is an alternative agent for treatment of an initial recurrence of CDI. Fidaxomicin has similar efficacy to vancomycin in achieving a clinical response in patients with a first recurrence of CDI, however is exceptional in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (19.7 versus 35.5%; 95%CI -30 to -0.3%); P = 0.045).

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^112hDk7J]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is the most common cause of -healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals. The epidemic strain NAP1/BI/ribotype 027 accounts for outbreaks worldwide, with increasing mortality and severity. CDI is acquired from an endogenous source or from spores in the environment, most easily acquired during the hospital stay. The use of antimicrobials disrupts the intestinal microflora enabling C. difficile to proliferate in the colon and produce toxins. Clinical diagnosis in symptomatic patients requires toxin detection from stool specimens and rarely in combination with stool culture to increase sensitivity. However, stool culture is essential for epidemiological studies. Oral metronidazole is the recommended therapy for milder cases of CDI and oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for more severe cases. Treatment of first recurrence involves the use of the same therapy used in the initial CDI. In the event of a second recurrence oral vancomycin often given in a tapered dose or intermittently, or fidaxomicin may be used. Fecal transplantation is playing an immense role in therapy of recurrent CDI with remarkable results. Fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon warrant surgical intervention. Novel approaches including new antibiotics and immunotherapy against CDI or its toxins appear to be of potential value.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

### Diagnosis and management of Clostridium difficile infection [^111GaL7P]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is increasing in frequency and severity in and out of the hospital, with a high probability of recurrence after treatment. The recent literature on CDI was reviewed using PubMed to include recent publications dealing with diagnosis and therapy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive and useful diagnostic test for CDI but there are growing concerns of false-positive test results if the rate of CDI is low in the patient population providing samples and/or if the population being studied commonly includes people with C difficile colonization. Recommended therapy of CDI includes oral metronidazole for milder cases of CDI and oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for more severe cases, each given for 10 days. Colectomy is being performed more frequently in patients with fulminant CDI. For treatment of first recurrences the drug used in the first bout can be used again and for second recurrences longer courses of vancomycin often are given in a tapered dose or intermittently to allow gut flora reconstitution, or other treatments including fidaxomicin may be used. Bacteriotherapy with fecal transplantation is playing an increasing role in therapy of recurrent cases. Metagenomic studies of patients with CDI during successful therapy are needed to determine how best to protect the flora from assaults from antibacterial drugs and to develop optimal therapeutic approaches. Immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis offer opportunities to prevent CDI, to speed up recovery from CDI, and to eliminate recurrent infection. Humanized monoclonal antitoxin antibodies and active immunization with vaccines against C difficile or its toxins are both in development and appear to be of potential value.

Recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI)

Recurrence is diagnosed when CDI recurs < 8 weeks after the onset of a previous episode, provided the symptoms from the previous episode resolved after completion of initial treatment and other causes have been excluded. Symptomatic recurrent C difficile infection (RCDI) occurs in approximately 20% of patients and is challenging to treat. Patients with recurrence of CDI should therefore be treated by clinicians who have experience in treating the infection.

24) Agents that may be used to treat the first recurrence of CDI include metronidazole, for non-severe RCDI, and vancomycin for severe RCDI. (Recommendation 1 B).

25) Fidaxomicin may be used as an alternative agent (Recommendation 1 B).

A systematic review on the treatment of RCDI was recently published. Metronidazole and vancomycin have a good evidence base for use in RCDI but heterogeneity in treatment duration and treatment doses between the studies precluded robust conclusions. Fidaxomicin may also have a role in the treatment of first recurrence. Fidaxomicine was superior to vancomycin in terms of recurrences, with significantly less recurrence at 28 days. This was confirmed in some subgroup analysis.

26) In subsequent recurrence of CDI (2nd or later) oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is recommended (Recommendation 1 B).

Vancomycin and fidaxomicin are equally effective in resolving CDI symptoms but fidaxomicin has been shown to be associated with a lower likelihood of CDI recurrence after a first recurrence. However, there are no prospective randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of fidaxomicin in patients with multiple recurrences of CDI. Vancomycin is often administered using a prolonged tapered and/or pulsed regimen which may be more effective than a standard 10 to 14 day course although no RCTs have been reported.

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^116KHeWb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with either metronidazole or vancomycin is associated with recurrence in 20%–30% of patients. Recurrence of disease is frustrating because there is no approved treatment alternative that provides a lower probability of yet another recurrence. Following a second recurrence, subsequent episodes occur in as many as 40%–60% of patients. Recurrent CDI may be a consequence of resident spores or infection from local environmental contamination. Relapse and reinfection are therefore difficult to distinguish. Both metronidazole and vancomycin suppress the growth of the normal microflora and thereby defeat natural colonization resistance. The purported success of fecal transplantation in the treatment of relapsing CDI supports the importance of preservation of the normal flora in preventing reinfection.

Current guidelines are to treat a first episode of nonsevere uncomplicated CDI with oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10–14 days. Oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10–14 days has become the standard for treating severe CDI. Treatment of the first recurrence of CDI is usually conducted with the same regimen used to treat the initial episode, whereas tapered and/or pulsed doses of vancomycin are recommended for second and subsequent recurrences. Long-term treatment with metronidazole has been associated with cumulative neurotoxicity and is not recommended beyond the first recurrence.

Fidaxomicin is highly active against Gram-positive anaerobes and spares Bacteroides species that normally comprise a major constituent of fecal flora. In contrast, vancomycin and metronidazole have broader antimicrobial activity; vancomycin has been shown to reduce fecal Bacteroides counts by 3–4 logs.

Fidaxomicin has been compared with vancomycin for the treatment of CDI in 2 phase 3 trials. This report presents a subset analysis comparing the efficacy of fidaxomicin with the efficacy of vancomycin in preventing a second recurrence in patients who were enrolled in the trials after a recent single episode of CDI.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — first recurrence management and fidaxomicin outcomes: A first recurrence of CDI may be treated with oral vancomycin, vancomycin followed by a tapered and pulsed regimen, or fidaxomicin, and in a randomized, stratified substudy of first-recurrence patients a subsequent, second recurrence was less common with fidaxomicin than a standard 10-day vancomycin course (19.7% vs 35.5%; p = 0.045); recurrence rates are significantly lower following treatment of an initial CDI episode with fidaxomicin as compared to vancomycin.

### Experimental glycopeptide antibiotic EVG7 prevents recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection by sparing members of the lachnospiraceae family [^116n39q5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Oral vancomycin has a long history as the first-line treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but its use is associated with high relapse rates. Antibiotics that more selectively target C. difficile while sparing protective commensal gut bacteria, have the potential to prevent recurrent CDI (rCDI). Here, we investigate the experimental glycopeptide antibiotic, EVG7, in the context of rCDI. In vitro susceptibility assays reveal that clinical C. difficile isolates are up to 16-times more sensitive to EVG7 (MIC = 0.063–0.25 mg/L) compared to vancomycin (MIC = 0.5–2 mg/L). In a validated mouse model of rCDI in male mice, low dose oral EVG7 (0.04 mg/mL in drinking water) more effectively treats primary CDI and prevents recurrence, outperforming a 10-fold higher dose of vancomycin. Subsequent microbiome analysis and in vitro susceptibility testing reveal that EVG7 preserves Lachnospiraceae, a family of commensal bacteria associated with protection against C. difficile colonization.

### Does addition of intravenous metronidazole to oral vancomycin improve outcomes in Clostridioides difficile infection? [^114agLJN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend adding intravenous (IV) metronidazole to oral vancomycin for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). In this study, we compared dual therapy with IV metronidazole and vancomycin vs vancomycin monotherapy. We assessed prevalence of use and effectiveness of dual therapy in nonfulminant and fulminant CDI.

Methods

This was a 2-center retrospective study conducted from 2010 to 2018. Adult inpatients were included if they had a positive C. difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on an unformed stool and received vancomycin within 2 days of testing. Patients were classified as having received dual therapy if IV metronidazole was given within the same time window, and otherwise classified as vancomycin monotherapy. The primary outcome was death or colectomy within 90 days after the index test. Logistic regression modeling was used to adjust for CDI severity and other established predictors of CDI outcomes. CDI recurrence was examined as a secondary outcome, adjusting for death as a competing risk.

Results

The study included 2114 patients (dual therapy, 993; monotherapy, 1121); 23% met the primary outcome. There was no association between dual therapy and the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval, .79–1.45), which remained true when the analysis was restricted to patients with fulminant CDI (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, .65–2.10). There was also no association between dual therapy and CDI recurrence.

Conclusions

Dual therapy with IV metronidazole and vancomycin was common for nonfulminant and fulminant CDI but was not associated with improved outcomes compared with vancomycin alone.

IDSA/SHEA 2017 pediatric Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode or first recurrence of nonsevere disease: Either metronidazole or vancomycin is recommended for the treatment of children with an initial episode or first recurrence of nonsevere CDI (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Evidence indicates there are no RCTs comparing the use of these agents in children, and reported outcomes include a prospective series of 82 children in which 56 received metronidazole and 6 (11%) had treatment failure, and a cohort of 69 community-acquired CDI cases showing treatment failure 18% for metronidazole and 0% for vancomycin without a statistically significant difference. A physician survey found that 100% had treated children with CDI, but only 41%–79% treated mild CDI in children with underlying comorbidities, and complications and mortality from CDI in children are uncommon regardless of severity or antibiotic choice. Safety notes include that oral vancomycin is not absorbed with a lower risk of adverse effects than metronidazole, but vancomycin exposure promotes carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and available data suggest metronidazole use is also associated with this outcome.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TtWx6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis, we found that OVP was associated with a decreased risk of future CDI in patients with a prior history of CDI who required systemic antimicrobial therapy. However, there was no benefit of oral vancomycin as primary prophylaxis.

Oral vancomycin is well tolerated, with minimal systemic absorption from the gastrointestinal mucosa to result in toxicity or other systemic antimicrobial effects. It can be postulated that oral vancomycin might inhibit the growth of the vegetative form (but not spores) of C. difficile in patients with history of CDI who are on antibiotics, and, thus, prevent recurrence. At the same time, it should be considered that vancomycin leads to gut microbial dysbiosis. One study demonstrated that, in patients with CDI, the stool concentration of vancomycin remained adequately high for 3–5 days after completion of therapy to inhibit the in vitro growth of C. difficile. Therefore, it could be proposed that, in high-risk patients, vancomycin could be continued for 1–2 weeks after completion of the systemic antimicrobial therapy to continue inhibiting C. difficile growth. However, the risk of CDI continues to be high even 90 days after antibiotics, while continuing the use of vancomycin prophylaxis this long is practically difficult.

The principal concern while considering OVP would be that oral vancomycin will have a damaging effect on the microbiota of the colon and on whether OVP increases the risk of recurrent CDI following completion of therapy due to disruption of gut microbiota. A clinical trial comparing the efficacy of vancomycin, metronidazole, and placebo for eradication of asymptomatic C. difficile fecal excretion showed that vancomycin was temporarily effective, but, after 2 months, vancomycin was associated with a significantly higher rate of subsequent recolonization with new CDI strains compared with those on placebo or metronidazole. One study found that patients with CDI treated with oval vancomycin 125 mg four times per day had fecal concentrations of the drug 500–1000 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations against C. difficile, suggesting lower doses of once or twice daily could be sufficient as a prophylactic dose.

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^112x3k9Z]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Consensus guidelines can be of great utility in forming the framework for developing institution-specific treatment pathways for managing various infectious diseases and establishing evidence-based standard of care. The 2021 IDSA/SHEA guidelines for the management of CDI primarily based recommendations on the findings of 4 clinical trials that they included in a pooled analysis. In their analysis, the combined rates of sustained clinical response at 4 weeks was significantly increased among those receiving FDX compared to VAN. However, sustained clinical response at 90 days and mortality were no different between groups. Despite the lack of observed benefit in sustained clinical cure beyond 30 days or mortality, the guidelines recommend FDX as first-line therapy. The rationale outlined in the IDSA/SHEA guidance for FDX as prefered therapy include: (1) high value is placed on avoiding rCDI based on quality of life indicators, (2) use of FDX, despite the high acquisition cost, is cost-effective based on cost-effectiveness analyses, (3) FDX may be more feasible with regard to less frequent dosing, (4) is acceptable to patients and their providers. Following the availability of the 2021 IDSA/SHEA update to the CDI management guidelines recommending with the moderate certainty evidence the preference for FDX based on the pooled analyses, we opted to change our institutional pathway to recommend FDX as first-line therapy. However, due the cost of therapy and known challenges with insurance coverage we added the requirement that patients have at least one risk factor for CDI recurrence in an attempt to target patients most likely to benefit. With this change, our medical center experienced a significant increase in expenditures on FDX and our utilization compared to other similar medical centers based on benchmarking data was an evident outlier. We also invest a large amount of clinician, clinical pharmacist, and antimicrobial stewardship workforce time in reviewing patients with CDI by ensuring appropriate treatment selection and facilitating outpatient coverage of FDX for patients who may be discharged prior to completion of their CDI therapy. Given these factors, it was pertinent to complete this review of outcomes data to ensure that this practice is resulting in meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes for our patients. With the findings of this study, the preference for FDX, at least in patients meeting our high risk for rCDI criteria, is not seemingly justified. As a result, we intend to make changes to our institutional CDI treatment pathway.

These guidelines were also the first to acknowledge that some patients are unable to take oral intake either due to an ileus or other medical co-morbidities. Given this, they recommended instilling vancomycin directly via enema. This was a foundational addition that was clinically relevant and remains in the current guidelines as well.

The novelty of this guideline continued by recommending a vancomycin taper or pulse as treatment of recurrent CDI. A 'taper' is defined as slowly decreasing the dose of the medication over an extended period of time and a 'pulse' involves giving a fixed dose on a schedule that skips days between medication administration. Theoretically, a taper will continue to suppress C. difficile from proliferating while the lower dose will minimize 'collateral' damage to the microbiota, allowing the microbiota to rejuvenate and minimizing the risk of recurrence. A pulse is believed to work by mimicking the life cycle of CDI and therefore minimizing the ability of the bacterium to proliferate. The most quoted study to validate a taper/pulse method was that by McFarland and colleagues, who took a cohort from another trial considering Saccharomyces boullardii to prevent recurrent CDI and assessed those patients who recurred who did not receive the S. boullardii and randomized them to receive either vancomycin 1 g per day for 7–14 days, vancomycin 2 g per day for 7–14 days, a taper of vancomycin, or a pulse of vancomycin. It turned out that those who received the high dose vancomycin recurred frequently, those who received the tapered dose recurred 31.0%, while those that received a pulse recurred 14.3%. Studies such as this supported adding these alternative treatment regimens to the guidelines. Within the 2009 European guideline, a vancomycin taper or pulse was reserved for those patients with two or more recurrences given a shortage of well-controlled trials to assess this regimen's efficacy.

### Cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for Clostridioides difficile infection: an evaluation of the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines [^1177AY38]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2018, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI). However, there is little guidance regarding which treatments are cost-effective.

Methods

We used a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with an initial CDI diagnosis. We used the model to estimate the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the recently published 2018 IDSA guidelines. The model includes stratification by the severity of the initial infection, and subsequent likelihood of cure, recurrence, mortality, and outcomes of subsequent recurrences. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results

Use of fidaxomicin for nonsevere initial CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for subsequent recurrence (strategy 44) cost an additional $478 for 0.009 QALYs gained per CDI patient, resulting in an ICER of $31 751 per QALY, below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. This is the optimal, cost-effective CDI treatment strategy.

Conclusions

Metronidazole is suboptimal for nonsevere CDI as it is less beneficial than alternative strategies. The preferred treatment regimen is fidaxomicin for nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrence. The most effective treatments, with highest cure rates, are also cost-effective due to averted mortality, utility loss, and costs of rehospitalization and/or further treatments for recurrent CDI.

### Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a review of risk factors, treatments, and outcomes [^115KRtmn]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Episodes of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are difficult to treat for several reasons. Foremost, data are lacking to support any particular treatment strategy. In addition, treatment of recurrent episodes is not always successful, and repeated, prolonged treatment is often necessary. Identification of subgroups at risk for recurrent CDI may aid in diagnosing and treating these patients. Two likely mechanistic factors increasing the risk of recurrent CDI are an inadequate immune response to C. difficile toxins and persistent disruption of the normal colonic flora. Important epidemiologic risk factors include advanced age, continuation of other antibiotics, and prolonged hospital stays. Current guidelines recommend that the first recurrent episode be treated with the same agent (i.e., metronidazole or vancomycin) used for the index episode. However, if the first recurrence is characterized as severe, vancomycin should be used. A reasonable strategy for managing a subsequent episode involves tapering followed by pulsed doses of vancomycin. Other potentially effective strategies for recurrent CDI include vancomycin with adjunctive treatments, such as Saccharomyces boulardii, rifaximin "chaser" therapy after vancomycin, nitazoxanide, fecal transplantation, and intravenous immunoglobulin. New treatment agents that are active against C. difficile, but spare critical components of the normal flora, may decrease the incidence of recurrent CDI.

### Administration of spores of nontoxigenic Clostridium difficile strain M3 for prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1176wfvd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of health care-associated infection in US hospitals. Recurrence occurs in 25% to 30% of patients.

Objective

To determine the safety, fecal colonization, recurrence rate, and optimal dosing schedule of nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 (VP20621; NTCD-M3) for prevention of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study conducted from June 2011 to June 2013 among 173 patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed as having CDI (first episode or first recurrence) and had successfully completed treatment with metronidazole, oral vancomycin, or both at 44 study centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 treatments: oral liquid formulation of NTCD-M3, 10⁴ spores/d for 7 days (n = 43), 10⁷ spores/d for 7 days (n = 44), or 10⁷ spores/d for 14 days (n = 42), or placebo for 14 days (n = 44).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was safety and tolerability of NTCD-M3 within 7 days of treatment. Exploratory secondary outcomes included fecal colonization with NTCD-M3 from end of study drug through week 6 and CDI recurrence from day 1 through week 6.

Results

Among 168 patients who started treatment, 157 completed treatment. One or more treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 78% of patients receiving NTCD-M3 and 86% of patients receiving placebo. Diarrhea and abdominal pain were reported in 46% and 17% of patients receiving NTCD-M3 and 60% and 33% of placebo patients, respectively. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 7% of patients receiving placebo and 3% of all patients who received NTCD-M3. Headache was reported in 10% of patients receiving NTCD-M3 and 2% of placebo patients. Fecal colonization occurred in 69% of NTCD-M3 patients: 71% with 10⁷ spores/d and 63% with 10⁴ spores/d. Recurrence of CDI occurred in 13 (30%) of 43 placebo patients and 14 (11%) of 125 NTCD-M3 patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11–0.69; p = 0.006); the lowest recurrence was in 2 (5%) of 43 patients receiving 10⁷ spores/d for 7 days (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0–0.6; p = 0.01 vs placebo]). Recurrence occurred in 2 (2%) of 86 patients who were colonized vs 12 (31%) of 39 patients who received NTCD-M3 and were not colonized (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00–0.05; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with CDI who clinically recovered following treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin, oral administration of spores of NTCD-M3 was well tolerated and appeared to be safe. Nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 colonized the gastrointestinal tract and significantly reduced CDI recurrence.

### Treatment of first recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection: fidaxomicin versus vancomycin [^116wkuKj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Population

Patients with toxin-positive CDI were recruited to 2 phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (NCT00314951 and NCT00468728). A separate stratum was constructed of patients who had experienced a single prior CDI episode within 3 months of the current CDI episode. Patients were recruited in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Eligible patients were aged > 15 years, had a diagnosis of CDI, and had received no more than 24 hours of pretreatment with vancomycin or metronidazole. Concomitant treatment with other potentially effective treatments for CDI was not allowed. Of 1164 patients enrolled in both trials, 178 (15%) were enrolled for treatment of a first recurrence. Clostridium difficile infection was defined as a change in bowel habits, with > 3 unformed bowel movements (or > 200 mL of unformed stool for patients with rectal collection devices) in the 24 hours before randomization and the presence of C. difficile toxin A or B in the stool within 48 hours of randomization. All patients gave written informed consent.

Study Design and Conduct

Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) or vancomycin (125 mg 4 times daily) for 10 days. The main outcome of this analysis was recurrence (diarrhea and positive stool toxin test) within 28 days after completing treatment. Patients were evaluable for recurrence if they were followed up for 28 ± 2 days from the end of treatment and did not receive additional CDI therapy. Results are given for the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol groups.

Fecal samples collected before the first dose of study drug, at the end of treatment, and at recurrence of symptoms were assayed for toxins A and B, which were assessed by the standard tests used at the local site laboratory. Patients were asked to record self-administration of study drugs and CDI symptoms, including number and consistency of bowel movements.

Safety was assessed by interview, recording of adverse events, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and other evaluations.

### Uncertain benefits of oral vancomycin for recurrent C. difficile infection… [^1156ahKu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

They chose the regimen recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines. 3 Most of the prior studies dosed the vancomycin differently, with 1 study using a higher dose of 250 mg twice daily. 4 They used 2-step testing, using culture with the final diagnosis made by enzyme-linked immunoassay for both toxins A and B. If the enzyme-linked immunoassay was negative, stool was sent out for cell cytotoxicity. Positive stool cultures were tested by polymerase chain reaction, which was used to confirm the presence of the toxin B gene. The study demonstrated the benefit of daily vancomycin with a 13. 5% decrease in recurrences. 2 Although it did not reach statistical significance because the study was underpowered, the reduction appears to be a clinically meaningful result. What is striking, however, is how high the rates of recurrence were in both the treatment and placebo groups.

2 There was no difference in rCDI outcomes when evaluating subgroups at particularly high risk of rCDI, although the numbers were small. The risk of recurrence increased with the number of episodes of CDI, so knowing the number of prior recurrences in the patients enrolled would be helpful in interpretation of the results. Those data were not reported. It is noted that the participants also provided a baseline stool sample or perirectal swab prior to randomization. It was not noted what percentage of patients had detectable C difficile colonization in the stool prior to initiation of the study. Follow-up of 8 weeks is sufficient to capture most, if not all, of the recurrent episodes.

The current study2 supports the use of vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention of rCDI in patients receiving antibacterial treatment for alternative indications within 180 days of the CDI episode. The small sample size limits the ability to provide conclusive evidence of efficacy. A large multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial will be necessary to answer this question definitively. It will also provide more evidence of the effects on the gut microbiota and allow clinicians to weigh the risks and benefits of vancomycin prophylaxis.
