## Question

Can iron pills be crushed and chewed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether iron pills can be crushed and chewed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific iron formulation, because the answer depends on whether it's a chewable tablet, an enteric-coated or extended-release tablet, or a standard immediate-release ferrous salt. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says for each type. Next, I will consider the pharmacologic rationale for not crushing or chewing certain formulations. After that, I should review any exceptions where crushing is acceptable or even intended. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and note any absorption or tolerability implications if a tablet is altered against labeling instructions.

> Let me first confirm the key distinction: some iron products are designed to be chewed, whereas others explicitly instruct not to chew or crush. I need to check examples of each to anchor the guidance. Chewable iron products include certain ferrous fumarate–containing contraceptive packs and a standalone iron–folate chewable tablet, both of which are labeled for chewing or dissolving in the mouth, indicating formulation-specific safety and palatability considerations [^8d0969b8] [^86838a5d]. By contrast, multiple iron products carry explicit "do not chew, crush, or split" warnings, including ferric citrate/Auryxia due to mouth and teeth discoloration, ferric maltol/Accrufer capsules, and several ferrous sulfate enteric-coated tablets, which are coated to protect the stomach or to modify release kinetics [^4cd8315c] [^0de665f6] [^7cc511ef] [^a0b50396] [^f8c724bd] [^71f66932] [^bc17d6ec].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for not crushing or chewing enteric-coated or extended-release iron. Enteric coatings are intended to delay dissolution until the small intestine to reduce gastric irritation; crushing bypasses that protection and can increase GI side effects like nausea, dyspepsia, and constipation, which are already common with ferrous salts and can worsen adherence [^2bcd92de] [^f8c724bd]. I should also confirm that slow-release ferrous formulations have been criticized for poor efficacy because iron may be released past the duodenum/jejunum where absorption is optimal; nonetheless, if a product is enteric-coated, altering it still risks both reduced efficacy and more GI upset, so I should advise against crushing those unless a clinician specifically directs otherwise [^7e0a572d] [^2bcd92de].

> Hold on, I should verify the cosmetic and safety issues with ferric citrate. The FDA labeling for ferric citrate/Auryxia repeatedly warns that chewing or crushing can cause discoloration of the mouth and teeth, which is a direct, formulation-specific reason to avoid manipulation even if it might not change systemic absorption dramatically in all cases [^4cd8315c] [^0de665f6] [^7cc511ef]. Let me reconsider whether any exception is made; I do not see labeled exceptions for ferric citrate, so the instruction stands to swallow whole and not chew or crush [^4cd8315c] [^0de665f6] [^7cc511ef].

> Next, I should review the chewable iron products to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Several contraceptive brands incorporate ferrous fumarate tablets that are explicitly labeled as chewable, with instructions to chew and swallow, sometimes with a full glass of water, confirming that chewing is intended and safe for those specific formulations [^8d0969b8] [^d1c89a58] [^b9e0747d] [^d4a725d7]. I also need to check the standalone iron–folate chewable; yes, it instructs to dissolve in the mouth or chew before swallowing, again reflecting formulation design rather than a universal rule for all iron tablets [^86838a5d].

> But wait, what if someone cannot swallow tablets at all? I should double-check whether any iron products allow sprinkling or mixing. Ferric maltol/Accrufer capsules are labeled "swallow whole; do not open, break, or chew", so that remains a no-go for manipulation, whereas some non-iron extended-release opioids provide a bead-sprinkling option; that analogy does not translate to iron products here, so I should not infer it applies to iron without evidence or labeling support [^a0b50396] [^3fe26271]. If dysphagia is a persistent issue, the safer path is to switch to a liquid ferrous salt or a chewable formulation rather than altering a tablet meant to be swallowed whole, and I should confirm that this aligns with guideline preferences for ferrous salts as first-line and with practical administration advice [^2bcd92de] [^26134a7d].

> I will now examine the absorption implications briefly, because patients often ask whether crushing helps. Let me verify whether particle size changes improve or impair absorption. Evidence suggests that in some contexts, smaller particle size or altered formulations can reduce absorption due to increased interaction with dietary inhibitors or altered dissolution timing; for example, a powdered ferric pyrophosphate supplement showed lower bioavailability than a ferrous fumarate tablet, and crushed tablets may behave differently than intact tablets in ways that do not necessarily improve uptake, so I should caution that crushing does not guarantee better absorption and may worsen tolerability [^d36633b6] [^c5e76168]. Conversely, alternate-day dosing strategies that avoid hepcidin-mediated blockade can improve fractional absorption without needing to crush tablets, which is a more evidence-aligned approach if absorption is the concern [^bde6cc85] [^daad4201].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-first answer. No, iron pills cannot universally be crushed or chewed; it depends entirely on the formulation. Chewing is appropriate only for products explicitly labeled as chewable or designed to be dissolved/chewed, whereas enteric-coated, extended-release, or ferric citrate tablets should not be crushed or chewed due to GI protection loss, altered release, or teeth/mouth discoloration risks. If swallowing is difficult, switch to a liquid ferrous salt or a chewable iron product rather than manipulating a tablet against its labeling, and coordinate with a clinician to ensure dosing and absorption remain adequate [^8d0969b8] [^86838a5d] [^4cd8315c] [^0de665f6] [^7cc511ef] [^a0b50396] [^e48553b8] [^71f66932] [^bc17d6ec] [^2bcd92de].

In general, **iron pills should not be crushed or chewed** unless the product is specifically labeled as chewable or designed for that purpose [^86838a5d]. Crushing or chewing can cause **gastrointestinal irritation**, **tooth discoloration**, and may alter absorption or release characteristics, especially with enteric-coated or extended-release formulations [^4cd8315c] [^e48553b8]. If swallowing is difficult, consider liquid iron, alternate-day dosing, or parenteral iron rather than altering tablets [^66e48c4d] [^e894aa8b]. Always follow the specific product label and consult a clinician before modifying administration.

## Risks and consequences of crushing or chewing iron pills

### Gastrointestinal irritation and side effects

Crushing or chewing iron pills — especially enteric-coated or extended-release formulations — can cause **significant gastrointestinal irritation**. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [^1d3a5465]. These effects can reduce adherence and lead to discontinuation of therapy [^b1d847e6].

---

### Tooth discoloration and oral irritation

Chewing iron pills can cause **tooth discoloration** and oral irritation, particularly with ferric citrate formulations [^4cd8315c]. The FDA specifically warns against chewing or crushing ferric citrate tablets due to the risk of mouth and teeth discoloration [^0de665f6].

---

### Altered absorption and efficacy

Crushing or chewing enteric-coated or extended-release iron pills can alter their absorption characteristics, potentially reducing efficacy. Enteric coatings are designed to protect the stomach and ensure release in the small intestine; crushing bypasses this, causing **premature release and reduced absorption** [^7e0a572d].

---

## Specific formulations and their instructions

| **Formulation** | **Instructions regarding crushing or chewing** |
|-|-|
| Ferric citrate (Auryxia) | Do not chew or crush; swallow whole [^4cd8315c] [^0de665f6] |
| Ferrous sulfate enteric-coated tablets | Do not crush or chew; swallow whole [^e48553b8] [^71f66932] [^bc17d6ec] |
| Ferric maltol (Accrufer) | Do not open, break, or chew capsules; swallow whole [^a0b50396] |
| Chewable iron tablets (e.g. ferrous fumarate chewables) | Designed to be chewed; follow product instructions [^86838a5d] [^8d0969b8] |

## Alternative strategies for patients with difficulty swallowing

For patients who have difficulty swallowing iron pills, consider the following alternatives:

- **Liquid iron supplements**: Liquid formulations are available and may be easier to administer, particularly for pediatric or geriatric patients [^f8c724bd].

- **Alternate-day dosing**: Recent evidence suggests that alternate-day dosing of oral iron may improve absorption and reduce gastrointestinal side effects, potentially improving adherence [^bde6cc85] [^daad4201].

- **Parenteral iron therapy**: Intravenous iron may be considered for patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron, or when rapid repletion is required [^e894aa8b] [^c226577c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized treatment** and adherence to product-specific instructions. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends starting with one tablet per day of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate, and if not tolerated, considering alternate-day dosing or alternative preparations [^26134a7d] [^66e48c4d]. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) similarly recommends individualized dosing strategies and consideration of alternative formulations if side effects occur [^2bcd92de].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not crush or chew iron pills** unless the product is specifically labeled as chewable or designed for that purpose [^86838a5d].

- **Follow product-specific instructions** and consult a healthcare provider before modifying administration [^4cd8315c].

- **Consider alternative formulations** (liquid iron, alternate-day dosing, or parenteral iron) if swallowing difficulties or side effects occur [^66e48c4d] [^e894aa8b].

---

Crushing or chewing iron pills is generally **not recommended** due to risks of gastrointestinal irritation, tooth discoloration, and altered absorption. Always follow product-specific instructions and consult a healthcare provider for individualized solutions.

### Daprodustat (Jesduvroq) [^6f5d23c7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Pre-Treatment and On-Treatment Evaluations of Anemia, Iron Stores, and Liver Tests

Evaluation of Anemia and Iron Stores

Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating JESDUVROQ. Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment with JESDUVROQ. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 ng/ml or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy.

Liver Testing

Assess serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin prior to initiation of JESDUVROQ. Repeat the liver tests if the patient develops signs or symptoms that could be consistent with liver disease during treatment with JESDUVROQ.

2.2 Important Dosing Information

Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of JESDUVROQ sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin higher than 11 g/dL.

JESDUVROQ can be taken with or without food, and without regard to concomitant administration of iron or phosphate binders [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

JESDUVROQ should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

JESDUVROQ can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose of JESDUVROQ is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is the same day as the next dose. In this case, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose taken at the usual time. Double-doses should not be taken to make-up for a missed dose.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^8454246e]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Proquin XR and other oral formulations of ciprofloxacin are not interchangeable. Proquin XR should be administered orally once daily for 3 days with a main meal of the day, preferably the evening meal. Proquin XR should be administered at least 4 hours before or 2 hours after antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, sucralfate, VIDEX®(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations containing zinc.

Proquin XR tablets should be taken whole and never split, crushed, or chewed. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions)

Impaired Renal Function:

Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternate pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is required for patient with uUTI and mild to moderate renal impairment. The efficacy of Proquin XR has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use)

Impaired Liver Function:

No dosage adjustment is required with Proquin XR in patients with stable chronic cirrhosis. However, the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency have not been fully elucidated. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations)

While patients have been known to aspirate pills, they virtually never persist long enough to lead to complications. A spectrum of events, however, may arise especially from iron pill aspiration. If not identified and removed early, cytotoxic damage from local free-radical generation may result in airway damage. We report a case of an aspirated iron pill, which did not disintegrate and presented with chronic cough. Imaging revealed a foreign body in the right bronchus, and bronchoscopic removal allowed resolution of an associated pneumonia, without any further symptoms on subsequent surveillance.

2.1 Recommended Dosage and Administration

The recommended starting total daily dosage of CUVRIOR in adult patients is 300 mg up to 3,000 mg taken orally in divided doses (two times daily). Table 1 provides the recommended starting total daily dosage of CUVRIOR in adult patients switching from penicillamine to CUVRIOR [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Discontinue penicillamine before starting CUVRIOR.

Adjust the total daily dosage of CUVRIOR according to clinical assessment and laboratory monitoring of copper [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The total daily dosage of CUVRIOR should not exceed 3,000 mg.

If the number of CUVRIOR tablets prescribed per day cannot be equally divided among doses, then divide the total daily dosage such that the higher number of tablets is administered with the first daily dose. Table 2 provides the recommended approach to administration of CUVRIOR tablets to achieve the total daily dosage.

2.2 Important Administration Instructions

Discontinue penicillamine before starting CUVRIOR [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
Administer CUVRIOR on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals and at least 1 hour apart from any other food or milk.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol and ferrous fumarate (nexesta Fe) [^b9e0747d]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Instructions For Use

Nexesta Fe (neks-ey-stuh Fe) (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable))

Important Information about taking Nexesta Fe

Take 1 pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your blister pack.
Both the white to off-white pills and the brown pills may be swallowed whole or chewed and swallowed. If the pill is chewed, drink a full glass (8 ounces) of liquid immediately after swallowing.
Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) you could get pregnant. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.
If you have trouble remembering to take Nexesta Fe, talk to your healthcare provider. When you first start taking Nexesta Fe, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.
You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking Nexesta Fe. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.
Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.
It is not uncommon to miss a period. However, if you miss a period and have not taken Nexesta Fe according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Nexesta Fe.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, take another pill of the same color from your extra blister pack. If you do not have an extra blister pack, take the next pill in your blister pack. Continue taking all your remaining pills in order. Start the first pill of your next blister pack the day after finishing your current blister pack. This will be 1 day earlier than originally scheduled. Continue on your new schedule.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea for more than 1 day, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use an additional birth control method, like condoms and a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.
Stop taking Nexesta Fe at least 4 weeks before you have major surgery and do not restart after the surgery without asking your healthcare provider. Be sure to use other forms of contraception (like condoms and spermicide) during this time period.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Relative bioavailability of iron and folic acid from a new powdered supplement compared to a traditional tablet in pregnant women [^d36633b6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Deficiencies of iron and folic acid during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the fetus, thus supplements are recommended. Adherence to current tablet-based supplements is documented to be poor. Recently a powdered form of micronutrients has been developed which may decrease side-effects and thus improve adherence. However, before testing the efficacy of the supplement as an alternate choice for supplementation during pregnancy, the bioavailability of the iron needs to be determined. Our objective was to measure the relative bioavailability of iron and folic acid from a powdered supplement that can be sprinkled on semi-solid foods or beverages versus a traditional tablet supplement in pregnant women.

Methods

Eighteen healthy pregnant women (24–32 weeks gestation) were randomized to receive the supplements in a crossover design. Following ingestion of each supplement, the changes (over baseline) in serum iron and folate over 8 hours were determined. The powdered supplement contained 30 mg of iron as micronized dispersible ferric pyrophosphate with an emulsifier coating and 600 μg folic acid; the tablet contained 27 mg iron from ferrous fumarate and 1000 μg folic acid.

Results

Overall absorption of iron from the powdered supplement was significantly lower than the tablet (p = 0.003). There was no difference in the overall absorption of folic acid between supplements. Based on the differences in the area under the curve and doses, the relative bioavailability of iron from powdered supplement was lower than from the tablet (0.22).

Conclusion

The unexpected lower bioavailability of iron from the powdered supplement is contrary to previously published reports. However, since pills and capsules are known to be poorly accepted by some women during pregnancy, it is reasonable to continue to explore alternative micronutrient delivery systems and forms of iron for this purpose.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bba815d5]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts remain the mainstay of oral iron supplementation. Their high efficacy is offset by poor tolerability and reduced compliance, which sparked the development of alternative oral iron supplements. Recent studies with ferrous sulfate provided new insights on optimal dosage and frequency. Additional adequately powered RCT are required to address open questions on efficacy, side effects, optimal dosage and frequency of different types of oral iron supplements for selected groups of patients. As none of the old or new oral iron formulations has shown non-inferiority versus intravenous iron, comparisons against the gold standard (ferrous sulfate) would be more informative. The effects of oral iron supplements on hepcidin should also be investigated in animal models and clinical studies. Based on current knowledge, the choice between iron formulations should depend on the individual's iron status, tolerance, absorption capacity, and specific therapeutic goals.

Conclusion

The lower bioavailability of the iron in the powdered supplement was unexpected and contrary to previously published reports. Since pills and capsules are known to be poorly accepted by some women during pregnancy, especially those with significant morning sickness, we believe it is reasonable to continue to look for alternative delivery systems and forms of iron for this purpose.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^f8c724bd]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of oral iron supplements

There are various types of oral iron supplements (Table 1). The two major classes are ferrous (Fe 2+) salts and ferric (Fe 3+) complexes. Other types include carbonyl iron and heme iron polypeptide.

Ferrous salts

The most common oral iron supplements are ferrous salts with sulfate, fumarate or gluconate. Others include ferrous glycine sulfate, bisglycinate, ascorbate, carbonate, tartrate, iodine, chloride, sodium citrate, aspartate or succinate.

Ferrous salts are available as tablets or syrup. Because dissolved Fe 2+ is readily oxidized to insoluble Fe 3+, a main challenge for liquid supplements is to maintain Fe 2+ reduced; this is done with the addition of excipients such as sodium bisulfite. Slow-release (enteric-coated) ferrous salt formulations have also been designed with the aim of reducing gastrointestinal adverse effects, while preserving iron absorption.

Deferasirox, the only oral iron chelator approved in the US and Canada, achieved a pediatric label indication down to 2 years of age. FDA-mandated post-marketing safety surveillance in children under age 6 is ongoing. We wish to raise a non-safety-related concern with deferasirox chelation in very young children (2–5 years old). Specifically, the circumstances required for reliable daily ingestion of deferasirox do not mesh well with the developmental characteristics common in young children, which may limit adherence and cause parental distress. We review developmental challenges associated with oral chelation in this age group and provide suggestions to improve adherence in this population.

### Relative bioavailability of iron and folic acid from a new powdered supplement compared to a traditional tablet in pregnant women [^c5e76168]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Given the documented importance of vitamin and mineral supplementation during pregnancy and the relatively poor adherence to currently available supplements, our goal was to develop a supplement that was efficacious in terms of iron and folic acid bioavailability, yet could potentially result in improved adherence. Thus, we investigated the absorption kinetics of a micronized dispersible form of ferric pyrophosphate (MDFP) with an emulsifier coating and folic acid in a powdered multivitamin supplement in healthy pregnant women versus ferrous fumarate (non-encapsulated) in a traditional tablet supplement. Both iron and folic acid were absorbed from the powdered supplement, however based on the differences in the area under the curve (AUC) and doses, the relative bioavailability of iron from powdered supplement was lower than from the tablet supplement (0.22), while folic acid was greater (1.8).

In children, powdered supplements which included encapsulated ferrous fumarate as the iron source were shown to be equally as effective as ferrous sulfate drops at reducing the incidence of iron deficiency anemia but with improved adherence. Using stable isotopes, it was directly demonstrated that 8.3% of the encapsulated ferrous fumarate was absorbed in iron-deficient anemic children compared to 4.3% in iron deficient and iron sufficient children. The MDFP in the powdered supplement in the present study had a distinctly different absorption curve from the ferrous fumarate in the tablet supplement. It is possible that the emulsifier coating on the MDFP delayed or reduced absorption of the iron by keeping the iron suspended within the gastric lumen for a longer period of time compared to the iron in the tablet thereby increasing its interaction with dietary inhibitors or allowing the MDFP to exit the stomach and duodenum without being dissolved. Other factors may also have influenced the bioavailability of the iron in the powdered supplement. Navarro et al showed distinctly different curves in the absorption kinetics of iron in the comparison of a whole versus crushed tablet with the crushed tablet having a lower absorption than the whole tablet. It is possible that the smaller particle size in the crushed form may enhance micronutrient interactions resulting in reduced absorption of the iron, whereas the tablet form may offer some protection from dietary inhibitors. Alternatively, the combination of powder form and emulsifier coating could delay both the reduction of a portion of the ferric form of iron to the ferrous form by dietary acids as well as the transport of the ferric iron into the enterocyte by the Integrin-Mobilferrin pathway.

### Relative abuse of crush-resistant prescription opioid tablets via alternative oral modes of administration [^55bc13c9]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This observational study investigated the relative use of various oral MOAs of currently marketed crush-resistant tablets formulated to have abuse-deterrent properties. The primary findings in this study were that, among those abusers who continue to abuse the crush-resistant tablets, ASI-MV respondents were more likely to report manipulation prior to oral abuse of CRTs compared with non-CRT comparators. More specifically, among those who abuse the opioid analgesics orally, CRTs were less likely than non-CRT comparators to be swallowed whole and more likely to be chewed. CRTs were also more likely than most comparators to be dissolved in the mouth (i.e. sucked on).

Prior studies suggest that some CRTs intended to deter abuse show promise for reducing nonoral abuse when compared with the non-CRT versions. While achieving the goal of reducing nonoral abuse is consistent with the FDA guidance on evaluating abuse deterrence, the guidance is clear that such formulations may not prevent oral abuse. The same point is made in the recently published CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic noncancer pain, which states that 1) while abuse-deterrent technologies may be expected to make manipulation of opioids more difficult or less rewarding, they do not prevent opioid abuse through oral intake, which is the most common route of opioid abuse, 2) CRTs formulated to deter abuse can still be abused by nonoral routes, and 3) an abuse-deterrent label does not guarantee that there is no risk for abuse.

The literature on CRTs thus far appears to assume that a CRT that effectively reduces use by nonoral routes will, more or less inevitably, result in a shift to oral abuse of the products. So far, however, the existing literature does not distinguish between oral, "as-intended" administration (swallowing a tablet whole) and other oral MOAs that involve product manipulation before swallowing. There is a general consensus that chewing in particular has been a popular and effective way for individuals to extract the API from ER formulations in order to achieve a more potent and rapid rewarding effect. By examining the different MOAs used by oral abusers, the present study sheds light on this question, suggesting that when a CRT is marketed, at least part of the response by abusers to greater difficulty insufflating or injecting is to use the product by tampering prior to oral abuse.

3.0 Treatment and Monitoring of CH

3.1 Initial treatment and therapeutic regimens

Recommendations

3.1.1 L-T 4 alone is recommended as the treatment of choice for CH (1|⊕⊕○).

3.1.2 Treatment with L-T 4 should be started as soon as possible, and no later than the first 2 weeks of life or immediately after confirmatory serum test results in infants identified in a second routine screening test. We recommend an initial L-T 4 dose of 10 to 15 μg/kg per day. Infants with severe disease, as defined by a very low pretreatment TT 4 or FT4 concentration, should be treated with the highest initial dose, and those with a mild to moderate hypothyroidism with a lower dose (1|⊕⊕○).

3.1.3 L-T 4 should be administered orally. If oral administration is not possible, it can also be administered iv, in which case the iv dose should be no more than 80% the oral dose. The dose should then be adjusted according to TSH and FT4 determinations (1|⊕⊕○).

3.1.4 We recommend the administration of L-T 4 in tablet form. In neonates and infants, the tablets can be crushed and administered via a small spoon, with suspension, if necessary, in a few milliliters of water or breast milk. L-T 4 can also be administered in liquid form, but only if pharmaceutically produced and licensed L-T 4 solutions are available (1|⊕⊕○). A brand rather than a generic formulation is recommended in CH, at least in infancy (2|⊕⊕○).

### The impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation during pregnancy: a pilot randomized trial [^5d6c140f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Oral iron is first-line medication for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We conducted a pilot randomized trial to investigate the impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation started early in pregnancy on women without anemia for 4 main outcomes: recruitment and protocol compliance, adherence, maintenance of maternal hemoglobin, and side effects. At antenatal clinic visits, participants were allocated to 1 of 3 trial arms in a 1:1:1 ratio: 200 mg ferrous sulfate daily, alternate days, or 3 times per week. The participants were followed to delivery. Baseline characteristics of 300 recruited participants were well matched between trial arms. The mean proportion of tablets taken as expected per participant was 82.5% overall (72.3%, 89.6%, and 84.5% for the daily, alternate days, and 3 times a week arm, respectively). There was a lower overall adherence rate in the daily arm (47%) than in the alternate days (62%) and the 3 times per week (61%) arms. A reduction in hemoglobin between randomization and 28 weeks' gestation seemed smaller for the daily arm. A range of side effects were commonly reported at baseline before starting interventions and at later antenatal visits. Many side effects of iron overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms. A daily iron dosing schedule might give the best opportunity for delivering an adequate iron load during pregnancy in women without anemia. Further randomized trials powered on clinical outcomes are needed to establish the clinical effectiveness of oral iron supplementation to prevent iron deficiency anemia. This study was registered (#ISRCTN12911644).

### Dosing patients with oral iron supplements: practical guidance [^03374b2a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron is an essential trace element that is important for the development, structure, and functioning of the brain. Iron has been both favorably and unfavorably implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, iron adequacy in pregnancy and early childhood has been suggested to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia, but iron mechanisms have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. Supplemental iron may be indicated to treat restless legs syndrome, akathisia, and pica, but more commonly to treat iron deficiency associated with poor nutrition in major mental illness. Supplemental iron is commonly orally administered but is poorly absorbed by this route. It is therefore necessary to know what improves and what impairs iron absorption. This article explains that, for best absorption, oral iron supplements are ideally dosed as ferrous salts. The dose should be administered in the morning, on a fasting stomach, along with about 100 mg of vitamin C in the form of a tablet, or with a glass of orange or other citrus juice. If neither vitamin C nor citrus juice is available, as a poorer option, iron should be dosed with plain water. Absorption is markedly reduced if iron is administered in the afternoon, or with food such as cereals and other grains, or with beverages such as milk, tea, and coffee. Calcium supplements, antacids, H2 inhibitors, and proton pump inhibitors also reduce the absorption of orally administered iron. Some data suggest that alternate day dosing improves fractional iron absorption as well as reduces adverse effects of treatment. Finally, to reduce the risk of pill esophagitis, iron should be dosed with a full glass of liquid, and the patient should not recline or lie down for at least the next 30–60 min.

### Practical problems with medication use that older people experience: a qualitative study [^6906428f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Drug Taking

Twenty-eight problems related to the taking of medicines were reported. One of these problems concerned lodging of the medicine in the mouth or throat (n = 17). For one participant, who used alendronic acid, this was considered to have the potential to cause discomfort or clinical deterioration due to the possible development of esophageal ulceration (Table 2).

It's just that I think the tablet is too big to swallow. I drink a lot of warm water. Then it doesn't get stuck. And you are not allowed to break the tablet, so I take it with a lot of water, warm or hot water. (Female, 83 years, alendronic acid 70 mg)

Problems with the flavor of medicines were reported (n = 10). One participant reported swallowing medicines with yogurt to mask the taste. One of these medicines was ferrous fumarate. This was considered to have the potential to cause discomfort or clinical deterioration by decreasing absorption of iron (Table 2):

I start in the morning with seven, and that is an awful lot. Because sometimes you really hate to chew on them. I say chew because they are quite difficult to consume properly. Nowadays I take those that don't go down so well with a little yogurt. I do this with the large one, but also with the small ones, because one of them is bitter. And this is usually quite unpleasant.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^ffdb46f2]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron is essential for oxygen transport, respiration and several biochemical functions by virtue of its ability to form coordination complexes and shuttle between its ferrous (Fe 2+) and ferric (Fe 3+) forms. However, redox reactivity renders iron potentially toxic and excess, unshielded iron promotes oxidative tissue damage. Thus, a balanced iron supply is important, as both iron deficiency and overload cause morbidity.

While iron is abundant, its bioavailability is low. This poses a risk of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) or non-anemic iron deficiency (ID), which are managed by oral (and in specific cases intravenous) iron replacement therapy. During the last years, new oral iron formulations have been added to many already available, while several studies raised questions on optimal dosing and frequency. Recent advances and knowledge gaps in this emerging field are discussed herein.

### Placebos: the nurse and the iron pills [^14124508]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

In sub-Saharan Africa, a nurse gives iron pills as placebos to terminally ill patients. She tells them, acting in what she believes is in their best interests, "these will make you feel better". The patients believe it will help their AIDS and their well-being improves. Do the motive and the patient's positive outcome in well-being make the deceit justifiable when other issues such as consent, autonomy and potential consequences regarding the patient and the wider community are considered? Is there a difference between lying and non-lying deception when the end result is the same? The patients feel better, but at what cost if the deceit was found out? It will be argued that although the actions of the nurse are understandable and to some extent defensible, they are unethical. It is not ethically acceptable to take away the patient's autonomy and risk the health of the community even though the risk of deceit being discovered is a small one.

### Are we giving too much iron? Low-dose iron therapy is effective in octogenarians [^8c91c7be]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Elderly patients are vulnerable to the dose-dependent adverse effects of iron replacement therapy. Our study examines whether low-dose iron therapy can efficiently resolve iron-deficiency anemia in patients over the age of 80 years and reduce adverse effects.

Subjects and Methods

Ninety hospitalized patients with iron-deficiency anemia were randomized to receive elemental iron in daily doses of 15 mg or 50 mg as liquid ferrous gluconate or 150 mg of ferrous calcium citrate tablets for 60 days. Thirty control patients without anemia were given 15 mg of iron for 60 days. A 2-hour iron absorption test was performed after the initial dose. Hemoglobin and ferritin levels were measured on day 1, 30, and 60 after initiating therapy. Each patient completed a weekly questionnaire regarding drug-induced adverse effects.

Results

Serum iron rose significantly in the anemic patients beginning 15 minutes after the first dose but not in nonanemic patients. Two months of iron treatment significantly increased hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations similarly in all 3 groups of iron-deficiency anemia patients (for example, hemoglobin levels rose from 10.0 g/dL to 11.3 g/dL with 15 mg/d of iron therapy and from 10.2 g/dL to 11.6 g/dL with 150 mg/d). Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, and black stools were significantly more common at higher iron doses.

Conclusions

Low-dose iron treatment is effective in elderly patients with iron-deficiency anemia. It can replace the commonly used higher doses and can significantly reduce adverse effects.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^2bcd92de]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Estimates of total body iron indicate 19 mg and 38 mg oral iron are equivalent for the mitigation of iron deficiency in individuals experiencing repeated phlebotomy [^bd93bd51]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is a common clinical condition often treated with tablets containing 65 mg of elemental iron. Such doses can elicit gastrointestinal side effects lowering patient compliance. Oral iron supplements also increase hepcidin production causing decreased fractional absorption of subsequent doses. Frequent blood donors often become iron deficient. Therefore, they were enrolled in a two-year study involving continued blood donations and randomization to receive no pill, placebo, 19, or 38 mg ferrous gluconate for 60 days. Total body iron (TBI) did not change for the subset of donors in the no pill and placebo groups who completed both enrollment and final visits (P = 0.21 and P = 0.28, respectively). However, repeated measures regression analysis on the complete dataset estimated a significant decrease in TBI of 52 mg/year for the placebo and no pill groups (P = 0.001). The effects of 19 and 38 mg iron supplementation on TBI were indistinguishable (P = 0.54). TBI increased by 229 mg after the initial 60 days of iron supplementation (P < .0001) and was maintained at this higher level with continued iron supplementation following each subsequent donation. The TBI increase was apportioned 51 mg to red cell iron (P < .0001) and 174 mg to storage iron (P < .0001). Changes in storage iron were negatively impacted by 57 mg due to concurrent antacid use (P = 0.04). These findings in blood donors suggest that much lower doses of iron than are currently used will be effective for clinical treatment of iron deficiency anemia.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^7e0a572d]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients, and non-anemic blood donorssuggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin > 100 μg/L often requires longer treatment.

Ferrous salts

Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered as the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate or gluconate is recommended as a first line treatment for IDA in adults by the current British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Slow-release ferrous salt supplements have performed poorly in several studies, possibly due to delayed liberation of encapsulated Fe 2+ past the duodenum and upper jejunum, where iron absorption is optimal. Hence, serious concerns have been raised on their efficacy, and their use is not recommended.

### Relative abuse of crush-resistant prescription opioid tablets via alternative oral modes of administration [^334b5144]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The main finding of this study is that oral abuse involving tampering/manipulation (e.g. chewing, dissolving in the mouth) is more commonly reported in abuse of CRT opioids than non-CRT opioids. While initial studies of CRT opioid analgesic products suggest that these products may reduce abuse by nonoral ROAs, for those who continue to abuse these products, the prevalence of abuse by oral routes generally increases. Oral abuse is not well understood, particularly for ER opioids, and data presented here illustrate that oral abuse often involves product manipulation. Formulations that can better resist manipulation are important because they can potentially interrupt the progression from initial use by swallowing whole to chewing/crushing, to insufflation, and eventually to injection. These findings may also be relevant when prescribing for pain patients with dysphagia, odynophagia, or difficulty swallowing. Even nonabuse (i.e. misuse)-related "tampering" of a crush-resistant product by a patient or caregiver could disrupt the extended-release mechanism, which is a safety concern.

Taken together, these results suggest the need for abuse-deterrent formulations designed to reduce oral abuse, including by MOAs that involve tampering, such as chewing. The overall goal of CRTs can be viewed as discouraging abuse by all nonintended routes (i.e. routes other than swallowing whole), thereby reducing the attractiveness or desirability of these products to abusers. In any event, prescribers should remember that prescribing an abuse-deterrent or crush-resistant opioid does not fully address concerns about abuse, misuse, or diversion. Prescribers should document in the treatment plan assessments performed, rationale for the prescription decision, and approaches taken to address the risk of oral abuse and product manipulation.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bde6cc85]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal dosage and frequency of oral iron supplementation

The elemental iron content (actual amount of iron available for absorption) differs between commercial iron formulations (Table 1). Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing ~60–70 mg elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach, to reach a daily dose of ~200 mg elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to reach the target of increasing hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple dosing per day. The studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aiming to prevent iron overload. These are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption(Figure 2).

Thus, the effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study with non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate in different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, so that each participant served as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher triggered induction of hepcidin for up to 24 h, which decreased fractional iron absorption from a subsequent dose the following day. Hepcidin levels returned to baseline after 48 h, restoring efficient iron absorption. These early data seem to disqualify the split dosing of ferrous sulfate two or three times per day, and even favor intermittent intake every second day versus daily dosing, to bypass the hepcidin blockade and increase fractional iron absorption.

### Could the erythrocyte indices or serum ferritin predict the therapeutic response to a trial with oral iron during pregnancy? Results from the accuracy study for maternal anaemia diagnosis (AMA) [^5780ebf4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

For these reasons, we assessed the responsiveness to oral iron, subject by subject, by Hb Z-scores, and then we adopted it as a dependent variable in a regression model to estimate a dose-response effect per iron pill. The adjusted coefficient of 0.008 Z-score per pill was robust and agreed with meta-analyzes adjusted for control groups, which estimate Hb increases of 0.4 g/dL in pregnant women, after a few weeks of low daily doses of oral iron. Two previous works have used Hb Z-scores to assess oral iron-therapies during pregnancy, but both of them aimed to compare intermittent with daily treatments, rather than to estimate a dose-response effect. The significant per pill effect in our analysis indicates that we could identify minimal therapeutic responses, within the broad period of iron-therapies in this trial (23–125 days), particularly because women ingested therapeutic doses in both groups of iron-responsive and not iron-responsive anaemia.

Finally, in our study population, if the decision to treat was based on Hb or SF, half of women would undergo iron-therapy without hematological benefit or would not receive treatment despite having iron needs. This finding agrees with the estimate that only half of the global burden of anaemia can be attributed uniquely to iron-deficiency, and that only half of anaemic pregnant women get cured after taking adequate amounts of iron in clinical trials. Actually, if the response to the therapeutic test with oral iron was taken into account, most of the pregnant women studied would be identified as not iron-responsive. This result may point towards the presence of other causes of anaemia and futile treatments, since these women were treated longer and with higher iron doses. Nevertheless, a lack of empirical data during pregnancy may bring doubts about how sensitive to the therapeutic test with oral iron would be women with severe anaemia, as well as if other biomarkers could be correlated with iron-responsiveness more than those we had selected.

### The effect of blister packaging iron and folate on adherence to medication and hemoglobin levels among pregnant women at national referral hospital antenatal clinics in a low to middle income country: a randomised controlled trial (the IFAd trial) [^4b7a8168]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome of the study was adherence to the IFA supplementation regimen, which was assessed verbally and using a balance from the 30-day pill count computed at 4 and 8 weeks' periods. Adherence at return visit was measured by pill count. For participants who reported at scheduled 4 weeks visit, the balance of pills was counted if they had the drug package with them or they were asked the balance of pill left at home. If the count or balance was 2 pills, that indicated that they had swallowed 28 pills as instructed (that is one pill per day), and they were considered to have 100% adherence. Those lost-to-follow-up were considered non-adherent participants. The same assessment was applied at 8th week of second return. We also computed 90% adherence based on pill count (had balance of only 3 tablets on return visit). The secondary outcome was change in hemoglobin level from baseline to 8 weeks.

Sample size

Based on the study done in Ethiopia that showed adherence among women to iron folate supplementation was 37.2%, and our hypothesis that blister packaging of iron folate pills increases compliance by 9 percentage points, with a two sided 5% significance level and 80% power, we calculated a sample size of 481 in each group given an anticipated 10% loss to follow up.

Randomization

Using a blocked randomisation sampling technique, computer random numbers in blocks of six were generated by a biostatistician. The biostatistician produced an allocation list for the study arms. The allocation sequence was concealed from the research team enrolling and screening participants in serially numbered sealed opaque envelopes (concealed allocation) containing the randomization group. After the research assistant had obtained consent, she would open the next envelope to determine the group assignment, only after the participant was enrolled, completed all the baseline assessment and it was time to allocate the intervention. Because of the nature of the study, it was difficult to blind the implementation of the allocation and measurement of the outcome. The participants recruited were assigned to receive either an appropriately labelled blister pack containing IFA pills or to receiving the standard of practice of the loose packs.

### Alternate day versus consecutive day oral iron supplementation in iron-depleted women: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^08ddbb3a]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Between Nov 24, 2021, and Jan 21, 2022, 75 women were enrolled into each of the two groups. Five participants in the consecutive-day group and eight in the alternate-day group discontinued participation during the study; two in each group discontinued due to side effects (Fig. 1). In both groups, 75 women were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The study was completed on December 12, 2022. Median capsule adherence was 98.3% (IQR 95.3–100.0) in the consecutive-day group and 98.9% (96.0%–100.0) in the alternate-day group (P = 0.46). In the consecutive-day group, 95.2% (IQR 80.8–99.3) of the capsules were consumed in the morning and 92.4% (72.4–97.8) without a meal; in the alternate-day group, the corresponding values were 94.9% (IQR 75.6–98.9) and 93.5% (85.8–98.3), respectively.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4ef1a396]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Iron supplements likely benefit non-anaemic pregnant women. The size of this benefit will vary based on individual context, and the impact on quality of life remains to be quantified. However, we estimate for every ten women taking iron, one fewer will develop anaemia. In contrast, there is insufficient evidence to quantify the harms of iron supplements in the same population. Therefore, this review highlights four important avenues for future research; quantification of harms, optimization of dosing regimens, determining the clinical relevance of any benefit, and identifying subpopulations with disparate outcomes. Exploring these areas will enable women, clinicians and guideline developers to make informed decisions regarding prophylactic iron supplementation.

### Supplementation with oral vs. intravenous iron for anemia with IBD or gastrointestinal bleeding: is oral iron getting a bad rap? [^5ad8b041]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although iron supplementation is commonly prescribed, the amount of elemental iron needed to achieve clinical efficacy, and the optimal method of supplementation, are under debate. Use of intravenous (IV) iron replacement is increasingly being advocated. We explore the physiology of iron supplementation, review clinical data suggesting that the typical oral dosing of iron may be excessive, and compare IV and oral methods of iron supplementation with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both IV and oral iron can effectively raise hemoglobin levels in iron-deficiency anemia. There is no evidence that IV iron can raise hemoglobin at a faster pace. Side effects of oral iron are probably related to the relatively high doses of elemental iron that are typically prescribed. Emerging data suggest that low-dose iron has comparable efficacy, with fewer side effects. In IBD, both oral and IV iron are effective, and there is no convincing evidence that oral iron activates or exacerbates clinical symptoms. The use of a low starting dose of oral iron, such as one ferrous sulfate tablet per day, for treatment of iron deficiency is worth considering.

### Review of opioid abuse-deterrent formulations: impact and barriers to access [^2238bc7a]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Manipulation Methods

Abuse, misuse, and diversion of opioids, including ADF opioids, remain a public health problem. ADFs do not alter the addictive properties of the opioid molecule itself, and while ADFs may deter abuse, they are not resistant to all abuse. For example, current ADF technologies do not deter swallowing several intact capsules or tablets to achieve a feeling of a desired drug effect like euphoria. For this reason, ADFs still carry a risk of overdose (Table 3).

Table 3
Impact of ADF on Abuse and Misuse Behaviors in Individuals Seeking or Entering Opioid Treatment Programs

The current prevailing ADF technology and most frequently prescribed is the reformulated hard-to-crush tablet OxyContin. A recent analysis of data from the RADARS system found that severe life-threatening events and death are twice as likely to occur with intentional abuse of prescription opioids when taken via nonoral routes of administration compared to oral routes. One study showed that 34% of abusers (N = 88) successfully overcame the ADF mechanism and effectively manipulated OxyContin for use via IV and inhalation routes. Moreover, abuse of OxyContin occurs orally. For example, a real-world analysis of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment (N = 18,135) found that up to 42% of oral abusers of crush-resistant tablets reported manipulating the pill (eg, chewing or dissolving). In a separate study of OxyContin abusers (N = 1705), up to 76% reported oral abuse of OxyContin (Figure 2).

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^1d3a5465]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Tolerability and adverse effects of oral iron supplements

In general, the proper use of oral iron supplements is considered safe and does not cause severe adverse effects. However, it frequently triggers gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and mucosal injury, which may reduce compliance.

Ferrous salts

While efficacious in repletion of iron stores, ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts often exhibit limited tolerability due to gastrointestinal side effects. Ferrous salts may also cause teeth staining and a metallic taste in the mouth, particularly with prolonged use in liquid form or when not properly diluted before ingestion. A systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the tolerability and adverse effects of ferrous sulfate versus placebo or versus intravenous iron in 43 RCT involving 6,831 adults. The use of ferrous sulfate significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal side effects versus placebo with an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.74–3.08; P < 0.0001), and versus intravenous iron with an odds ratio of 3.05 (95% confidence interval: 2.07–4.48; P < 0.0001). There was no significant association between odds ratio and ferrous sulfate dose. Additionally, there was no evidence that slow-release ferrous sulfate formulations were tolerated better.

Ferric complexes

Although ferric iron supplements are generally thought to be better tolerated compared to ferrous ones, there are not many directly comparative studies. In the BESTIRON RCTand the trial with infants and children aged 9–48 months, there were more reported cases of diarrhea in patients receiving ferric polysaccharide than in those receiving ferrous sulfate, but there were no significant differences in combined post hoc gastrointestinal adverse effect profiles. Likewise, there were no differences in adverse effects between women with IDA treated with ferrous glycine sulfate or iron protein succinylate. In a recent crossover, double-blind RCT in healthy women of reproductive age, microencapsulated ferric saccharate showed a better tolerability profile compared to that of ferrous sulfate regarding the incidences of symptoms, numbers of complaints/symptoms, overall intensity, and total days with symptoms.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^26330393]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and pre-anemic iron deficiency are the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most commonly prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate, while other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used. In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol, or nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial ® iron. Oral iron supplementation is usually efficacious in correcting iron-deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores but causes gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications. Herein, we critically review literature on relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements, and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency.

### New film-coated tablet formulation of deferasirox is well tolerated in patients with thalassemia or lower-risk MDS: results of the randomized, phase II ECLIPSE study [^cbbf76bd]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Once-daily deferasirox dispersible tablets (DT) have a well-defined safety and efficacy profile and, compared with parenteral deferoxamine, provide greater patient adherence, satisfaction, and quality of life. However, barriers still exist to optimal adherence, including gastrointestinal tolerability and palatability, leading to development of a new film-coated tablet (FCT) formulation that can be swallowed with a light meal, without the need to disperse into a suspension prior to consumption. The randomized, open-label, phase II ECLIPSE study evaluated the safety of deferasirox DT and FCT formulations over 24 weeks in chelation-naïve or pre-treated patients aged ≥ 10 years, with transfusion-dependent thalassemia or IPSS-R very-low-, low-, or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. One hundred seventy-three patients were randomized 1:1 to DT (n = 86) or FCT (n = 87). Adverse events (overall), consistent with the known deferasirox safety profile, were reported in similar proportions of patients for each formulation (DT 89.5%; FCT 89.7%), with a lower frequency of severe events observed in patients receiving FCT (19.5% vs. 25.6% DT). Laboratory parameters (serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and urine protein/creatinine ratio) generally remained stable throughout the study. Patient-reported outcomes showed greater adherence and satisfaction, better palatability and fewer concerns with FCT than DT. Treatment compliance by pill count was higher with FCT (92.9%) than with DT (85.3%). This analysis suggests deferasirox FCT offers an improved formulation with enhanced patient satisfaction, which may improve adherence, thereby reducing frequency and severity of iron overload-related complications.

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^90aba997]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

During the prelatent iron deficiency phase, an iron-rich diet can treat most cases. However, patients with IDA require iron supplements to replenish storage iron, restore normal hematopoiesis, treat anemia, and relieve symptoms.

Oral iron supplementation is the primary approach to restore iron levels for patients with IDA. Numerous nonheme iron supplements are available, and ferrous sulfate and ferric succinate supplements are the most commonly used. Vitamin C is the only dietary constituent other than animal tissue that has been shown to promote iron absorption. Iron absorption occurs predominantly in the duodenum and upper jejunum, where ferrous iron can be transported into small intestine mucosal epithelial cells. When taken orally, iron is always oxidized to the Fe 3+ state from its original form. It requires an acidic gastrointestinal environment to be dissolved adequately for absorption. Vitamin C can create a more acidic environment in the stomach and prevent the oxidization of ferrous iron to ferric iron. However, in a series of 12 individuals treated with iron during intake of a regular or vitamin C–supplemented diet, the effect of vitamin C on promoting iron absorption from a complete diet was far less pronounced than that from a single meal. The facilitating impact of vitamin C with food on iron status is minimal. Therefore, whether vitamin C has additional advantages, such as improving the efficacy of iron tablets and, thus, speeding up the recovery of anemia, remains poorly understood. Whether iron tablets with vitamin C supplements should be recommended is controversial.

To our knowledge, until now there has not been a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess whether vitamin C supplements are necessary for patients with IDA taking iron tablets. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a rigorous RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of oral iron supplements alone or combined with vitamin C in patients with IDA. We designed a single-center, equivalence RCT to evaluate whether oral iron supplements alone were comparable with oral iron supplements plus vitamin C and to verify whether vitamin C routinely used with iron supplements can improve iron absorption.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### The effect of blister packaging iron and folate on adherence to medication and hemoglobin levels among pregnant women at national referral hospital antenatal clinics in a low to middle income country: a randomised controlled trial (the IFAd trial) [^08d21898]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia in pregnancy is an important global public health problem. It is estimated that 38% of pregnant women worldwide are anemic. In Africa, literature from observational studies show 20% of maternal deaths are attributed to anemia. In Uganda, 50% of pregnant women have iron deficiency anaemia. The proportion of pregnant women receiving Iron-Folic acid (IFA) supplementation has improved. However, the number of IFA pills consumed is still low. We carried out a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of dispensing blister and loose packaged IFA pills on adherence measured by count on next return visit and hemoglobin levels among pregnant women at two National Referral Hospitals in Kampala, Uganda.

Methods

This trial was conducted between April and October 2016. Nine hundred fifty pregnant women at ≤ 28weeks were randomized to either the blister (intervention arm) or loose (control arm) packaged IFA. The participants completed the baseline measurements and received 30 pills of IFA at enrolment to swallow one pill per day. We assessed adherence by pill count and measured hemoglobin at four and 8 weeks. The results were presented using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis.

Results

There were 474 participants in the control and 478 in the intervention arms. Adherence to IFA intake was similar in the two groups at 4th week (40.6 and 39.0%, p = 0.624) and 8th week (51.9 and 46.8%, p = 0.119). The mean hemoglobin level at 4weeks was higher in the blister than in the loose packaging arms (11.9+1.1g/dl and 11.8 + 1.3g/dl, respectively; p = 0.02), however, similar at week 8 (12.1 + 1.2 and 12.0 + 1.3, respectively; p = 0.23). However, over the 8-week period blister packaging arm had a higher change in hemoglobin level compared to loose package (blister package 0.6 ± 1.0; loose packaging 0.2 ± 1.1; difference: 0.4g/dL (95% CI: 0.24–0.51g/dL); p = 0.001. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Our results showed no effect of blister packaging on IFA adherence among pregnant women. However, our findings showed that blister packaged group had a higher hemoglobin increase compared to loose iron group.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^b1d847e6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Conventional oral iron formulations

The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends ferrous preparations, specifically ferrous sulphate, as first-line therapy for iron replenishment as they are cheap, have good bioavailability, available in multiple preparations and have been shown to replenish iron stores and correct anaemia effectively. However, there are also many limitations to their use, with the most common being the frequency and severity of side effects. A systematic review demonstrated that GI side effects were the most problematic with constipation being the most frequent complaint, followed by nausea and diarrhoea. This will have a resultant effect on patient adherence, likely leading to cessation and, thus, inadequate treatment.

The appropriate dosing of ferrous iron preparations is also a contentious issue between clinicians. To adequately replenish iron stores, therapeutic treatment of IDA was initially felt to require 200 mg of iron sulphate 2–3 times per day in order to raise Hb by 20 g/L over a 4-week period, with treatment continuing for 3 months. However, the daily doses of elemental iron should not be greater than 100 mg/dayas the body can only absorb 10–20 mg of iron per day. It should be noted that 200 mg of ferrous sulphate is equivalent to 65 mg of elemental iron.

A recent study compared oral iron dosing regimens in women with mild anaemia with divided daily, once daily and alternate-day dosing. The results demonstrated superiority with alternate-day dosing, with 33% greater fractional iron absorption over 14 doses. In addition, a randomised trial of elderly patients with IDA received 15 mg, 50 mg or 150 mg of elemental iron per day. After 2 months, the mean increase in Hb was the same in all groups (1.4 g/dL); however, adverse effects were significantly greater with higher doses. It is, therefore, an evolving view that a single daily dose (40–60 mg) or a slightly higher alternate-day dose (80–100 mg) is the preferred dosing regimen in order to reduce the side effects and optimise the proportion of elemental iron absorbed.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^d9e62fdc]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Strategies to improve adherence to antiretroviral medications — medication strategies emphasize regimen simplification, tolerability, and formulation support: Choose the simplest regimen possible; reduce dosing frequency, pill size, and number of pills (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets or as a Co-packaged Formulation, by Drug Class and Appendix A, Table 2. Antiretroviral Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets and Co-packaged Formulations: Minimum Body Weights and Considerations for Use in Children and Adolescents). Consider LAI regimens (e.g. LA CAB/RPV) for eligible children and adolescents. When choosing a regimen, consider the child/adolescent's routines and potential variations in individual and family activities. Choose the most palatable medicine possible (pharmacists may be able to add syrups or flavoring agents to improve palatability). Choose drugs with the fewest AEs; provide anticipatory guidance for managing AEs. Simplify food requirements for medication administration. Prescribe drugs carefully to avoid adverse drug–drug interactions. Assess pill-swallowing capacity and offer pill-swallowing training and aids (e.g., pill-swallowing cup, pill glide). Adjust pill size as needed or check if the pill can be crushed. Consider dispersible formulations if possible. See drug sections in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for information about available formulations and administration of individual drugs. Choose ARV regimens with high genetic barriers to resistance, when available, if there are concerns about adherence.

### Morphine sulfate (Avinza) [^3fe26271]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

AVINZA MUST BE SWALLOWED WHOLE (NOT CHEWED, CRUSHED, OR DISSOLVED) OR AVINZA MAY BE OPENED AND THE ENTIRE BEAD CONTENTS SPRINKLED ON A SMALL AMOUNT OF APPLESAUCE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO INGESTION. THE BEADS MUST NOT BE CHEWED, CRUSHED, OR DISSOLVED DUE TO RISK OF ACUTE OVERDOSE. INGESTING CHEWED OR CRUSHED AVINZA BEADS WILL LEAD TO THE RAPID RELEASE AND ABSORPTION OF A POTENTIALLY TOXIC DOSE OF MORPHINE.

Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages while on AVINZA therapy. Additionally, patients must not use prescription or non-prescription medicine containing alcohol while on AVINZA therapy. Consumption of alcohol while taking AVINZA may result in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.

The daily dose of AVINZA must be limited to a maximum of 1600 mg/day. AVINZA doses of over 1600 mg/day contain a quantity of fumaric acid that has not been demonstrated to be safe, and which may result in serious renal toxicity. (see WARNINGS)

The 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 mg capsules are for use only in opioid-tolerant patients.

All doses are intended to be administered once daily. As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of AVINZA, attention should be given to the following:

the total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent morphine dose needed;
the patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
the general condition and medical status of the patient;
concurrent medications;
the type and severity of the patient's pain.

The following dosing recommendations, therefore, can only be considered suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to AVINZA

Patients receiving other oral morphine formulations may be converted to AVINZA by administering the patient's total daily oral morphine dose as AVINZA once-daily. AVINZA should not be given more frequently than every 24 hours. As with conversion from any oral morphine formulation to another, supplemental pain medication may be required until the response to the patient's daily AVINZA dosage has stabilized (up to 4 days).

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^e3f2b32a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the effects of oral iron supplements alone equivalent to a regimen of oral iron supplements plus vitamin C in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial that included 440 adults with iron deficiency anemia, the mean change in hemoglobin level after 2 weeks was 2.00 g/dL in the oral iron supplements plus vitamin C group, compared with 1.84 g/dL in the oral iron supplements–only group. This difference met prespecified criteria for equivalence.

Meaning

The use of oral iron supplements alone is comparable to a regimen of vitamin C supplemented with oral iron for patients with iron deficiency anemia.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^daad4201]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In two prospective, open-label RCT with non-anemic, iron-deficient, premenopausal women, the participants received ferrous sulfate containing three different iron isotopes. The first study examined the differences between intake of 60 mg elemental iron on consecutive versus alternate days, while the second study assessed the impact of split dosing of 120 mg elemental iron (in two doses of 60 mg each per day) versus single daily dosing. In line with the pilot data, split dosing twice per day, as well as single daily dosing of 120 mg iron induced hepcidin, which diminished iron absorption the next day. Using the same methodology, a cross-over study involving premenopausal women with IDA compared iron absorption from ferrous sulfate at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg elemental iron administered either on two consecutive days or on alternate days. Total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was almost twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days. In a RCT with IDA patients, the primary endpoint of a 2 g/ dL rise in hemoglobin at 3 and 6 weeks was reached by significantly more patients taking 60 mg elemental iron twice daily versus 120 mg on alternate days. However, the median hemoglobin rise in the "alternate day" arm at 6 weeks was not significantly different from that in the "twice daily" arm at 3 weeks, while the treatment was better tolerated in the "alternate day" group. Similar results were obtained by other studies involving IDA patients. Current evidence supports the concept that intermittent iron supplementation every other day may be as effective as daily supplementation in controlling IDA, but with fewer adverse effects, at least in women of reproductive age. Nevertheless, this view is based on a small number of studies, some of them with methodological limitations. Thus, validation in more robust and adequately powered RCT with IDA patients of various etiologies is warranted. In any case, the new findings are reflected in the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, which recommend an initial treatment of IDA with " one tablet per day of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered ". It should be noted that all data favoring oral iron supplementation every other day were obtained using ferrous sulfate. Therefore, the recommendation for intermittent iron intake is restricted to ferrous salts. Whether this also applies to other iron supplements remains to be examined. There is evidence that ferric maltol induces hepcidin similarly to ferrous sulfate in IBD patients, while ferric citrate promoted a stronger increase in hepcidin compared to ferrous sulfate in non-dialysis CKD patients. On the other hand, administration of iron protein succinylateor sucrosomial ® irondid not affect hepcidin in rats and mice, respectively. Interestingly, ferric citrateor sucrosomial ® ironeffectively increased hemoglobinization in mouse models of hepcidin overexpression. These findings may be relevant to anemic patients who respond poorly to conventional oral iron supplements and require intravenous iron. This occurs in a subset of IBD or CKD patients who exhibit restricted iron availability for erythropoiesis due to inflammatory hepcidin induction (and impaired renal clearance of hepcidin in CKD), combined with IDA or not. The same considerations apply to patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), a genetic disorder caused by inactivation of the hepcidin suppressor TMPRSS6.

Discussion

This investigator-initiated multicentre Australian study has been designed to provide evidence to help nephrologists and their CKD patients better determine whether HIP (Proferrin ® ES) will more effectively augment iron stores in ESP-treated PD patients than conventional oral iron supplementation. Concomitant iron supplementation is required in as many as 90% of ESP-treated individuals. However, the optimal means of administering iron to PD patients remains unclear: administration of intravenous iron is logistically difficult and costly, while conventional oral iron supplementation is also associated with poor compliance, gastrointestinal side effects and suboptimal GI absorption of iron. Thus, the development of an oral iron supplement which is able to safely, cheaply and more effectively maintain iron stores and haemoglobin levels in ESP-treated PD patients would fulfil a currently unmet clinical need.

The multicentre nature of this trial will greatly enhance its generalisability. Moreover, the trial sample size has been carefully and prospectively calculated using a minimum clinically important difference in TSAT of 7% and realistic estimates of trial drop-out and non-compliance rates to minimise the risk of a type 2 statistical error.

It is hoped that results will be available in 2010. Demonstration of a significant improvement in iron stores with oral HIP therapy will provide clinicians with an important new therapy for effectively combating inadequate iron stores in PD patients.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of iron supplementation alone and as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) compared with ESA alone in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia?

Bottom Line

Addition of iron to ESAs improves hematopoietic response, reduces the need for red blood cell transfusions, increases hemoglobin levels, and seems to be well tolerated. The subgroup analyses suggest the superiority of parenteral iron over oral iron supplementation in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia.
