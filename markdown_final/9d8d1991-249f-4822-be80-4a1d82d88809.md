## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which characteristic most increases the risk for prescription opioid misuse in a 62-year-old woman with severe chronic low back pain and multiple comorbidities, among options including lack of pain relief with physical therapy, history of alcohol use disorder, lack of pain relief after back surgery, and presence of multiple medical comorbidities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what high-credibility regulatory and guideline sources explicitly identify as risk factors for opioid misuse. Then, I should verify the comparative evidence for each option, especially whether treatment nonresponse or general medical comorbidity are recognized predictors. Next, I'll examine data quantifying risk associated with a history of substance use disorder, particularly alcohol use disorder. Finally, I'll synthesize and confirm the strongest predictor and outline the clinical implications for monitoring and mitigation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the core risk factors from high-credibility sources. The FDA prescribing information for potent opioids explicitly lists as "high risk" those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, alongside prolonged prior opioid exposure and concurrent use with other abused drugs, which directly implicates alcohol use disorder history as a primary risk factor for opioid misuse [^112DLMzd] [^1114phup].

> I need to check whether empirical data quantify this risk. Hold on, let me verify the magnitude. A VA primary care study of patients on opioids showed that those with a lifetime substance use disorder had markedly higher odds of aberrant behaviors, including borrowing pain medication (OR 6.62) and requesting early refills (OR 3.86), indicating that even a remote history confers substantial ongoing risk; this aligns with guideline emphasis on SUD history as a key predictor and supports history of alcohol use disorder as a strong signal for misuse risk [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine the alternatives systematically. Lack of pain relief with physical therapy, and similarly, lack of pain relief after back surgery, may drive legitimate concern about analgesia, but wait, I should confirm whether such treatment nonresponse is recognized as a misuse risk factor. The FDA labeling explicitly notes that preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in inadequately controlled pain, and neither FDA nor VA/DoD guidelines list treatment failure with PT or surgery as predictors of opioid misuse, so these options are not supported as primary risk factors [^112DLMzd] [^1114phup] [^116cPCUD].

> Next, I should review whether multiple medical comorbidities independently predict misuse. Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions. The VA/DoD guideline highlights behavioral health conditions and substance use disorders as risk factors when considering long-term opioid therapy, rather than general medical comorbidity per se; thus, broad medical comorbidity is a weaker and indirect signal compared with a specific SUD history such as alcohol use disorder [^116cPCUD].

> Hmm, wait a minute — does a remote history of alcohol use disorder still matter, or is current use required. The FDA's risk framing uses "history of drug or alcohol abuse", not only current use, and the VA study employed lifetime SUD and still found elevated odds for aberrant behaviors, so even past AUD remains clinically relevant for predicting misuse and warrants enhanced monitoring [^112DLMzd] [^111FiAoa].

> I should also confirm recommended mitigation steps if AUD history is present. The CDC guideline advises reviewing controlled substance histories via PDMP at initiation and periodically during therapy to identify high-risk combinations or dosages, and consensus recommendations endorse structured risk assessment, collateral information, and rational urine drug monitoring — practices that should be heightened in patients with a history of alcohol or other SUDs [^116cPCUD] [^113a63x1].

> Putting this together, the most evidence-based and specific predictor among the choices is history of alcohol use disorder, given its explicit designation as high risk in FDA labeling, corroboration in VA/DoD guidance emphasizing SUD history, and quantified elevations in aberrant opioid-related behaviors in patients with lifetime SUD histories; therefore, the correct answer is history of alcohol use disorder, with targeted monitoring and risk mitigation indicated in such patients [^112DLMzd] [^1114phup] [^116cPCUD] [^111FiAoa] [^1129F96H] [^113a63x1].

---

The characteristic most likely to increase the risk for prescription opioid misuse in this patient is a **history of alcohol use disorder**. This is because a prior substance use disorder is the **strongest predictor of opioid misuse**, with a 2–4-fold increased risk [^111FiAoa], and is specifically highlighted in FDA warnings [^112DLMzd] and clinical guidelines [^1129F96H] as a high-risk factor [^1114phup]. While chronic pain, multiple comorbidities, and lack of relief from prior treatments increase opioid exposure [^notfound], they do not independently predict misuse [^116cPCUD] as strongly as a prior substance use disorder.

---

## Risk factors for prescription opioid misuse

Prescription opioid misuse is influenced by multiple factors, including patient demographics, medical history, psychiatric comorbidities, and prior substance use disorders [^116cPCUD]. Among these, a history of substance use disorder — particularly alcohol use disorder — remains a **significant predictor of opioid misuse** [^113a63x1].

---

### History of alcohol use disorder

A history of alcohol use disorder is a **well-established risk factor** for prescription opioid misuse. Patients with a prior substance use disorder are significantly more likely to misuse prescription medications, including opioids. Becker et al. (2008) found that patients with a lifetime history of substance use disorder were more likely to report aberrant medication-related behaviors [^111FiAoa], such as borrowing pain medications and requesting early refills. This elevated risk persists even after adjustment for other clinical factors, including pain and depression severity. The FDA also warns that patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse are **at high risk** for opioid misuse and addiction [^112DLMzd]; this warning is reiterated in opioid analgesic prescribing information [^1114phup], underscoring the need for careful monitoring and caution when prescribing to patients with a history of substance use disorder.

---

### Lack of pain relief with physical therapy or back surgery

While inadequate relief from physical therapy or back surgery may increase the likelihood of opioid prescribing, these factors alone **do not independently predict opioid misuse** [^116cPCUD]. The main concern is greater opioid exposure, which may indirectly raise misuse risk [^11459Dtm]. However, a prior substance use disorder remains a stronger and more consistent predictor than inadequate pain relief alone [^111FiAoa].

---

### Presence of multiple medical comorbidities

Multiple medical comorbidities — such as hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — may **increase the risk of opioid-related adverse events** (e.g. respiratory depression) but do not independently predict opioid misuse [^116cPCUD]. The main concern is adverse-event risk rather than misuse [^111hHeM9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines consistently emphasize **assessing patients' history of substance use disorders** when considering opioid therapy [^116cPCUD]. The CDC guideline [^1129F96H] recommends reviewing patients' history of controlled-substance prescriptions and substance use disorders [^1121agYX] before initiating therapy [^113a63x1]. Similarly, the FDA advises [^112DLMzd] careful monitoring and caution when prescribing opioids to patients with a history of substance use disorder [^1114phup].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Among the listed characteristics, a history of alcohol use disorder is the **most significant risk factor** for prescription opioid misuse in this patient. Robust evidence and clinical guidelines consistently identify prior substance use disorder as a leading predictor of opioid misuse [^116cPCUD]. Therefore, clinicians should exercise caution and closely monitor patients with a history of alcohol use disorder when considering opioid therapy [^112DLMzd].

### Actiq [^112DLMzd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because the use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction, even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Actiq abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing fentanyl, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Actiq in combination with other abused drugs.

- **Drug-seeking behavior**: This is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorders. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

Actiq, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help.

### Prescription medication misuse and substance use disorder in VA primary care patients with chronic pain [^111FiAoa]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between a history of substance use disorder (SUD) and self-reported prescription medication misuse in 127 primary care patients who receive opioid medications for chronic pain treatment.

Participants completed measures assessing pain location, pain intensity, pain-related disability, and misuse of prescription medications. Other measures included demographic characteristics, psychiatric symptomatology, and quality of life assessments.

Seventy-eight percent of participants reported at least one indicator of medication misuse in the prior year. After adjusting for age and clinical factors (pain severity, depression severity, alcohol or substance use disorder), participants with a SUD history were significantly more likely to report borrowing pain medications from others (OR = 6.62, 95% CI = 1.4–30.7) and requesting an early refill of pain medication (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 1.5–9.6) compared to those without a SUD history.

Misuse of prescription medications is a concern among primary care patients with chronic pain. Participants with a lifetime history of SUD are more likely to exhibit aberrant medication-related behaviors. Patients with SUD histories should be carefully evaluated for medication misuse potential and may require more intensive assessment and follow-up.

### Ultiva [^1114phup]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because the use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Ultiva abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing remifentanil, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Ultiva in combination with other abused drugs.

- **Drug-seeking behavior**: This is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.

- **Diversion for nonmedical use**: Ultiva, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures to ensure safe use of opioids.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^114FdpyM]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Most mental disorders, including major depressive disorders, have consistent associations with alcohol use, particularly with heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders. In addition to these associations, both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, and the ICD‐10 list alcohol‐induced mental disorders, including alcohol‐induced depressive disorders, thus building causality into the disorder category. However, these codes are not used in most countries. An exception is the United States, where it is a billable code for medical services. Therefore, we need to establish estimates of the causal impact of alcohol use on major depressive episodes in other ways.

There are three possible descriptions of the potential causal pathways that underlie the association between heavy alcohol use and alcohol use disorders and major depressive disorders:

- **Heavy drinking/alcohol use disorders causing depressive disorders**: This is considered the strongest and most prevalent pathway.

- **Depressive disorders increasing alcohol use and causing alcohol use disorders**: This is often discussed under the heading of a 'self‐medication' hypothesis.

- **A reciprocal causal relationship or causation by another mechanism**: This could include genetic vulnerability.

Two reviews on this topic concluded that all three mechanisms are possible and probably exist, but the first mechanism — where alcohol use, especially heavy use and alcohol use disorders, causes depression — is stronger and more prevalent than the other pathways.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^114DdEuq]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

This study explores the history of ideas about drinking alcohol and how it may be influenced, focusing on the evolution of thinking about brief interventions. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines brief interventions as 'practices that aim to identify a real or potential alcohol problem and motivate an individual to do something about it'. This permissive definition lacks specificity in intervention content, a characteristic also reflected in two definitions offered by Nick Heather, a key architect of contemporary thinking on brief interventions. He described brief interventions as 'a family of interventions varying in length, structure, targets of intervention, personnel responsible for their delivery, media of communication, and several other ways including their underpinning theory and intervention philosophy'. The key feature of the brief intervention construct was articulated as 'a set of principles regarding intervention (arising from the public health approach to alcohol problems)'. The WHO manual for use in primary care identifies four types of interventions: alcohol education for those screening negative, and simple advice, brief counselling, and specialist referral for increasing levels of risk as identified by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). We are unaware of any studies of brief interventions evaluating alcohol education for those whose drinking is not identified as risky, and thus give no further attention to this group.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: Consensus recommendations [^113a63x1]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Explanations for risk factors of opioid misuse and opioid use disorder**: A comprehensive evaluation to assess the presence or risk of misuse and opioid use disorder includes questions about patients' history of substance use disorders and clinical characteristics (e.g. from a physical examination), input from patients' family members and other health care providers (e.g. psychiatrists, previous pain specialists), and pill counts. Behaviors that may indicate an increased likelihood of misuse or opioid use disorder include requests for early refills, unauthorized dose escalations, and use of another individual's medication. Substance use disorder is generally associated with one or more of the four "Cs" (i.e. impaired control over use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving).

- **Simple screening methods**: A few simple questions (e.g. single-item screening questions [SISQs] for alcohol and drug use) followed by a discussion with patients is an efficient way for clinicians to incorporate risk assessment into their practice. Reviewing a patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions in the PDMP is another method for assessing potential opioid misuse or substance use disorder. Clinicians should be aware of their state's regulations, recommendations, and resources regarding PDMPs. All states have or are planning to implement a PDMP, but reporting times vary, and not every provider is required to participate in PDMPs in all states. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 is intended to improve the efficiency of these programs to track prescription drug use.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^115TXXDP]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

This study explores the early development of brief interventions for alcohol using a history of ideas approach, with a particular focus on intervention content.

- **Methods**: The source publications of the key primary studies published from approximately 1962 to 1992 were examined, followed by a brief review of the earliest reviews in this field. These studies were placed in the context of developments in alcohol research and public health.

- **Results**: After early pioneering work on brief interventions, further advances were not made until thinking about alcohol problems and their treatment, most notably on controlled drinking, along with wider changes in public health, created new conditions for progress. There was then a golden era of rapid advance in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when preventing the development of problem drinking became important for public health reasons, in addition to helping already problematic drinkers. Many research challenges identified at that time remain to be met. The content of brief interventions changed over the period of study, although not in ways well informed by research advances, and there were also obvious continuities, with a renewed emphasis on the facilitation of self-change being one important consequence of the development of internet applications.

- **Conclusions**: Ideas about brief interventions have changed in important ways. Brief interventions have been studied with different populations of drinkers, with aims embracing both individual and population-level perspectives, and without well-specified contents.

### Alcohol abuse risk factors and psychiatric disorders in pregnant women with a history of infertility [^116bpbLN]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

To determine if a history of infertility is associated with alcohol abuse risk factors, depression, and other psychiatric disorders, pregnant women awaiting their first prenatal visit completed a questionnaire. They subsequently participated in an interview consisting of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IIIR and the Family Alcohol and Drug Survey. The data obtained from women with a history of infertility were compared with the data from women without prior infertility.

Eighty-nine pregnant women participated in the study, with 27 having prior infertility and 62 without. The subjects were demographically similar, except that women with a history of infertility were slightly older than controls (34.7 vs. 31.1 years, p < 0.001). Pregnant women with a history of infertility reported needing significantly more drinks to get high (3.3 vs. 2.7, p = 0.04) and were more likely to have clinically elevated scores for tolerance, annoyance, cut-down, and eye-opener (T-ACE) alcohol tolerance (83.3% vs. 52.3%, p < 0.01) than women without such a history. Major depression (lifetime) was diagnosed in 69.2% of infertility subjects compared with 30% of controls (p < 0.05). Lifetime simple phobia (23.1% vs. 10%, p < 0.01), generalized anxiety disorder (23.1% vs. 3%, p < 0.01), panic disorder (15.4% vs. 0%, p < 0.05), and bulimia (7.7% vs. 0%, p < 0.05) were also more common in women with a history of infertility compared with controls.

In conclusion, pregnant women with a history of infertility are at increased risk for alcohol abuse and are more likely to suffer from a range of psychiatric disorders compared to those without such history.

### Recurrent risk of hospitalization among older people with problematic alcohol use: A multiple failure-time analysis with a discontinuous risk model [^117NqFfR]. Addiction (2022). Low credibility.

The analysis investigated the risk of all-cause, alcohol use-, polydrug use-, and psychiatric disorders-related rehospitalization among 1,741 older people with problematic alcohol use after their index ASI assessment. During the study period, 11,455 hospital admissions and 346 deaths were recorded. Approximately three out of four individuals were hospitalized at least once during the study period. About 70% of hospitalizations and 33% of deaths in the cohort were related to alcohol-related disorders and diseases. Furthermore, 18.5% of the cohort was hospitalized at least once with psychiatric-related disorders and 8.5% with polydrug use disorders. More than 10% (n = 183) were hospitalized at least once with dual alcohol use and psychiatric disorders.

Previous cross-sectional analyses of older samples from emergency departments and medical and psychiatric inpatient stays reported a high prevalence of alcohol use disorder. Our study found an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality among older addiction service users over a 14-year study period. The risk, moreover, varied among previously identified subgroups of service users. The analyses underscored the heterogeneity of older addiction service users with respect to disease comorbidity and treatment needs throughout the care continuum, even in the presence of similar alcohol-related problems.

The risk for rehospitalization and mortality with alcohol-related disorders and diseases (ARDDS) was higher for the EO:PP group when compared to the LO:FC subtype. EO:PP has a history of delirium tremens, repeated outpatient and inpatient treatments.

### Identifying key risk factors for intentional self-harm, including suicide, among a cohort of people prescribed opioid agonist treatment: A predictive modelling study [^117H98xj]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Feature complexity

Previous studies have identified a history of self-harm and mental health problems as major risk factors for overdose and suicide among people who use opioids, consistent with this study. A review of suicide prediction models in 2019 concluded that larger predictor datasets were required to predict suicide effectively, to be used in conjunction with staged screening designs (such as self-report surveys), the use of machine learning, and evaluation using net benefit. Due to the large cohort size, we were able to assess over 230 predictors from 82 main factors to identify people at highest risk. This has provided a key advantage over small studies with insufficient power to determine the importance of the many contributing factors examined.

Although it is generally agreed that self-harm is associated with higher suicide risk and therefore should trigger an intervention, people who self-harm/suicide are a heterogeneous population, making risk identification a complex task. This study has identified additional factors such as the number of ED presentations and the number of prescribers of OAT in the previous three months that may increase our ability to identify those at risk.

This study was a prototype; a pilot study designed for production data and a method of model deployment is a feasible next step.

Implementation

The model is the first step in assessing the predictive ability of using administrative data to identify people at risk. Most of the important features identified in this model were from hospital records and are already accessible in an integrated format.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^112Hfqjt]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

The Boston trials examined the adequacy of existing emergency room care for alcoholics, which began in 1957. This series of studies included the publication of preliminary findings from a subset of the study population a year prior to the full trial results. Alcoholism was viewed explicitly as a behavioral problem amenable to intervention outside hospitals in the community. The brief intervention involved a psychiatrist and a social worker seeking to capitalize on the emergency care visit by referring the patient to outpatient alcohol treatment. A clinic had been opened in Boston earlier in the 1950s. The intervention involved "meeting patients initially with understanding, sympathy, and attention to expressed needs, however concrete they may be". These ideas, held by the young Chafetz about the nature of alcohol problems, co-existed alongside others. An earlier report presented a psychodynamic interpretation of alcoholism heavily influenced by Freud's thinking, which was still strongly evident to at least one writer in 1961.

The first trial alternately assigned 200 male alcoholics to experimental and usual-care groups following a diagnosis of alcoholism by the chief medical officer. Sixty-five brief intervention patients versus five control patients subsequently made an initial visit to the outpatient alcohol clinic, with 42 versus one completing five or more visits over a 12-month period. There was concern about the generalizability of these data due to the very severe nature of the problems faced by the frequently homeless study population.

### Is alcohol dependence best viewed as a chronic relapsing disorder [^116zoh8Y]. Addiction (2012). High credibility.

This 'For Debate' paper starts by recognizing the growing trend towards considering alcohol dependence as a chronic relapsing disorder. We argue that the adoption of this model results from focusing on those in treatment for alcohol dependence rather than considering the larger number of people in the general population who meet criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. The majority of the general population who ever experience alcohol dependence do not behave as though they have a chronic relapsing disorder; they do not seek treatment, resolve their dependence themselves, and do not relapse repeatedly. We suggest that caution is therefore needed in using the chronic relapsing disorder label. Our primary concerns are that this formulation privileges biological aspects of dependence to the detriment of psychological and social contributions, inhibits much-needed developments in understanding alcohol dependence, and leads to inefficient distributions of public health and clinical care resources for alcohol dependence. We invite debate on this issue.

### The effect of parental alcohol and drug disorders on adolescent personality [^117Ae4aX]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship of parental alcohol or drug diagnosis to offspring personality was examined in a population-based sample of 17-year-old twins (568 girls and 479 boys) participating in the Minnesota Twin Family Study. The study investigated whether offspring personality characteristics are specific to the type of substance use disorder in parents (alcohol versus drug) and are found in high-risk offspring without substance use disorders as well as in offspring with substance use disorders.

Personality was assessed using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire, and substance use disorders were evaluated through diagnostic interviews.

In both male and female offspring, a parental history of alcohol dependence was associated with greater negative emotionality, aggression, stress reaction, and alienation, but lower well-being. Conversely, a parental history of drug disorders was linked to lower constraint, control, harm avoidance, and traditionalism, but higher social potency. Excluding offspring with a substance use disorder had virtually no effect on the statistical significance of these findings.

In contrast to findings in some adult samples, personality characteristics associated with a family history of substance use disorders are observed even in adolescent offspring who have not yet developed these disorders themselves. This suggests that personality might be one indicator of familial risk for substance use disorders during this developmental stage.

### The "Prediction of alcohol withdrawal severity scale" (PAWSS): Systematic literature review and pilot study of a new scale for the prediction of complicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114LiXPR]. Alcohol (2014). High credibility.

The Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with alcohol use disorder. It is specifically designed to predict the risk and severity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in adults who are admitted to the hospital for reasons other than alcohol withdrawal.

The PAWSS is clinically useful in identifying patients who are at risk of developing severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens. This allows for early intervention and management, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality associated with severe alcohol withdrawal.

The PAWSS is not intended for use in patients under the age of 18 or in patients who are admitted to the hospital specifically for alcohol withdrawal. It also may not be as accurate in patients with severe comorbid conditions or those who are unable to provide a reliable history of their alcohol use.

The Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) evaluates the risk of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms by considering eleven specific factors related to an individual's alcohol consumption and history. Each factor is assessed with a simple yes or no response, and each "yes" response contributes a certain number of points to the overall score.

- **Scoring system**: Here's how the scoring system works for each factor:
	- Alcohol consumption in the last 30 days or a positive blood alcohol level on admission: 15 points.

### Does this patient have alcohol use disorder? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^113eS8cB]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The accuracy of screening tests for alcohol use disorder, defined as a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, requires reassessment to align with the latest definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5).

The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools in identifying individuals with alcohol use disorder as defined in the DSM-5.

- **Data sources and study selection**: The databases of MEDLINE and Embase were searched (January 2013-February 2023) for original studies on the diagnostic accuracy of brief screening tools to identify alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-5 definition. As the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder does not include excessive alcohol use as a criterion, studies of screening tools that identify excessive or high-risk drinking among younger individuals (aged 9–18 years), older individuals (aged ≥ 65 years), and pregnant persons were also retained.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated. When appropriate, a meta-analysis was performed to calculate a summary LR.

- **Results**: Of 4303 identified studies, 35 were retained (N = 79,633). There were 11,691 individuals with alcohol use disorder or a history of excessive drinking. Across all age categories, a score of 8 or greater on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) increased the likelihood of alcohol use disorder (LR, 6.5 [95% CI, 3.9–11]). A positive screening result using AUDIT identified alcohol use disorder better among females.

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcoholic liver disease [^1142jyea]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for alcohol use disorder, and more specifically with respect to general counseling, the ACG 2018 guidelines recommend counseling patients with heavy alcohol use (> 3 drinks per day in males and > 2 drinks per day in females for more than 5 years) that they are at an increased risk for liver disease.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^1149cgtV]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Brief interventions for alcohol are considered significant because encouraging individuals to engage proactively in assisted reflection on this behavior, whether or not they currently have problems, is a fundamental public health challenge within the general population. For other behavioral problems, such as smoking cessation, the focus is more on technique- and content-focused efforts to aid individuals who have already decided to change. In these cases, brief interventions tend to be less effective than more extended interventions.

This certainly does not imply that the content of brief interventions for alcohol is irrelevant; rather, it emphasizes that its importance is different. There is an urgent need to rectify the slow pace of progress in this area for the literature to develop further. Apart from motivational interviewing (MI), it is not evident that other psychological treatment approaches have been influential in the evolution of brief interventions over time, although this may be shifting.

Where problems are more evident, the idea of brief intervention might be less appealing, whereas the opposite could be true for efforts aimed at promoting physical activity, sexual health, mental health, and reducing risks associated with overeating or drug use. The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to be a pivotal influence in the realm of brief interventions. They sponsor the International Network on Brief Interventions for Alcohol and Other Drugs (INEBRIA), a contemporary international network in this sector, which has recently expanded its focus to include drug use.

### Cross-sectional volumetric analysis of brain atrophy in alcohol dependence: Effects of drinking history and comorbid substance use disorder [^116LZg5C]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The authors assessed whether individual differences in drinking history, as well as the lifetime incidence of comorbid cocaine or marijuana use disorder, underlie differential patterns of brain atrophy in subjects with alcohol dependence.

Segmented magnetic resonance images were used to compare whole-brain cerebral gray matter and white matter in 134 male subjects aged 30–50 with alcohol dependence, either alone or with comorbid cocaine or marijuana use disorder.

Drinking history variables correlated negatively with both gray matter and white matter after age was controlled. Alcohol-dependent subjects with no comorbid substance use disorder (N = 51) showed a steeper negative correlation between age and the gray matter/white matter ratio than did alcohol-dependent subjects with a comorbid lifetime cocaine use disorder diagnosis (N = 50). Alcohol-dependent subjects with comorbid cocaine use disorder tended to have a steeper negative correlation between age and white matter (adjusted for intracranial volume) than alcohol-dependent subjects with no comorbid substance use disorder. After age and the greater estimated cumulative alcohol consumption of alcohol-dependent subjects with comorbid cocaine use disorder were controlled in a multiple regression analysis, however, comorbid cocaine use disorder did not account for any independent variance in any volumetric measure.

Brain atrophy among subjects with alcohol dependence reflects individual differences in exposure to alcohol, and the data provide mixed evidence that comorbid conditions impact these patterns.

### Parental alcohol use disorders and alcohol use and disorders in offspring: A community study [^111owth2]. Psychological Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We examined the association between parental alcohol use disorders and patterns of alcohol consumption and DSM-IV alcohol use disorders in their offspring in a community-based sample of young adults.

- **Methods**: Data are based on baseline and 4-year follow-up data of 2,427 respondents aged 14–24 at baseline. Alcohol use and disorders in respondents were assessed using the Munich-Composite-international-Diagnostic-Interview with DSM-IV algorithms. Diagnostic information about parents was collected by family history information from the respondents and by direct interview with one parent (cohort aged 14 to 17 years only).

- **Results**: Although the association between maternal and paternal alcohol use disorders and non-problematical drinking in offspring was minimal, there was a strong effect for the transition to hazardous use and for alcohol abuse and dependence; the effect of parental concordance for transition into hazardous use was particularly striking. Maternal history was associated with a higher probability of progression from occasional to regular use, whereas paternal history was associated with progression from regular to hazardous use. Parental alcoholism increased the risk for the first onset of hazardous use and alcohol dependence between the ages of 14–17, and for an earlier onset of the alcohol outcomes in offspring. The impact of parental alcohol use disorders was comparable for male and female offspring.

- **Conclusions**: Parental alcoholism predicts escalation of alcohol use, development of alcohol use disorders, and onset of alcohol outcomes in offspring.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for opioids for pain, more specifically concerning the review of prescriptions, the CDC 2022 guidelines recommend reviewing the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions. This review should utilize state prescription drug monitoring program data when prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose.

### A 42-year-old man considering whether to drink alcohol for his health [^111vreM5]. JAMA (2010). Low credibility.

Alcohol consumption is widespread and, in excess, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the same time, a consistent body of observational evidence has found that individuals who consume alcohol within recommended limits have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than do abstainers. These observations have led many to consider small amounts of alcohol as a cardioprotective strategy. Mr. Q, a 42-year-old man who has consistently sought ways to preserve his health, is at a crossroads in his discussions with his physicians about the health effects of his regular, limited alcohol intake.

- **Epidemiology of drinking in the United States**: The discussion reviews the established effects of moderate alcohol intake on key pathophysiological biomarkers and pathways.
- **Effectiveness and evidence**: It examines the strengths and limitations of observational evidence linking alcohol intake to a lower risk of coronary heart disease and other chronic diseases linked to moderate alcohol intake.

A framework is provided in which Mr. Q can discuss the potential risks and benefits of alcohol consumption with his physicians.

### Shapes of subcortical structures in adolescents with and without familial history of substance use disorder [^112hLTYC]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

Prior research investigated neural correlates of SUD risk by examining cortical thickness and volume in adolescents with and without FH of drug/alcohol use. For example, thinner cortices were found in the medial orbitofrontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and superior parietal cortices in at-risk adolescents with FH of alcohol use disorder (AUD). In a study of adolescents and young adults with FH+ for AUD, the ratio of orbitofrontal cortex volume to amygdala volume was found to predict time to alcohol dependence across the sample. In addition, the density of family history of alcoholism was found to be related to the volume of the left nucleus accumbens in adolescent females but not in adolescent males. These studies suggest that risk for SUD could be detected in the volume of brain structures prior to regular drug or alcohol use.

### Family history of alcohol use disorders among adults with panic disorder in the community [^1127FHjm]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical studies suggest a familial association between panic disorder and alcohol use disorders, but this relationship has not been examined in a representative community sample. The objective of this study is to examine the familial association between panic disorder and alcohol use disorders among adults in the community.

Data were drawn from the NESARC, a nationally representative sample of over 43,000 adults in the United States. Rates of alcohol use disorders were examined using the family history method in first-degree relatives (FDRs) of adults with panic disorder. Analyses were adjusted for demographics, alcohol use disorders in the proband, and anxiety disorders in the FDRs.

First-degree relatives of adults with panic disorder have significantly higher odds of alcohol use disorders compared with FDRs of adults without panic disorder. These associations persist after adjusting for demographic characteristics, alcohol use disorders in the proband, and anxiety disorders in the FDRs.

Consistent with findings from clinical studies, this is the first population-based study to show a familial link between panic disorder and alcohol use disorders. This association appears independent of the influence of comorbidity of alcohol use disorders and anxiety disorders, suggesting a potential familial and/or genetic pathway. Future longitudinal studies will be needed to further understand the mechanism of this observed association.

### The trouble with drink: Why ideas matter [^116UuGr7]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

This paper builds upon the work of previous authors who have explored the evolution of ideas in the alcohol arena. With revisions in the relevant sections of the ICD and DSM forthcoming, such matters are of considerable contemporary importance. The focus here is on the history of the last 200 years. The main themes to be explored include the following:

- **Flux of ideas**: Over time, what has counted as the trouble with drink, as well as ideas on the cause of the problem and the impact of this thinking on public action.

- **Medical perspectives**: Medical authorities of the late Enlightenment period made the revolutionary suggestion that habitual drunkenness constituted a disease, rather than a vice. This idea has persisted to the present day, although an alternative perception of drink itself or alcohol-related problems as causes for concern also exists.

- **Inferences from history**:
	- The need for vigilance to prevent disease formulations from becoming stalking-horses for moralism and social control.
	- The integration of awareness of alcohol dependence as a dimensional individual-level problem with a public health understanding of alcohol-related problems.
	- The dangers of scientific reductionism when addressing problems that require multi-disciplinary analysis.
	- The need for global consensus rather than cultural imposition of ideas on what constitutes the problem with drink.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, particularly concerning treatment goals, the APA 2018 guidelines recommend incorporating the following discussions into the initial treatment goals. These should be documented in the medical record:

- **Patient's legal obligations**: such as abstinence from alcohol use and monitoring of abstinence.

- **Risks to self from continued use of alcohol**: including physical health concerns, occupational functioning, and legal involvement.

- **Risk to others from continued use of alcohol**: such as impaired driving.

### Associative memory in alcohol-related contexts: An fMRI study with young binge drinkers [^114ZkEaH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). High credibility.

Participants aged between 18 and 23 years were recruited via an online survey and divided into two groups. Inclusion criteria for the BD group required participants to have consumed four or more drinks for women (five or more for men) in less than 2 hours at least once per month for the past 10 months, ensuring a consistent pattern of binge drinking (BD). The second group served as the control group, consisting of alcohol abstainers without a drinking history; that is, they had never consumed alcohol and, thus, had never experienced a BD episode in their lives.

Preselected participants completed a clinical interview that included different questionnaires to assess their eligibility to participate in the study. Participants were excluded from either group based on the following criteria:

- **Alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT)**: A score of 20 or higher, indicating alcohol abuse or dependence.

- **Handedness**: Left-handedness, as indicated by a score of −40 or lower on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.

- **Psychological assessment**: A Global Severity Index score of 90 or higher, or a score of 90 or higher on at least two symptomatic dimensions of the SCL-90-R.

- **Sensory deficits**: Uncorrected sensory deficits, for example, participants with poor eyesight who do not use glasses or contact lenses.

- **Medical history**: A personal history of traumatic brain injury or neurological disorder.

- **Substance use**: Regular cannabis consumption (i.e. weekly use) or a personal history of regular or occasional use of other drugs, including opiates, hallucinogens, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines, or medically prescribed psychoactive substances.

- **DSM-IV-R criteria**: Alcohol abuse or dependence.

### Brief interventions for smoking or alcohol moderated by history of mental health condition: A national survey of adults in Great Britain 2020–2023 [^112BjKGQ]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

All variables were self-reported. Participants were included if they smoked in the past year or if they drank at risky levels (AUDIT-C score ≥ 5). Details on the wording of the questions and classification are presented in online supplemental file 1. The outcome measures included visiting a GP in the past year, receipt of GP-based brief interventions for smoking or drinking, type of support received, and the most recent attempt to stop smoking or reduce drinking triggered by a healthcare professional (see Table 1).

- **Outcome variables and covariates**:
	- People were classified as having a history of a mental health condition if they reported at least one condition to the question, "Since the age of 16, which of the following, if any, has a doctor or health professional ever told you that you had?"
	- Depression
	- Anxiety
	- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
	- Panic disorder or a phobia
	- Post-traumatic stress disorder
	- Psychosis
	- Personality disorder
	- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
	- An eating disorder
	- Alcohol misuse or dependence
	- Drug use or dependence
	- Problem gambling
	- Autism or autism spectrum disorder
	- Bipolar disorder (previously known as manic depression)

The question was adapted from other surveys. The list of answer options is based on a report on adult psychiatric morbidity in England as well as is in line with ICD-10 recognized mental and behavioral disorders. If none of the answer options were selected, participants were classified as not having a history of a diagnosed mental health condition.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^115LRQYH]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

The contemporaneous connection with the Davies study was not simply coincidental. There were broader developments in thinking about alcohol problems, which were to have major implications for the subsequent development of brief intervention studies, as well as for alcohol research more generally. A punitive approach criminalizing those with alcohol problems was giving way to a more liberal approach. This arose out of a concern for the effects of labeling, which was prominent in the sociology of deviance at the time. Attention to better understanding the needs of drinkers became a constituent element of the progressive politics of the 1960s. Throughout that decade and the next, the disease concept of alcoholism came to be challenged and defended robustly, in a dispute about the nature of scientific thinking on alcohol problems.

There are different varieties of disease conceptions of addictions, although at its heart, the disease concept involves a categorical separation of people who are unable to drink normally from those who are, making controlled drinking impossible for the former. This was gradually challenged by explicitly behavioral conceptions of the nature of drinking problems within the treatment research community. These were already evident during the 1950s, for example, in Finland, where reduced drinking was accepted as an acceptable treatment outcome measure in addition to abstinence. Drinking problems, even very extreme drinking leading to disease and premature death, became defined fundamentally differently.

### Alcohol and public health [^117Y9vxM]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Alcoholic beverages and the problems they engender have been familiar fixtures in human societies since the beginning of recorded history. We review advances in alcohol science in terms of three topics: the epidemiology of alcohol's role in health and illness, the treatment of alcohol use disorders from a public health perspective, and policy research and options. Research has substantially contributed to our understanding of the relation between drinking and specific disorders, demonstrating that the relation between alcohol consumption and health outcomes is complex and multidimensional. Alcohol is causally related to more than 60 different medical conditions. Overall, 4% of the global burden of disease is attributable to alcohol, accounting for about as much death and disability globally as tobacco and hypertension.

Treatment research indicates that early intervention in primary care is feasible and effective. Various behavioral and pharmacological interventions are available to treat alcohol dependence. This evidence suggests that treating alcohol-related problems should be incorporated into a public health response. Additionally, evidence-based preventive measures are available at both the individual and population levels, with alcohol taxes, restrictions on alcohol availability, and drinking-driving countermeasures among the most effective policy options. Despite these scientific advances, alcohol problems continue to present a major challenge to medicine and public health, partly because population-based public health approaches have been n

### Do current measures of polygenic risk for mental disorders contribute to population variance in mental health [^115GEutM]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Low credibility.

Family history and parental history were assessed as person-level characteristics across two variables, as described in a previous publication. First, for participants who screened positive for the following psychiatric diagnoses, the presence of the disorder in direct relatives was assessed at each interview wave: alcohol/drug abuse/dependence, depression, mania, and anxiety disorders (panic disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder). This variable will be referred to as "family history". A total of 51% of the sample screened positive for this variable at any of the four interview waves. Second, at T1, self-reported parental history of "problems with alcohol", "problems with drugs", "any psychiatric treatment or admission", "severe anxiety or phobias", "severe depression", "suicide", and "delusions or hallucinations" were assessed in the entire sample. A total of 31% screened positive for positive parental family history. This variable will be referred to as "parental history".

Childhood adversity was assessed at T0 using a questionnaire based on the NEMESIS trauma questionnaire. Whenever a subject reported having experienced one of five types of childhood adversity before the age of 16 years (emotional neglect [not listened to, ignored, or unsupported], physical abuse [kicked, hit, bitten, or hurt with object or hot water], psychological abuse [yelled at, insulted, unjustly punished/treated, threatened, belittled, or blackmailed], peer victimization [bullying], and one time or more sexual abuse [any unwanted sexual experience]).

### Associations between polygenic risk of substance use and use disorder and alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use in adolescence and young adulthood in a longitudinal twin study [^115uB3uj]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

**Family history**: Adolescent participants' family history of SUD was determined using parents' self-report of their own lifetime symptoms, collected at the baseline assessment using the expanded Substance Abuse Module (SAM) of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (Robins, Baber, & Cottler). Parents were assigned lifetime alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, or nicotine dependence diagnoses if they endorsed two or more DSM-III-R symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence, cannabis abuse or dependence, or nicotine dependence, respectively, consistent with DSM-5 criteria. Adolescent participants' family history of alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and nicotine dependence were thus each coded as '1' if at least one parent met criteria for the respective lifetime diagnosis and coded as '0' if neither parent met lifetime criteria.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^1151LdvP]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

In so doing, problem drinking, understood as a behavior over which control could be exerted, invited interventions providing help. This concept fitted with the emerging epidemiological perspective, which saw alcohol consumption and problems as being distributed in degrees across the entire drinking population in a roughly normal distribution but skewed towards the heavier end. It was also very much of its time within psychology, being part of the rise of behaviorist ideas more widely within that discipline and in psychiatry, and the concomitant waning of the influence of psychoanalytical perspectives. The ideas of Carl Rogers and the humanistic psychology movement became prominent in thinking about how to help people in general with problems of any kind throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Nonetheless, humanistic and behavioral ideas had to contend with culturally powerful and thus strongly persistent ideas of character defects as they were applied to people with alcohol problems in US treatment systems and society more broadly.

In 1977, Edwards and Orford published a trial showing equivalent outcomes for 100 married men given a single session of 'advice' in comparison with the standard treatment of the time involving in-patient admission and extensive aftercare, including Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) facilitation. The approach used for the advice was not directed at treatment engagement and instead directly involved wives in assisting the resolution of problems in their husbands. Abstinence was the treatment goal; general practitioners (GPs) were to be contacted for withdrawal medication.

### The early history of ideas on brief interventions for alcohol [^114XMhCN]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

This study explores the early development of brief interventions for alcohol using a history of ideas approach, with a particular focus on intervention content.

- **Methods**: The source publications of the key primary studies published from approximately 1962 to 1992 were examined, followed by a brief review of the earliest reviews in this field. These studies were placed in the context of developments in alcohol research and public health.

- **Results**: After early pioneering work on brief interventions, further advances were not made until new thinking about alcohol problems and their treatment, most notably on controlled drinking, along with wider changes in public health, created new conditions for progress. There was a golden era of rapid advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when preventing the development of problem drinking became important for public health reasons, in addition to helping already problematic drinkers. Many research challenges identified at that time remain to be met. The content of brief interventions changed over the period of study, although not in ways well informed by research advances. There were also obvious continuities, with a renewed emphasis on the facilitation of self-change being one important consequence of the development of internet applications.

- **Conclusions**: Ideas about brief interventions have changed in important ways. Brief interventions have been studied with different populations of drinkers, with aims embracing both individual and population-level perspectives, and without well-specified contents.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114cWaGK]. Nursing (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol withdrawal syndrome:

- **Definition**: AWS is a condition that occurs after the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake following heavy and prolonged use.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AWS involves neuroadaptive changes in the CNS due to chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol use leads to the upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the downregulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped, this results in a hyperadrenergic state and increased glutamatergic activity, causing withdrawal symptoms.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AWS include heavy and prolonged alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, concomitant use of other sedative-hypnotics, and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of AWS typically begins with mild symptoms, such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea within 6–12 hours of cessation of alcohol intake. More severe symptoms, such as hallucinations and seizures, can occur within 12–48 hours. Delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability, typically occurs within 48–96 hours.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although most cases of AWS are self-limiting and resolve within a week, severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens can be life-threatening. The use of validated risk assessment tools, such as the PAWSS, can help identify patients at risk of severe AWS and guide management strategies.

### Is alcohol dependence best viewed as a chronic relapsing disorder [^112Uxdzo]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

This 'For Debate' paper starts by recognizing the growing trend towards considering alcohol dependence as a chronic relapsing disorder. We argue that the adoption of this model results from focusing on those in treatment for alcohol dependence, rather than considering the larger number of people in the general population who meet criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. The majority of the general population who ever experience alcohol dependence do not behave as though they have a chronic relapsing disorder; they do not seek treatment, resolve their dependence themselves, and do not relapse repeatedly. We suggest that caution is therefore needed in using the chronic relapsing disorder label. Our primary concerns are that this formulation privileges biological aspects of dependence to the detriment of psychological and social contributions, it inhibits much-needed developments in understanding alcohol dependence, and leads to inefficient distributions of public health and clinical care resources for alcohol dependence. We invite debate on this issue.

### Advances in the science and treatment of alcohol use disorder [^114fnyd1]. Science Advances (2019). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder is a complex condition that can be associated with various factors and symptoms. These include:

- **CAGE score, PTSD, and tremor**: The presence of a positive CAGE questionnaire, a TWEAK score of ≥ 2, or a T-ACE score of ≥ 1 can indicate alcohol use disorder.
- **Failure to fulfill domestic or work obligations**: This is a common issue among those affected.
- **Sarcopenia and altered mental status**: Symptoms such as restlessness, depression, and altered mental status are frequently observed.
- **Unsafe alcohol consumption and cravings**: The consumption of alcohol in unsafe situations and cravings for alcohol are notable indicators.
- **Liver-related problems**: Indicators include liver cirrhosis, increased serum ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels, as well as an increased AST-to-ALT ratio and elevated serum ferritin.
- **Physical and mental health issues**: Symptoms such as neuropathy, low mood, weight loss, cachexia, malnutrition, anxiety, sleep disorders, and gynecomastia may present.
- **Scores and tolerance**: High AUDIT scores (≥ 8), AUDIT-C scores (≥ 4), and developing tolerance to the effects of alcohol are noted.
- **Complications and withdrawal**: Ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and substance use disorder can develop. Continuing to drink despite negative consequences and experiencing withdrawal symptoms when reducing alcohol intake are critical issues impacting patients' health and quality of life.

These diverse factors highlight the multifaceted nature of alcohol use disorder and the importance of comprehensive treatment and management approaches.

Structured psychiatric and psychological assessment revealed the demographic characteristics of the 34 individuals (28 cases of acute HIV infection and 6 cases of early HIV infection) enrolled in the study are presented in a companion piece in this issue. In brief, participants were predominantly Caucasian or Hispanic gay men in their late 20s or early 30s who had at least some college education.

Psychiatric history, as assessed by the M. I.N. I. Plus, is described in Table 1. The vast majority of participants (29 of 34; 85.3%) met criteria for a lifetime history of an alcohol or other substance use disorder, with more than half (21 of 34; 61.8%) meeting criteria for a recent (within the past 12 months) disorder. Furthermore, a majority of participants (18 of 34; 52.9%) met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of mood disorder, either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Co-morbidity — the lifetime occurrence of two or more conditions, such as alcohol use disorder and mood disorder — was characteristic of the sample, with 18 participants (52.9%) having two or more disorders.

### Gender differences in prevalence, risk, and clinical correlates of alcoholism comorbidity in bipolar disorder [^111JcRZ9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence of lifetime alcohol abuse and/or dependence (alcoholism) in patients with bipolar disorder has been reported to be higher than in all other axis I psychiatric diagnoses. This study examined gender-specific relationships between alcoholism and bipolar illness, which have previously received little systematic study.

- **Method**: The prevalence of lifetime alcoholism in 267 outpatients enrolled in the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network was evaluated by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Alcoholism and its relationship to retrospectively assessed measures of the course of bipolar illness were evaluated by patient-rated and clinician-administered questionnaires.

- **Results**: As in the general population, more men (49%, 57 of 116) than women with bipolar disorder (29%, 44 of 151) met the criteria for lifetime alcoholism. However, the risk of having alcoholism was greater for women with bipolar disorder (odds ratio = 7.35) than for men with bipolar disorder (odds ratio = 2.77) compared with the general population. Alcoholism was associated with a history of polysubstance use in women with bipolar disorder and with a family history of alcoholism in men with bipolar disorder.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that there are gender differences in the prevalence, risk, and clinical correlates of alcoholism in bipolar illness. Although this study is limited by the retrospective assessment of illness variables, the magnitude of these gender-specific differences is substantial and warrants further prospective study.

### The association between glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist prescriptions and substance-related outcomes in patients with opioid and alcohol use disorders: A real-world data analysis [^112VWNdx]. Addiction (2025). Low credibility.

Demographics of patients with hospital visits between January 2014 and August 2022 reveal insights among those prescribed GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists or not, specifically within the population with a history of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder from Cerner‐affiliated hospital systems.

Among those with a history of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the mean (SD) age was 46.8 (16.2) years; 67.7% were male, 70.8% were single, 62.2% were non-Hispanic White, 36.3% were from the Western United States, and 28.5% reported Medicaid for insurance. Notably, 10% of patients in the AUD cohort had a comorbidity score ≥ 5, 8.9% had a history of mental health conditions, 34.4% had a history of tobacco dependence, and 6.3% had undergone medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) treatment.

- **Differences between prescription and non-prescription groups**:
	- Those with AUD and a GIP/GLP‐1 RA prescription had an average age of 54.7 years and were 64.7% male. In contrast, individuals without prescriptions had an average age of 46.8 years and 67.7% male. Additionally, 15.5% of those with prescriptions had a history of mental health conditions, and 50.1% had a history of tobacco dependence, compared to 8.8% and 34.4% respectively in those without prescriptions.

- **Alcohol intoxication and treatment history**:
	- Among individuals with AUD and a GIP/GLP‐1 RA prescription, 21.8% had a history of alcohol intoxication and 14.8% had undergone MAUD treatment. Comparatively, 37.1% had a history of alcohol intoxication and 6.2% had undergone MAUD treatment among those without a GIP/GLP‐1 RA prescription in the AUD cohort.

### Behavioral symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses among 162 children in nonalcoholic or alcoholic families [^114SCbvJ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to investigate behavioral symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses among children with alcoholic relatives. While it is known that people with alcoholic relatives have high rates of alcohol abuse and dependence as adults, their patterns of problems earlier in life are less clear. Many studies have previously failed to control for parental disorders other than alcoholism, as well as for parents' socioeconomic status and general life functioning. The authors aimed to conduct a study controlling for these factors.

The method involved administering personal structured interviews and a behavioral checklist to the parents of 162 children, aged 7 years or older, whose fathers had participated in the 15-year follow-up of 453 sons of alcoholics with no history of antisocial personality disorder and sons of nonalcoholic comparison subjects originally selected from a university population.

Results indicated no significant relationship between a family history of alcoholism and childhood diagnoses of conduct, oppositional, or attention deficit disorders, or with behavioral checklist summary scores. However, it was found that children with alcoholic relatives apparently have a slightly higher risk for drug abuse or dependence than those without alcoholic relatives.

The conclusions drawn from the study suggest that, once familial antisocial disorders and familial socioeconomic status are controlled for, a family history of alcoholism does not appear to relate to childhood externalizing disorders.

### Gender differences in psychiatric and behavioral health burden among adults with alcohol and other substance use disorders in the United States [^116R8po3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: Studies report that women with opioid use disorder experience more comorbid psychiatric disorders and behavioral health burdens than men. We broadened the study of this phenomenon to alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other substance use disorders (SUDs) using national epidemiologic data.

- **Methods**: Data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave-III identified 2,491 women and 3,317 men with DSM-5 AUD or SUDs, and 30,501 men and women without such disorders. Women and men with AUD and SUDs were compared to those without such disorders on 22 measures of DSM-5 psychiatric disorders and behavioral histories (e.g. incarceration and suicide attempt). The interaction of female sex and AUD in relation to these measures was evaluated and we repeated analyses for SUDs.

- **Results**: Separate analyses of female and male adults with and without AUD or SUDs showed AUD and SUDs in both sexes were strongly associated with psychiatric disorders and behavioral histories. In pooled analyses, the interaction of female sex and AUD showed women with AUD had significantly greater likelihood than men of: borderline personality disorder, pain; parental history of incarceration; traumatic events; incarceration; and lifetime homelessness (P < 0.05 for all), but not for psychiatric diagnoses. Interaction of female sex with SUDs showed women had increased likelihood of all personality disorders, traumatic events, and past incarceration (P < 0.05 for all).

- **Conclusions**: Certain personality disorders and behavioral histories, but not psychiatric diagnoses, may play a significant role in the interaction of female sex with AUD and SUDs.

### Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder among pre-adopted and foster children [^114iHR3w]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

For many of the patients, complete or reliable information was not available for various reasons, including the lack of cooperation from the biological parents. This occurred in situations where children were removed from the home due to neglect or abuse, when children were found abandoned, or when there was unreliability of the information obtained, such as a lack of external validation related to ethanol consumption. This is a particularly significant problem associated with this patient population because most categories of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) require confirmed maternal exposure to alcohol.

With reference to maternal alcohol consumption, we followed the recommendations of the Canadian Task Force that a history of alcohol consumption during pregnancy was sufficient. Our study population presented unique problems with regard to prenatal alcohol exposure. A preponderance of children in our study were placed in foster care or became candidates for adoption due to the unavailability of biological parents, such as abandoned children or those whose parents were incapable of raising them due to intellectual disability, psychiatric disorders, or serious substance abuse. There were also parents accused of abuse where admitting to alcohol usage would damage their legal standing. As such, in many cases, it was difficult to obtain a reliable history of prenatal alcohol exposure. Due to policies of Israel's Child Services Agency, we could not contact biological parents. We adopted a conservative approach to maternal alcohol consumption. Unless the information was reliable and confirmed by an outside source, such as a social worker or family member, we did not categorize it as valid.

### Development and internal validation of a prediction model for long-term opioid use-an analysis of insurance claims data [^1135ntXU]. Pain (2024). Low credibility.

- **Predictor domains included**: Demographic variables such as age in categories from 2 years ago, 6 months to 2 years ago, and within the last 6 months. Disease-specific risk factors include comorbidities and comedication use.

Although in Switzerland the level of inequality is relatively low compared to other countries, there are differences in social status. The socioeconomic variables include proxies such as the place of residence; for instance, the French/Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland are associated with a lower index of socioeconomic position compared to the German-speaking parts. Additionally, private or semiprivate insurance is more expensive, and managed care models are less expensive than standard policies.

Comorbid diseases were identified using the Chronic Disease Score (CDS), which has been associated with healthcare use. Chronic diseases included are chronic infections, inflammatory disease, renal disease, endocrinologic disease, diabetes, lung or pulmonary disease, neurological disease, cardiovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia.

### The natural history of alcohol-related liver disease [^1174n6dr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) in light of recent data that have synthesized existing knowledge on this topic and described new research cohorts to improve our understanding of progression and outcomes in ArLD.

- **Recent findings**: ArLD occurs following a threshold of alcohol consumption, but this threshold is lowered by the presence of comorbid factors, with obesity being the most common. The most common stage of ArLD is alcohol-related steatosis, which is associated with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (3% per year). Non-liver-related morbidity is more likely, at a rate of 4% per year compared to 1% per year. In contrast, alcohol-related steatohepatitis or cirrhosis is more dangerous, with higher rates of both non-liver and liver-related mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs at approximately 3% per year among people with ArLD cirrhosis.

These data allow for an improved understanding of ArLD to effectively counsel patients and guide public health policies. Awareness of the shortcomings of the available data, highlighted in a recent systematic review, will inform the design of further research, particularly to describe the multiple interacting factors that may cause ArLD to regress or progress.

### The association between employment in coal mining and history of injury, current pain, and prescription opioid use [^113F553g]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Coal mining involves heavy physical demand, which is associated with an increased risk of injury and long-term musculoskeletal health disorders and chronic pain. Management of chronic pain is, in turn, associated with prescription opioid use and the risk of opioid use disorder (OUD).

- **Methods**: We analyzed clinical data from 5,463 coal miners evaluated between 2004 and 2015. Using an iterative text mining procedure, we analyzed structured clinical notes to extract information on occupational histories and clinical data. We evaluated associations along the causal chain using a series of multivariable logistic regression models to determine the relationship between (1) specific mining occupations and history of traumatic injury, (2) history of traumatic injury and pain, and (3) pain and prescription opioid use.

- **Results**: Among these mostly former coal miners (mean age 62.4 years), the average coal mining tenure was 27.3 years; 88.4% reported being previously injured, 92.3% reported suffering from pain, and 39.2% reported prescription opioid use. Occupations involving the most strenuous mining work were associated with a history of traumatic injury. A history of traumatic injury to body regions of the head/neck/back/spine was associated with pain involving those same regions (adjusted OR = 5.04; CI 95%: 4.46, 5.70; p < 0.001). In a separate model, reported pain of the head/neck/back/spine was associated with prescription opioid use (aOR = 2.66; CI 95%: 2.35, 3.01; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: These miners are at significant risk of injury and subsequent pain management issues, often leading to prescription opioid use.

### Prevalence and clinical relevance of interview-assessed psychosis-risk symptoms in the young adult community [^116YQkx7]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The risk factors for the presence of psychosis-risk symptoms include younger age, lifetime alcohol misuse, lifetime drug misuse, single marital status, absence of a partner, lower educational attainment, unemployment, family history of mental disorders in first- or second-degree biological relatives (particularly substance use and/or affective disorder), and lifetime traumatic events. Notably, sex, migrant status (estimated by non-Swiss nationality), minority status, alcohol misuse, and higher population density did not predict the presence of any psychosis-risk symptoms.

Stepwise analyses revealed a stable significant model with goodness-of-fit: χ²(7) = 72.048, p < 0.001. This model included younger age, lifetime drug misuse, absence of a partner, lower educational attainment, unemployment, family history of mental disorders, and lifetime traumatic events as predictors of any psychosis-risk symptom.

When distinguishing between ultra-high risk and basic symptoms, the following predictors of psychosis-risk symptom constellations emerged:

- **Exclusively ultra-high risk symptoms**: Family history of mental disorders, lifetime trauma, lifetime alcohol and drug misuse, unemployment.

### The relationship between different dimensions of alcohol use and the burden of disease-an update [^113Dtdmi]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Terminology

Unless specified otherwise, we will use the term 'heavy drinking occasion' for consuming quantities of 60+ g of pure alcohol on one occasion. Chronic heavy drinking indicates consumption on average per day of 60+ g of pure alcohol for men and 40+ g for women. Light to moderate drinking refers to drinking patterns which, on average, entail fewer than 60 g of pure alcohol per day in men and fewer than 40 g in women.

### Initial opioid prescription characteristics and risk of opioid misuse, poisoning and dependence: Retrospective cohort study [^11459Dtm]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). Low credibility.

We included patients' sociodemographic and lifestyle variables such as age, sex, nationality, income range (based on pharmaceutical co-payment status information), alcohol misuse, and tobacco use. Additionally, comorbidities at baseline were considered, including hypertension, ischaemic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, depression, diabetes, and renal and liver disease. We also examined the presence of any surgical procedure in the 30 days prior to the index date. Detailed information on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes used for covariates and drugs included in the study can be found in the online supplemental material S1, and details on the identification of surgical procedures are provided in the online supplemental material S2.

- **Treatment initiation**: This was characterized using several variables, including the choice of opioid, duration (mean, median, and range), daily MME (mean, median, and range), indication of use, and the percentage of patients with concomitant use, or overlap, of benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, or antipsychotics. Overlap was determined when patients received at least one prescription for one of these drugs, with the days' supply overlapping the index date (the date of initial opioid prescription). To estimate the daily MME of the initial prescription, we used prescription information to identify milligrams prescribed, days' supply (using the dosing regimen specified in the prescription), and an MME conversion table (see online supplemental material S3). Indication of use was classified as musculoskeletal (MSK) pain (back pain, osteoarthrosis, arthritis, other MSK conditions).

### Complexity of illness and adjunctive benzodiazepine use in outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder: results from the Bipolar CHOICE study [^117Ku4Ln]. Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benzodiazepine use disorder:

- **Definition**: Benzodiazepine use disorder (BUD) is a chronic condition characterized by the excessive and uncontrollable use of benzodiazepine drugs, often leading to significant impairment or distress.

- **Pathophysiology**: BUD is characterized by neurobiological changes in the brain's GABA system. Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of GABA, leading to sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. Chronic use can lead to the development of tolerance and dependence.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of BUD in the US is estimated at 2.2%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BUD include a personal history of substance use disorders, psychiatric disorders (particularly anxiety disorders), and certain demographic factors such as lower educational level and lower income. Environmental influences, such as easy access to benzodiazepines, can also contribute to the development of this disorder.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, BUD presents with a range of symptoms. These can include cravings for benzodiazepines, continued use despite negative consequences, inability to control or reduce use, and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and seizures. Complications can include cognitive impairment, increased risk of falls and accidents, and life-threatening withdrawal symptoms.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BUD can vary widely and is influenced by several factors. These include the patient's overall health and the presence of co-occurring conditions.
