## Question

What evaluation and management should be pursued following a recurrent ischemic stroke in a 93-year-old patient who is currently taking clopidogrel?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what evaluation and management to pursue for a 93-year-old with a recurrent ischemic stroke while taking clopidogrel. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and stroke severity to determine whether acute dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is even appropriate. Then, I should verify the stroke mechanism with a focused etiologic workup because strategy hinges on cardioembolic versus non-cardioembolic sources. Next, I will examine for atrial fibrillation and decide about anticoagulation timing if present. After that, I need to check for antiplatelet nonadherence, high on-treatment platelet reactivity, and CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles that would make clopidogrel suboptimal. Finally, I should quantify bleeding risk in a 93-year-old, choose an evidence-based antithrombotic regimen, and optimize vascular risk factors with close follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario: I need emergent brain and vascular imaging to verify an acute ischemic stroke, exclude hemorrhage, define infarct burden and pattern, and document the NIHSS because DAPT is only indicated acutely for minor non-cardioembolic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 3) or high-risk TIA, typically for 21 days started within 24 hours, before de-escalating to monotherapy [^115GgZv4] [^111NF3pH]. Hold on, I should also review diffusion-weighted MRI for infarction patterns because multiple acute infarctions carry substantially higher early recurrence risk and may push me to intensify secondary prevention if bleeding risk allows [^116cTQNA].

> Next, I should review the mechanism using a TOAST-based approach because recurrent stroke on an antiplatelet often reflects a mismatch between mechanism and therapy. Wait, let me verify the yield here: in a large registry, breakthrough strokes on antiplatelets were cardioembolic in about one quarter, large artery atherosclerosis in about one fifth, small vessel disease in about one eighth, and unknown in about one third, which underscores the need for telemetry or prolonged rhythm monitoring and echocardiography, plus head and neck CTA/MRA or duplex to identify large artery disease [^112okrR1] [^112cp98v]. I should confirm that antithrombotics are matched to mechanism because antiplatelets are preferred for atherosclerotic disease, whereas anticoagulation is required for cardioembolism and thrombophilias [^1152SP8K].

> I will now examine for atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic sources; if AF is identified, I should switch from antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation, with DOACs generally preferred and initiation typically 2–14 days post-stroke when hemorrhagic transformation risk is acceptable. Wait, I need to ensure I do not add routine antiplatelet therapy on top of anticoagulation in the absence of another clear indication, because the evidence does not support it and bleeding risk rises, especially in the very elderly [^113EFB3o] [^112wT5zX] [^116amYnG]. Hold on, I should verify that adjunctive antiplatelet therapy after an ischemic stroke on a DOAC did not improve outcomes in observational cohorts either, which supports avoiding dual-pathway strategies here unless a coronary indication exists [^114F3xbn] [^114gN39P].

> But if the stroke is non-cardioembolic and minor, and the patient presents within the guideline window, I should consider short-course DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days given the POINT and CHANCE data, then revert to single antiplatelet therapy; beyond 90 days, the benefit wanes and bleeding rises. Wait, let me double-check severity; if NIHSS is > 3 or the presentation is outside the acute window, the guidelines do not support starting DAPT, and I should avoid escalating antiplatelet intensity without evidence [^113zT3iC] [^113F5Uq6] [^115GgZv4] [^111NF3pH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought intermediate-severity strokes might still benefit from DAPT, but the guideline indication is restricted to minor non-cardioembolic strokes, so I should not extrapolate beyond that population [^115GgZv4] [^111NF3pH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "clopidogrel failure" before ruling out adherence lapses, drug–drug interactions, and pharmacodynamic or pharmacogenomic resistance. I should confirm adherence and look for recent withdrawal or periprocedural stoppage, which is a known trigger for early recurrence, then assess for high on-treatment platelet reactivity and consider CYP2C19 genotyping because loss-of-function alleles impair clopidogrel activation and are associated with higher event rates. If high on-treatment reactivity or a LOF genotype is present, clopidogrel is suboptimal and I should switch to an alternative antiplatelet strategy rather than simply increasing dose [^116JWKij] [^114NfToV] [^113q21ER] [^112mUKxR].

> For long-term secondary prevention in non-cardioembolic stroke, I need to ensure the regimen aligns with guideline-supported monotherapy options: aspirin 50–325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, or aspirin 25 mg plus extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily, tailored to tolerance and prior response. I should confirm that chronic dual antiplatelet therapy or triple antiplatelet therapy is not recommended due to bleeding without added benefit, particularly relevant in a 93-year-old, and that prolonged aspirin–clopidogrel after lacunar stroke increased bleeding and death in SPS3, supporting avoidance of long-term DAPT [^113bmhte] [^111E5Guz] [^114MrDoE].

> Let me consider imaging-defined large artery stenosis, because symptomatic intracranial or extracranial stenosis may shift me toward a short course of ticagrelor plus aspirin in selected high-risk TIA or stroke patients per 2021 guidelines, recognizing the increased bleeding and the need to individualize in the very elderly. I should double-check that this ticagrelor-based DAPT recommendation is 30 days and targeted to high-risk or stenotic phenotypes rather than used broadly [^113T7Tbj].

> I need to ensure I quantify bleeding risk formally given advanced age. The S2TOP-BLEED tool can estimate major bleeding on antiplatelets, and for patients who may require anticoagulation, a HAS-BLED assessment and clinical appraisal of frailty, falls risk, renal function, and prior GI bleeding are crucial. Hold on, I should verify that net benefit varies by bleeding risk strata; in those with very high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, de-escalation may be prudent after the acute phase [^111CW7Sa].

> Next, I should review comprehensive vascular risk reduction because the antithrombotic choice is only one piece. I need to confirm continuation or initiation of high-intensity statin if tolerated, even in older adults, after shared decision-making that considers frailty and drug interactions, and I must optimize blood pressure, diabetes, and lifestyle measures because these shift recurrent stroke risk substantially, particularly after a breakthrough event [^116Eg5bQ] [^1152SP8K] [^111gSaks].

> Putting this together for a 93-year-old with recurrent ischemic stroke on clopidogrel: let me first confirm minor versus non-minor stroke and timing. If minor and within 24 hours, I would initiate 21 days of aspirin plus clopidogrel, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy, but if outside window or NIHSS > 3, I would not start DAPT and instead move directly to optimized monotherapy after mechanism-directed evaluation. I should screen intensively for AF and, if present, transition to a DOAC at 2–14 days without routine addition of antiplatelet therapy, balancing hemorrhagic risk. If non-cardioembolic with evidence of clopidogrel nonresponse or CYP2C19 LOF, I would switch to aspirin or aspirin–dipyridamole rather than persist with clopidogrel, and I would avoid long-term dual or triple antiplatelet therapy. Throughout, I must individualize to bleeding risk using S2TOP-BLEED, reassess adherence, eliminate drug interactions, and close the loop on risk factor control with careful geriatric considerations [^115GgZv4] [^111NF3pH] [^113EFB3o] [^112wT5zX] [^116amYnG] [^114NfToV] [^113q21ER] [^112mUKxR] [^113bmhte] [^111E5Guz] [^111CW7Sa] [^116Eg5bQ].

After a repeat ischemic stroke in a 93-year-old already on clopidogrel, the priority is to **identify the stroke mechanism** and **individualize antithrombotic therapy** based on etiology and bleeding risk [^111NF3pH] [^1152SP8K]. Immediate steps include **brain imaging**, **vascular imaging**, and **cardiac evaluation** to guide management [^112cp98v]. If a cardioembolic source is found, **switch to anticoagulation** [^113EFB3o]; if non-cardioembolic, consider **short-term dual antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 21–30 days [^115GgZv4], then revert to monotherapy [^113bmhte], and avoid triple therapy [^111E5Guz]. Address modifiable risk factors, assess for clopidogrel resistance [^113q21ER], and involve geriatrics and palliative care to align care with goals and frailty.

---

## Diagnostic workup

A comprehensive **diagnostic workup** is essential to determine the etiology of recurrent ischemic stroke:

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI with DWI or CT to confirm infarct and exclude hemorrhage [^112cp98v].

- **Vascular imaging**: CTA, MRA, or carotid ultrasound to assess extracranial/intracranial stenosis.

- **Cardiac evaluation**: ECG, echocardiography, and prolonged rhythm monitoring to detect AF or other cardioembolic sources.

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, renal/hepatic function, lipid panel, HbA1c, and coagulation profile [^112cp98v].

- **Medication adherence and resistance**: Review adherence and consider platelet function testing or CYP2C19 genotyping for clopidogrel resistance [^114NfToV] [^113q21ER].

---

## Antithrombotic management

Antithrombotic therapy should be **individualized** according to stroke etiology, bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors:

### Cardioembolic stroke (e.g. atrial fibrillation)

- **Anticoagulation**: Initiate oral anticoagulation (warfarin or DOAC) if a cardioembolic source is identified [^113EFB3o].

- **Timing**: Start anticoagulation 2–14 days after the event, considering hemorrhagic risk [^112wT5zX].

- **Avoidance of dual therapy**: Do not add antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulation unless there is a separate indication (e.g. recent coronary stenting) [^116amYnG].

---

### Non-cardioembolic stroke

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: Consider short-term DAPT (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 21–30 days if the stroke is minor (NIHSS ≤ 3) or high-risk TIA, then revert to monotherapy [^111NF3pH] [^113bmhte].

- **Alternative antiplatelet agents**: If clopidogrel resistance is confirmed, consider switching to aspirin or aspirin plus dipyridamole [^113bmhte] [^1152SP8K].

- **Avoidance of triple therapy**: Do not use triple antiplatelet therapy due to excessive bleeding risk [^111E5Guz].

---

## Risk factor optimization

Aggressive management of **modifiable risk factors** is critical. Targets include achieving blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; initiating high-intensity statin therapy with attention to frailty and tolerance [^116Eg5bQ]; aiming for HbA1c < 7.0–7.5% if feasible; and lifestyle measures such as smoking cessation, dietary modifications, and physical activity as tolerated.

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

Elderly patients require **individualized care** given increased bleeding risk, frailty, and comorbidities. Use validated bleeding risk tools (e.g. HAS-BLED) to guide therapy; consider deprescribing or simplifying regimens when risks outweigh benefits; and involve geriatrics and palliative care early to align treatment with patient goals and quality of life.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Cardioembolic stroke | Initiate anticoagulation (warfarin or DOAC) [^113EFB3o] |
| Non-cardioembolic stroke | - Short-term DAPT (aspirin + clopidogrel) for 21–30 days [^115GgZv4] <br/> - Then monotherapy [^113bmhte] |
| Clopidogrel resistance | Switch to aspirin or aspirin + dipyridamole [^113bmhte] |
| High bleeding risk | - Individualize therapy [^111CW7Sa] <br/> - Consider deprescribing [^111CW7Sa] |
| Frailty/cognitive impairment | - Simplify regimen <br/> - Consider palliative care |

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically concerning antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel). This should ideally occur within 12–24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset. The dual therapy should continue for 21–90 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent minor (NIHSS score ≤ 3) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (ABCD² score ≥ 4).

### Ninety-day stroke recurrence in minor stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis of trials and observational studies [^117Hdssf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with minor ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) have traditionally been considered together. This is due to similarities in treatment, prognosis, and outcomes, as well as the challenges in differentiating between them based on imaging at presentation. Recent large antiplatelet trials have also adopted this approach by including both minor strokes and high-risk TIAs. Combined, they are associated with a risk of recurrent stroke between 10% and 20% during the first three months in natural history observations.

TIA and minor stroke, however, are not identical. Up to 38% of clinic attendees with TIA have nonischemic mimics, which dilutes the estimated cohort risk of stroke recurrence because patients without ischemia effectively have a near-zero rate of early subsequent stroke. Among meta-analyses that focus on TIA alone, the 90-day stroke risk varied from 6% to 9%. These meta-analyses were based on studies performed more than 10 years ago. Since then, studies addressing rapid TIA pathways have reported a lower risk of recurrence compared with standard care. For example, a large multicenter TIA and minor stroke registry reported a 90-day recurrence risk of 3.7%, but it is unclear if this finding was dominated by cases of TIA or what the risks were in the subgroup with minor stroke.

Determining the risk of recurrence with TIA and minor stroke separately can be difficult as few investigators have focused on recurrence after minor stroke. Further, recurrence rates may be reduced by treatment and therefore lower among those.

### Antiplatelet regimen for patients with breakthrough strokes while on aspirin: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uLPhy]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal antiplatelet therapy after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack while on aspirin is uncertain, so a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to address this issue.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed (1966 to August 2016) and bibliographies of relevant published original studies to identify randomized trials and cohort studies. These studies reported on patients who were on aspirin at the time of an index ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and provided hazard ratios for major adverse cardiovascular events or recurrent stroke associated with a switch to or addition of another antiplatelet agent versus maintaining aspirin monotherapy. Estimates were combined using a random effects model.

- **Results**: Five studies with 8,723 patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were identified. Clopidogrel was used in four cohorts, and ticagrelor was used in one cohort. Pooling results demonstrated that the addition of or a switch to another antiplatelet agent, as compared to aspirin monotherapy, was associated with reduced risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.85) and recurrent stroke (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.92). Each strategy of either adding or switching to another antiplatelet agent showed benefits over continued aspirin monotherapy. Studies with regimen initiation in the first days after the index event showed more homogeneous evidence of benefit.

In conclusion, among patients who experience an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack while on aspirin monotherapy, the addition of or switch to another antiplatelet agent appears beneficial.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke and high-risk TIA [^113zT3iC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The POINT study, conducted by Johnston SC and colleagues and published in 2018 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine, investigates the effects of combination antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA).

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.
- **Population**: The study included 4,881 patients (2,195 female, 2,686 male).
	- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.
	- **Exclusion criteria**: Thrombolytic therapy within 1 week before the event, candidates for thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, or endarterectomy, planned use of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, contraindications to aspirin or clopidogrel.

- **Interventions**:
	- N = 2,432 received dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel at a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1, followed by 75 mg per day, and aspirin at a dose of 50–325 mg per day).
	- N = 2,449 received aspirin alone (at a dose of 50–325 mg per day plus matched placebo).

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in major ischemic events at 90 days (5% vs. 6.5%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in ischemic stroke (4.6% vs. 6.3%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92).
	- Significant decrease in total ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (4.8% vs. 6.4%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.94).
	- No significant difference in ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death was observed between groups.

### Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack: Is more platelet inhibition the answer [^115CSEkX]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular events constitute an estimated 200,000 of the 700,000 strokes reported annually in the United States, which makes secondary stroke prevention an important goal in the management of disease among patients who have experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack.

- **Methods and results**: Various pharmacological approaches have been advocated, but the relative efficacy and safety of these regimens has remained the subject of much debate. The results of recent clinical trials on the use of antiplatelet therapy suggest that patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack may constitute a population distinct from patients with coronary or peripheral vascular disease. This distinction may be caused, in part, by the differing etiologies of stroke and the increased vulnerability of cerebral vessels to bleeding. Indeed, dual antiplatelet therapy, which has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions, does not confer secondary stroke protection. The emerging paradigm is that some level of platelet inhibition is required for secondary stroke protection — a level beyond which increased risk of bleeding arises.

- **Conclusions**: Because the vast majority of patients with ischemic stroke have stroke or transient ischemic attack, rather than myocardial infarction, as their next event, antiplatelet therapies for these patients should be administered according to what has been shown to be efficacious for secondary stroke protection, rather than for myocardial protection.

### Challenges of long-term dual antiplatelet therapy use following acute coronary syndromes [^1117Z6DN]. American Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event is associated with a high risk of reACS, stroke, and death. To ameliorate the risk of subsequent events, guidelines for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation ACS recommend long-term management strategies for secondary prevention including risk factor modification and anti-ischemic and antiplatelet therapies. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), comprising aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, is a critical component of secondary prevention therapy following ACS. However, despite the importance of DAPT for secondary prevention after ACS, questions remain regarding the optimal duration of therapy.

Clinical evidence is emerging that maintenance DAPT for more than 12 months lowers the risk of reACS events; however, this benefit must be considered against the potential risks of prolonged DAPT, such as bleeding. Several tools for bleeding risk assessment have shown promise; however, their limited accuracy and discriminative power necessitate further development. Assessment of patient ischemic risk should consider the complexity of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure, the anatomic burden of coronary artery disease, and additional underlying risk factors.

Consequently, identifying patients in whom the risk-benefit ratio favors prolonged DAPT may prove invaluable for clinicians. Deciding which patients should continue or stop taking DAPT at 12 months after PCI, or considering P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy as an option, is essential. This article reviews the most recent information about the risks and benefits of prolonged DAPT.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after minor strokes or high-risk TIA: Evidence from the Austrian stroke registry [^113x3iBy]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, representing a significant burden on healthcare systems. In recent years, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has emerged as a potential strategy to improve outcomes in patients with non-cardioembolic strokes or high-risk TIAs. DAPT typically includes the combination of aspirin with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor. In Austria, a standard DAPT regimen includes 100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 75 mg of clopidogrel, with a loading dose of 250–300 mg ASA and 300 mg clopidogrel for 21 days. Following the initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating a significant reduction in the recurrence of vascular events, short-term DAPT has been implemented as a secondary prevention strategy for non-cardioembolic strokes or high-risk TIAs for a duration of 3–4 weeks in clinical routine. Only a sub-study of the CHANCE trial reported significant benefits of DAPT on functional outcomes. However, data on the effects of DAPT on functional outcomes after ischemic stroke in a real-life setting are scarce.

The aim of the study was therefore to investigate the effects of DAPT on functional outcomes in patients with non-cardioembolic strokes or high-risk TIAs in a real-life setting.

### Aspirin versus clopidogrel monotherapy for the secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular attack following previous ischemic stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113SLg9u]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

This analysis showed that in patients with T2DM, aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy was equally effective and safe for the secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular attack following a previous ischemic stroke. There was no significant difference in stroke, fatal stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, and mortality when either aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy was used in these patients with T2DM.

The Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) randomized trial demonstrated that aspirin monotherapy in patients with T2DM could prevent serious vascular events. Among the 15,480 participants, serious vascular events occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared with the aspirin group. However, major bleeding was also observed with the use of aspirin in these patients compared with those who did not use antiplatelet medications.

Apart from clopidogrel, aspirin monotherapy has also been compared with other anticoagulants in patients with recurrent stroke. For example, in the Prevention of Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Events of Ischemic Origin with the TP Receptor Antagonist Terutroban in Patients with a History of Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (PERFORM) study, the baseline features of the population were described.

Ten-year survival data from the Athens Stroke Outcome Project showed clopidogrel monotherapy to be more favorable compared with aspirin monotherapy for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with T2DM. Among 197 participants with T2DM who were treated by aspirin and 107 participants who were…

### Dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel: Subanalysis of the CSPS.com trial [^116dVLPv]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the most basic treatment for the prevention of a secondary stroke in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The combination of antiplatelets with different mechanisms is expected to prevent the recurrence of ischemic stroke events more effectively than monotherapy. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel inhibits platelet function more than either of these agents alone, and several clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that the aspirin and clopidogrel combination reduces the recurrence of ischemic stroke slightly, while significantly increasing the frequency of bleeding events compared with aspirin or clopidogrel alone. The relevant guidelines therefore recommend avoiding the use of dual antiplatelet therapies (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel) for preventing secondary stroke events in patients who are in the chronic phase of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.

Cilostazol selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 3, and the results of the CSPS2 (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study 2) demonstrated that cilostazol treatment significantly reduces stroke recurrence with fewer bleeding events than aspirin. In light of the lower rate of bleeding events in patients treated with cilostazol, the addition of cilostazol to a regimen with another antiplatelet therapy has been expected to decrease the recurrence of stroke without increasing the bleeding risk. The trial (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study combination) showed that, compared with aspirin or clopidogrel alone, combination treatment with cilostazol reduced the recurrence of ischemic stroke.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^112cp98v]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Risk factor modification (secondary prevention)**: Classification of AIS subtype/etiology is based on the definitions used in the Multicenter Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment and includes the following categories: 1) large-artery atherosclerosis, 2) cardioembolism, 3) small-vessel occlusion, 4) stroke of other determined etiology, and 5) stroke of undetermined etiology (cryptogenic). A thorough workup consisting of vascular imaging, MRI, transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble assessment (for shunt evaluation), lipid panel, and hemoglobin A1C, among others, is required to determine the underlying etiology and tailor the appropriate secondary stroke prevention strategies.

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Antiplatelet therapy is an important cornerstone of treatment for the prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Aspirin is the most commonly used agent since it is relatively safe, cheap, and widely available. It reduces the risk of reoccurrence within the acute phase of 2–4 weeks post-AIS if administered within 48 hours of onset. A meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials concluded that aspirin reduces the risk of re-ischemic stroke by 22% and has the strongest effect in the early weeks after AIS. The P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel is another commonly used antiplatelet agent in AIS. The Clopidogrel with Aspirin in Acute Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (CHANCE) trial, a study with primary Asian ethnicity, demonstrated a reduction of 90-day stroke incidence after minor strokes (NIHSS < 4) or TIAs with the combination therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy).

### High on treatment platelet reactivity to aspirin and clopidogrel in ischemic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NfToV]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Emerging studies highlight high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) as a major hindrance to the secondary prevention of cardiovascular ischemic events. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the prevalence of HTPR in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and reveal a possible relation with a higher risk of cerebrovascular event recurrence.

Studies were selected if they reported absolute numbers or percentages of HTPR with ASA or clopidogrel in IS/TIA patients at any time point after the cerebrovascular event onset and assessed with any type of platelet function tests. We included 52 full-text studies with a total of 8,364 patients. Overall, the pooled prevalence of HTPR was 24% (95% CI: 20–27%).

- **Prevalence of HTPR**:
	- On ASA: 23% (95% CI: 20–28%)
	- On clopidogrel: 27% (95% CI: 22–32%)
	- On dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT): 7% (95% CI: 5–10%)

The overall analysis of all studies providing data on the risk of IS/TIA recurrence indicates that patients with HTPR had a significantly higher risk for IS/TIA recurrence (RR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.30–2.52; p < 0.001). In conclusion, the present study shows a significantly lower prevalence of HTPR in DAPT and an increased rate of cerebrovascular ischemic events in patients presenting HTPR.

### Ischaemic stroke despite antiplatelet therapy: Causes and outcomes [^112okrR1]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Ischaemic stroke may occur despite antiplatelet therapy (APT). We aimed to investigate the frequency, potential causes, and outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke despite APT.

- **Methods**: In this cohort study, we enrolled patients with imaging-confirmed ischaemic stroke from the Swiss Stroke Registry (01/2014–07/2022). We determined the frequency of prior APT, assessed stroke etiology (modified TOAST classification), and evaluated the association of prior APT with unfavourable functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score 3–6) and recurrent ischaemic stroke at 3 months using regression models.

- **Results**: Among 53,352 patients, 27,484 (51.5%) had no prior antithrombotic treatment, 17,760 (33.3%) were on APT, 7039 (13.2%) on anticoagulation, and 1069 (2.0%) were on APT plus anticoagulation. In patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or TIA (n = 11,948; 22.4%), 2401 (20.1%) had no prior antithrombotic therapy, 6594 (55.2%) were on APT, 2489 (20.8%) on anticoagulation, and 464 (3.9%) on APT plus anticoagulation.

	- Amongst patients with ischaemic stroke despite APT, etiology was large artery atherosclerosis in 19.8% (n = 3416), cardiac embolism in 23.6% (n = 4059), small vessel disease in 11.7% (n = 2011), other causes in 7.4% (n = 1267), more than one cause in 6.3% (n = 1078), and unknown cause in 31.3% (n = 5388). Prior APT was not independently associated with an unfavourable outcome (aOR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.98–1.14; p = 0.135) or death (aOR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.99–1.21; p = 0.059) at 3 months but was associated with increased odds of a recurrent stroke (6.0% vs 4.3%; aOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11–1.44; p < 0.001).

### Anticoagulants versus antiplatelet therapy for preventing stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111B1NL1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

People with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) who have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke are at risk of recurring stroke. Both warfarin and aspirin have been shown to reduce the recurrence of vascular events.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to compare the effect of anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents for secondary prevention in people with NRAF and previous cerebral ischemia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched 9 June 2003) and contacted trialists.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents in patients with NRAF and a previous TIA or minor ischemic stroke.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both reviewers extracted and analyzed data.

- **Main results**: Two trials were identified. The European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (EAFT) involved 455 patients who received either anticoagulants (International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2.5 to 4.0) or aspirin (300 mg/day). Patients joined the trial within three months of a transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. The mean follow-up was 2.3 years. In the Studio Italiano Fibrillazione Atriale (SIFA) trial, 916 patients with NRAF and a TIA or minor stroke within the previous 15 days were randomized to open-label anticoagulants (INR 2.0 to 3.5) or indobufen (a reversible platelet cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 100 or 200 mg BID). The follow-up period was one year. The combined results show that anticoagulants were significantly more effective than antiplatelet therapy both for all vascular events.

### Association of alternative anticoagulation strategies and outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke while taking a direct oral anticoagulant [^1131Hdyq]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) effectively prevent ischemic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Yet, ischemic stroke despite DOACs still occurred in 1%–2% of patients with AF in pivotal randomized controlled trials; up to 30% of patients with AF who developed ischemic stroke were on oral anticoagulants at stroke onset. Because the condition often precluded intravenous thrombolytic therapy and predicted a high risk of recurrence, it is critical to improve secondary stroke prevention for patients with ischemic stroke despite DOACs.

In practice, there are broadly three alternative antithrombotic regimens after ischemic stroke despite DOACs:

- **Switching between DOACs**: The options include apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban.
- **Switching to warfarin**: This was favored in certain regions.
- **Addition of antiplatelet agents**: Therapeutic options varied significantly across different regions.

For instance, while most German stroke neurologists favored switching between DOACs, in an Irish study, thrombotic events during DOAC usage commonly prompted switching to warfarin treatment. Nonetheless, in an epidemiologic study, adjustment of oral anticoagulant therapy collectively did not reduce subsequent ischemic stroke risk. Because ischemic stroke despite DOACs is increasingly common due to surging DOAC prescriptions, investigating the outcomes of patients on alternative antithrombotic regimens after an episode of ischemic stroke despite DOACs may inform treatment decisions.

In this population-based analysis, we compared the clinical outcomes of patients with NVAF with ischemic stroke.

### Prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke [^113h28nh]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack are common problems in primary care, with stroke survivors averaging 10 outpatient visits per year. Risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia should be evaluated during each office visit. Attention should be given to lifestyle modification, including management of obesity, smoking cessation, reduction in alcohol consumption, and promotion of physical activity.

The choice of an antiplatelet agent (e.g. aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, dipyridamole) or the anticoagulant warfarin is based on the safety, tolerability, effectiveness, and price of each agent. Aspirin is a common first choice for prevention of recurrent stroke, but the combination of dipyridamole and aspirin should be considered for many patients because of its superior effectiveness in two clinical trials. Clopidogrel is recommended for patients with aspirin intolerance or allergy, or for those who cannot tolerate dipyridamole. Warfarin and the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel should not be used in the prevention of ischemic stroke.

Carotid endarterectomy is appropriate for select patients; carotid stenting was recently shown to be less effective and less safe than endarterectomy.

### Multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents for preventing early recurrence after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^115NWiMF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antiplatelet agents are considered to be the cornerstone for secondary prevention of stroke, but the role of using multiple antiplatelet agents early after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) to improve outcomes has not been established.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of initiating, within 72 hours after an ischemic stroke or TIA, multiple antiplatelet agents versus fewer antiplatelet agents to prevent stroke recurrence. The analysis explores the evidence for different drug combinations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 6 July 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7 of 12, 2020) (last searched 6 July 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 to 6 July 2020), Embase (1980 to 6 July 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and reviews and used the Science Citation Index Cited Reference search for forward tracking of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents initiated within 72 hours after stroke or TIA.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data from eligible studies for the primary outcomes of stroke recurrence and vascular death, and secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction; composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; intracranial hemorrhage; extracranial hemorrhage.

### Efficacy of clopidogrel for prevention of stroke based on allele status in the POINT trial [^113q21ER]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug that is metabolized to its active form by the CYP2C19 enzyme. The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) found a significant interaction between loss-of-function allele status for the CYP2C19 gene and the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel on the rate of early restroke following acute transient ischemic attack/minor stroke. The POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke Trial), similar in design to CHANCE but performed largely in North America and Europe, demonstrated a reduction in early restroke with dual antiplatelet therapy compared with aspirin alone. This substudy was conducted to evaluate a potential interaction between loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and outcome by treatment group in POINT.

- **Methods**: Of the 269 sites in 10 countries that enrolled patients in POINT, 134 sites participated in this substudy. DNA samples were genotyped for CYP2C19 *2, *3, and *17 alleles and classified as carriers or noncarriers of loss-of-function alleles. Major ischemia consisted of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischemic vascular death.

- **Results**: Nine hundred thirty-two patients provided analyzable DNA. The rates of major ischemia were 6.7% for the aspirin group versus 2.3% for the dual antiplatelet therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.09–1.21]; P = 0.09) among carriers of the loss-of-function allele. The rates of major ischemia were 5.6% for the aspirin group versus 3.7% for the dual antiplatelet therapy group among noncarriers.

### Association of alternative anticoagulation strategies and outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke while taking a direct oral anticoagulant [^117AtQU6]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Ischemic stroke despite a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is increasingly common and portends a high risk of subsequent ischemic stroke. The efficacy and safety of antithrombotic regimens after the condition are unclear. We aimed to compare the outcomes of patients with ischemic stroke despite DOACs, with and without an alternative antithrombotic regimen, and determine the risk factors of recurrent ischemic stroke while on anticoagulation.

- **Methods**: In a population-based, propensity score–weighted, retrospective cohort study, we compared the clinical outcomes of DOAC-to-warfarin switch, DOAC-to-DOAC switch (DOAC switch), or addition of antiplatelet agents, with those of unchanged DOAC regimen (DOAC same) among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who developed the first ischemic stroke despite a DOAC from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, in Hong Kong. The primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke. Secondary outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage, acute coronary syndrome, and death. We performed competing risk regression analyses to compare the clinical endpoints and determined the predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke in an unweighted multivariable logistic regression model.

- **Results**: During the 6-year study period, among 45,946 patients with AF on a DOAC as stroke prophylaxis, 2,908 patients developed ischemic stroke despite a DOAC. A total of 2,337 patients with NVAF were included in the final analyses. Compared with DOAC same, warfarin (aHR 1.96, 95% CI 1.27–3.02, p = 0.002) and DOAC switch (aHR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25–2.11) were associated with different clinical outcomes.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111b34z9]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically concerning primary prevention and antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the addition of ticagrelor to aspirin in patients with established, stable coronary artery disease who have a low bleeding risk. This combined therapy can be extended beyond 12 months for up to 3 years to potentially reduce the rate of ischemic stroke.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111czY3V]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to primary prevention, antiplatelet therapy is addressed in the USPSTF 2022 guidelines. These guidelines recommend individualizing the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in adults aged 40–59 years who have a ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk. The recommendation is particularly pertinent for individuals not at increased risk for bleeding and those willing to take low-dose aspirin daily.

### Effects of clopidogrel added to aspirin in patients with recent lacunar stroke [^114MrDoE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The study, SPS3 Clopidogrel-ASA, was published by SPS Investigators and colleagues in 2012 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*. This study relates to acute ischemic stroke. The trial investigated the effect of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in patients with recent lacunar stroke.

The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 3,020 patients (1,118 female and 1,902 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by MRI. Key exclusion criteria included MRI evidence of a recent or remote cortical infarct, a large subcortical infarct greater than 1.5 cm in diameter, intracerebral hemorrhage, disabling stroke, previous intracerebral hemorrhage, or cortical ischemic stroke.

The interventions were:

- **Clopidogrel group (n = 1,517)**: 75 mg clopidogrel plus 325 mg aspirin daily.
- **Placebo group (n = 1,503)**: Placebo plus 325 mg aspirin daily.

The primary outcome showed no significant difference in the incidence of recurrent stroke at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (2.5% per year vs. 2.7% per year; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- **Increase in incidence of death from any cause**: 2.1% per year vs. 1.4% per year; HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.04.
	- **No significant difference in incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke**: 2% per year vs. 2.4% per year; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.09.

### Anticoagulants for preventing recurrence following presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^113VviwR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

After a first ischaemic stroke, further vascular events due to thromboembolism are common and often fatal. Anticoagulants could potentially reduce the risk of such events, but any benefits could be offset by an increased risk of fatal or disabling haemorrhages.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of prolonged anticoagulant therapy compared with placebo or open control following presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register in May 2008. In June 2008, we searched three online trial registers, used the Web of Science Cited Reference Search to identify new citations of previously included studies, contacted a pharmaceutical company, and also contacted authors for additional information on included trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing at least one month of anticoagulant therapy with control in people with previous, presumed non-cardioembolic, ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials involving 2487 participants were included. The quality of the nine trials which predated routine computerised tomography (CT) scanning and the use of the International Normalised Ratio to monitor anticoagulation was poor. There was no evidence of an effect of anticoagulant therapy on either the odds of death or dependency (two trials, odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval…

### Investigating real-world clopidogrel pharmacogenetics in stroke using a bioresource linked to electronic medical records [^112mUKxR]. Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the data about the clinical impact of clopidogrel pharmacogenetics is derived from patients with coronary artery disease in whom dual antiplatelet therapy, usually comprising aspirin and clopidogrel, has been the norm. However, clopidogrel monotherapy is recommended as first‐line therapy for secondary prevention for patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in the United Kingdom. Patients with ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel monotherapy may, therefore, be more susceptible to the impact of genetically determined clopidogrel poor metabolizer status. The American Heart Association guidelines for stroke from 2014 indicate the option for the use of clopidogrel and aspirin only during the first 21 days after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Very recently, a meta‐analysis of large studies from China, including clopidogrel‐treated patients with stroke or TIA, indicated increased risk of stroke and vascular endpoints for the carriers of CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function allele. However, few European studies have directly considered the impact of genetic variation on outcomes specifically in a stroke population treated with clopidogrel monotherapy, and thus genotype‐based dosing guidelines for coronary artery disease cannot be directly applied to patients who have a stroke.

Bioresources linked to electronic medical records (EMRs) are potentially powerful and flexible platforms for exploring the real‐world potential of genomics for patient stratification to improve the efficacy of drugs. However, models need to be developed to fully harness this potential.

### Beyond antithrombotics: Recent advances in pharmacological risk factor management for secondary stroke prevention [^111gSaks]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with ischemic stroke represent a diverse group with several cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, which classify them as patients at very high risk of stroke recurrence, cardiovascular adverse events, or death. In addition to antithrombotic therapy, which is important for secondary stroke prevention, cardiovascular risk factor assessment and treatment significantly reduce mortality and morbidity. Dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension are common and important modifiable cardiovascular risk factors among patients with stroke. Early recognition and treatment may have a significant impact on patients' future risk of major cardiovascular events.

In recent years, there have been numerous advancements in pharmacological agents aimed at secondary cardiovascular prevention. These innovations, combined with enhanced awareness and interventions targeting adherence and persistence to treatment, as well as lifestyle modifications, have the potential to substantially alleviate the burden of cardiovascular disease, particularly in patients who have experienced ischemic strokes. This review summarizes the evidence on the contemporary advances in pharmacological treatment and future perspectives on secondary stroke prevention beyond antithrombotic treatment.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for acute high risk transient ischaemic attack and minor ischaemic stroke: a clinical practice guideline [^114pzjup]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

What is the role of dual antiplatelet therapy following a high-risk transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke? Specifically, does dual antiplatelet therapy with a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel lead to a greater reduction in re-stroke and death compared to the use of aspirin alone when given in the first 24 hours following a high-risk transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke? An expert panel produced a strong recommendation for initiating dual antiplatelet therapy within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms and for continuing it for 10–21 days. Practice typically involves the use of a single drug.

### Association of timing for starting dual antiplatelet treatment with cilostazol and recurrent stroke: A CSPS.com trial post hoc analysis [^1153rzND]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment combining cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel showed a reduced risk of stroke recurrence compared to aspirin or clopidogrel alone after high-risk noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in a randomized trial. We aimed to determine whether the effect of dual medication, compared to monotherapy on the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke, differs according to the timing of initiating medication after stroke onset.

- **Methods**: In a subanalysis of the randomized controlled trial, patients between 8 and 180 days after stroke onset were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or clopidogrel alone, or a combination of cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel. They were divided into three groups based on the timing of starting trial treatment: between 8 and 14 days after stroke onset (8–14 days group), between 15 and 28 days after stroke onset (15–28 days group), and between 29 and 180 days after stroke onset (29–180 days group). The primary efficacy outcome was the first recurrence of ischemic stroke. Safety outcomes included severe or life-threatening bleeding.

- **Results**: Of 1,879 patients, 498 belonged to the 8–14 days group, 467 to the 15–28 days group, and 914 to the 29–180 days group. There was a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction for the recurrence of ischemic stroke between trial treatment and trichotomized groups. The recurrence of ischemic stroke was less common with dual therapy than with monotherapy in the 15–28 days group (annualized rate 1.5% vs 4.9%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio 0.34 [95% CI 0.12–0.95]).

### Comparative effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy in mild-to-moderate acute ischemic stroke according to the risk of recurrent stroke: An analysis of 15 000 patients from a nationwide, multicenter registry [^11696kCN]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

This study compared the effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel-aspirin to that of aspirin monotherapy (AM) in mild-to-moderate acute ischemic stroke, considering the risk of recurrent stroke using the Stroke Prognosis Instrument II (SPI-II) score.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective analysis of data from a nationwide, multicenter stroke registry database between January 2011 and July 2018. We included patients with mild-to-moderate (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤ 10), acute (within 24 hours of onset), noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was a 3-month composite of stroke (either hemorrhagic or ischemic), myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. Propensity scores using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method were employed to mitigate baseline imbalances between the DAPT and AM groups and within each subgroup considering SPI-II scores.

- **Results**: Among the 15,430 patients (age, 66 ± 13 years; men, 62.0%), 45.1% (n = 6960) received DAPT, and 54.9% (n = 8470) received AM. Primary outcome events were significantly more frequent in the AM group (16.7%) than in the DAPT group (15.5%; P = 0.03). Weighted Cox proportional hazards models indicated a reduced risk of 3-month primary vascular events in the DAPT group versus the AM group (hazard ratio, 0.84 [0.78–0.92]; P < 0.001).

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: A guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^115GgZv4]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute ischemic stroke, particularly concerning antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend initiating dual antiplatelet therapy — consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel — within 24 hours after symptom onset. This regimen should be continued for 21 days to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke for up to 90 days from symptom onset in patients presenting with minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 3) who have not received IV alteplase.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with hemorrhagic transformation, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initiation or continuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, depending on the specific clinical scenario and underlying indication in patients with AIS and hemorrhagic transformation.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy in transient ischemic attack and minor stroke with different infarction patterns: Subgroup analysis of the CHANCE randomized clinical trial [^116cTQNA]. JAMA Neurology (2018). High credibility.

Infarction patterns may serve as important imaging markers to assess the probability of stroke recurrence in transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke. However, it is unclear whether patients with different infarction patterns benefit differently from dual antiplatelet therapy.

The study aimed to investigate whether infarction patterns can stratify the risk of stroke recurrence and whether the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone are consistent in different infarction patterns after TIA or minor stroke.

In this prespecified imaging substudy of the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) randomized clinical trial, a total of 1,342 patients with noncardioembolic TIA or minor stroke at 45 sites of CHANCE from October 1, 2009, to July 30, 2012, were included in this substudy. The final analysis was conducted on July 30, 2016, and included 1,089 patients with required magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Infarction patterns were grouped into multiple acute infarctions (MAIs), single acute infarction (SAI), and no acute infarction (NAI) according to diffusion-weighted imaging.

Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were stroke recurrence and new clinical vascular events after 3 months, respectively. The safety outcome was moderate to severe bleeding risk after 3 months.

Among 1,089 patients, the mean (SD) age was 63.1 (10.7) years, and 731 patients (65%) were men. Patients with MAIs (hazard ratio [HR], 5.8; 95% CI, 2.

### Aspirin nonresponse in patients with arterial causes of ischemic stroke: Considerations in detection and management [^113fHjQm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at risk for recurrent ischemic events in the same or different vascular beds. Due to the central role of platelets in the spectrum of ischemic events across all vascular beds, antiplatelet therapy is a critical component of treatment. Among all antiplatelet therapies approved for the secondary prevention of stroke, aspirin is the most well-established and is recommended for all patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease. However, some patients do not respond to aspirin therapy and are termed "aspirin-resistant". This review discusses issues related to and possible solutions for decreased platelet response to aspirin in patients with arterial causes of ischemic stroke.

### Treatment effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 12 hours of acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111vrsx6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The primary endpoint event of efficacy for this subanalysis was a new symptomatic ischemic stroke event in the first 90 days. The symptomatic ischemic stroke events were divided into two types:

- **Re-ischemic stroke**:
	- (a) Sudden onset of a new focal neurologic deficit, with clinical or imaging evidence of infarction lasting ≥ 24 hours and not attributable to a nonischemic cause (e.g. not associated with brain infection, trauma, tumor, seizure, severe metabolic disease, or degenerative neurologic disease).
	- (b) A new focal neurologic deficit lasting 24 hours and not attributable to a nonischemic cause, accompanied by new ischemic changes from the initial infarct on baseline magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the brain. For example, initial mild hemiparesis (NIHSS 2) evolving to hemiplegia (NIHSS 6) was considered stroke progression rather than re-stroke unless imaging clearly demonstrated a distinct second event remote from the presenting event.

The secondary endpoint event of efficacy was a new clinical vascular event, which included ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.

### Antithrombotic therapy to prevent recurrent strokes in ischemic cerebrovascular disease: JACC scientific expert panel [^1152SP8K]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Stroke survivors carry a high risk of recurrence. Antithrombotic medications are paramount for secondary prevention and thus crucial to reduce the overall stroke burden. Appropriate antithrombotic agent selection should be based on the best understanding of the physiopathological mechanism that led to the initial ischemic injury. Antiplatelet therapy is preferred for lesions characterized by atherosclerosis and endothelial injury, whereas anticoagulant agents are favored for cardiogenic embolism and highly thrombophilic conditions. Large randomized controlled trials have provided new data to support recommendations for the evidence-based use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant agents after stroke.

In this review, the authors cover recent trials that have altered clinical practice, cite systematic reviews and meta-analyses, review evidence-based recommendations based on older landmark trials, and indicate where there are still evidence-gaps and new trials being conducted.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^113T7Tbj]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for transient ischemic attack, specifically in relation to antithrombotic therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke within 30 days. This is particularly advised for patients with a high-risk TIA, indicated by an ABCD² score of 6 or higher, and those with symptomatic intracranial or extracranial stenosis of 30% or more in an artery that could account for the event. It is important to recognize that this regimen may increase the risk of serious bleeding events, including intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Aspirin versus clopidogrel monotherapy for the secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular attack following previous ischemic stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ryQUW]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and stroke are two various diseases with many aspects in common, including dyslipidemia and hypertension. Due to factors such as platelet hyperactivity and occluded vascular arteries, patients with T2DM are at a higher risk for ischemic stroke. A recent prospective observational study including over 200 acute stroke patients in a city in Southern Iraq indicated that diabetes mellitus is associated with a heavier burden and worse outcomes for acute stroke compared with patients without diabetes. In the United States, recurrent stroke contributes to up to 25% of the annual 800,000 stroke cases. The rising rate of stroke in patients with T2DM has led to the development of non-invasive techniques, such as cerebrovascular intervention, for their management. Cerebrovascular ultrasonography is now being used to detect stroke and select patients for such intervention.

Aspirin is recommended as initial treatment for the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM. However, clopidogrel, an oral antiplatelet drug, might be an alternative choice for patients with aspirin intolerance.

This analysis aimed to systematically compare aspirin versus clopidogrel monotherapy for the secondary prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular attacks following previous ischemic stroke in patients with T2DM.

### Comparison of prasugrel and clopidogrel in patients with non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke: a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial (PRASTRO-I) [^112rht4G]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The effect of prasugrel in terms of the prevention of recurrence of ischaemic stroke is unknown. We investigated the non-inferiority of prasugrel to clopidogrel for prevention of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from other vascular causes in Japanese patients with non-cardioembolic stroke.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3 randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, patients aged 20–74 years who had had a non-cardioembolic stroke in the previous 1–26 weeks were recruited from 224 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) orally for 96–104 weeks. Randomisation was stratified according to stroke subtype. The randomisation schedule was generated by an independent statistician who created a computer-generated random number sequence. Patients, investigators, and the funder were masked to treatment allocation.

	- The primary endpoint was combined incidence of ischaemic stroke (fatal and non-fatal), myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal), and death from other vascular causes in the intention-to-treat population. The safety endpoint was incidence of bleeding events, comprising life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, and clinically relevant bleeding. The safety analysis was done in the population excluding trial patients with serious Good Clinical Practice violations, and those who had not taken the trial drug. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an upper 95% confidence interval limit for the risk ratio (RR) of 1.35.

### Optimal duration of aspirin plus clopidogrel after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1167MoYJ]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

The role of aspirin plus clopidogrel (A+C) therapy compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack remains uncertain. We conducted this study to determine the optimal period of efficacy and safety of A+C compared with aspirin monotherapy.

- **Methods**: Ten randomized controlled trials (15,434 patients) were selected using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) as of June 2018, comparing A+C with aspirin monotherapy in patients with transient ischemic attack or IS. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke (reIS), and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality. We stratified analysis based on short- (≤ 1 month), intermediate- (≤ 3 month), and long-term (> 3 month) A+C therapy. Effects were estimated as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: A+C significantly reduced the risk of reIS at short-term (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.78) and intermediate-term (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.90) durations. Similarly, major adverse cardiovascular events were significantly reduced by short-term (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60–0.78) and intermediate-term (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94) A+C therapy. However, long-term A+C did not yield beneficial effects in terms of reIS (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63–1.04) and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71–1.07).

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: Extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^113rYudL]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

After the final, extended follow-up of the only completed randomized clinical trial of antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage, no statistically significant increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage was found after restarting antiplatelet therapy. This finding provides physicians with some reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage, if indicated for secondary prevention of major vascular events.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138itBT]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Minor ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) put patients at risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including devastating major strokes. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that patients who experience minor ischaemic strokes or TIAs benefit from antiplatelet therapy. Consequently, guidelines for the management of acute ischaemic stroke and TIA recommend antiplatelet therapy — typically providing strong recommendations for use of a single agent, most commonly aspirin. One guideline provides a weak recommendation for clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, initiated within 24 hours of a patient presenting with minor stroke or TIA, and continuing for 21 days.

Several trials have tested the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone to prevent recurrent events in patients experiencing non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA in both the acute and chronic phases. The Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial reported that adding clopidogrel to aspirin starting within 24 hours of a minor stroke or TIA and continuing for 21 days reduced stroke risk without increasing the risk of moderate or severe haemorrhage at three and 12 months.

Despite findings from the CHANCE trial, many guidelines persisted in recommending single rather than dual agent clopidogrel and aspirin for the initial treatment of minor ischaemic stroke or TIA. Rationales provided by guideline authors for not recommending routine dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with this condition focused on the balance between efficacy and safety.

### Treatment effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 12 hours of acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack [^114ufMUu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to analyze the benefits and safety associated with the combination therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin among minor stroke or transient ischemic attack patients treated within 12 hours.

- **Methods and results**: This was a subanalysis of the CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) trial, mainly limited to the prespecified group of patients randomized within 12 hours to either the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke during 90-day follow-up. Re-ischemic stroke and progressive ischemic stroke were analyzed. Multivariable Cox modeling showed that randomization within 12 hours was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke events (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.25 [1.04–1.49], P = 0.02). Among 2573 patients randomized within 12 hours, 282 (10.96%) patients had ischemic stroke events. Among them, 158 (12.34%) of 1280 patients taking aspirin experienced ischemic stroke compared with 124 (9.59%) of 1293 patients taking clopidogrel-aspirin (P = 0.02). The dual antiplatelet was more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of re-ischemic stroke (6.57% versus 8.91%, P = 0.03) but not progressive ischemic stroke (3.02% versus 3.43%, P = 0.28). There was no significant difference in hemorrhagic events (P = 0.39).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients treated within 12 hours, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of re-ischemic stroke during the 90-day follow-up and did not increase the risk of hemorrhagic events.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly concerning patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulation therapy is addressed. The AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of anticoagulation 2–14 days after the index event. This recommendation aims to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke who are at low risk for hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, particularly in relation to antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend individualizing the selection of antiplatelet agents for early secondary prevention in patients with noncardioembolic AIS. This selection should be based on patient risk factor profiles, cost, tolerance, relative known efficacy of the agents, and other clinical characteristics.

### Association of alternative anticoagulation strategies and outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke while taking a direct oral anticoagulant [^114F3xbn]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Adjunctive antiplatelet therapy to DOAC did not seem to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Although recent studies showed the efficacy of aspirin in combination with rivaroxaban for cardiovascular protection in atherosclerotic diseases, our study suggested that this "dual pathway inhibition" strategy might not be similarly effective in a population purely consisting of patients with NVAF. Some studies even found a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with AF with dual antithrombotic therapy. However, these comparisons were confounded by the higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients who received dual antithrombotic therapy, when compared to our cohort, which had a low incidence of ischemic heart disease of less than 4% in both groups. Overall, our study did not find a clinical benefit of adjunctive antiplatelet therapy in patients with NVAF who developed ischemic stroke despite DOACs.

In the unweighted multivariable regression analysis, DM was associated with an increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. Although DM is a modifiable risk factor and predicted ischemic stroke in patients with AF, the mean glycated hemoglobin A1c levels were not significantly different among DOAC recipients with and without recurrent cerebral ischemia in our cohort. Another study also found that most patients with ischemic stroke despite DOACs had satisfactory glycemic control at stroke onset. Further longitudinal studies should determine whether stringent long-term glycemic control may lower the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke among DOAC recipients.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulation therapy is discussed. The AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support the addition of antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulants (OACs) for reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with a history of ischemic stroke, AF, and coronary artery disease. Initiating dual antiplatelet and oral anticoagulation therapy should be considered in patients with unstable angina and those requiring coronary artery stenting.

### Anticoagulants for preventing recurrence following presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^116B8cqs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

After a first ischaemic stroke, further vascular events due to thromboembolism, especially myocardial infarction and recurrent stroke, are common and often fatal. Anticoagulants could potentially reduce the risk of such events, but any benefits could be offset by an increased risk of fatal or disabling haemorrhages.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effect of prolonged anticoagulant therapy compared with placebo or open control, following presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register and contacted companies marketing anticoagulant agents. The most recent search for this review was carried out in August 2002.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing at least one month of anticoagulant therapy with control in people with previous presumed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials involving 2487 patients were included. The quality of the nine trials which predated routine computerised tomography scanning and the use of the International Normalised Ratio to monitor anticoagulation was poor. There was no evidence of an effect of anticoagulant therapy on either the odds of death or dependency (two trials, odds ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52 to 1.34) or of 'non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death'.

### Clopidogrel with aspirin in acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHANCE) trial: One-year outcomes [^113F5Uq6]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

The Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial demonstrated that combining clopidogrel and aspirin reduces the 90-day risk of stroke without increasing hemorrhage, compared to aspirin alone. However, it initially provided insufficient data to determine if this benefit persisted long-term. Here, we report the 1-year follow-up outcomes of the trial.

- **Methods and results**: The trial was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, conducted at 114 centers in China. We randomly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours of minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack onset to clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel on day 1, then 75 mg daily for 90 days, plus 75 mg of aspirin daily for the first 21 days) or to an aspirin-alone group (75 mg per day for 90 days). The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during a 1-year follow-up. Differences in outcomes were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Stroke was experienced by 275 (10.6%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, compared to 362 (14.0%) patients in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.93; P = 0.006). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in 7 (0.3%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and 9 (0.4%) patients in the aspirin group (P = 0.44).

- **Conclusions**: The early benefit of clopidogrel-aspirin treatment in reducing the risk of subsequent stroke persisted throughout the one-year follow-up period.

### Withdrawal of antithrombotic agents and its impact on ischemic stroke occurrence [^116JWKij]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic medications, including anticoagulants and antiplatelets, are often withheld during the periprocedural period and following bleeding complications to minimize the risk of new or recurrent bleeding. Additionally, patients may stop these medications for various reasons, such as cost, side effects, or unwillingness to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen.

Methods used in the study involved reviewing patient records from the population-based Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study to identify instances of ischemic stroke in 2005 and determine the temporal association of these strokes with the withdrawal of antithrombotic medication. Study nurses identified ischemic strokes and documented reasons for medication withdrawal for subsequent physician review.

Results indicated that in 2005, 2,197 cases of ischemic stroke were identified among residents of the region through hospital discharge records. Of these, 114 cases (5.2%) occurred within 60 days following the withdrawal of antithrombotic medication. Specifically, 61 cases (53.5%) followed the stoppage of warfarin, while the remainder followed the cessation of an antiplatelet medication. Among the strokes after medication withdrawal, 71 cases (62.3%) were first-ever strokes, and 43 cases (37.7%) were recurrent. Additionally, 54 cases (47.4%) occurred following a physician withdrew the medication in the periprocedural period.

The conclusions drawn indicate that the withdrawal of antiplatelet and antithrombotic medications in the 60 days preceding an acute ischemic stroke was associated with 5.2% of ischemic strokes in our study population. This underscores the importance of careful decision-making regarding antithrombotic medication use during the periprocedural period.

### Association of alternative anticoagulation strategies and outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke while taking a direct oral anticoagulant [^114gN39P]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Among 1,652 patients in the DOAC same group, 249 (15.1%) patients were started on antiplatelet agents within 8 weeks of the first ischemic stroke despite being on DOACs (see eTable 2 in the supplement), and 1,166 (70.6%) patients did not receive any antiplatelet therapy. Adjunctive antiplatelet treatment did not reduce the risk of re-ischemic stroke (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 0.88–1.84, p = 0.188), intracranial hemorrhage (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54–2.68, p = 0.654), ACS (aHR 1.71, 95% CI 0.80–3.66, p = 0.167), or death (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 0.84–1.41, p = 0.512).

- **Cumulative incidence**: Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative incidence of (A) ischemic stroke, (B) intracranial hemorrhage, (C) acute coronary syndrome, and (D) death in patients with ischemic stroke despite direct oral anticoagulant use, with or without newly added antiplatelet therapy.

After adjusting for covariates that were clinically relevant or reached a p-value of ≤ 0.25 in the univariate logistic regression analyses (see eTable 3 in the supplement), our multivariable logistic regression analysis within the DOAC same group revealed associations with re-ischemic stroke. Advanced age (aHR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.03, p = 0.029), a history of DM (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 0.73–1.20, p = 0.002), the use of CYP/P-gp modulators (aHR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05–1.84, p = 0.021), and LAD (aHR 2.84, 95% CI 1.16–6.91, p = 0.021) were all associated factors of re-ischemic stroke (see eTable 4). Schoenfeld residual tests suggested that these risk factors did not vary significantly with time (p = 0.131; see eFigure 1).

### Clinical reasoning: A 32-year-old woman with recurrent intracerebral hemorrhages [^111DmBAC]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Evaluating patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is common practice in the field of stroke neurology but can be complicated and may require extensive evaluation in younger patients with no history of hypertension. In this case, a healthy 32-year-old woman presented with an acute spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Neurologic workup required extensive imaging evaluation, genetic testing, and a thorough evaluation of patient and family medical history to identify the final diagnosis. This case highlights the diagnostic approach and importance of thorough clinical evaluation of young patients with intracerebral hemorrhages. Readers will walk through the stepwise diagnostic approach to arrive at the leading diagnosis with a review of the possible differential diagnoses and a discussion of this rare condition.

### Balancing benefits and risks of long-term antiplatelet therapy in noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke [^111CW7Sa]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Lifelong treatment with antiplatelet drugs is recommended following a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. Bleeding complications may offset the benefit of antiplatelet drugs in patients at increased risk of bleeding and low risk of reischemic events. We aimed to investigate the net benefit of antiplatelet treatment according to an individual's bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: We pooled individual patient data from six randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE [Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events], ESPS-2 [European Stroke Prevention Study-2], MATCH [Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients], CHARISMA [Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance], ESPRIT [European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial], and PRoFESS [Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes]) investigating antiplatelet therapy in the subacute or chronic phase after noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were stratified into quintiles according to their predicted risk of major bleeding with the S2TOP-BLEED score. The annual risk of major bleeding and reischemic events was assessed per quintile for four scenarios: (1) aspirin monotherapy, (2) aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, (3) aspirin-dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, and (4) aspirin versus clopidogrel. Net benefit was calculated for the second, third, and fourth scenario.

Thirty-seven thousand eighty-seven patients were included in the analysis.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Se7GF]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction

Two studies, including 9,690 patients, reported on myocardial infarction. Pooled analysis provided wide, essentially non-informative, confidence intervals (1.45, 0.62 to 3.38, I² = 0%, low quality evidence).

ReStroke (fatal and non-fatal)

Three studies, including 10,301 patients, reported all reStroke events (fatal or non-fatal). Pooled analysis showed that dual antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of all reStroke (0.71, 0.63 to 0.82, I² = 0%). The sensitivity analysis considering the missing data among these studies did not appreciably change the results in any case.

- **Effect by stroke subtypes**: Although the description of subtypes of stroke was not comprehensively detailed in all three studies, it is clear that each included a mix of small and large vessel disease. Furthermore, only the CHANCE study conducted a subgroup analysis addressing intracranial large vessel stenosis versus those without intracranial large vessel stenosis, which failed to suggest any difference in effect between the two. In the FASTER study, the authors documented the distribution of stroke type as cardioembolic (6.6%), lacunar (28.8%), large artery (24.0%), unknown (36.7%), and other (1.3%).

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^113EFB3o]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulation therapy should be initiated. According to the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines, oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

It is advised to initiate oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke regardless of the pattern of AF, including paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent forms.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel: Subanalysis of the CSPS.com trial [^117JJ6PQ]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Although dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces the recurrence of ischemic stroke while significantly increasing the bleeding events compared with monotherapy, the CSPS.com trial (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study combination) showed that DAPT using cilostazol was more effective without the bleeding risk. In the CSPS.com trial, aspirin or clopidogrel was used as the underlying antiplatelet drug, and the effectiveness and safety of each combination were examined and clarified.

In the CSPS.com trial, a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study, patients with high-risk, noncardioembolic ischemic stroke 8 to 180 days after onset treated with aspirin or clopidogrel alone at the discretion of the physician in charge were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy or DAPT using cilostazol and followed for 0.5 to 3.5 years. The primary efficacy outcome was the first recurrence of ischemic stroke, while the safety outcome was severe or life-threatening bleeding. The analysis focused on the underlying antiplatelet agents.

A total of 763 patients taking aspirin and 1116 taking clopidogrel were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Although the clopidogrel group had more risk factors than the aspirin group, the primary efficacy outcome and safety outcome did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the aspirin group, the primary efficacy outcome and safety outcome did not differ significantly between the DAPT group and the aspirin-monotherapy group.
