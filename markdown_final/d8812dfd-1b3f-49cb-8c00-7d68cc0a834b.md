## Question

expound upon 17q12 deletion syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about 17q12 deletion syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic basis and nomenclature. Then, I should review epidemiology and inheritance patterns. Next, I will characterize the renal phenotype and electrolyte/functional kidney issues. After that, I will detail endocrine manifestations, especially MODY5. I will then analyze neurodevelopmental and psychiatric features, with careful attention to evidence strength. I should also consider prenatal diagnostic triggers and counseling implications. Finally, I will integrate differential points with the reciprocal duplication and highlight management and counseling considerations with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the genetic lesion and terminology. 17q12 deletion syndrome is a recurrent 1.3–1.4 Mb microdeletion on 17q12 mediated by low-copy repeats and non-allelic homologous recombination; it encompasses HNF1B and roughly 15 neighboring genes, making it a true contiguous gene syndrome rather than a single-gene disorder, and is also described under RCAD (renal cysts and diabetes) or MODY5-associated deletion when HNF1B features dominate [^1123QRot] [^114nwXhZ] [^112VosEL]. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism again: the recurrent nature and breakpoint architecture consistent with NAHR are well-supported across cohorts and align with the contiguous gene model rather than isolated HNF1B variants alone [^1123QRot].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and inheritance. The disorder is ultra-rare, with a worldwide prevalence estimate around 0.00147 per 100,000 population in Orphanet 2024, though I need to acknowledge that ascertainment and diagnostic technology can influence these figures substantially [^116ZyDvV]. About half of whole-gene HNF1B deletions arise de novo, so absence of family history does not exclude the diagnosis; inherited cases occur as well, consistent with autosomal dominant transmission of the CNV when present in a parent [^114nwXhZ]. But wait, I should consider parental mosaicism and its counseling implications; while specific data for 17q12 mosaicism are limited, parental somatic or germline mosaicism has been documented with other recurrent CNVs like 16p11.2 and can lead to apparent de novo presentations, so parental testing with sensitive methods remains prudent [^116K1CfX].

> I will now examine the renal phenotype, which is often the most penetrant feature. Let me think about the prenatal picture first: hyperechogenic kidneys, sometimes enlarged and cystic, are frequently detected from around 15 weeks, with both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios reported, and literature reviews suggest prenatal renal anomalies in the majority of reported 17q12 deletion fetuses [^115ZgPFz]. Postnatally, structural findings span cystic dysplasia, hypoplasia, horseshoe or duplex kidneys, collecting system abnormalities, and hydronephrosis, supporting the spectrum of developmental kidney disease tied to HNF1B haploinsufficiency within the 17q12 interval [^114nwXhZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing renal function and electrolytes. I need to ensure I capture the characteristic tubular defects: hypomagnesemia, often refractory and driven by impaired distal tubular transport regulation, hyperuricemia, and broader renal tubular dysfunction can occur, and chronic kidney disease may progress to end-stage disease in some patients, warranting longitudinal nephrology follow-up and electrolyte monitoring [^114nwXhZ] [^1122DMYG] [^112K8kSM]. I should double-check the mechanistic link for magnesium wasting; HNF1B's role in regulating ion transport genes is consistent with the observed hypomagnesemia phenotype across case series and reports [^1122DMYG].

> Now, endocrine manifestations. Let me verify MODY5 features carefully. HNF1B haploinsufficiency causes MODY5, a minority of overall MODY but a characteristic component of the 17q12 deletion syndrome, with presentations that include early-onset diabetes, pancreatic hypoplasia, and occasionally abnormal liver function tests; importantly, a substantial fraction of clinically ascertained MODY5 patients harbor complete HNF1B deletions within the 17q12 microdeletion context, not just intragenic variants [^112VosEL] [^114nwXhZ] [^113vi8hG]. I should confirm additional endocrine and hepatopancreatic details: pancreatic hypoplasia driving insulin deficiency and cholestatic or transaminase elevations have been reported, supporting systematic metabolic and hepatic surveillance in affected individuals [^114nwXhZ] [^113vi8hG].

> I need to examine neurodevelopmental and psychiatric risks with precision. The high-impact AJHG study demonstrates that the 17q12 deletion confers a markedly increased risk for autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia relative to controls, consistent with a dosage-sensitive gene or genes within the deleted interval affecting brain development and function [^1123QRot]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought verbal IQ around 74 and non-verbal IQ around 83 with over 80% psychiatric disorders applied here, but let me verify that cohort; those IQ and psychiatric figures are from 16p11.2 deletion carriers, not 17q12, so I should not extrapolate them to 17q12 without direct evidence, and I will correct that here to avoid overreach while maintaining that increased ASD and schizophrenia risk is well supported for 17q12 deletions [^113nzjDd] [^1123QRot]. I should confirm ancillary neuro features like macrocephaly being noted in some 17q12 deletion cases in the AJHG study, while acknowledging variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance across cohorts [^1123QRot].

> Next, I should review prenatal diagnostic implications and counseling. Prenatally detected hyperechogenic kidneys, even when normal-sized, should prompt consideration of microarray testing for 17q12 deletion given the strong association reported, and follow-up studies have shown a notable correlation between such prenatal findings and later neurodevelopmental diagnoses including ASD, which supports early counseling and developmental surveillance planning after birth [^116PoZCX] [^115ZgPFz]. Wait, let me verify the timing and frequency; abnormalities are often detectable from mid-second trimester, and pooled series suggest renal anomalies in most prenatally ascertained 17q12 deletion fetuses, although prenatal severity does not necessarily predict postnatal renal outcomes on a one-to-one basis, which is important for counseling uncertainty [^115ZgPFz].

> I should confirm differential points with the reciprocal 17q12 duplication to avoid conflation. The microduplication often shows broader phenotypic variability with developmental delays, behavioral problems, and renal anomalies, but unlike the deletion, it does not show a consistent association with diabetes in population cohorts; conversely, the deletion more strongly links to developmental kidney disease and MODY5, reinforcing that deletion and duplication have overlapping yet distinct risks that should be conveyed during counseling [^1172WMdT]. Hold on, I should ensure the renal signal in duplication is not overstated; recent population data specifically strengthened the renal association with duplication while clarifying the lack of diabetes enrichment compared to deletion, refining expectations for the reciprocal CNV [^1172WMdT].

> Let me consider atypical or extended phenotypes and self-check for overclaims. Case-level data suggest possible vascular calcification in some adults with 17q12 deletion in the context of hypomagnesemia and hyperparathyroidism, which may expand the phenotype but requires cautious interpretation and replication; this should not be treated as a defining feature, yet it supports cardiovascular risk assessment in those with significant mineral metabolism disturbances [^1122DMYG] [^115qemSs]. I should confirm that isolated case reports and small series can generate hypotheses but should not drive universal screening protocols without stronger evidence, though maintaining a low threshold for CV risk factor management is reasonable in the presence of CKD or persistent electrolyte derangements [^1122DMYG].

> I need to ensure testing strategies and counseling are explicit. Chromosomal microarray detects the classic 1.3–1.4 Mb 17q12 deletion, and exome-based copy number calling can identify it as a secondary finding; when a fetal finding suggests the diagnosis but prenatal imaging is unremarkable, parental carrier status may still be informative for family risk, and postnatal surveillance can be tailored to the multisystem risks if the deletion is confirmed [^1177m3sX] [^115ZgPFz]. Hold on, I should verify recurrence risk counseling: de novo events predominate among whole-gene deletions but inherited cases occur, so parental testing is essential, and given the broader CNV literature documenting parental mosaicism in other recurrent CNVs, using sensitive methods and not assuming true de novo status without testing remains best practice [^114nwXhZ] [^116K1CfX].

> Finally, I should synthesize core clinical management implications without overstating guidance. Multidisciplinary follow-up is warranted, with nephrology for structural and functional renal disease and electrolytes, endocrinology for MODY5 evaluation and pancreatic or hepatic issues, and developmental-behavioral pediatrics or psychiatry for neurodevelopmental surveillance given elevated risks for ASD and schizophrenia; prenatal teams should flag hyperechogenic kidneys as an indication for microarray and early counseling, while postnatal teams should anticipate variable expressivity and tailor monitoring to the individual phenotype and family context [^114nwXhZ] [^1123QRot] [^115ZgPFz]. I should confirm that ongoing reassessment is needed because penetrance is incomplete and phenotype evolves over time, making periodic review and adaptive care plans essential in this contiguous gene syndrome [^1123QRot].

17q12 deletion syndrome is a recurrent ~1.4 Mb microdeletion at 17q12 [^1123QRot], most often de novo [^114nwXhZ], with an estimated prevalence of 0.00147 per 100,000 [^116ZyDvV]. Hallmarks include **renal anomalies** (cysts, dysplasia, hypoplasia, agenesis) and **MODY5** [^112VosEL] due to HNF1B haploinsufficiency, often accompanied by hypomagnesemia and pancreatic hypoplasia [^114nwXhZ]. Neurodevelopmental features include intellectual disability, autism, and **increased schizophrenia risk** [^1123QRot], with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance [^1172WMdT]. Diagnosis is established by chromosomal microarray [^115ZgPFz] or MLPA, and management is multidisciplinary with renal, endocrine, and neurodevelopmental surveillance; **genetic counseling is essential** given autosomal dominant inheritance [^1123QRot] and a ~50% de novo rate [^114nwXhZ].

---

## Genetic basis and molecular mechanisms

- **Genomic region**: The typical deletion spans ~1.4 Mb at 17q12, encompassing ~15 genes, including HNF1B and LHX1 [^1123QRot] [^1172WMdT].

- **HNF1B**: A transcription factor critical for kidney, pancreas, liver, and genital tract development; haploinsufficiency underlies renal anomalies, MODY5 [^112VosEL], and hypomagnesemia [^114nwXhZ].

- **LHX1**: A LIM homeobox gene implicated in neurodevelopmental and structural brain anomalies [^1123QRot].

- **Mechanism**: Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between flanking low-copy repeats drives recurrent deletions [^1123QRot].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### Renal and urinary tract anomalies

Renal and urinary tract anomalies are the **most consistent feature**, occurring in ~80–85% of patients [^111KvtEH]. Reported malformations include multicystic dysplastic kidneys, renal hypoplasia, agenesis, horseshoe kidney, duplex kidneys, hydronephrosis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy [^114nwXhZ]. Electrolyte abnormalities are common, notably hypomagnesemia and hyperuricemia [^114nwXhZ]. Progressive renal insufficiency or chronic kidney disease is frequent [^114nwXhZ].

---

### Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities

Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities include early-onset diabetes mellitus (**MODY5**) [^112VosEL] due to HNF1B haploinsufficiency. Pancreatic hypoplasia contributes to exocrine insufficiency and diabetes [^114nwXhZ], and hyperparathyroidism is reported in some patients [^1122DMYG].

---

### Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders

Neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders span mild to moderate intellectual disability and commonly include **autism spectrum disorder** [^1123QRot]. There is also an increased risk of schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions.

---

### Other clinical features

Other clinical features include **genital tract malformations** such as Müllerian anomalies, uterine aplasia, and vaginal atresia [^114nwXhZ]. Reported liver abnormalities include elevated liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, and steatohepatitis [^114nwXhZ]. Cardiovascular anomalies are rare but include vascular calcifications and coronary artery disease [^115qemSs].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA)**: First-line test for detecting 17q12 deletions [^114DBreX].

- **Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)**: Confirms deletions and defines breakpoints [^1123QRot].

- **Prenatal diagnosis**: Recommended when fetal renal anomalies (e.g. hyperechogenic kidneys) are detected on ultrasound [^116PoZCX] [^115ZgPFz].

---

## Inheritance patterns and recurrence risk

Inheritance is **autosomal dominant**; ~50% de novo [^114nwXhZ], ~50% inherited [^1123QRot]. Recurrence risk is **50% if a parent carries the deletion** and low when the deletion is de novo.

---

## Management and treatment strategies

Management is **multidisciplinary and individualized** [^114nwXhZ]:

- **Renal management**: Regular monitoring of renal function, blood pressure, and electrolytes; dialysis or transplantation as needed.

- **Endocrine management**: Insulin for diabetes [^112VosEL]; magnesium supplementation for hypomagnesemia.

- **Neurodevelopmental management**: Early intervention, special education, and behavioral therapies [^1123QRot].

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for families to discuss inheritance, recurrence, and reproductive options [^1123QRot].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Prognosis is variable and depends on **renal disease severity**, diabetes control, and neurodevelopmental involvement [^1123QRot]. Quality of life can be significantly impacted; multidisciplinary care and **early intervention** improve outcomes [^116PoZCX].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions focus on clarifying **genotype-phenotype correlations** to explain variability and expressivity [^1123QRot]. Efforts include exploring targeted therapies for HNF1B-related diabetes and renal disease and conducting longitudinal studies to define natural history and guide surveillance [^1172WMdT].

---

17q12 deletion syndrome is a recurrent microdeletion with variable expressivity, characterized by renal anomalies, MODY5, and neurodevelopmental disorders [^1123QRot]. Diagnosis relies on CMA or MLPA [^114DBreX], and care is **multidisciplinary**; **genetic counseling is critical** due to autosomal dominant inheritance and frequent de novo events [^114nwXhZ].

### Chromosome 17q12 microdeletions but not intragenic HNF1B mutations link developmental kidney disease and psychiatric disorder [^114nwXhZ]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1B) are the most common known monogenic cause of developmental kidney disease. The phenotype of HNF1B-associated renal disease is highly variable despite this single genetic etiology. Abnormalities are often detected on prenatal ultrasonography, where bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys with normal or slightly increased size are commonly found.

Cystic disease, including cystic dysplasia, is usually seen in both pediatric and adult populations. Other developmental kidney diseases have been reported, including single kidneys, hypoplasia, horseshoe kidneys, duplex kidneys, collecting system abnormalities, bilateral hydronephrosis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy. Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypomagnesemia and hyperuricemia, are common.

HNF1B-associated disease is a multisystem disorder. Extrarenal phenotypic features include early onset diabetes mellitus, pancreatic hypoplasia, genital tract malformations, and abnormal liver function tests. Genetic changes in the HNF1B gene comprise either whole-gene deletions (approximately half of patients) or intragenic mutations (base substitutions or small insertions/deletions within the HNF1B gene). Both may arise spontaneously, with 50% of whole-gene deletions occurring de novo. This means there is often no family history of renal disease or diabetes.

The majority of patients with a whole-gene deletion have an approximate 1.3 Mb deletion at chromosome 17q12, which includes the entire HNF1B gene.

### Deletion 17q12 is a recurrent copy number variant that confers high risk of autism and schizophrenia [^1123QRot]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2010). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental disorders for which recent evidence indicates an important etiologic role for rare copy number variants (CNVs) and suggests common genetic mechanisms. We performed cytogenomic array analysis in a discovery sample of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders referred for clinical testing. We detected a recurrent 1.4 Mb deletion at 17q12, which harbors HNF1B, the gene responsible for renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD), in 18/15,749 patients, including several with ASD, but 0/4,519 controls.

We identified additional shared phenotypic features among nine patients available for clinical assessment, including macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, renal anomalies, and neurocognitive impairments. In a large follow-up sample, the same deletion was identified in 2/1,182 ASD/neurocognitive impairment and in 4/6,340 schizophrenia patients, but in 0/47,929 controls (corrected p = 7.37 × 10⁻⁵). These data demonstrate that deletion 17q12 is a recurrent, pathogenic CNV that confers a very high risk for ASD and schizophrenia and show that one or more of the 15 genes in the deleted interval is dosage sensitive and essential for normal brain development and function. In addition, the phenotypic features of patients with this CNV are consistent with a contiguous gene syndrome that extends beyond RCAD, which is caused by HNF1B mutations only.

### 17q12 deletion syndrome as a rare cause for diabetes mellitus type MODY5 [^112VosEL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5) is caused by mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox β gene (HNF1B). Although clinical characteristics and therapeutic management of MODY5 are increasingly better defined, adequate consideration of the frequent association of MODY5 with 17q12 deletion syndrome is often missing.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We report two cases of patients with 17q12 deletion syndrome who presented to our clinic. Furthermore, we reviewed the existing literature to improve systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. A PubMed search using the terms 17q12 deletion syndrome, diabetes mellitus type MODY5, and/or HNF1B was performed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Three hundred sixty-one cases of postnatal 17q12 deletion syndrome were assessed, and details on clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic management were reviewed and compared with the two cases at our clinic. Furthermore, data on pathogenic mechanisms and their clinical implications were evaluated.

- **Conclusion**: The 17q12 deletion syndrome usually comprises MODY5, structural or functional abnormalities of the kidneys, and neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders. A complete deletion of HNF1B can be found in about 50% of patients with MODY5. A wide variety of additional clinical features, including genital and brain malformations, has been reported. Because HNF1B deletions are virtually always part of a 17q12 deletion syndrome, and common genetic analyses for evaluation of MODY5 are unable to detect the deletion of a 1.4-Mb chromosomal region, in-depth assessment is necessary.

### The phenotypic variability of 16p11.2 distal BP2-BP3 deletion in a transgenerational family and in neurodevelopmentally ascertained samples [^116ZEaVR]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Low credibility.

Also of interest is the pattern of other vulnerabilities. For example, although the proband had relative deficits in non-verbal IQ, all other family members had a fairly 'flat' intellectual profile in the average range. No other genetic abnormalities were identified that would offer an explanation for the proband's non-verbal deficits, and so we believe it is most likely related to the 16p11.2 distal deletion. It would appear, therefore, that this may be a more variable aspect of phenotype, given that more family members had ASD/BAP than low IQ. Moreover, given the fact that the middle sibling (-004) had research-diagnosed ASD in association with normal IQ, it seems reasonable to conclude, for this family at least, that ASD is not simply an epiphenomenon and secondary to impaired intellectual function. Similarly, comorbidity for externalizing behavior was seen in the middle sibling but not the proband, again indicating that this is not simply the result of either impaired intellectual function or ASD. It is also important to note that the third-born child (-005) received intensive behavioral intervention from toddlerhood, specifically in the form of an assistant in the classroom and help with school-related tasks at home. This stands in contrast to his older siblings. We postulate that this vigilance, at least with respect to ASD, may have contributed to improved developmental trajectory.

Our curation of data from the genome diagnostics lab at SickKids indicates that neurodevelopmental phenotypes are common in the presence of the 16p11.2 deletion.

### Refinement of the Smith-Magenis syndrome critical region to approximately 950kb and assessment of 17p11.2 deletions. Are all deletions created equally [^112QWdFQ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome associated with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 17p11.2. SMS is thought to be a contiguous gene syndrome caused by the haploinsufficiency of one or more genes in the associated deletion region. At the time of writing, no gene has been reported to contribute to the characteristics seen in the SMS phenotype. To expedite the search for the SMS causative genes, we have reduced the SMS critical region to approximately 950kb by analyzing 11 patient samples carrying 17p11.2 deletions. In addition, we have re-evaluated the frequency with which different 17p11.2 deletions naturally occur, showing evidence that homologous recombination likely takes place between low copy repeats at a higher frequency than previously reported.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^112zrwjf]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

Our findings of high percentages of developmental delay (DD) in all subgroups, and a more frequently reported delayed speech development in cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletions, were similar to previous reports. Cases with more severe learning difficulties are most likely to undergo an IQ test, and some cases were too young for an IQ test.

Of the cases with a 16p11.2 copy number variation (CNV) and available full-scale IQ (FSIQ) data, intellectual disability (ID) was reported in 28.6%, and borderline intellectual functioning in 62.5%, similar to previously reported large (N ≥ 100 cases) studies. In our cohort, 18.2% of cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion were diagnosed with ID, similar to the reported 20–30% of cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion in previous large studies. Of cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion in our cohort, 40% were diagnosed with ID, yet FSIQ information was not available for approximately half of the cases.

Information about the prevalence of ID in cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletions is not available in the literature; however, the Simons Searchlight registry reports a combined prevalence of DD or ID in 52% of cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion. A formal diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was made in 19.4% of cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion in our cohort, compared to 11–45% of cases in different large cohorts. Another 35.5% of cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion in our cohort had signs of ASD without a formal ASD diagnosis. Cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplications in our cohort had a higher prevalence of DD (60%) and ID (57.1%) than reported in larger cohorts in literature.

### The pleiotropic spectrum of proximal 16p11.2 CNVs [^1171QLaB]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2024). High credibility.

The 16p11.2 BP4–5 rearrangement represents one of the most common etiologies of genomic disorders, leading to a broad and variable spectrum of phenotypes that extends far beyond neurodevelopmental disorders. Poor awareness of the syndrome and heterogeneous phenotypes that require personalized solutions have been described as challenges to parents of children affected by 16p11.2 BP4–5 CNVs in accessing adequate and continued support. To ensure equity in diagnosis and provide personalized treatment plans, physicians must be aware of the different clinical presentations of these CNVs and assemble multidisciplinary teams of specialists who can anticipate and manage the different associated comorbidities.

This task is complicated by our lack of understanding of the specific genetic and environmental factors that contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity. Yet, surveys of both parents of pediatric 16p11.2 BP4–5 deletion carrier individuals and adults with incidental findings of a 16p11.2 BP4–5 CNV, as a consequence of their participation in a biobank, reported that overall, they felt empowered and positively valued the diagnosis. In this review, we emphasize how integrating results from diverse data sources in terms of ascertainment, demographics, and ancestry, as well as analytical approaches and experimental settings, can help fill knowledge gaps and deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying variability in expressivity and penetrance. We hope this will guide the development of personalized prevention and treatment strategies.

### Further clinical and molecular delineation of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome [^112fezuS]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

We obtained clinical information for all 15 patients to assess possible genotype–phenotype correlations. Patients were grouped according to deletion size and location. Features in patients whose deletion includes the proposed critical region between breakpoints B–C (patients 2–12) are discussed first. We then consider patients whose deletion includes only the region between breakpoints C–D (patients 13 and 14). Finally, clinical features in patient 1, whose deletion involves only the proximal 300 kb of the B–C region, are considered. Patient 15 is omitted from further discussion, as the inheritance and clinical significance of the deletion are unknown.

- **Clinical features of patients with deletions of 15q24**: Photographs and hand radiographs of patient 1 (A) show pronounced shortening of the fourth metacarpals. Photographs of patient 4 (B), patient 6 at 9 months and 2 years (C), patient 7 at 13 months and 6 years (D), and patients 9 (E), 10 (F), 12 (G), and 14 (H) are also included.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^116K1CfX]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

In clinical genetic practice, 5–7% of cases with intellectual disability (ID) or congenital malformations are diagnosed with two different Mendelian disorders. Dual diagnoses have also been described for 16p11.2 deletion syndrome. Trained clinicians will have to decide whether more extensive genetic testing, following a molecular 16p11.2 deletion or duplication diagnosis, is recommended. In our cohort, additional genetic testing was performed in the majority of cases. Dual diagnoses identified in our cohort should encourage close attention to whether an individual's phenotype is fully explained by the 16p11.2 CNV.

For example, one case with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion had a short stature (height SDS –2.9) and a congenital heart defect, both cardinal features of Noonan syndrome. We indeed confirmed this second diagnosis. As this second diagnosis could affect our results and conclusions, we excluded this particular case from our subgroup analyses. Clinical overlap of two syndromes makes it harder to realize that these cases could have a dual diagnosis. We recommend consultation with a clinical geneticist in cases of severe or previously unreported symptoms.

Importantly, we mentioned one case with an apparent de novo typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion when tested using array-CGH. The patient's mother eventually carried the same typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion in mosaic form when reanalyzed with SNP array nine years later. Even though this is a rare finding, it can be relevant for siblings of cases with an apparent de novo deletion who were analyzed with previous genetic techniques.

### Six at sixty. 'Have you tested for 22q?' [^114bJVYj]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

In 1997, the Journal of Medical Genetics published our paper on the spectrum of clinical features associated with interstitial chromosome 22q11 deletions. This copy number variation is associated with an extraordinary range of clinical features, which led initially to its association with several diagnostic labels. Since 1997, work on clinical and basic science aspects of the syndrome and the genes reduced to hemizygosity has provided a wealth of information pertaining to both best practice care and underlying biology. It is recognized that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is an excellent model for probing mechanisms underlying psychiatric disease, cardiovascular development, and much more.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^113ctPaB]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, we present the clinical manifestations of our Dutch cohort of 100 cases with different pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs, emphasizing the phenotype's complexity and variability. We stress the importance of a personalized and multidisciplinary approach for all cases, focusing on cognitive, psychiatric, and growth parameters evaluation and treatment. Additional genetic diagnostics can be considered by trained clinicians to explain uncommon features. Polygenic and epigenetic assessments will further predict clinical variability and aid in personalized treatment in the future.

### Phenotypic heterogeneity of 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome: 5 case reports [^113k9yLa]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by wide clinical heterogeneity. Individuals may present with a normal phenotype or neurodevelopmental pathology, often associated with nonspecific dysmorphology, epilepsy, cardiac anomalies, and obesity, among other characteristics.

- **Clinical cases**:
	- **Case 1**: Male, 11-year-old, with macrocephaly from 4 months, obesity from 2 years, and speech delay; currently diagnosed with intellectual developmental disorder.
	- **Case 2**: Female, 13-year-old, referred at 4 years due to language delay; at 6 years, early puberty and obesity were identified; currently recognized as having intellectual developmental disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
	- **Case 3**: Male, 5-year-old, referred at 3 years for global developmental delay, mainly in language; family history of intellectual developmental disorder; currently has global developmental delay.
	- **Case 4**: Male, 6-year-old, referred at 11 months for motor delay; at 18 months, language delay, motor coordination difficulties, and aggressiveness were noted; recently, he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
	- **Case 5**: Male, 14-year-old, with macrocephaly and expressive language delay at 2 years; oppositional behavior and ADHD diagnosed, with learning disabilities and overweight. None of the cases have epilepsy or cardiac pathology. All showed 16p11.2 microdeletion in array-CGH studies and received multidisciplinary follow-up.

- **Discussion/conclusion**: 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome shows significant clinical variability, with common neurodevelopmental involvement.

A critical aspect of human genetics and genomics is linking genotype to phenotype. In some diseases, it is clear what gene is underlying the main phenotype (e.g. CFTR [MIM:] in cystic fibrosis [MIM:]), while in other cases, it is not clear. Large, often complex structural variants present a challenge because they can be recurrent with the same breakpoints in all or most individuals (e.g. 22q11.2 [MIM:], 16p11.2 [MIM:], 7q11.23 Williams syndrome region [MIM:]), or they can show heterogeneity in breakpoints. Further, one gene can underlie the majority of the phenotype (e.g. RAI1 [MIM:] in Smith-Magenis syndrome [MIM:]), or several genes can contribute to various phenotypes.

9p deletion and duplication syndromes are particularly challenging because there is heterogeneity in breakpoint locations, they typically encompass several genes, and they have variable phenotypes.

### 16p13.11 microdeletion/microduplication in fetuses: Investigation of associated ultrasound phenotypes, genetic anomalies, and pregnancy outcome follow-up [^114CG6pw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Region 16p13.11 is a dose-sensitive region whose microdeletions or microduplications can lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes. 16p13.11 microdeletions are well defined in clinical practice. However, 16p13.11 microduplication is a newly discovered syndrome whose molecular mechanism, candidate genes, and pathogenesis remain unclear. In this study, CNV analysis was performed on over 9,000 fetuses undergoing prenatal diagnosis using SNP-array. It was found that 20 fetuses had CNV changes in the 16p13.11 region, including 5 cases with 16p13.11 microdeletion and 15 cases with 16p13.11 microduplication.

It has been reported that the size of the 16p13.11 microdeletion region ranges from 0.8 to 3.3 Mb. In this study, there were 5 cases of 16p13.11 microdeletion involving fragments of approximately 0.12 Mb to 1.8 Mb in size. The region of the 16p13.11 microdeletion was mostly within the range reported in earlier studies, except for one case where it was only 0.12 Mb.

A large number of clinical studies have shown that 16p13.11 microdeletion is strongly correlated with a variety of neurological disorders, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Heinzen et al. conducted genome-wide CNV analysis on patients with epilepsy syndrome and found that 23 of them carried 16p13.11 microdeletions, with clinical manifestations of partial epilepsy, childhood amnesic epilepsy, or juvenile amnesic epilepsy. Hannes et al. conducted comparative genomic hybridization screening on patients with intellectual disability and multiple malformations and found that the presence…

### Cardiovascular findings in duplication 17p11.2 syndrome [^112ou6XC]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular abnormalities are newly recognized features of duplication 17p11.2 syndrome. In a single-center study, we evaluated subjects with duplication 17p11.2 syndrome for cardiovascular abnormalities.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five subjects with 17p11.2 duplication identified by chromosome analysis and/or array-based comparative genomic hybridization were enrolled in a multidisciplinary protocol. In our clinical evaluation of these subjects, we performed physical examinations, echocardiography, and electrocardiography. Three of these subjects were followed up longitudinally at our institution.

- **Results**: Cardiovascular anomalies, including structural and conduction abnormalities, were identified in 10 of 25 (40%) of subjects with duplication 17p11.2 syndrome. The most frequent abnormality was dilated aortic root (20% of total cohort). Bicommissural aortic valve (2/25), atrial (3/25) and ventricular (2/25) septal defects, and patent foramen ovale (4/25) were also observed.

- **Conclusion**: Duplication 17p11.2 syndrome is associated with structural heart disease, aortopathy, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Individuals with duplication 17p11.2 syndrome should be evaluated by electrocardiography and echocardiography at the time of diagnosis and monitored for cardiovascular disease over time. Further clinical investigation, including longitudinal analysis, would likely determine the age of onset and characterize the progression (if any) of vasculopathy in subjects with duplication 17p11.2 syndrome, so that specific guidelines can be established for cardiovascular management.

Additional genetic analyses, other than CMA, were performed in 58% of the total cohort (see "Methods") with a second confirmed genetic diagnosis found in 4% of the total cohort. A variant of uncertain significance (another CNV or a single gene variant) was reported in 18%. The table below details confirmed second genetic diagnoses in four cases with 16p11.2 deletion, including the involved genes and their reference numbers in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database.

### ATR-16 syndrome: Mechanisms linking monosomy to phenotype [^116kxN1H]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Deletions removing 100s-1000s kb of DNA, and variable numbers of poorly characterized genes, are often found in patients with a wide range of developmental abnormalities. In such cases, understanding the contribution of the deletion to an individual's clinical phenotype is challenging.

- **Methods**: Here, as an example of this common phenomenon, we analyzed 41 patients with simple deletions of ~177 to ~2000 kb affecting one allele of the well-characterized, gene-dense, distal region of chromosome 16 (16p13.3), referred to as ATR-16 syndrome. We characterized deletion extents and screened for genetic background effects, telomere position effect, and compensatory upregulation of hemizygous genes.

- **Results**: We find the risk of developmental and neurological abnormalities arises from much smaller distal chromosome 16 deletions (~400 kb) than previously reported. Beyond this, the severity of ATR-16 syndrome increases with deletion size, but there is no evidence that critical regions determine the developmental abnormalities associated with this disorder. Surprisingly, we find no evidence of telomere position effect or compensatory upregulation of hemizygous genes; however, genetic background effects substantially modify phenotypic abnormalities.

- **Conclusions**: Using ATR-16 as a general model of disorders caused by CNVs, we show the degree to which individuals with contiguous gene syndromes are affected is not simply related to the number of genes deleted but depends on their genetic background. We also show there is no critical region defining the degree of phenotypic abnormalities.

### Unusual manifestations of young woman with MODY5 based on 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome [^113vi8hG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common type of monogenic diabetes that causes beta-cell dysfunction. Typically, the onset of MODYs is at an early age, with an average age of about 25. To the best of our knowledge, 14 candidate genes are involved in the pathogenesis of MODYs. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor 1 homeobox α (HNF 1A), glucokinase gene (GCK), and hepato-nuclear factor 4 homeobox (HNF 4A) are the most common subtypes. MODY5 is caused by mutation of the transcription factor HNF1B gene and is a rare subgroup of MODYs. It accounts for about 2–6% of patients with MODYs. Nowadays, the name "MODY5" has often been replaced by HNF1B MODY; however, in keeping with some references, MODY5 was used in this paper. Heterozygous mutations and complete gene deletions in HNF1B each account for approximately 50% of all patients.

We herein discuss a case of a patient who suffered from HNF1B heterozygosity due to 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome. The HNF1B gene, located on chromosome 17, contains nine exons and encodes HNF1β, a member of the transcription factor superfamily containing homologous domains. HNF1β plays an important tissue-specific role in regulating gene expression in the pancreas, kidney, intestine, liver, and genital tract. It is also involved in the embryonic development of these organs. The heterozygous mutation of the HNF1B gene can cause abnormalities in the aforementioned organs. This patient with 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome was diagnosed with MODY5 but lacked structural abnormalities of the genitourinary system, which is unusual.

### Unusual manifestations of young woman with MODY5 based on 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome [^111KvtEH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome, also known as renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome, is a distinct chromosomal aberration encompassing multiple genes, including HNF1B, LHX1, and ACACA. The deletion of HNF1B is associated with MODY5, and this gene is expressed in many organs. The spectrum of clinical phenotypes in patients with HNF1B mutations includes abnormalities of the liver, kidney, pancreas, and urogenital tract.

There are other common features, including delayed language development, learning disabilities, kidney involvement, eye dysmorphism, and strabismus. The most prevalent findings in patients with 17q12 deletion are kidney abnormalities, found in about 80–85% of these patients.

This patient did not present common renal structural abnormalities, such as multicystic dysplastic kidney, solitary kidney, or urinary tract malformation, which contributed to the delayed diagnosis. However, this patient developed severe electrolyte disturbances, especially refractory hypomagnesemia, a characteristic manifestation of impaired renal tubular function. HNF1B recognizes a site containing the ion transport regulator 2 gene, which can cause hypomagnesemia with hypermagnesuria and hypocalcinuria. Motyka reported four cases of MODY5, and these patients all had various degrees of hypomagnesemia.

Furthermore, 74% of patients with 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome had renal insufficiency with hypomagnesemia and/or hypocalcinuria. Consequently, renal function tests and ultrasonography of the kidneys were required regularly in these patients.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^114Ey4M5]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

The human chromosome 16p11.2 region consists of low copy repeats that are susceptible to misalignment during recombination, resulting in non-allelic homologous recombination and leading to reCNVs at different breakpoints (BPs). Recurrent 16p11.2 deletions and duplications are amongst the most prevalent disease-causing and development-affecting chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs). Although clinically heterogeneous, they share clinical features such as developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), behavioral and psychiatric problems, weight issues, congenital anomalies, and epilepsy.

The 'typical' 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion (OMIM#611913) and duplication (OMIM#614671) affect the ~600 kilobases (kb) from ~29.6 to 30.2 Megabases (Mb) region of chromosome 16, while the 'distal' 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (OMIM#613444) comprise the ~220 kb from ~28.8 to 29 Mb region of chromosome 16 (reference genome GRCh37/hg19). Studies have shown that cases with a typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 CNV on average have a 22–26 points lower full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score than relatives without the CNV. Similarly, cases with a distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNV on average have a lower FSIQ and more often neurodevelopmental disorders than non-carrier relatives. Penetrance of distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletions for neurodevelopmental disorders, however, is believed to be lower than the penetrance of typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is reported in ~25% of cases with 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 and BP4-BP5 CNVs. Interestingly, some opposite symptoms ('mirror phenotypes').

### Case report: extreme coronary calcifications and hypomagnesemia in a patient with a 17q12 deletion involving HNF1B [^1122DMYG]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, vascular calcifications have not been previously described in 17q12 deletion syndrome. Based on our discussion of this patient's findings, review of literature, and pertinent physiologic mechanisms, vascular calcifications are a plausible extension of the 17q12 deletion phenotype and may contribute significantly to the cardiovascular risk of affected patients, particularly in the setting of hypomagnesemia and hyperparathyroidism. Evaluation, surveillance, and aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors should be considered for individuals with 17q12 deletion syndrome.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^116Wgzd6]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

**Typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 versus distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion**: The majority of the typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletions were reported as de novo, which significantly differed from the distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletions (respectively 74.5% versus 25% de novo, p = 0.018). However, not all parents were tested. Obesity was more frequently associated with the distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 than typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletions (p = 0.001). Cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletions, on average, had an earlier onset of obesity (5.1 years versus 9.8 years; p = 0.044), as well as a higher BMI SDS (+3.2 versus +1.5; p < 0.001). Cases with typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion had a lower height SDS than cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion (-0.8 versus +0.1; p = 0.007). Delay in motor development was more often reported in the distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion group (p = 0.010), and neonatal feeding problems were more often reported in the typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion group (p = 0.031).

### Duplications of 17q12 can cause familial fever-related epilepsy syndromes [^116Va11C]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

After identifying a 17q12 duplication cosegregating in a four-generation family with genetic or generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), we aimed to determine the frequency of 17q12 genomic rearrangements in GEFS+ and a wide spectrum of other epilepsy phenotypes. Furthermore, we describe seizure prevalence in previously reported patients with a 17q12 duplication or deletion.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 433 patients with a broad range of epilepsy phenotypes. The 180k Cytosure ISCA v2 array was used for copy number variation screening in the index patient. Segregation analysis and follow-up studies were performed with the multiplex amplicon quantification technique.

- **Results**: We identified two families in which a 17q12 duplication segregated with febrile-sensitive epilepsy. In the follow-up study, the mutation rate in familial febrile seizures (FS) and GEFS+ phenotypes was 1/222. No 17q12 deletions were detected. Two of the six mutation carriers in the initial GEFS+ family had mild intellectual disability, whereas all family members of the second family were of normal intelligence. In the literature, four of 43 individuals with a 17q12 duplication and four of 55 with the reciprocal deletion were described to have had seizures.

- **Conclusions**: Our study shows that 17q12 duplications are a rare cause of familial FS and GEFS+. Although some family members might have intellectual disability, seizures can be the sole clinical symptom. This is the first report on an inherited copy number variation in these self-limiting fever-sensitive epilepsy syndromes.

### WHO ever heard of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome? Parents' perspectives on a susceptibility copy number variation syndrome [^1155HZbG]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Chromosomal microarray analysis is an important diagnostic tool to identify copy number variations (CNV). Some CNVs affect susceptibility regions, meaning deletions or duplications in these regions have partial penetrance and often increase the risk for a spectrum of neurocognitive disorders. Not much is known about the impact of rare CNV susceptibility syndromes on the lives of patients or their parents. In this study, we focus on one specific susceptibility CNV disorder, 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, characterized by an increased risk of mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and obesity. We aimed to explore the impact of such a disorder on family members involved in the daily care of children with this syndrome.

Three focus group discussions were conducted with 23 Dutch (grand)parents. Thematic analysis was performed by two independent researchers. The following five themes emerged:

- **The end of a diagnostic odyssey and response to the diagnosis**: Participants shared their journey to obtaining a diagnosis and their reactions upon receiving it.
- **After the diagnosis - life with a child with 16p11.2 deletion syndrome**: Participants discussed the ongoing challenges and adjustments in caring for a child with this condition.
- **Access to medical care and support services**: Parents highlighted difficulties in accessing appropriate medical care and support services.
- **Nobody knows what 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is**: A lack of awareness and understanding of the syndrome among healthcare professionals was noted.
- **Future perspective - ideal care**: Participants expressed their views on what constitutes ideal care for their children.

The participants experienced a lack of knowledge among professionals involved. Together with the large variability of the syndrome, this led to fragmented care and unmet needs regarding healthcare, social, and educational assistance. Care for children with a CNV susceptibility syndrome could be improved by a multidisciplinary approach.

### Expansion of the deletion 13q syndrome phenotype: a case report [^115262A6]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The phenotypic description of deletion 13q syndrome is dependent on the location and size of the deleted segment. At present, the syndrome is divided into three groups based on the deletion's location relative to chromosomal band 13q32. Groups 1 (proximal to q32) and 2 (including q32) have shown distinctive phenotypes, including mental retardation and growth deficiency, whereas group 3 (q33–34 deletion) is defined by the presence of mental retardation but usually the absence of major malformations.

An 8-year-old Hispanic female is reported with dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, moderate to severe mental retardation, and uncontrolled epilepsy associated with a terminal 13q33.3 deletion. These features expand the characterization of the phenotype associated with group 3 of the 13q deletion syndrome to include major clinical manifestations. This case report will contribute to more accurate genetic counseling and may help identify more individuals with this syndrome.

### Neuropsychological profile and neuroimaging in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: A review [^112Uh8Mo]. Child Neuropsychology (2005). Low credibility.

22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome is associated with cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric problems and is known to affect brain structure. Recently, 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome has been proposed as a disease model for a genetic subtype of schizophrenia. In this paper, we discuss the currently available literature on neurocognitive functioning and brain anatomy in patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome and how this contributes to our understanding of the neurobiology of schizophrenia.

Research on cognitive functioning in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome patients suggests a specific cognitive profile with impairments in arithmetical, visuo-spatial, and executive tasks and relatively preserved language skills. Prominent findings of neuroimaging studies in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome patients include the reduction of overall brain volume, midline defects, structural alterations of the cerebellum and frontal lobe, white matter abnormalities, and decreased grey matter volumes in parietal and temporal areas. We describe how brain abnormalities in patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome may contribute to the understanding of the clinical syndrome, including cognitive impairments, psychotic symptoms, and social and communication problems.

### Unusual manifestations of young woman with MODY5 based on 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome [^117GATt7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Up to now, fourteen subtypes of MODY have been reported. There is no concise or standardized diagnostic algorithm for MODY; however, some clinical signs indicate that the patient may have inherited diabetes. For example, there was hyperinsulinism during infancy, low triglyceride level, pancreatic agenesis, renal anomalies, and genital anomalies. This patient had serious fatigue, rapid weight loss, and refractory hypomagnesemia even after blood glucose was controlled. All these clinical characteristics suggest a specific type of diabetes. Genetic tests confirmed that the patient was MODY5 due to the deletion of the HNF1B gene.

Although MODY5 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, genetic abnormalities can also occur spontaneously. It has been suggested that the new occurrence rate of HNF1B gene deletion can be as high as 50%. MODY5 is often one of the manifestations of 17q12 Recurrent Deletion Syndrome. This patient is more likely to be spontaneous based on family history and final etiology.

### A 600 kb deletion syndrome at 16p11.2 leads to energy imbalance and neuropsychiatric disorders [^111Agd2D]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The recurrent ~600 kb 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion is among the most frequent known genetic aetiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders.

- **Objective**: To define the medical, neuropsychological, and behavioural phenotypes in carriers of this deletion.

- **Methods**: We collected clinical data on 285 deletion carriers and performed detailed evaluations on 72 carriers and 68 intrafamilial non-carrier controls.

- **Results**: When compared to intrafamilial controls, full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) is two standard deviations lower in carriers, and there is no difference between carriers referred for neurodevelopmental disorders and carriers identified through cascade family testing. Verbal IQ (mean 74) is lower than non-verbal IQ (mean 83), and a majority of carriers require speech therapy. Over 80% of individuals exhibit psychiatric disorders, including ASD, which is present in 15% of the paediatric carriers. Increase in head circumference (HC) during infancy is similar to the HC and brain growth patterns observed in idiopathic ASD. Obesity, a major comorbidity present in 50% of the carriers by the age of 7 years, does not correlate with FSIQ or any behavioural trait. Seizures are present in 24% of carriers and occur independently of other symptoms. Malformations are infrequently found, confirming only a few of the previously reported associations.

- **Conclusions**: The 16p11.2 deletion impacts in a quantitative and independent manner FSIQ, behaviour and body mass index, possibly through direct influences on neural circuitry.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^113vPTjP]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). High credibility.

The 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperphagia, obesity, macrocephaly, and psychiatric problems. Cases with 16p11.2 duplication syndrome have similar neurodevelopmental problems but typically show a partial 'mirror phenotype' with underweight and microcephaly. Various copy number variants (CNVs) of the chromosomal 16p11.2 region have been described. Most is known about the 'typical' 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 (29.6–30.2 Mb; ~600 kb) deletions and duplications, but there are also several published cohorts with more distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (28.8–29.0 Mb; ~220 kb) that exhibit clinical overlap.

We assessed 100 cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and compared their clinical characteristics to provide clearer genotype-phenotype correlations and raise awareness of the different 16p11.2 CNVs. Neurodevelopmental and weight issues were reported in the majority of cases. Cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion showed the most severe obesity phenotype (73.7% obesity, mean BMI SDS 3.2). In addition to the more well-defined typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs, we describe the clinical features of five cases with other, overlapping, 16p11.2 CNVs in more detail. Interestingly, four cases had a second genetic diagnosis and 18 cases had an additional gene variant of uncertain significance, which could potentially help explain the cases' phenotypes.

In conclusion, we provide an overview of our Dutch cohort of cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs.

### Case report: Extreme coronary calcifications and hypomagnesemia in a patient with a 17q12 deletion involving HNF1B [^115qemSs]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

17q12 deletion syndrome encompasses a broad constellation of clinical phenotypes, including renal magnesium wasting, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), renal cysts, genitourinary malformations, and neuropsychiatric illness. Manifestations outside of the renal, endocrine, and nervous systems have not been well described.

- **Case presentation**: We report a 62-year-old male referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who presented with persistent hypermagnesiuric hypomagnesemia and was found to have a 17q12 deletion. The patient exhibited several known manifestations of the syndrome, including severe hypomagnesemia, renal cysts, diabetes, and cognitive deficits. Coronary CT revealed extensive coronary calcifications, with a coronary artery calcification score of 12,427. Vascular calcifications have not been previously reported in this condition. We describe several physiologic mechanisms and a review of literature to support the expansion of the 17q12 deletion syndrome to include vascular calcification.

- **Conclusion**: Extensive coronary and vascular calcifications may be an extension of the 17q12 deletion phenotype, particularly if hypomagnesemia and hyperparathyroidism are prevalent. In patients with 17q12 deletions involving HNF1B, hyperparathyroidism and hypomagnesemia may contribute to significant cardiovascular risk.

### Estimating the effect size of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and its contribution to neurodevelopmental symptoms: recommendations for practice [^112gpVtD]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of the 15q11.2 deletion may point towards important biological mechanisms, but they are too small to support any relevant counseling in the clinic. The deletion should not be considered an etiological factor for patients referred to the developmental clinic. In particular, the standard deviation (SD) of IQ observed among siblings (± 12 points around the parental mean) is three times higher than the effect size of the 15q11.2 deletion. The presence or absence of the deletion in a young child is therefore a very poor predictor of developmental delay or intellectual disabilities (IDs). Our estimate of the effect size on IQ is concordant with the frequency of de novo occurrence observed in deletion carriers (8.3%), which is tightly related to the effect size of deletions on IQ.

Clinical series have been useful in delineating rare syndromes with remarkable and/or severe presentations. Using the duplication as a 'neutral CNV' control group, we show that the average proband referred for chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) testing presents with intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, autism, and cardiac malformations in approximately 35%, 14%, 17%, and 6% of cases, respectively. This suggests that clinical series will report similar frequencies regardless of any formal association, such as the association of the 15q11.2 deletion with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and congenital heart defects (CHD), which has yet to be demonstrated. Clinical series are especially problematic for genetic variants with an effect size much smaller than the average referral criteria, such as 16p13.11, 1q21.1 TAR, 17q12, 16p11.2 Distal (SH2B1), 1q21.1 Distal (Class I), and 15q13.3.

### Recurrent 17q12 microduplications contribute to renal disease but not diabetes [^1172WMdT]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Low credibility.

Recurrent microdeletions (OMIM: 614527) and microduplications (OMIM: 614526) of approximately 1.4 Mb region of 17q12 have each been associated with a range of conditions, including diabetes, renal disease, and intellectual disability (see Rasmussen et al. for review). Despite incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, some phenotypes present more consistently with microdeletions and others with microduplications. The microdeletion syndrome can include developmental kidney disease, early-onset diabetes mellitus, pancreatic hypoplasia, genital tract malformations, abnormal liver function tests, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The 17q12 microduplication is associated with a more variable phenotype that can include cognitive impairment, speech and motor developmental delay, brain anomalies, dysmorphic facial features, behavioral abnormalities, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and epilepsy. Renal function in 17q12 microduplications has not been characterized in a population cohort.

### A 600 kb deletion syndrome at 16p11.2 leads to energy imbalance and neuropsychiatric disorders [^113nzjDd]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The recurrent ∼600 kb 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion is among the most frequent known genetic aetiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders.

- **Objective**: To define the medical, neuropsychological, and behavioural phenotypes in carriers of this deletion.

- **Methods**: We collected clinical data on 285 deletion carriers and performed detailed evaluations on 72 carriers and 68 intrafamilial non-carrier controls.

- **Results**: When compared to intrafamilial controls, full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) is two standard deviations lower in carriers, and there is no difference between carriers referred for neurodevelopmental disorders and carriers identified through cascade family testing. Verbal IQ (mean 74) is lower than non-verbal IQ (mean 83) and a majority of carriers require speech therapy. Over 80% of individuals exhibit psychiatric disorders including ASD, which is present in 15% of the paediatric carriers. Increase in head circumference (HC) during infancy is similar to the HC and brain growth patterns observed in idiopathic ASD. Obesity, a major comorbidity present in 50% of the carriers by the age of 7 years, does not correlate with FSIQ or any behavioural trait. Seizures are present in 24% of carriers and occur independently of other symptoms. Malformations are infrequently found, confirming only a few of the previously reported associations.

- **Conclusions**: The 16p11.2 deletion impacts in a quantitative and independent manner FSIQ, behaviour and body mass index, possibly through direct influences on neural circuitry.

### Further clinical and molecular delineation of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome [^114DBreX]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The introduction of genome-wide approaches to identify deletions and duplications throughout the human genome has facilitated the discovery of numerous novel causes for intellectual disability (ID), autism, and other developmental disorders. In the clinical work-up of undiagnosed intellectual disability, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has the ability to make a diagnosis in 10–30% of cases. Recently, an international consensus has been reached that chromosomal microarray should be a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for individuals with developmental disabilities or congenital anomalies. It has also been shown that in many patients, abnormal chromosomal microarray testing influences medical care by precipitating specialty referral, diagnostic imaging, or specific laboratory testing.

For patients with well-known classical microdeletion syndromes, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Williams syndrome, extensive data exist on clinical features observed in patients, and management guidelines have been developed. For newly discovered microdeletion/duplication syndromes, case reports and family support groups such as Unique, the Rare Chromosome Disorder Support Group, offer limited resources. Systematic characterization of newly reported patients provides much-needed information for clinicians and patients.

Microdeletion of chromosome 15q24 was described as a new genomic disorder after identification of patients with overlapping deletions, intellectual disability, and similar clinical features. The 15q24 region is a complex area with significant implications for understanding these genetic disorders.

### 17q21.31 microduplication patients are characterised by behavioural problems and poor social interaction [^112LwGZp]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Microdeletions at 17q21.31 have recently been shown to cause a novel syndrome. Here we identify the reciprocal 17q21.31 duplication syndrome in four patients.

- **Method**: Patients with the 17q21.31 duplication were identified by screening a large cohort of patients (n = 13,070) with mental retardation and congenital malformation by comparative genomic hybridisation microarray. Parental origin was investigated in three patients by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microsatellite genotyping.

- **Results**: In three cases, it was possible to show that duplication arose de novo. Intellectual skills range from normal to mild mental retardation. Patients are characterised by poor social interaction, with relationship difficulties reminiscent of autistic spectrum disorders. Other features are rather variable, with no striking common phenotypic features. Parental origin was investigated for three patients. In all cases, duplication was of maternal origin either through interchromosomal (two cases) or interchromatid (one case) rearrangement. The three mothers are all carriers of the inverted H2 haplotype, emphasising the role of local genomic architecture alteration as a predisposing factor for this duplication.

- **Conclusion**: Autistic features observed in our patients suggest that genes in the duplicated interval should be considered as candidates for disorders in the autistic spectrum. Other phenotypic observations are rather variable or aspecific, adding 17q21.31 duplications to a growing group of recently identified genomic disorders with variable penetrance and expressivity.

### Further clinical and molecular delineation of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome [^115caXfT]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Chromosome 15q24 microdeletion syndrome is a rare genomic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, unusual facial morphology, and other anomalies. At the time of writing, 20 patients have been reported; 18 have had detailed breakpoint analysis.

- **Aim**: To further delineate the features of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, the clinical and molecular characterization of fifteen patients with deletions in the 15q24 region was performed, nearly doubling the number of reported patients.

- **Methods**: Breakpoints were characterized using a custom high-density array comparative hybridization platform, and detailed phenotype information was collected for each patient.

- **Results**: Nine distinct deletions with different breakpoints ranging in size from 266 kb to 3.75 Mb were identified. The majority of breakpoints lie within segmental duplication (SD) blocks. Low sequence identity and large intervals of unique sequence between SD blocks likely contribute to the rarity of 15q24 deletions, which occur 8–10 times less frequently than 1q21 or 15q13 microdeletions in our series. Two small, atypical deletions were identified within the region that help delineate the critical region for the core phenotype in the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: The molecular characterization of these patients suggests that the core cognitive features of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, including developmental delays and severe speech problems, are largely due to deletion of genes in a 1.1-Mb critical region. However, genes just distal to the critical region also play an important role.

### 17q12 microdeletion syndrome [^112K8kSM]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

An infant girl presented with multiple blisters followed by peeling of the skin over the entire body for five days with a prodrome of fever and cough. The child had dysmorphic facies, growth faltering, and developmental delay. The ultrasonogram of the abdomen showed multiple small cysts in both kidneys with increased echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Whole exome sequencing revealed a 1.4 mb deletion on the long arm of chromosome 17, which also involves the HNF1B gene. A diabetes workup showed an HbA1c of 5.9% with normal fasting glucose levels, suggestive of possible pre-diabetes. The renal functions were deranged with an estimated GFR of 22 mL/min/1.73 m². Keeping a possibility of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) in mind, the child was treated successfully with appropriate antibiotics. This case depicts an atypical presentation of 17q12 deletion syndrome with very early onset chronic kidney disease, pre-diabetes, and SSSS.

### Unusual manifestations of young woman with MODY5 based on 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome [^111YCbhN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome is a rare cause of diabetes mellitus type MODY5. It comprises variable combinations: MODY5, structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract, neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders, and some unusual genomic syndromes. Although this patient lacked the typical manifestations of genitourinary tract impairment, diabetes with hypomagnesemia was an important clue to her diagnosis. Therefore, we need to pay attention to some atypical 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome.

### Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options [^113c9WTc]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). High credibility.

The 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperphagia, obesity, macrocephaly, and psychiatric problems. Cases with 16p11.2 duplication syndrome have similar neurodevelopmental issues but typically show a partial 'mirror phenotype' with underweight and microcephaly. Various copy number variants (CNVs) of the chromosomal 16p11.2 region have been described.

Most knowledge pertains to the 'typical' 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 (29.6–30.2Mb; ~600kb) deletions and duplications. However, several published cohorts with more distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (28.8–29.0Mb; ~220kb) exhibit clinical overlap. We assessed 100 cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and compared their clinical characteristics to provide clearer genotype-phenotype correlations and raise awareness of the different 16p11.2 CNVs. Neurodevelopmental and weight issues were reported in the majority of cases. Cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion showed the most severe obesity phenotype, with 73.7% obesity and a mean BMI SDS of 3.2.

In addition to the more well-defined typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs, we describe the clinical features of five cases with other, overlapping 16p11.2 CNVs in more detail. Interestingly, four cases had a second genetic diagnosis and eighteen cases had an additional gene variant of uncertain significance. This could potentially help explain the cases' phenotypes.

In conclusion, we provide an overview of our Dutch cohort of cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and relevant second genetic findings.

### Systematic reanalysis of partial trisomy 21 cases with or without Down syndrome suggests a small region on 21q22.13 as critical to the phenotype [^1136u8pA]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The presented approach, based on stringent criteria to review cytogenetic and clinical features, and on systematic map integration, led us to accurately revise data points from past analyses. This allowed us to propose a more refined delimitation at a structural level of an Hsa21 region that is consistently duplicated in individuals diagnosed with Down syndrome. This duplication is thus likely associated with the most typical Down syndrome symptoms and signs, such as a recognizable form of intellectual disability and some facial phenotypes.

### Concurrent of compound heterozygous variant of a novel in-frame deletion and the common hypomorphic haplotype in TBX6 and inherited 17q12 microdeletion in a fetus [^1177m3sX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

We identified the 17q12 microdeletion in the family as a secondary finding. It has been reported that approximately 5% of patients have more than one molecular finding. We conducted routine analysis of CNVs for each sample by comparing the read depth with WES data from other samples of the same batch. By this strategy, we identified a 1.85 Mb deletion on the 17q12 region (hg19, chr17:34493374–36,346,847) in the fetus and the mother, which was also identified by CMA. This CNV can lead to 17q12 microdeletion syndrome, mainly manifested as renal cysts and diabetes syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of the HNF1B gene (chr17:34815072–36,192,489, OMIM#189,907). According to the clinical interpretation guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Clinical Genome, the microdeletion of 17q12 was classified as pathogenic.

- **Copy number variation analysis**: Sequencing depth analysis using the WES data showed a 17q12 deletion (hg19, chr17:34493374–36,346,847) in the fetus and mother.

Since the ultrasound examination did not indicate any renal abnormalities in the fetus, we therefore evaluated the health status of the mother. Ultrasound reports from another hospital showed the mother had multiple cystic areas in both kidneys with multiple stones, suggesting cystic changes in the renal medulla, the possibility of a sponge kidney, and several anechoic areas in the right kidney, indicative of multiple renal cysts.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation in Smith-Magenis syndrome: Evidence that multiple genes in 17p11.2 contribute to the clinical spectrum [^116XXhRM]. Genetics in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a complex disorder characterized by mental retardation, craniofacial and skeletal anomalies, and behavioral abnormalities. We report the molecular and genotype-phenotype analyses of 31 patients with SMS who carry 17p11.2 deletions or mutations in the RAI1 gene.

- **Methods**: Patients with SMS were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or sequencing of RAI1 to identify 17p11.2 deletions or intragenic mutations, respectively. They were compared for 30 characteristic features of this disorder using the Fisher exact test.

- **Results**: In our cohort, 8 of 31 individuals carried a common 3.5 Mb deletion, whereas 10 individuals had smaller deletions, two had larger deletions, and one had an atypical 17p11.2 deletion. Ten patients with nondeletion had a heterozygous mutation in RAI1. Phenotypic comparison between patients with deletions and those with RAI1 mutations shows that 21 of 30 SMS features are due to haploinsufficiency of RAI1, while cardiac anomalies, speech and motor delay, hypotonia, short stature, and hearing loss are linked to 17p11.2 deletions rather than RAI1 mutations (p < 0.05). Additionally, patients with smaller deletions exhibit features similar to those with RAI1 mutations.

- **Conclusion**: Although RAI1 is the primary gene responsible for most features of SMS, other genes within 17p11.2 contribute to the variable features and overall severity of the syndrome.

### Genetic basis of prune belly syndrome: Screening for HNF1β gene [^111Drkww]. The Journal of Urology (2012). High credibility.

Although the cause of prune belly syndrome is unknown, familial evidence suggests a genetic component. Recently, two nonfamilial cases of prune belly syndrome with chromosome 17q12 deletions encompassing the HNF1β gene have made this a candidate gene for prune belly syndrome. At the time of writing, there has been no large-scale screening of patients with prune belly syndrome for HNF1β mutations. We assessed the role of HNF1β in prune belly syndrome by screening for genomic mutations with functional characterization of any detected mutations.

- **Materials and methods**: We studied patients with prune belly syndrome who were prospectively enrolled in our Pediatric Genitourinary DNA Repository since 2001. DNA from patient samples was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, sequenced for coding and splice regions of the HNF1β gene, and compared to control databases. We performed functional assay testing on the ability of mutant HNF1β to activate a luciferase construct with an HNF1β DNA binding site.

- **Results**: From 32 prune belly syndrome probands (30 males, 2 females), HNF1β sequencing detected a missense mutation (V61G) in one child with prune belly syndrome. Absent in control databases, V61G was previously reported in two patients without prune belly syndrome who had congenital genitourinary anomalies. Functional testing showed similar luciferase activity compared to wild-type HNF1β, suggesting the V61G substitution does not disturb HNF1β function.

- **Conclusions**: One genomic HNF1β mutation was detected in 3% of patients with prune belly syndrome but found to be functionally normal. Thus, the functional characterization of this mutation suggests it may not be a significant contributing factor to prune belly syndrome.

### Prenatal diagnosis of 17q12 deletion syndrome: From fetal hyperechogenic kidneys to high risk for autism [^116PoZCX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

The linkage between 17q12 microdeletions, renal anomalies, and a higher risk for neurodevelopmental disorders is well described in the literature. This study presents the prenatal diagnosis of normal-sized fetal hyperechogenic kidneys leading to the diagnosis of 17q12 deletion syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.

- **Methods**: Over a period of 9 years in a single referral center, seven fetuses were diagnosed with hyperechogenic renal parenchyma and were followed up prospectively. Amniocentesis for molecular diagnosis was performed in all cases. Subsequently, five fetuses were found to harbor a 17q12 deletion through chromosomal microarray analysis. Postnatal evaluation was carried out by a developmental neurologist.

- **Results**: Five of the seven fetuses had a molecular diagnosis of 17q12 deletion. One patient elected termination of pregnancy. On long-term follow-up, all four of the remaining children showed symptoms consistent with neurodevelopmental disorders. The two fetuses without the deletion have a normal follow-up with regression of the renal hyperechogenicity.

- **Conclusions**: We report a strikingly high correlation between prenatal hyperechogenic kidneys, 17q12 microdeletion, and autism spectrum disorder. This finding offers the advantage of optimal prenatal counseling, as well as early diagnosis and intervention. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Concurrent of compound heterozygous variant of a novel in-frame deletion and the common hypomorphic haplotype in TBX6 and inherited 17q12 microdeletion in a fetus [^113NHPpZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

TACS is caused by bi-allelic variants of TBX6, consistent with autosomal recessive trait manifestation. The only exception was an autosomal dominant SCD caused by TBX6 elongation (c.1311 A > T, p.*437Cext*81) variant reported in a Macedonian family, whose pathogenic mechanism remained to be explored. To explain the heterogeneity of the TACS clinical phenotype, an allelic heterogeneity hypothesis of TBX6 was proposed. For the heterozygous common risk haplotype of TBX6, it causes only a moderate reduction in TBX6 expression, while the mutations in the other allele lead to different dosage effects, thus causing variation of phenotypic severity.

In addition to the compound heterozygosity in TBX6, the fetus harbored a microdeletion of 17q12 inherited from the mother. The 17q12 deletion syndrome can lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes after birth, mainly including congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (genital tract abnormalities, renal cysts, abnormalities of kidney parenchyma, fusion anomalies), MODY5, and neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders (developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia). However, knowledge about the prenatal phenotypes of 17q12 deletion syndrome is still limited.

The results of ultrasound screening at gestational weeks of 20–32 showed that the most common prenatal phenotypes were kidney anomalies, including renal hyperechogenicity and multicystic dysplastic kidneys. Although the ultrasound scan of the fetus in this study at 17 weeks of gestation found no abnormalities, further investigations are warranted to understand the full spectrum of prenatal manifestations.

### Unusual manifestations of young woman with MODY5 based on 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome [^116HxX6c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5) is a rare subtype of MODY. It is caused by mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B gene (HNF1B). The 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome usually results in MODY5 due to the deletion of HNF1B. Patients often present with clinical manifestations aside from diabetes. Refractory hypomagnesemia was a clue for further examination in this patient, although she lacked structural abnormalities of the genitourinary system and neurodevelopmental disorders commonly associated with 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome. Such atypical cases warrant attention.

- **Case presentation**: A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for severe malnutrition and gastrointestinal symptoms. At age 20, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs. She discontinued the medication on her own accord and subsequently returned to the hospital due to diabetic ketoacidosis. Following insulin treatment, diabetic ketoacidosis was resolved, and blood glucose levels were satisfactorily controlled. However, she continued to experience intractable nausea, vomiting, and persistent weight loss. Further examination revealed hypokalemia and refractory hypomagnesemia. Genetic testing identified approximately a 1.85 Mb heterozygous fragment deletion on chromosome 17 and the deletion of exons 1–9 of the HNF1B gene. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with MODY5.

- **Discussion and conclusions**: The 17q12 recurrent deletion syndrome is characterized by_VARIABLE_DELETION_HERE_

### Microdeletions excluding YWHAE and PAFAH1B1 cause a unique leukoencephalopathy: further delineation of the 17p13.3 microdeletion spectrum [^116tqkbQ]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine brain malformations caused by 17p13.3 deletions, which include lissencephaly with deletions of the larger Miller-Dieker syndrome region or smaller deletions of only PAFAH1B1. These deletions can lead to white matter changes and a distinct syndrome due to deletions including YWHAE and CRK but sparing PAFAH1B1. We aimed to understand the significance of 17p13.3 deletions between the YWHAE/CRK and PAFAH1B1 loci.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the clinical features of six individuals from five families who had 17p13.3 deletions located between, but not including, YWHAE/CRK and PAFAH1B1. These deletions were identified in individuals undergoing clinical chromosomal microarray testing or research genome sequencing.

- **Results**: Five individuals from four families exhibited multifocal white matter lesions, while a sixth had a normal magnetic resonance image. By combining our findings with a literature review of individuals with white matter changes and deletions in this chromosomal region, we narrowed the overlapping region for this brain phenotype to approximately 345kb, encompassing 11 RefSeq genes. RTN4RL1 haploinsufficiency emerged as the best candidate for causing this phenotype.

- **Conclusion**: While previous literature has hypothesized dysmorphic features and white matter changes related to YWHAE, our cohort provides evidence that additional genetic changes within 17p13.3 are required for proper brain development.

### Should we offer prenatal testing for 17q12 microdeletion syndrome to all cases with prenatally diagnosed echogenic kidneys? Prenatal findings in two families with 17q12 microdeletion syndrome and review of the literature [^115ZgPFz]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to report the prenatal ultrasound findings in four fetuses from two families postnatally diagnosed with 17q12 microdeletion syndrome on microarray CGH and review the literature.

- **Methods**: We report two families presenting with prenatally detected hyperechogenic kidneys. In family 1, the mother had three pregnancies complicated by anhydramnios with bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys, hyperechogenic enlarged cystic kidneys, and bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys with polyhydramnios respectively. In family 2, prenatal ultrasound scans detected hyperechogenic kidneys. A PubMed search for all reported cases of 17q12 deletion between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All publications were reviewed, and findings summarized.

- **Results**: Fourteen publications were deemed suitable for literature review; there was a diagnosis of 17q12 deletion with documented prenatal findings in 25 cases. Prenatal renal anomalies were reported in 88% of these cases. Anomalies were documented from 15 weeks, and the most common presentations were hyperechogenic, multicystic, or enlarged kidneys. Both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios were seen. Postnatal renal ultrasound scan findings were of multicystic dysplastic kidney. There did not appear to be a correlation of prenatal presentation and severity of renal disease.

- **Conclusion**: Prenatal testing should be offered to all cases of hyperechogenic kidneys with unknown cause.
