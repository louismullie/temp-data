## Question

Protein and glucose in urine means

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the simultaneous presence of protein and glucose in urine means, how to interpret it, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of protein and glucose handling by the kidney. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to proteinuria and glucosuria. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis when both coexist, including diabetic kidney disease, tubular disorders, and medication effects. After that, I need to check for confounders and confirmatory testing. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, monitoring, and when to refer, making sure I align with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the normal physiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Under normal conditions, the glomerular barrier restricts albumin and larger proteins, and the proximal tubule reabsorbs nearly all filtered glucose via SGLT2 and SGLT1, so urine should contain minimal protein and essentially no glucose, which means any measurable protein or glucose in urine is abnormal and warrants evaluation [^113RcCtu] [^115jhDva].

> Now, proteinuria: I need to ensure I'm precise about mechanisms and thresholds. Proteinuria reflects increased glomerular permeability, tubular dysfunction with impaired reabsorption of filtered proteins, or overflow from increased plasma proteins; clinically, albumin is the most informative marker, and persistent albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g indicates kidney damage and higher cardiovascular risk, with > 300 mg/g indicating more advanced disease and worse prognosis [^1175ZuJn] [^1125fo7H] [^11174st5].

> For glucosuria, hold on, let me verify the renal threshold and causes. Glucose appears in urine when plasma glucose exceeds the tubular reabsorption maximum of roughly 180–200 mg/dL, or when the renal threshold is lowered or reabsorption is impaired, as in SGLT2 loss-of-function variants, pregnancy, or proximal tubular injury; importantly, glucosuria in the setting of normal or well-controlled blood glucose points to tubular dysfunction rather than hyperglycemia [^115jhDva] [^114841uC] [^11368Ms7].

> When both protein and glucose appear together, I should think about overlapping pathophysiology. In diabetes, hyperglycemia can overwhelm SGLT transport causing glucosuria, while chronic hyperglycemia injures podocytes and the glomerular barrier leading to albuminuria; mechanistically, SGLT2 inhibitors increase glycosuria and concurrently reduce albuminuria, illustrating a proximal tubule–glomerular crosstalk that can modulate proteinuria independent of changes in plasma glucose, which helps explain why both can coexist in diabetic kidney disease [^114ZADpo] [^115jhDva].

> But wait, what if the patient is not diabetic or has atypical features? I should double-check for nondiabetic etiologies. Proximal tubular disorders such as Fanconi syndrome can cause normoglycemic glucosuria and low-molecular-weight proteinuria, and certain drugs like tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can induce tubular injury with glycosuria and proteinuria; in such cases, the combination reflects tubular dysfunction rather than primary glomerular disease, and medication review plus tubular markers are key [^11368Ms7] [^112LDJS1] [^1123tDu7].

> Next, I should review confounders and confirmatory testing so I don't misclassify. Transient elevations in albumin excretion can occur with fever, exercise, menstruation, marked hyperglycemia, or UTI, so I need to confirm persistent albuminuria with two additional first-morning specimens over 3–6 months and exclude UTI; when albuminuria is detected on dipstick, I should quantify with albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio, and if glucosuria is present with normal glucose, I should consider tubular disease and check serum electrolytes, phosphate, bicarbonate, and low-molecular-weight proteins [^1175ZuJn] [^11174st5] [^111VG1ea].

> I will now examine the immediate clinical implications and actions. The combination of proteinuria and glucosuria signals kidney damage and higher cardiovascular risk; I should assess kidney function with serum creatinine and eGFR, screen for diabetes with fasting glucose or HbA1c if not already established, measure blood pressure, and review medications for nephrotoxins or SGLT2 inhibitors; if diabetic kidney disease is likely, optimize glycemic and blood pressure control, and initiate ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy when albuminuria is ≥ 30 mg/g, with consideration of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal protection in appropriate patients [^1125fo7H] [^113WQVma] [^11174st5].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and follow-up. For patients with established diabetic kidney disease, guidelines recommend monitoring urinary albumin and eGFR every 1–4 times per year depending on stage, and for those on tenofovir or cobicistat-containing regimens, urine protein and glucose should be checked at baseline and periodically every 3–6 months; if albuminuria increases rapidly or exceeds 300 mg/g, I should reassess for nondiabetic kidney disease and consider nephrology referral [^115wFBvY] [^1131Q6gc] [^116JspQc] [^115nMn4q].

> Let me reconsider the differential when features are atypical. In diabetes, clues to nondiabetic kidney disease include type 1 diabetes duration less than 5 years, active urine sediment, rapidly rising albuminuria or declining eGFR, or the absence of retinopathy; in such cases, I should broaden the workup and, if uncertainty persists, discuss kidney biopsy to distinguish diabetic glomerulopathy from alternative glomerular diseases [^115nMn4q] [^111LtDrU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the interpretation is integrated and actionable. The simultaneous presence of protein and glucose in urine indicates clinically significant kidney injury, most commonly from diabetic kidney disease but also from proximal tubular disorders or drug-induced nephrotoxicity; confirming persistence, quantifying albuminuria, assessing kidney function, and contextualizing with glycemic status and medications guide the correct diagnosis and management, with timely intervention to slow progression and reduce cardiovascular risk [^1175ZuJn] [^11174st5] [^1125fo7H].

The presence of both protein and glucose in urine indicates **kidney damage with concurrent hyperglycemia** or **tubular dysfunction**. Proteinuria reflects increased glomerular permeability or tubular injury [^1147GaKG], while glucosuria occurs when blood glucose exceeds the renal threshold (~180 mg/dL) [^115jhDva] or when tubular reabsorption is impaired [^116i6Mjc]. This combination is most commonly due to **diabetic nephropathy** [^1144N9vj] but may also signal other glomerular diseases, tubular disorders (e.g. Fanconi syndrome) [^11368Ms7], or medication effects (e.g. SGLT2 inhibitors) [^114ZADpo]. Confirm with **repeat urinalysis** [^1175ZuJn], quantify protein with **ACR/PCR** [^116WnUKT], and check **serum glucose, eGFR, and electrolytes** to determine the cause and guide management [^113dB55k].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Proteinuria

Proteinuria arises from **increased glomerular permeability** — as in diabetes, hypertension, or glomerulonephritis [^1147GaKG] — or from **tubular dysfunction**, in which impaired reabsorption of normally filtered proteins (e.g. β2-microglobulin) causes proteinuria [^1143f6gc].

---

### Glucosuria

Glucosuria reflects **hyperglycemia exceeding the renal threshold** (~180 mg/dL) [^115jhDva], overwhelming proximal tubular reabsorption capacity [^116i6Mjc], or **tubular dysfunction** with impaired glucose reabsorption despite normal or mildly elevated blood glucose (e.g. Fanconi syndrome, SGLT2 inhibition) [^11368Ms7] [^114ZADpo].

---

## Clinical significance of combined protein and glucose in urine

The simultaneous presence of protein and glucose in urine is clinically significant and **indicates underlying renal pathology** [^1123tDu7]. The most common causes include:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Diabetic nephropathy | - Hyperglycemia <br/> - Glomerular hyperfiltration <br/> - Mesangial expansion <br/> - Glomerulosclerosis | - Proteinuria <br/> - Glucosuria <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Progressive renal impairment [^112VFwDP] |
| Fanconi syndrome | - Proximal tubular dysfunction <br/> - Impaired reabsorption of glucose, amino acids, phosphate, bicarbonate | - Glucosuria <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Hypophosphatemia <br/> - Metabolic acidosis [^11368Ms7] |
| SGLT2 inhibitor therapy | - Inhibition of SGLT2 <br/> - Increased urinary glucose excretion | - Glucosuria <br/> - Mild proteinuria <br/> - Cardiorenal benefits [^114ZADpo] |
| Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) | - Tubular injury <br/> - Impaired reabsorption | - Proteinuria <br/> - Glucosuria <br/> - Acute kidney injury [^11368Ms7] |
| Multiple myeloma | - Light chain proteinuria <br/> - Renal tubular injury | - Proteinuria <br/> - Glucosuria <br/> - Bone pain <br/> - Hypercalcemia [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When both protein and glucose are detected in urine, a **systematic diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat urinalysis to confirm persistent proteinuria and glucosuria [^notfound].
- **Quantification**: Measure urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) to quantify protein excretion [^1175ZuJn].
- **Blood glucose assessment**: Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess glycemic control [^notfound].
- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and electrolytes to assess renal function [^113WQVma].
- **Additional tests**: Consider renal ultrasound, autoimmune serology, or kidney biopsy if indicated [^112vS6j4].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The presence of both protein and glucose in urine has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Progression of renal disease**: Proteinuria is a strong independent predictor of renal disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity [^1125fo7H].
- **Glycemic control**: Intensive glycemic control can reduce proteinuria and slow renal disease progression [^1161Ecuc].
- **Blood pressure control**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended to reduce proteinuria and slow renal disease progression [^117GKq7f].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary protein restriction, weight management, and smoking cessation are beneficial [^117GKq7f].

---

## Conclusion

Protein and glucose in urine indicate **kidney damage with concurrent hyperglycemia or tubular dysfunction**. Proteinuria reflects increased glomerular permeability or tubular injury, while glucosuria reflects hyperglycemia or impaired tubular reabsorption. This combination is most commonly due to diabetic nephropathy but may also indicate other glomerular diseases, tubular disorders, or medication effects. Confirm with repeat urinalysis, quantify protein excretion, and assess renal function to guide management [^1175ZuJn].

### Screening with urinary dipsticks for reducing morbidity and mortality [^11168YvC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary dipsticks are sometimes used for screening asymptomatic people, and for case-finding among inpatients or outpatients who do not have genitourinary symptoms. Abnormalities identified on screening sometimes lead to additional investigations, which may identify serious disease, such as bladder cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urinary dipstick screening could improve prognoses due to earlier detection, but could also lead to unnecessary and potentially invasive follow-up testing and unnecessary treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks in general populations and patients in hospitals.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 8 September 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and other study types that compared urinary dipstick screening with no dipstick screening were eligible for inclusion. We searched for studies that investigated the use of urinary dipsticks for detecting haemoglobin, protein, albumin, albumin-creatinine ratio, leukocytes, nitrite, or glucose, alone or in any combination, and in any setting. We planned to exclude studies conducted in patients with urinary disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. However, no studies met our inclusion criteria.

Main Results

Literature searches to 8 September 2014 yielded 4298 records, of which 4249 were excluded following title and abstract assessment. There were 49 records (44 studies) eligible for full text assessment; of these 18 studies were not RCTs and 26 studies compared interventions or controls that were not relevant to this review. Thus, no studies were eligible for inclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks, which remain unknown.

### Glucosuria and albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy: a consideration at nanolevel [^112x3iCJ]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2007). Low credibility.

In diabetes, the appearance of albumin in the urine has long been recognized as a cardinal feature of kidney disease. Physiologically, the glomerular capillary wall provides a barrier to protein in blood not to cross into urine. However, in the pathological condition, the change in the glomerular permeability, protein can be detected in urine. Here, the author reviewed the reported size of the glomerular pore size as well as the molecular size of glucose and albumin in the literature. According to this study, it can conclude that the appearance of glucosuria in diabetic patient is due to the impairment of renal tubular function. With prolonged glucosuria, the impairment of glomerulus, decrease in pore size, develops. Finally, the albuminuria occurs as late complication.

### Dietary proteins contribute little to glucose production, even under optimal gluconeogenic conditions in healthy humans [^117JSAzx]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Dietary proteins are believed to participate significantly in maintaining blood glucose levels, but their contribution to endogenous glucose production (EGP) remains unclear. We investigated this question using multiple stable isotopes. After overnight fasting, eight healthy volunteers received an intravenous infusion of [6,6–2 H 2]-glucose. Two hours later, they ingested four eggs containing 23 g of intrinsically, uniformly, and doubly [15 N]-[13 C]–labeled proteins. Gas exchanges, expired CO 2, blood, and urine were collected over the 8 h following egg ingestion. The cumulative amount of dietary amino acids (AAs) deaminated over this 8-h period was 18.1 ± 3.5%, 17.5% of them being oxidized. The EGP remained stable for 6 h but fell thereafter, concomitantly with blood glucose levels. During the 8 h after egg ingestion, 50.4 ± 7.7 g of glucose was produced, but only 3.9 ± 0.7 g originated from dietary AA. Our results show that the total postprandial contribution of dietary AA to EGP was small in humans habituated to a diet medium-rich in proteins, even after an overnight fast and in the absence of carbohydrates from the meal. These findings question the respective roles of dietary proteins and endogenous sources in generating significant amounts of glucose in order to maintain blood glucose levels in healthy subjects.

### Executive summary: guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114F16N1]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in patients with diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments in the full version of the guideline). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the patients measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring; genetic testing; and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

Nephropathy Screening and Treatment

General recommendations

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize glucose control. (A)
To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114e7ULJ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

URINARY GLUCOSE

RECOMMENDATION: SEMIQUANTITATIVE URINE GLUCOSE TESTING IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ROUTINE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUSB (low).

1. Use

Semiquantitative urine glucose testing, once the hallmark of diabetes care in the home setting, has now been replaced by SMBG (see above). Semiquantitative urine glucose monitoring should be considered only for patients who are unable or refuse to perform SMBG, because the urine glucose concentration does not accurately reflect the plasma glucose concentration. Notwithstanding these limitations, urine glucose monitoring is supported by the IDF in those situations in which blood glucose monitoring is not accessible or affordable, particularly in resource-poor settings.

2. Rationale

Although urine glucose is detectable in patients with grossly increased blood glucose concentrations, it provides no information about blood glucose concentrations below the variable renal glucose threshold [approximately 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)]. This fact alone limits its usefulness for monitoring diabetes under modern care recommendations. Semiquantitative urine glucose tests also cannot distinguish between euglycemia and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, the extent to which the kidney concentrates the urine will affect urine glucose concentrations, and only mean glucose values between voidings are reflected. These facts further minimize the value of urine glucose measurements.

3. Analytical considerations

Semiquantitative test-strip methods that use reactions specific for glucose are recommended. Commercially available strips use the glucose oxidase reaction. Test methods that detect reducing substances are not recommended because they are subject to numerous interferences, including numerous drugs and nonglucose sugars. When used, single voided urine samples are recommended.

4. Interpretation

Because of the limited use of urine glucose measurements, semiquantitative specific reaction–based test-strip methods are adequate.

KETONE TESTING

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: KETONES MEASURED IN URINE OR BLOOD IN THE HOME SETTING BY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND IN THE CLINIC/HOSPITAL SETTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AN ADJUNCT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF DKA GPP.

The ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc), acetone, and β-hydroxybutyric acid (βHBA) are catabolic products of free fatty acids. Measurements of ketones in urine and blood are widely used in the management of patients with diabetes as adjuncts for both diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of DKA. Measurements of ketone bodies are routinely performed, both in an office/hospital setting and by patients at home. The ADA recommends that ketosis-prone patients with diabetes check urine or blood ketones in situations characterized by deterioration in glycemic control in order to detect and preempt the development of DKA.

### Cardiovascular implications of proteinuria: an indicator of chronic kidney disease [^1125fo7H]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria, defined as urine protein excretion greater than 300 mg over 24 h, is a strong and independent predictor of increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with and without diabetes. Proteinuria is a sign of persistent dysfunction of the glomerular barrier and often precedes any detectable decline in renal filtration function. Measurement of proteinuria is important in stratifying the risk for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease progression. A variety of basic pathophysiologic mechanisms that can partially explain simultaneous renal and cardiac disease will be discussed in this Review. In addition to being a prognostic marker, proteinuria is being considered as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular medicine. Therapeutic strategies for amelioration of proteinuria by achieving blood pressure targets, glycemic control in diabetes, treatment of hyperlipidemia, and reducing dietary salt and protein intake are also reviewed in this paper. Future clinical studies are needed to assess if proteinuria reduction should be a target of treatment to reduce the burden of end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and improve survival in this high-risk population.

### Changes in the composition of urine over six hours using urine dipstick analysis and automated microscopy [^114JvGuP]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the study

Our study is unique as it utilized reliable measurements from the state-of-the-art IDEXX SediVue Dx ® machine, providing high accuracy and reproducibility in microscopic examination. This instrument has not been used to analyze human urine samples; thus, there are no academic publications investigating its use in human urine at the time of the writing of this paper.

One of the limitations is that the investigation only spanned a relatively short time frame of 6 h, where longer delays in urine analysis might reveal further changes in the urine composition of other components. Another limitation was the small sample size as each urine sample has to be analyzed individually, limiting the number of samples that can be studied for test–retest changes at frequent intervals. Further studies on larger cohorts should be performed to confirm these findings. For example, there could be interaction of components such that these results may be different in urines with extremes of pH or in the presence of large amounts of protein or glucose.

### Association between glycosuria and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes from the CREDENCE trial: a mechanistic link? [^114ZADpo]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Highly selective SGLT2 inhibitors reduce sodium-glucose reabsorption by 30–40%, thereby sparing the proximal tubule an equivalent percentage of energy consumption. SGLT2 inhibitors have also been consistently shown to reduce albuminuria. One question therefore is whether SGLT2-induced glycosuria bears any relation to concomitant albuminuria. We recently explored the role of glycosuria in SGLT2 inhibitor-induced cardiorenal protection by measuring urine glucose-to-creatinine ratio (UGCR) in proteinuric patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and high cardiovascular risk randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo (a subcohort of the CREDENCE trial). At 1 year after randomization, UGCR rose from a baseline of 0.25 (1.09) to 15.8 (29.2) mg/mg (median (IQR)) in the canagliflozin arm versus 0.24 (1.09) to 0.24 (1.29) mg/mg in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001 between arms). Over the same time period, the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) dropped from 920 (1,283) to 593 (1,311) mg/g with canagliflozin while numerically increasing (from 886 (1,266) to 1,016 (1,819) mg/g) with placebo (p < 0.0001 between arms). As is typical of multicentric patient cohorts, the distributions of UACR and UGCR were both widely scattered. Notably, however, UACR was directly related to UGCR among participants on placebo but inversely related to UGCR among participants on canagliflozin (figure 1). Thus, from the equation, a subject with a UGCR of 15 mg/mg (corresponding to a glycosuria of 25–30 g/day) is predicted to have a UACR of 1,315 mg/g if on placebo and one of 546 mg/g if on canagliflozin. The interpretation of this relationship is straightforward, that is, without canagliflozin a large glycosuria marks worse glycemic control (and, presumably, greater renal damage), while with canagliflozin the same degree of glycosuria is associated with less albuminuria and lesser kidney damage. Importantly, at 1-year estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 49 (27) versus 50 (29) mL×min −1 ×1.73 m −2, canagliflozin versus placebo, p = n.s. — and plasma glucose concentrations: 8.0 (3.6) versus 8.3 (3.8) mmol/L, p < 0.02 — were little different between the arms. Also, the reduction of UACR with canagliflozin was detected at the earliest time tested after randomization — when glycosuria had been steadily ongoing — and stabilized thereafter.

### Noninvasive biomarkers for lupus nephritis [^112WHu6F]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary Biomarkers for LN

Like blood, urine also contains a variety of components, such as epithelial cells, proteins, glucose, inorganic salts, and trace elements, which can be used as biomarkers for laboratory medicine. Arazi et alused single cell transcriptomics to analyze kidney and urine samples from LN patients and healthy individuals. Their finding revealed similarities in the molecular signatures of urine and kidney tissues, highlighting the superiority of urine samples in understanding kidney damage. Additionally, numerous studies have demonstrated that the phenotype and composition of urine cells were similar to those cells observed in renal biopsies, suggesting that the immune cells examined in urine originated from the kidney. Of note, urine collection is clinically very easy with few side effects; hence, it can be used to significantly improve the frequency of continuous monitoring in LN patients. Therefore, urine testing has the potential to serve as a surrogate for renal biopsy in assessing the extent of kidney damage and inflammation level.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^112LDJS1]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to exclude metabolic acidosis, hypercalciuria, and renal Fanconi syndrome by measuring serum bicarbonate levels and urinary excretion of calcium, amino acids, glucose, and low-molecular-weight protein markers.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^11368Ms7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Proximal tubular dysfunction — urine and derived indices are characterized by diagnostic glycosuria and specific fractional excretion and ratio thresholds. Urine glucose on dipstick is defined as glycosuria in the absence of diabetes, or in diabetics with well-controlled blood glucose and is diagnostic of renal tubular injury. Fractional excretion of phosphate is interpreted as < 10% is normal and > 20% is abnormal, and an upward trend in urinary phosphate wasting is suggestive of tubular injury. Tubular maximum for phosphate corrected for glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) is lower than reference value (normal, 2.8–4.4 mg/dL) to assess renal phosphate handling independent of plasma phosphate and renal function. For purine handling, the fractional excretion of uric acid is < 15% is normal and > 20% is abnormal, and an upward trend in urinary uric acid wasting is strongly suggestive of proximal tubular dysfunction. Protein selectivity can be screened with the urine albumin-to-protein ratio, where uAPR < 0.4 suggests predominantly tubulointerstitial disease, whereas uAPR > 0.4 suggests predominantly glomerular disease, and it is only evaluated in individuals with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200 mg/g.

### Common variation at 16p11.2 is associated with glycosuria in pregnancy: findings from a genome-wide association study in European women [^114841uC]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At normal levels, glucose is not detectable in urine. Glycosuria, the presence of glucose in urine above normal levels, may be caused by either an increase in blood glucose such that the renal tubules are overwhelmed and complete reabsorption of presented glucose is not possible, a lowering of the renal threshold, or inhibition of renal tubule reabsorption. Although prevalence estimates for glycosuria vary, it seems likely that the condition effects around 50% of women at some stage of their pregnancy and is thought to occur primarily as a result of pregnancy-related increases in renal blood flow resulting in a lower threshold for excreting glucose in urine. It also reflects pregnancy-related increases in circulating blood glucose. While, outside of pregnancy, glycosuria is considered a diabetes indicator, glycosuria in pregnancy is not specific or sensitive for gestational diabetes risk and is not recommended as a screening tool for it.

There is evidence that glycosuria is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in offspring and with later life outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease death, in mothers. Therefore, the presence of glycosuria may potentially indicate future adverse outcomes in pregnancy and the life course.

Both glucose regulation and renal function are heritable, with reliable evidence for several genetic variants being associated with a range of relevant traits, including fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, type 2 diabetes and glomerular filtration rate in general non-pregnant populations. While these studies have yielded valuable new insights into glucose metabolism, still outstanding is an investigation of the genetic contribution to glycosuria during pregnancy. To investigate whether common genetic variants are associated with glucose in urine during pregnancy and to explore potential links to other glycaemic and renal-function-related traits, we set out to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of glycosuria during pregnancy in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and looked for confirmatory evidence in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986). We further investigated the genetic overlap between identified loci and multiple diabetes-related traits.

### Plasma and urine biomarkers in chronic kidney disease: closer to clinical application [^1144N9vj]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

It is estimated that 850 million globally have chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the United States, 37 million have CKD, of which the leading cause is diabetes, which accounts for nearly half of all patients that reach end stage of kidney disease (ESKD). The projected growth for both diabetes and ESKD will impose a significant burden nationally and globally if left unmitigated. However, 90% of patients with CKD have earlier stages that may be treatable before reaching advanced stages that are plagued by irreversible fibrosis and lack any treatment options, other than symptom control. There are now many new treatments for CKD [and diabetic kidney disease (DKD)] that can slow the risk of progression of kidney disease, particularly the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). These agents reduce the risk of progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes (DKD) by 40%. However, there are still issues with optimal usage of SGLT2i, including slow implementation, potential adverse effects, initial decline in kidney function upon initiation and high costs. The FDA recently approved dapagliflozin to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with CKD who are at risk of disease progression. Although the standard for risk assessment of kidney disease progression is a combination of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria/albuminuria, the intra-individual variation of albuminuria is large, such that decreases of 55% and increases of 124% within 4 weeks are within the bounds of random variation and do not connote true biological change. The same is true for eGFR, where decreases of 16% and increases of 20% can all be due to random variation. Moreover, a substantiation amount of kidney damage (glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis) can occur in early stages (particularly in DKD), before there are noticeable decrements in eGFR. Thus, there is a need for more sensitive and specific biomarkers in CKD.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^113WvZ3V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes (protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones).

Objective —

To explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells because of urine strip shortages.

Design —

During shortages, we implemented an automated algorithm that triggered sending urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose and ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed 2 labels so nursing staff would collect 2 specimens. We monitored the turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification, ensured that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding not having usual urinalysis results. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.

Results —

The algorithm was put in place twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period we had only 1 complaint, by a physician wanting to have results of nitrates.

Conclusions —

During urine strip shortages, we successfully implemented a diversion algorithm that provided actionable urinalysis analytes in a timely manner with minimal provider complaints.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) renal monitoring in children — Because TDF has the potential to decrease creatinine clearance and cause renal tubular dysfunction, the Panel recommends measuring serum creatinine and using a urine dipstick to check protein and glucose concentration before initiating TDF, although it is unclear how often to monitor in asymptomatic children. Many Panel members monitor creatinine with other blood tests every 3 to 4 months and perform urinalysis every 6 to 12 months. Serum phosphate should be measured if clinically indicated; renal phosphate loss can occur in the presence of normal creatinine and in the absence of proteinuria. Because nephrotoxicity increases with the duration of TDF treatment, monitoring should be continued during long-term therapy with the drug.

Monitoring after primary myeloma therapy — response assessment and follow-up testing should align with International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria; it is recommended that the IMWG uniform response criteria should be used in all clinical trials and, according to the NCCN Panel, response should be assessed using the IMWG criteria; the same imaging modality used during the initial workup should ideally be used for follow-up; follow-up tests include those used for initial diagnosis such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet counts, blood glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic panel; assessing changes in proteins, particularly the M protein, is used to track disease progression and response, with SPEP used to track quantitative immunoglobulins and 24-hour urine UPEP to track total protein; the FLCr is required for documenting sCR according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria, and the serum FLC assay cannot replace the 24-hour UPEP for monitoring patients with measurable urinary M protein and can be affected by renal function; bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with FISH should be performed as clinically indicated, especially at relapse.

### Extracellular vesicles as a source of prostate cancer biomarkers in liquid biopsies: a decade of research [^117T9Acd]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Urine is a biofluid in close anatomical proximity with the prostate through the prostatic urethra, and it has been the biofluid of choice in several recent studies of EV-based PCa biomarkers (Tables 2 and 3). In these studies, both urine and DRE urine have been used. As mentioned above, DRE urine is a rational choice if high amounts of EV molecules of prostatic origin are needed or if the analyte under investigation has a relatively low abundance. The physiological characteristics of urine and its dynamic character as an excretory biofluid require specific preanalytical steps to assure consistent analysis and experimental results. Timely urine pre-clearing (within hours after collection) by mild centrifugation to remove shed cells is important to prevent cell lysis, which could contaminate the EV fraction with cell debris. If the precleared urine is not to be processed immediately for EV analysis, which is often the case in biobanking and in large clinical studies, it is warranted to store the precleared fraction in aliquots at temperatures below −70 °C. Removal of uromodulin (also known as Tamm–Horsfall protein), a high-abundance protein in urine, has also been the focus of several studies because it forms polymer networks that can trap EVs and skew downstream analysis. Urine composition is highly variable (pH, osmolality and concentration) and influenced by certain medications and diet, therefore, an assessment of urine-sample characteristics using dipsticks (e.g. proteins, glucose, ketones, haemoglobin, nitrite, leucocytes and pH) can provide an easy and inexpensive quality-control measure to identify deviating samples. In addition, microbial presence (endogenous, pathological or caused by contamination during sample collection) should also be taken into consideration as it can influence not only EV quantitation, but also the normalisation of experimental data.

### Are your kidneys Ok? Detect early to protect kidney health [^1119s6nA]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Early identification of kidney disease can protect kidney health, prevent kidney disease progression and related complications, reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and decrease mortality. We must ask "Are your kidneys ok?" using serum creatinine to estimate kidney function and urine albumin to assess for kidney and endothelial damage. Evaluation for causes and risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) includes testing for diabetes and measurement of blood pressure and body mass index. This World Kidney Day we assert that case-finding in high-risk populations, or even population-level screening, can decrease the burden of kidney disease globally. Early-stage CKD is asymptomatic, and simple to test for, and recent paradigm shifting CKD treatments such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors dramatically improve outcomes and favor the cost-benefit analysis for screening or case-finding programs. Despite this, numerous barriers exist, including resource allocation, healthcare funding, healthcare infrastructure, and healthcare-professional and population awareness of kidney disease. Coordinated efforts by major kidney non-governmental organizations to prioritize the kidney health agenda for governments and aligning early detection efforts with other current programs will maximize efficiencies.

### Prevalence of coexisting diabetes and depression and the association of urinary albumin with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in affected individuals: a national population-based study [^114J5Fxm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Several mechanisms might explain the link between elevated urinary albumin levels and increased mortality in individuals with both diabetes and depression. First, higher urinary protein levels are a sign of endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis, both of which can lead to worse outcomes in this population. Additionally, oxidative stress — a common issue in both diabetes and depression — may be even more severe when these conditions coexist. This increased oxidative stress can exacerbate kidney damage, as reflected by higher urinary albumin levels, and further increase the risk of cardiovascular events. In addition, the combination of glucose abnormalities caused by diabetes and the negative emotional impact of depression can jointly lead to the deterioration of metabolic and cardiovascular functions, thereby increasing the risk of mortality. Furthermore, depression may contribute to poor medication adherence, resulting in inadequate glucose management, worsening kidney function, and the progression of diabetic nephropathy, which may be indicated by elevated levels of urinary albumin. These potential mechanisms underscore the complex interactions between glucose metabolism, renal function, and psychological factors, which collectively increase the long-term risk for this vulnerable population.

The results of this study have critical implications. First, for individuals with both diabetes and depression, in addition to controlling blood glucose and managing depression, greater attention should be given to monitoring urinary protein levels, with regular urine albumin checks serving as a key biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes. If an individual has no detectable urinary protein, this suggests that extensive medical diagnostics and follow-up may not be necessary. However, if an individual exhibits elevated urinary protein levels, this indicates a higher risk of adverse outcomes and necessitates more proactive and dynamic follow-up to reduce the occurrence of adverse events. Furthermore, elevated urinary protein levels suggest kidney dysfunction, necessitating intervention for impaired renal function alongside the treatment of diabetes and depression to improve the individual's overall prognosis.

Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which elevated urine albumin levels lead to increased mortality in individuals with both diabetes and depression. Longitudinal studies with diverse populations are required to confirm these results and discover potential causal relationships. Additionally, research into targeted interventions — such as intensified glycemic control, effective depression management, and strategies to protect kidney function — could be crucial in reducing mortality risk for this population.

### Transplantation of decellularized porcine kidney grafts repopulated with primary human cells demonstrates filtration function in pigs [^11443W6p]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidneys play an essential role in the regulation of water homeostasis and fluid composition, and they filter blood to produce urine. As kidney structural bioengineering was limited to the glomerulus, the readouts used to assess BEK functionality were accordingly centered on filtration, particularly with respect to protein and red blood cell exclusion, as both are known to increase in the urine with glomerular dysfunction or damage. Thus, traditional kidney readouts like electrolyte and glucose concentration were eschewed because reabsorption of these molecules are mediated predominantly by renal tubular epithelial cells, which were not incorporated in the BEKs tested in this study. Focusing on filtration function, we found that bi-culture BEKs produced urine characterized by significantly lower protein and hematocrit compared to HUVEC only grafts as indicated by in vitro normothermic perfusion testing. Furthermore, HUVEC only BEKs did not have any measurable evidence of filtration function, as indicated by similar hematocrit and protein levels in the urine and serum. Since the HUVEC-only control grafts were made with the same process as the bi-culture grafts minus the functional parenchymal cells filtration function in bi-culture grafts is attributed to the presence of differentiated GOCs/podocytes. The degree of filtration observed in this study, though not quite physiological, is attributed to the structural recapitulation of glomeruli to an extent. Future refinements to BEK seeding, culture, and podocyte differentiation are expected to increase the extent of glomerular recellularization and improve individual glomerular function, leading to an overall enhancement in BEK function.

### Novel urinary protein biomarkers predicting the development of microalbuminuria and renal function decline in type 1 diabetes [^113E3xn2]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Despite tremendous progress in treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes still live 15 years shorter, experience excess morbidity, and have medical costs over 10 times higher than the general population. Modification of traditional risk factors has made only limited impact on development of renal complications in these patients. Improved glycemic control reduces progression to early stages of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes even years later, but the risk of diabetic nephropathy is not completely abolished by improved glycemic control or lowering blood pressure. Whereas rates of end-stage renal disease have declined over recent years, after 30 years of diabetes duration, the cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease is 7.8% among patients with type 1 diabetes. Further, the presence of microvascular complications is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death in people with type 1 diabetes.

The development of renal complications and eventual end-stage renal disease in people with diabetes has been thought to follow a linear path involving the development of microalbuminuria, progressing to frank proteinuria. It was thought that renal function only declines once proteinuria is present and that regression of microalbuminuria indicates reversal of the disease progress. However, clinical trials have recently demonstrated that this dogma may be incorrect. First, renal function as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines before the development of proteinuria, demonstrating that there is an earlier phase of kidney damage that could be detected and targeted with interventions. Second, kidney damage can progress even when microalbuminuria has regressed. The identification of novel biomarkers for early renal disease is therefore a high priority.

Urine is an easily accessible biological matrix for which to identify new biomarkers. The urinary proteome is very complex, containing 1,000 of proteins and peptides that are derived from filtration/secretion/reabsorption processes within the kidney. Many of these proteins are sensitive to alterations in the kidney, and urinary proteomics provides a platform from which to simultaneously quantify hundreds of urinary proteins.

### Clinical presentation, risk factors and pathogens involved in bacteriuria of pregnant women attending antenatal clinic of 3 hospitals in a developing country: a cross sectional analytic study [^1133pA4A]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies conducted on bacteriuria during pregnancy in Cameroon where urine culture is expensive. More over dipstick screening tests routinely used in pregnancy are focused mainly on the presence of glucose and protein in urine rather than indicators of bacteriuria. This means that, bacteriuria especially when asymptomatic is not considered as an essential part of antenatal care by many clinicians. Therefore, nothing is known regarding the epidemiology of bacteriuria in pregnant women in Douala Cameroon. This study therefore aimed to determine the prevalence of bacteriuria, associated risk factors and pathogens involved in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic of 3 Hospitals in Douala.

### Rosuvastatin calcium [^11226SXe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of rosuvastatin tablets?

Rosuvastatin tablets may cause serious side effects, including:

Muscle pain, tenderness and weakness (myopathy). Muscle problems, including muscle breakdown, can be serious in some people and rarely cause kidney damage that can lead to death. Tell your doctor right away if:
you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially if you have a fever or feel more tired than usual, while you take rosuvastatin tablets.
you have muscle problems that do not go away even after your doctor has told you to stop taking rosuvastatin tablets. Your doctor may do further tests to diagnose the cause of your muscle problems.

Your chances of getting muscle problems are higher if you:

are taking certain other medicines while you take rosuvastatin tablets
are 65 years of age or older
have thyroid problems (hypothyroidism) that are not controlled
have kidney problems
are taking higher doses of rosuvastatin tablets
Liver problems. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver before you start taking rosuvastatin tablets and if you have symptoms of liver problems while you take rosuvastatin tablets. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms of liver problems:
feel unusually tired or weak
loss of appetite
upper belly pain
dark urine
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes
Protein and blood in the urine. Rosuvastatin tablets may cause you to have protein and blood in your urine. If you develop protein or blood in your urine, your doctor may decrease your dose of rosuvastatin tablets.
Increase in blood sugar (glucose) levels. Rosuvastatin tablets may cause an increase in your blood sugar levels.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

### Dietary proteins contribute little to glucose production, even under optimal gluconeogenic conditions in healthy humans [^115afsZw]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Protocol.

Soon after their arrival at the hospital, a venous catheter was inserted into both forearms of the subjects. After the collection of a baseline blood sample, a primed dose (22 µmol · kg −1) and a constant infusion of [6,6–2 H 2]-glucose (0.22 µmol · kg −1 · min −1) were started through the second catheter. Ninety minutes after starting the infusion and collection of a second baseline blood sample, the subjects were placed under a canopy for 30 min to measure fasting gas exchanges. At the end of this 30-min period, blood, urine, and expired gas were sampled, and the subjects were given the test meal, after which they were not allowed any other foods until the end of the experiment, although they were given 100 mL water every hour. During the 8 h following meal ingestion, blood and urine samples were collected every 30 min and 2 h, respectively. Expired air was collected every 30 min, and gas exchanges were measured over discontinuous periods of 30 min. After total blood centrifugation, aliquots of serum or plasma were collected and stored at −20 or −80°C (for hormones) until analysis. After measuring the volume of urine excreted, urine samples were either preserved by adding thymol and paraffin and stored at 4 or −20°C until analysis.

### Ascorbic acid and glucose can cause significant interference on quantitative measurement of biochemistry analytes in urine [^1118RPYX]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Preanalytical errors due to interferences can lead to inaccurate results, necessitating an understanding of potential interferences for each test. This study explores the impact of elevated concentrations of ascorbic acid and glucose on urine analysis, a pivotal diagnostic tool.

Methods

Conducted at the Clinical Institute of Chemistry, KBC Sestre milosrdnice, the research utilized a 24-hour urine sample. Parameters assessed included total proteins, albumin, amylase, sodium, potassium, chlorides, calcium, phosphates, magnesium, creatinine, urea, and uric acid. Various concentrations of added interferents were prepared for duplicate measurements using statistical analysis in Microsoft Excel.

Results

No statistically significant interferences were found in albumin, amylase, sodium, potassium, or phosphate concentrations. However, ascorbic acid interfered with chloride, calcium, and magnesium determinations. Conversely, elevated glucose affected total protein, calcium, magnesium, creatinine, urea, and uric acid determinations. Interference of ascorbic acid with chloride and interference of glucose with total proteins and uric acid displayed a linear relationship.

Conclusions

Results suggest cautious analysis interpretation from certain parameters in patients with elevated glucose and/or ascorbic acid in urine. Whereas ascorbic acid interference may go unnoticed due to its infrequent measurement, routine determination of glucose in urine is crucial, especially for diabetes patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of tyrosinemia type I: a US and Canadian consensus group review and recommendations [^115Wr7x7]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Renal disease in HT-1

A Fanconi-syndrome-type tubular disorder, characterized by aminoaciduria, glucosuria, phosphaturia, and/or RTA, is typical in untreated HT-1. Onset and severity, however, are variable, with the majority of patients being symptomatic by 6 months of age. Patients in whom renal disease is the predominant presenting feature have been reported. These patients typically demonstrate co-morbid liver involvement of varying severity. Progressive renal disease, not just Fanconi renal syndrome, is a near constant in untreated HT-1. Aside from hypophosphatemic rickets and hypertension, which can occur early in the disease process, longer-term complications include glomerulosclerosis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic renal failure. Imaging may show abnormal renal architecture with dilated tubules, echogenicity, enlarged kidneys, cysts, and nephrocalcinosis. The signal for the characteristic apoptosis of renal epithelial cells appears to be FAA, whereas SA appears responsible for the renal tubular damage.

At the time of diagnosis of HT-1, particularly if not in the first few weeks following positive NBS, full investigation of renal involvement should be initiated (Table 3). This should include the following:
Blood: blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, electrolytes including bicarbonate for assessment of RTA, calcium, and phosphate
Urine: glucose, amino acids, calcium, phosphate, Ca:creatinine ratio, tubular reabsorption of phosphate, total protein and albumin
Ultrasound of kidneys
Bone X-ray (wrist, chest, other) and densitometry for evidence of rachitic changes from hypophosphatemia

Standard therapeutic approaches to HT-1 with NTBC and dietary restriction of phenylalanine/tyrosine are associated with reversal (or prevention) of the tubulopathy in nearly all cases within weeks. To assess the ongoing presence of or recovery from RTA and tubulopathy, urine can be periodically analyzed for amino acids, glucose, phosphate (for tubular reabsorption of phosphate), excretion of protein and albumin or β2-microglobulin, and Ca/Cr ratios compared to plasma. The occurrence of longer-term renal complications, evidenced by elevation of creatinine, the presence of hypertension, and a requirement for increased daily water intake for maintenance of hydration status, is due to irreversible organ damage, which correlates with the length of time of the ongoing presence of SA in blood/urine. Therefore, continuation of NTBC treatment is crucial.

### Metabolic communication by SGLT2 inhibition [^111cJUUx]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Net Reduction of Uremic Toxin Metabolites by SGLT2i Is Independent of SGLT2

We then examined whether the reduced metabolites are independent of the presence of the SGLT2 protein, and whether these effects remain over a longer period. To distinguish the pure SGLT2 effect from an off-target effect, and in the absence of hyperglycemic confounders, we used the SGLT2 KO mouse model (Sglt2 KO). This mouse has a deletion of the Slc5a2 gene in exons 1 through 5, rendering the SGLT2 protein nonfunctional. We treated both Sglt2 KO and WT mice with SGLT2i (dapagliflozin) for 16 weeks on a normal diet, analyzed plasma and urine, and performed plasma targeted analysis using the panel of retained metabolites (Figure 5 A). Sglt2 KO mice had lower blood glucose, higher glucose excretion, and higher food intake (Figure 5 B and). In the KO mice, SGLT2i did not affect any of these measures. We calculated plasma:urine ratios (normalized to creatinine) to understand overall body handling in response to SGLT2i. The ratios for many metabolites were similarly changed in Sglt2 KO versus WT mice as they were by dapagliflozin versus vehicle treatment of WT mice (Figure 5 C left panel), suggesting consequences of SGLT2 inhibition. Among others, this included a decline in the ratio for glucose, reflecting an increase in urine glucose elimination. As expected, absence of SGLT2 blocked the effect of dapagliflozin on glucose excretion (Figure 5 C right panel). On the other hand, dapagliflozin significantly changed the ratio for a number of metabolites in Sglt2 KO mice, indicating an off-target effect (Figure 5 D and). Ranking changes in the plasma:urine ratios revealed that dapagliflozin reduced the ratios in Sglt2 KO mice for multiple aromatic acid metabolites, including cresols and hippurates, followed by tryptophan metabolites. The plasma-level analysis identified 5 metabolites significantly changed by SGLT2i in the Sglt2 KO environment, including PCL sulfate and a modified hippuric acid (Figure 5 E and 5 F). This experiment suggests that SGLT2i treatment has off-target effects, including on cresols, hippurates, and tryptophan metabolites.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116DbDmJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated renal dysfunction with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has variable onset; in adults, renal dysfunction may occur weeks to months after initiating therapy, hypophosphatemia appears at a median of 18 months, glucosuria may occur after 1 year of therapy, and abnormal urine protein/osmolality ratio may be an early indicator. In adults, approximately 2% experience increased serum creatinine levels and approximately 0.5% experience severe renal complications. Risk may increase in children with the following characteristics: aged > 6 years, Black race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and advanced HIV infection. Monitor urine protein, urine glucose, and serum creatinine at 3- to 6-month intervals. Some Panel members routinely monitor serum phosphate levels in patients who are taking TDF. If TDF is the likely cause, consider using an alternative ARV drug. TAF has significantly less renal toxicity than TDF. Changing from TDF to TAF may improve renal function and has been shown to be safe.

### Urine recirculation prolongs normothermic kidney perfusion via more optimal metabolic homeostasis-a proteomics study [^116KriCZ]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Carbonic anhydrase (CA1) may also contribute to an increased performance of kidneys perfused with urine recirculation (URC), and was found to be downregulated in kidneys with UR. We were able to maintain physiological pH values throughout the perfusion period only in kidneys perfused with URC. In contrast, urine replacement, caused either acidosis or alkalosis of the perfusate in our experiments. This could be due to a lack of presence or activity of CA1. 22, 34, 35, 36 The most important function of this enzyme is to maintain the acid–base balance in human blood and tissue. In addition, band 3 anion transport protein SLC4A1 was also significantly upregulated over time in kidneys perfused with URC (Figures 3, 5, 6). This protein is crucial to maintain the correct acid levels in the human body, mediated by the chloride–bicarbonate exchange in the kidney, and it is required for the normal acidification of the urine. 22, 34, 35

The profile of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis could also help to explain the difficulty to interpret lactate levels in kidney NMP, which is an easy task in liver NMP. In humans, lactate metabolism plays a major role in the native kidney and the renal cortex appears to be the most important lactate‐consuming organ after the liver. 18 Bartlett et al showed years ago that renal dysfunction impacts lactate and glucose metabolism. It is most likely that lactate levels are related to active glucose metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis in the kidney. Also, there seems to be a cortico‐medullary glucose‐lactate recycling system: the medulla consumes glucose by active glycolysis and generates lactate. The cortex has the ability to take up the lactate released by the medulla and uses it for oxidation and gluconeogenesis. 19 A publication by Hui et al demonstrated that glucose is essential in feeding the Krebs‐cycle via circulating lactate. 37 In their experimental setting in mice they detected strongly labeled lactate in the kidney after infusion of 13 C‐labeled glucose, although intermediates of the Krebs cycle were more labeled after lactate infusion. An explanation for this pattern in the kidney is the heterogeneity of kidney cells; the presence of glycolytic cells producing lactate from glucose and oxidative cells using lactate to make Krebs cycle intermediates. 37

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine availability and renal/hepatitis B considerations — TDF/3TC is available as a coformulated generic drug and is available in an FDC with DOR 100 mg. Renal function, urine glucose, and urine protein should be assessed before initiating treatment with TDF and periodically during treatment; in people with preexisting renal insufficiency (CrCl < 60 mL/min), use of TDF generally should be avoided, and if TDF is used, a dose adjustment is required if the person's CrCl falls below 50 mL/min. TDF, FTC, and 3TC are active against HBV, and in people with HBV/HIV coinfection, TDF/FTC or TDF/3TC may be used as the NRTI pair because these drugs have activity against both viruses.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112VFwDP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — diabetic kidney disease (DKD) terminology and clinical characterization — For consistency with chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification, the term DKD is proposed for a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes, and the term "diabetic nephropathy" should be replaced by DKD; the term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes. DKD is now defined, in part, by increased urinary albumin excretion and is divided into microalbuminuria, a modest elevation associated with stable kidney function but a greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure, and macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation associated with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased systemic blood pressure, and a high risk of kidney failure. These generalizations do not apply in all cases because people with normal urinary albumin excretion may have advanced DKD, whereas those with microalbuminuria may have either substantial or no pathological evidence of kidney damage; because diabetes is highly prevalent, some individuals with diabetes may have other types of CKD, although in most cases, clinical measures may be used to diagnose DKD.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^111VtuMC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Residual kidney function in peritoneal dialysis (PD) — "The amount of kidney function that continues to remove waste products and the remaining urine volume should be known for all individuals doing PD. Management should focus on preserving this as long as possible". The work group suggests residual kidney function "be measured as the average of the 24-hour urinary urea and creatinine clearances", with tracking of "urine volume in milliliters per 24 hours" if full measurement is not feasible, and they recommend evaluating it "as practical under individual circumstances because there is no evidence for the ideal frequency of evaluation". For preservation, "Several clinical trials support the recommendations for the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and neutral-pH low glucose degradation product PD solutions", and "other recommendations such as the use of volume diuretics and icodextrin as needed to maintain euvolemia while avoiding volume depletion" are noted albeit with "evidence that is more limited". Modality choice "(CAPD vs APD) should be based on individual choice because there is no consistent evidence that one preserves residual kidney function better than the other", aminoglycosides — "it is advisable to limit their use to less than 3 weeks to prevent ototoxicity", and "there are no studies that have shown an association of contrast administration with a sustained decrease in residual kidney function in people receiving PD". Clinical utility is emphasized because residual kidney function has been associated with "longer survival; better control of volume and BP, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia; lower probability of protein-energy wasting, inflammation, and peritonitis; and increased clearance of middle molecules and protein-bound uremic solutes", and recognizing it "allows for a potential decrease in the PD prescription, which would likely mean less treatment burden for the person on PD". Implementation challenges include dependence on collecting "a 24-hour urine sample" and that "neutral-pH low glucose degradation product PD solutions are not commercially available and use of icodextrin is restricted by some dialysis provider organizations in the United States".

Methods

Urine samples

Urine samples were collected during the morning (not first-void) from patients with biopsy ISUP Grades 1, 2 and 3 (done by magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion using the Koelis platform) scheduled for radical prostatectomy within 1 week. The two cohorts used in the study (70 samples for NGS analysis and 60 samples for RT-qPCR analysis) were collected sequentially. The clinical characteristics of both cohorts are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. The pH of the urine samples and the presence of leucocytes, nitrites, protein, glucose, ketones and blood in urine were analysed with a Combur-Test strip in an Urysys 1100 urine analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) to get additional information about the health status of the patients (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The collection of urine samples was approved by the Norwegian Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the participants gave informed written consent.

### Monitoring glycemic control: the importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose [^113DERQS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Several methods, each with differing utility and limitations, exist for monitoring glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the standard measure of long-term glycemic control, and HbA1c levels are strongly associated with complications of diabetes. However, HbA1c does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Urine glucose testing is noninvasive and inexpensive, but it is dependent on the patient's individual renal threshold and can only detect glucose concentrations above this threshold. As such, urine testing cannot be recommended for diabetes management that aims for near-normoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) complements HbA1c by providing real-time blood glucose data. It is an educational tool for both patients and their healthcare providers to understand the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on day-to-day glycemic control. However, guidelines from various international diabetes organizations vary in their level of specificity regarding the frequency and timing of self-monitoring. SMBG should be implemented for all patients as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes specific instruction on how, when, and why to test.

### Diabetic nephropathy [^112vS6j4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

Table 2
Chronic kidney disease stages

*Renal damage is defined by abnormalities in the urine and blood tests, imaging exams or in pathology

GFR = glomerular filtration rate

Serum creatinine concentration should not be used as an isolated index for the evaluation of renal function, since its measure is affected by other factors besides GFR itself, such as tubular secretion, extrarenal generation and protein ingestion.

Special Situations

Patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria, after the confirmation of diagnosis (2 measurements), should undergo a complete evaluation concerning differential diagnosis and assessment of renal function. DN is associated with several other conditions that need to be addressed making the management of these patients very complex. However this is not within the scope of the present manuscript and a detailed approach could be found in a recent review.

Diabetic patients can have other kidney diseases. The differential diagnosis is usually based on the history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation and kidney imaging. Renal biopsy has only been recommended in special situations. In the presence of micro or microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy in a patient with long term DM (e.g. > 10 years) the assumption that DM is causing the renal disease is generally correct. Conversely, in diabetic patients with type 2 DM with a fast increment in albuminuria and in patients with type 1 DM where macroalbuminuria develop in the absence of diabetic retinopathy a differential diagnosis should be carried out. However, in type 2 diabetic patients the time of DM onset is usually unknown and retinopathy could be absent in a significant proportion (28%) of patients with albuminuria. In summary, absent retinopathy, short duration of DM and faster decline in GFR and/or albuminuria increment are indications to suspect of nondiabetic renal disease. If after a non-invasive evaluation the diagnosis is still unclear, a kidney biopsy should be discussed. In type 2 DM the prevalence of nondiabetic renal disease could vary from 12 to 38%. All the kidney biopsy data are derived from retrospective studies. The differences in the prevalence of non-diabetic lesion observed in the studies probably reflect different criteria used to indicate renal biopsies. In one study, subjects with type 2 DM, gross proteinuria (> 1 g) without retinopathy, and hematuria and no retinopathy, 19% of patients with confirmed DN had another glomerulopathy associated. In this study, patients without diabetic glomerulosclerosis had a better prognosis than those with diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Another aspect that needs to be addressed is that it is not clear if there is additional benefit of detecting other nephropathies in the management of these patients.

### Beyond SGLT2: proximal tubule transporters as potential drug targets for chronic kidney disease [^115jhDva]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 INHIBITION

Inhibition of the renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) has been a major success story and exemplifies the principle of targeting a proximal tubule transport protein to address a major metabolic disease with benefits for kidney and the cardiovascular system. Multiple recent reviews have covered underlying mechanisms and clinical use of SGLT2 inhibitors. Nevertheless, this review will briefly highlight some of the major mechanisms of this class of drugs illustrating how studying basic physiologic principles of kidney function can lead to the development of new and powerful drugs.

About 180 g of glucose are daily filtered by the glomeruli but final urine is usually devoid of glucose except during postpranial periods or in individuals with (poorly controlled) diabetes. Glucose is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule by members of the SLC2 and SLC5 families of glucose transporters (Fig. 1). The threshold for the reabsorption of glucose is around 180–200 mg/dL (approx. 10 mmol/L) corresponding to the plasma glucose concentration above which glucose can be found in urine. In the early proximal tubule, glucose is taken up from urine by the luminally located low affinity, high capacity Na + -driven glucose transporter SGLT2 (SLC5A2), while in the late proximal tubule the remaining glucose is reabsorbed by the high affinity, low capacity Na + -dependent glucose transporter SGLT1 (SLC5A1). It has been estimated that under normal conditions, SGLT2 reabsorbs up to 97% of filtered glucose, but if SGLT2 is absent or blocked, SGLT1 can reabsorb up to 80 g of glucose per day. In both segments, glucose reabsorption is completed by the release of glucose from proximal tubule cells into blood by the basolateral GLUT2 (SLC2A2) uniporter that allows for efflux of glucose along its concentration gradient. Since SGLT2 transporters have the capacity to accumulate very high intracellular glucose concentrations, this gradient is direct from intracellular to extracellular (blood side). The importance of these transporters is highlighted in individuals with loss of function variants in the SLC5A2 or SLC2A2 genes causing benign renal glucosuria and Fanconi–Bickel syndrome. Loss-of-function variants in SLC5A1 cause intestinal glucose-galactose malabsorption, a severe condition with massive diarrhoea and dehydration upon ingestion of glucose- or galactose-containing carbohydrates. The benign phenotype of patients with SLC5A2 variants has contributed to the development of SGLT2-specific inhibitors suggesting a potential good safety profile of such drugs, while inhibition of SGLT1 is expected to cause intestinal problems.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112bBHEU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

KDOQI — microalbuminuria and GFR for DKD screening states that microalbuminuria and estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) "satisfy criteria for a screening test for DKD. (Moderate)". Microalbuminuria is described as "an independent risk factor for the development of CKD… and GFR loss… and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality", with point prevalence varying "from 7% to 22% in type 1… and from 6.5% to 42% in type 2 diabetes", and annual incidence "of 1% to 2%… reported in type 2… and possibly type 1 diabetes". For testing, "the Work Group recommends estimating the ACR [albumin-to-creatinine ratio] in a spot urine sample (preferably the first morning void)", noting that "The sensitivity and specificity of ACR estimates are greater than 85% compared with timed urine collections", and that urinary albumin excretion has "an intraindividual CV of approximately 40%". Estimates of urine albumin excretion are also reported as "available, relatively inexpensive, and easy to perform".

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO hepatitis C in chronic kidney disease — posttransplant management and antiviral therapy indicates that all conventional current maintenance immunosuppressive regimens can be considered for use in HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients more than 6 months after transplantation have their liver disease evaluated at least annually. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients be screened for the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation and be tested at least every 3 to 6 months for proteinuria. It is suggested that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria (either urine protein/creatinine ratio > 1 or 24-hour urine protein greater than 1 g on 2 or more occasions) have an allograft biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy included in the analysis. For HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients in whom the benefits of antiviral treatment clearly outweigh the risks, monotherapy with standard IFN is suggested, and because of the risk of rejection, kidney transplant recipients with HCV-associated glomerulopathy not receive IFN-based therapy unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks of treatment. After transplantation, HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients should be monitored for the development of liver disease, hyperglycemia, and proteinuria.

Whether podocyte injury and podocyturia occur at the very early stages of glucose intolerance, namely during the prediabetic stage, is a topic of speculation; however, this hypothesis has not yet been tested in clinical studies. In this study, we compared the mRNA levels of podocyte-specific proteins of subjects with diabetes, prediabetes and in healthy individuals to verify whether the excretion of podocytes in urine varies throughout the different stages of DN and is already increased in early stages of glucose intolerance.

### Proteinuria in diabetes: bystander or pathway to cardiorenal disease? [^1126rKaY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The development of albuminuria in diabetics is closely associated with an enhanced risk of renal and cardiovascular disease. However, the role of albuminuria in the pathogenesis of these clinical conditions remains controversial. Whether albuminuria is simply a biomarker or qualifies as a surrogate endpoint for cardiorenal disease has wide-ranging implications from the monitoring and treatment of patients to the design of clinical trials and drug development. We critically review available data to determine whether the association between albuminuria and cardiorenal disease is causative. Current evidence suggests the significance of albuminuria depends on its severity (degree or level) and on the specific clinical outcome under consideration. For diabetic kidney disease, there is convincing epidemiologic and experimental evidence to assign clinical albuminuria status as a surrogate endpoint, but for lower levels of albuminuria (microalbuminuria and normoalbuminuria), the evidence is inconclusive or not available. Albuminuria of any degree is unlikely to be causally related to diabetic cardiovascular disease, but its onset might be useful to identify those subjects at cardiovascular risk and to detect and treat other modifiable risk factors.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114idCUp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in diabetes mellitus [^114qXoWY]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

The role of the kidney in glucose reabsorption

The kidneys have a major role in glucose regulation in humans; under normal circumstances, over 99% of the glucose filtered by the glomeruli is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, such that virtually no glucose is excreted in the urine. Renal glucose reabsorption is achieved through the action of the SGLT family of protein transporters, primarily SGLT1 and SGLT2. These proteins transport glucose across the membranes of the proximal tubule epithelial cell in an active process that involves sodium transport, facilitated by the sodium gradient between the tubule and the cell, which supports secondary active co-transport of glucose. Glucose then passively diffuses into the intercellular space mainly via the GLUT2 (glucose transporter 2), a member of the GLUT family of proteins.

In individuals without T2DM, SGLT2 is responsible for the majority (80–90%) of renal glucose reabsorption. When the concentration of glucose in plasma exceeds that which can be reabsorbed via the SGLT proteins, the excessive amount of glucose is excreted in the urine. Furthermore, data from animal models of diabetes and from preclinical human models suggest that the hyperglycemic state in T2DM is associated with significantly increased expression of SGLT2 and GLUT2 proteins, together with an increased level of renal glucose reabsorption. Therefore, SGLT2 is a novel therapeutic target for antidiabetic therapy.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 HBV Infection

It is recommended that all individuals be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating TRUVADA. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients infected with HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are infected with HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. HBV-uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination.

5.2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)].

It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all individuals prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA®, it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of TRUVADA, and periodically during TRUVADA therapy.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

In the presence of high serum osmolality (≥ 295 mOsmol/L), urine osmolality should reach approximately 600 mOsmol/L, the urine osmolality/plasma osmolality ratio should be ≥ 2, and urine dipstick should be negative for glucose.

### Products for monitoring glucose levels in the human body with noninvasive optical, noninvasive fluid sampling, or minimally invasive technologies [^117W9qBW]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Technically, urine test strips fall under the definition of a NIFS-GM device. These test strips are ineffective in estimating real-time blood glucose concentrations and are rarely used for making treatment decisions. Urine glucose testing is characterized by the following three characteristics:

(1) a long and unpredictable lag time between dynamic blood glucose concentrations and urine glucose concentrations,
(2) a high blood glucose concentration threshold for urine glucose excretion, below which glucose does not appear in the urine, and
(3) a wide person-to-person variability in this blood glucose threshold concentration where glucose spills into the urine.

For NIFS-GM technologies designed to measure glucose in samples of sweat, saliva, and tears, the actual analytical measurements might be accurate; however, the correlation is poor for glucose levels in these fluids compared to those in blood, and this correlation might be influenced by regionalized physiological stressors or stimuli. Such correlations have proven difficult to control, thereby raising the possibility that physiology will render such an approach to be impractical for commercialization.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^1143f6gc]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Urine dipstick tests are widely used in routine medical care to diagnose kidney and urinary tract and metabolic diseases. Several environmental factors are known to affect the test results, whereas the effects of genetic diversity are largely unknown. We tested 32.5 million sequence variants for association with urinary biomarkers in a set of 150 274 Icelanders with urine dipstick measurements. We detected 20 association signals, of which 14 are novel, associating with at least one of five clinical entities defined by the urine dipstick: glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria, hematuria and urine pH. These include three independent glucosuria variants at SLC5A2, the gene encoding the sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT2), a protein targeted pharmacologically to increase urinary glucose excretion in the treatment of diabetes. Two variants associating with proteinuria are in LRP2 and CUBN, encoding the co-transporters megalin and cubilin, respectively, that mediate proximal tubule protein uptake. One of the hematuria-associated variants is a rare, previously unreported 2.5 kb exonic deletion in COL4A3. Of the four signals associated with urine pH, we note that the pH-increasing alleles of two variants (POU2AF1, WDR72) associate significantly with increased risk of kidney stones. Our results reveal that genetic factors affect variability in urinary biomarkers, in both a disease dependent and independent context.

Stroke causes death and disability in adults worldwide, 1, 2, 3 and identifying and managing risk factors for stroke are essential and urgent for disease prevention. Urine protein dipstick testing is a common tool used to screen for proteinuria, which is an indicator of chronic kidney disease. 4 Several studies have suggested that proteinuria is linked to an increase in stroke events. 5, 6, 7 However, proteinuria is a changeable exposure, which may increase or decrease at different stages of monitoring 8 and, therefore, is termed "time dependent". 9 Time‐dependent exposure exerts its short‐term effects on outcomes, 9 which is defined as the effect of the interval between updates of exposure. Previous studies have generally examined urine protein at baseline or assessed the long‐term effect of proteinuria on stroke. Few studies, however, have investigated time‐dependent proteinuria and its relationship with stroke. Thus, the impact of time‐dependent proteinuria on stroke risk remains unclear.

Prediabetes is an intermediated state between normal glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus, which includes impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. 10 The American Diabetes Association defines prediabetes as a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L. 11 Researchers have found that individuals with prediabetes demonstrated a high risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease such as stroke. 12, 13 It has been established that diabetes mellitus is also an independent risk factor for stroke. 13 Studies have demonstrated that urine protein can be detected in patients with diabetes mellitus. 14 The association between time‐dependent proteinuria and stroke in individuals with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus needs to be examined. Previous studies have reported that proteinuria has a long‐term effect on stroke incidence in the populations with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus. 15 However, the relationship between time‐dependent proteinuria and stroke risk has not been investigated in larger cohorts with diverse glucose levels.

Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the effect of proteinuria, especially the effect of time‐dependent proteinuria, on subsequent stroke among a large cohort of the Chinese population with different glucose levels.

### Obstetric nephrology: renal hemodynamic and metabolic physiology in normal pregnancy [^115zVBjo]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Glomerular hyperfiltration, altered tubular function, and shifts in electrolyte-fluid balance are among the hallmark renal physiologic changes that characterize a healthy pregnancy. These adjustments are not only critical to maternal and fetal well being, but also provide the clinical context for identifying gestational aberrations in renal function and electrolyte composition. Systemic vasodilation characterizes early gestation and produces increments in renal plasma flow and GFR, the latter of which is maintained into the postpartum period. In addition, renal tubular changes allow for the accumulation of nutrients and electrolytes necessary for fetal growth such that wasting of proteins, glucose, and amino acids in urine is limited in pregnancy and total body stores of electrolytes increase throughout gestation. Substantial insight into the mechanisms underlying these complex adjustments can be gleaned from the available animal and human literature, but our understanding in many areas remains incomplete. This article reviews the available literature on renal adaptation to normal pregnancy, including renal function, tubular function, and electrolyte-fluid balance, along with the clinical ramifications of these adjustments, the limitations of the existing literature, and suggestions for future studies.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1153AzpS]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

TAF/FTC — other factors and considerations: TAF/FTC is available in fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) with bictegravir (BIC), DRV/c, EVG/c, and rilpivirine (RPV), allowing the regimens to be administered as a single pill taken once daily. TAF-containing regimens are approved for people with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min; renal function, urine glucose, and urine protein should be assessed before initiating treatment with TAF and repeated periodically during treatment, and TAF/FTC can be used without dosage adjustment in people with HIV who require hemodialysis. Both TAF and FTC are active against HBV, and in people with HIV/HBV coinfection, TAF/FTC may be used as the NRTI pair in an ARV regimen because these drugs have activity against both viruses. TAF is recommended as a preferred drug in pregnancy because of reassuring data from a multinational trial and the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry showing no evidence of teratogenicity.

Albuminuria as a surrogate marker — KDOQI notes that relationships between glomerular structural lesions and the presence or absence of microalbuminuria in diabetes are not straightforward, intrapatient variability in albuminuria measurements is large with controversy about standardization, and therefore the evidence for using albuminuria as a surrogate marker for clinical outcomes was not sufficiently strong to merit a guideline statement.

### Sodium-glucose transport: role in diabetes mellitus and potential clinical implications [^116XYM45]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Current options for glycemic control are less than optimal in terms of efficacy and to reduce complications in the diabetic population. Selective inhibition of SGLT2 in the proximal tubule increases urinary glucose excretion thereby reducing plasma glucose levels, which may present a novel therapeutic approach.

Recent Findings

SGLT2 inhibitors enhance glucose excretion and improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the absence of clinically relevant hypoglycemia or sustained changes in volume status or glomerular filtration rate. This is associated with lowering of body weight and may reduce systolic blood pressure. The increased glucosuria appears to increase the risk of genital infections but may not increase the risk of urinary tract infections.

Summary

The ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce plasma glucose without inducing increased insulin secretion, clinically relevant hypoglycemia, or weight gain constitutes a major advance. The ability to increase glucose excretion provides a powerful means to treat caloric excess conditions. Important questions remain to be resolved and more clinical research is needed on the long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibition. Potential extrarenal effects need to be explored in order to determine the safety of these compounds. It also remains to be determined whether these drugs lower the toxicity of glucose directly on renal cells, independent of hyperglycemia, which may slow or prevent the progressive nature of diabetic nephropathy.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1123tDu7]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) nephrotoxicity monitoring in pediatric HIV care includes urine-based assessment; measuring urine albumin and urine protein and calculating the ratio of urine albumin to urine protein can be helpful in identifying the non-albumin proteinuria seen in TDF-associated nephrotoxicity. Although these more complex and expensive tests may be used in research settings, in clinical practice, using a renal dipstick to identify normoglycemic glycosuria and proteinuria is the easiest way to detect renal damage.

Main text

The role of the kidneys in glucose homeostasis

The kidneys play a vital role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through glucose filtration, reabsorption, consumption, and generation. Glucose is freely filtered at the glomerulus, and in a healthy individual, all of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed. Glucose reabsorption from the tubular filtrate occurs by secondary active transport by sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLT) with 90% of the filtered glucose absorbed by SGLT2 in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule and 10% reabsorbed by SGLT1 in the latter parts of the proximal tubule. The maximum rate of tubular absorption of glucose is 375 mg/min, threefold higher than the glucose filtration rate of about 125 mg/min. However, this threshold varies between the nephrons, and glucose appears in the urine as the plasma level rises above 200 mg/dL. In kidney disease, a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduces the filtered glucose load. In contrast, the loss of functioning nephrons reduces the capacity for reabsorption. The net effect on the kidneys' glucose threshold can be quite variable in people with kidney disease. In addition to the excretion of glucose, the kidneys also consume ~ 10% of the plasma glucose as an energy source for its metabolic functions. The kidneys also contribute to about 20–25% of the circulating blood glucose in the fasting state by gluconeogenesis. The kidneys are also responsible for metabolizing insulin and clearing many glucose-lowering medications. The net effect of this interplay between kidneys, glucose metabolism, and medication clearance can be highly variable in individual patients with a propensity for both hyperglycemia due to reduced excretion and reduced consumption and fasting hypoglycemia due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and prolonged half-life of glucose-lowering medications.

Indirect markers of average glycemia

The indirect markers of glycemia provide an assessment of the average glucose levels over the preceding three months (hemoglobin A1C), 2 weeks (fructosamine and glycated albumin), and 1–2 weeks (1,5 anhydroglucitol). In the following sections, we discuss the biological rationale for using each marker and special considerations in patients with CKD, which might affect the markers' diagnostic validity (association with average glucose levels) and predictive validity (association with long-term complications of diabetes).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to screening for diabetic nephropathy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor urinary albumin (such as spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio) and eGFR 1–4 times per year in patients with established diabetic kidney disease, depending on the stage of the disease.

### Differential expression of coagulation pathway-related proteins in diabetic urine exosomes [^114nZzBd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies have shown that cholesterol plays a crucial role in determining cell membrane properties and function, and the accumulation of cholesterol in pancreatic β cells can lead to cell dysfunction. High levels of TG and LDL and low levels of HDL are associated with insulin resistance and are independent factors in insulin development. Elevated blood glucose occurs when the function of pancreatic β cells in the body to increase insulin release fails to compensate for the degree of insulin resistance. In vitro experiments have shown that HDL increases skeletal muscle glucose uptake and stimulates pancreatic β cells to synthesize and secrete insulin. Hypertension can aggravate insulin resistance, thus exacerbating the occurrence and development of diabetes. In this study, we found a strong positive correlation between urine exosome F2 and TG concentration in blood through exploration. F2 and TG concentrations are increased in diabetic patients, which may be one of the reasons why diabetic patients are more likely to be complicated with vascular lesions. In addition, we found that the F2 protein concentration was not associated with blood HDL-C in the healthy controls but was strongly negatively associated with blood HDL-C in the diabetes mellitus group. This correlation gives us a guess about the F2 protein. With the disorder of glucose metabolism in the human body, the concentration of F2 protein increases, which will affect the expression of HDL-C. Low levels of HDL-C cause insulin resistance, which in turn contributes to the development and progression of diabetes mellitus. The rise in blood sugar and insulin disorder further lead to abnormal changes in blood lipids. Of course, at present, this is just our guess, and the specific reason needs to be further studied in the molecular mechanism.

This study is the first to report the expression of coagulation-related proteins in urine exosomes of diabetic patients. In ROC curve analysis, we found that urine exosome protein F2 has good diagnostic ability and could be a potential biomarker for monitoring diabetic changes. Early detection of individuals at risk of developing diabetes mellitus may benefit for the implementation of preventive treatment. Urine samples have unique advantages in disease screening. Urine exosomes can meet the need for novel markers of diabetes mellitus and can be used for noninvasive, rapid and simple outcome determination.

The biomarker found in this study needs to be further evaluated and verified by many samples before being used in clinical practice. In the future, this study will be applied to the clinical monitoring of diabetes mellitus and could benefit a large population.

### Prediabetes is associated with proteinuria development but not with glomerular filtration rate decline: a longitudinal observational study [^116BF48F]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diabetes is recognized as the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, the association of prediabetes with CKD remains unclear, in particular, the independent effect of prediabetes on proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has not been evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the associations of prediabetes with the proteinuria development and with eGFR decline separately in the Japanese general population without CKD.

Methods

Participants who underwent health check-ups in 2014 and had adequate data after 2 years were retrospectively analysed. A total of 405,487 participants without CKD (eGFR, ≥ 60 mL min -1 1.73 m -2, with negative or trace urinary protein) at baseline were categorized according to fasting plasma glucose as having diabetes (≥ 126 mg/dl [7.0 mmol/l]), prediabetes (100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) or normal glucose level (˂100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyse the effects of prediabetes (vs. normal glucose level) on the proteinuria development (urinary protein of ≥ 1+) and eGFR decline (˂60 mL min -1 1.73 m -2) after 2 years.

Results

After 2 years, 7037 participants (1.7%) developed proteinuria alone, 19,015 (4.7%) presented eGFR decline alone and 636 (0.2%) showed both proteinuria and eGFR decline. Compared to normal glucose level and adjusting for prognostic factors, prediabetes was independently associated with the proteinuria development (odds ratio [OR] 1.233; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.170–1.301], whereas prediabetes was not associated with eGFR decline (OR 0.981; 95% CI 0.947–1.017).

Conclusions

Prediabetes is associated with the proteinuria development but not with eGFR decline in the general population.

### Nomogram for customized recurrence prediction in primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer based on routine blood and urine parameters [^1175TEZN]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the routine blood and urine parameters in predicating the recurrence of primary NMIBC. Specifically, higher age, blood platelet count, urinary leucocyte counts and lower urinary mucus filament showed significant associations with rapid NMIBC recurrence. Furthermore, we established a nomogram model, which comprised the parameters above and performed well in the customized prediction of NMIBC recurrence at 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month, hypothesized that its predictive value would assist doctors in identifying high-risk NMIBC patients and providing suitable follow-up alternatives.

The current gold standards for BC follow-up are urine cytology and cystoscopy with biopsy. However, cystoscopy is intrusive, expensive, has an accuracy rate of 85–90%, and has a risk of urinary tract infection, hematuria, and inadequate adherence to care guidelines. Additionally, it can be challenging to schedule repeated postoperative cystoscopic follow-ups for patients with NMIBC.

An extensive effort has been made in recent years to find biomarkers in blood and urine that can be used to diagnose BC and predict how well patients will respond to treatment. Lower urine pH and greater levels of urine protein, urine glucose, and pee occult blood have been linked to an increased risk of BC, according to research by Zeng et al. When compared to healthy controls, patients with bladder cancer have greater levels of urine- and plasma-soluble proteins such as VEGF, endostatin, stress proteins, and cytokines, which aid in the detection and staging of the disease. After BCG injection, leukocyte cell presence in urine appears to be a replacement urine biomarker of immune system activity. Additionally, a worse response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been associated to an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in MIBC patients' blood. However, few studies have looked into the use of non-invasive markers in blood or urine to predict the prognosis of NMIBC patients. Elsawy et al. reported that urinary IL-10 and serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can significantly predict the initial complete response after BCG treatment in high-risk NMIBC. Li et al. observed that the presence of ferrous protoporphyrin(+)/reactive oxygen species(+) in urine is associated with an increased risk of recurrence in newly diagnosed NMIBC patients.

### Bexagliflozin [^114rNdTU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Bexagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the transporter responsible for reabsorption of the majority of glucose from the renal glomerular filtrate in the renal proximal tubule. By inhibiting SGLT2, bexagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urinary Glucose Excretion and Urinary Volume

Dose-dependent increases in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) accompanied by increases in urine volume were observed in healthy subjects and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose administration of bexagliflozin. Dose-response analysis indicates that 20 mg bexagliflozin provides near-maximal UGE. Elevated UGE was maintained after multiple-dose administration.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 5 times the recommended dose, bexagliflozin does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically significant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of bexagliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following dosing in the fasted state, mean Cmaxand AUC0-∞were 134 ng/mL and 1,162 ng·h/mL, respectively. Bexagliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in plasma up to ~20% following multiple dosing.

Absorption Following oral administration of bexagliflozin tablets, peak plasma concentrations of bexagliflozin were reached between 2–4 hours post-dose and can be delayed if taken after a meal or by medications that slow gastric emptying. Plasma Cmaxand AUC of bexagliflozin increase in a dose-proportional manner following single doses from 3 mg (0.15 times the recommended dose) to 90 mg (4.5 times the recommended dose).

Effect of Food Administration of bexagliflozin tablets after consumption of a standard high-fat, high-caloric meal increased Cmaxand AUC by 31% and 10%, respectively, compared to dosing in the fasted state. The median Tmaxwas increased to 5 hours. The effects of food on bexagliflozin pharmacokinetics are not considered clinically relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Distribution Bexagliflozin is approximately 93% bound to plasma protein. Neither renal nor hepatic impairment substantially alters protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 262 L.

### Differential expression of coagulation pathway-related proteins in diabetic urine exosomes [^1114pv7o]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a hypercoagulable state, especially in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Glycemic control is one of the important elements to assess in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this study, the level of F2 expression in the urine exosomes of patients at a high level was significantly lower than that of patients at a general level. For diabetic patients with HbA1c ≥ 8%, blood glucose control was not ideal, and F2 expression was lower. This may be because when the blood glucose control of diabetic patients worsens, the increase in plasma glucose and insulin leads to a rapid and substantial increase in the circulation of thrombin production. In this study, the level of F2 expression in the urine exosomes of patients at a general level was significantly higher than that of the normal controls. Meanwhile, when we removed the data of the high level group and reanalyzed the area under the curve of F2 protein, as shown in Figure S1, we found that the area under the curve of F2 protein is larger at this time. It is speculated that urine exosome protein F2 may have higher clinical value for the early diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, F2 can be used as a monitoring indicator of diabetes mellitus, especially for blood glucose control monitoring, which has very important clinical value.

### Predictive and diagnostic biomarkers for gestational diabetes and its associated metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [^113CW9Um]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as the presence of high blood glucose levels with the onset, or detected for the first time during pregnancy, as a result of increased insulin resistance. GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty acid-binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino-acids and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.

### Glucose targets for preventing diabetic kidney disease and its progression [^1161Ecuc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) around the world. Blood pressure lowering and glucose control are used to reduce diabetes-associated disability including kidney failure. However there is a lack of an overall evidence summary of the optimal target range for blood glucose control to prevent kidney failure.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intensive (HbA1c < 7% or fasting glucose levels < 120 mg/dL versus standard glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7% or fasting glucose levels ≥ 120 mg/dL for preventing the onset and progression of kidney disease among adults with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 31 March 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating glucose-lowering interventions in which people (aged 14 year or older) with type 1 or 2 diabetes with and without kidney disease were randomly allocated to tight glucose control or less stringent blood glucose targets.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and risks of bias, extracted data and checked the processes for accuracy. Outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular complications, doubling of serum creatinine (SCr), ESKD and proteinuria. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 29,319 people with diabetes were included and 11 studies involving 29,141 people were included in our meta-analyses. Treatment duration was 56.7 months on average (range 6 months to 10 years). Studies included people with a range of kidney function. Incomplete reporting of key methodological details resulted in uncertain risks of bias in many studies. Using GRADE assessment, we had moderate confidence in the effects of glucose lowering strategies on ESKD, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and progressive protein leakage by kidney disease and low or very low confidence in effects of treatment on death related to cardiovascular complications and doubling of serum creatinine (SCr). For the primary outcomes, tight glycaemic control may make little or no difference to doubling of SCr compared with standard control (4 studies, 26,874 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11; I² = 73%, low certainty evidence), development of ESKD (4 studies, 23,332 participants: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.12; I² = 52%; low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (9 studies, 29,094 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.13; I² = 50%; moderate certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (6 studies, 23,673 participants: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.92; I² = 85%; low certainty evidence), or sudden death (4 studies, 5913 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; I² = 85%; very low certainty evidence). People who received treatment to achieve tighter glycaemic control probably experienced lower risks of non-fatal myocardial infarction (5 studies, 25,596 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; I² = 46%, moderate certainty evidence), onset of microalbuminuria (4 studies, 19,846 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93; I² = 61%, moderate certainty evidence), and progression of microalbuminuria (5 studies, 13,266 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93; I² = 75%, moderate certainty evidence). In absolute terms, tight versus standard glucose control treatment in 1,000 adults would lead to between zero and two people avoiding non-fatal myocardial infarction, while seven adults would avoid experiencing new-onset albuminuria and two would avoid worsening albuminuria.

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that people who receive intensive glycaemic control for treatment of diabetes had comparable risks of kidney failure, death and major cardiovascular events as people who received less stringent blood glucose control, while experiencing small clinical benefits on the onset and progression of microalbuminuria and myocardial infarction. The adverse effects of glycaemic management are uncertain. Based on absolute treatment effects, the clinical impact of targeting an HbA1c < 7% or blood glucose < 6.6 mmol/L is unclear and the potential harms of this treatment approach are largely unmeasured.

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^11174st5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Table 1
Methods for testing albuminuria as recommended by KDIGO and ADA guidelines

Figure 3
Proposed algorithm for the optimum management of CKD in T2D using albuminuria as a target.†Exercise (strenuous exercise within 24 hours of sample collection), infection (septicemia or other conditions increasing vascular permeability, symptomatic urinary tract infection), fever, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, upright posture (orthostatic proteinuria causing transient elevation in UACR), and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independent of kidney damage. A, albuminuria category; ACEi, ACE inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DPP-4i, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; G, GFR category; GLP-1RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; RAS, renin–aldosterone system; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor; T2D, type 2 diabetes; UACR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

Methods of measuring albuminuria are not standardized; however, KDIGO guidelines recommend standardization against a serum-based calibrant (CRM 470), with albumin measured using immunologic assays capable of specific and precise quantification at low concentrations and of producing quantitative results over the clinically relevant range. Alternate methods, such as a 24-hour UALB test, are available; however, this test is more burdensome (table 1). The use of urine dipsticks offers a convenient, cost-effective method of measuring albuminuria alone (table 1). However, the use of urine dipsticks is susceptible to false results with poor sensitivity for UACR ≥ 30 mg/g detection (~62%; 95% CI 50.9 to 72.0). Combining urine dipstick measurements for albumin with simultaneous measurement of creatinine could ensure a higher level of accuracy as this will correct for variations in albumin concentration that is highly dependent on hydration status. In addition, assays that measure total protein, such as colorimetric protein assays, may be used. However, it is important to note that UALB measurements provide a more specific and sensitive measure of changes in glomerular permeability than urinary total protein, and they enable early detection of low concentrations of albumin as a marker of kidney damage and the progression of kidney disease (table 1). Therefore, as kidney function declines, it is recommended that testing be carried out more frequently, with repeat testing of albuminuria in addition to eGFR measurements recommended to assess disease progression or response to treatment (figure 3).

### Proteinuria should be used as a surrogate in CKD [^115pf36e]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Surrogate end points of renal failure are instrumental to the testing of new treatments in patients with chronic kidney disease, the natural history of which is characterized by a slow, asymptomatic decline in renal function. The magnitude of proteinuria is widely recognized as a marker of the severity of glomerulopathy. Population-based studies have identified proteinuria as a predictor of future decline in glomerular filtration rate and of the development of end-stage renal disease. More importantly, a reduction in proteinuria invariably translates into a protection from renal function decline in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease with overt proteinuria. Thus, proteinuria should be considered a valuable surrogate end point for clinical trials in patients with proteinuric renal diseases.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected on less accurate methods:

- confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive)

- confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Using risk assessment to improve screening for albuminuria among US adults without diabetes [^111gGurS]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Many strategies have been proposed to screen for albuminuria. De Jong and Curhan explored initiating a screening program for albuminuria in high-risk individuals. Boulware et al. 2003 explored the value of periodic dipstick screening and found that this method was not cost-effective unless directed specifically toward high-risk groups or conducted at infrequent intervals of 10 years. Hoerger et al. found that microalbuminuria screening is only cost effective for patients with diabetes or hypertension as well or if conducted at longer intervals at established physician visits. Targeting screening to high-risk populations has shown potential in cost effectiveness analyses to identify more feasibly those with impaired kidney function.

Early identification of albuminuria has significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The presence of albuminuria may be and earlier sign of kidney damage, which can arise due to hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking, etc. prompting physician and patients to place greater emphasis on optimization of health behaviors and medical therapies. Albuminuria could also be the initial manifestation of nephrotic or nephritic syndrome requiring more specialized investigation and treatment. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) has been associated with reduced urine protein excretion and a slower decline of GFR among both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. – In populations with CKD and albuminuria, large clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone, can significantly slow progression of CKD and reduce mortality from renal and cardiovascular causes. Earlier detection can lead to earlier medical optimization of underlying kidney disease which can in turn slow progression. –

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^116mVAAx]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we report associations of sequence variants with biomarkers routinely assessed in clinical practice using urine dipstick tests. We identified 14 novel associations with 5 urinary traits in the Icelandic population.

Most notably, we describe novel association signals at SLC5A2, one common and two rare, influencing the risk of glucosuria in the general population. SLC5A2 encodes SGLT2, the principal sodium-glucose transporter in the kidney, responsible for the bulk of the tubular reabsorption of glucose. Increased glucosuria among these subjects is due to a lowering of the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, rather than being a result of increased glycemia such as in diabetics. SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of diabetes drugs that are used to regulate blood glucose levels in patients by enhancing the urinary glucose excretion. The effect of the rare missense variant Met382Thr in the Icelandic population corresponds to a decrease of 0.40% in HbA 1C (P = 3.7 × 10–4; population mean = 6.44%, SD = 1.48%), mimicking the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use the following measurements if measuring urine protein:

- urine protein-to-creatinine ratio

- reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading

- reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — distinguishing diabetic kidney disease (DKD) from other systemic diseases notes that systemic diseases most likely to be confused with DKD are those that cause mild to moderate proteinuria and a slow progressive decrease in eGFR, and differentiation requires clinical suspicion and appropriate diagnostic testing. It is the opinion of the Work Group that in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

KDOQI — screening schedule and initial tests for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes: Patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening to commence 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (A) or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (B). Screening should include measurements of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample (B) and measurement of serum creatinine and estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (B).

### Urinalysis… [^113RcCtu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

From the days of the Babylonian physicians, analysis of urine has been regarded as an essential part of the examination of the patient. 1 When properly performed, urinalysis may generate much useful, even critical, information. The recent introduction of simple, rapid, sensitive, and reliable chemical methods for detection of protein, glucose, and perhaps bacteria permits mass urinalysis in the screening of large populations for latent disease. 2 A slight trace of protein or sugar in the urine may be the only clue to serious renal or systemic disease.
3. The physician himself should examine the urine for any abnormalities, particularly in patients with suspect or overt renal disease. He must insist on adherence to common but much neglected principles in the collection of the specimen. The concentrated, first-morning specimen, if examined fresh, provides maximal opportunity for observation of formed elements, minimizing their lysis. Properly performed "catch" or midstream.

### Proteinuria in adults: a diagnostic approach… [^1147GaKG]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of Proteinuria Normal barriers to protein filtration begin in the glomerulus, which consists of unique capillaries that are permeable to fluid and small solutes but effective barriers to plasma proteins. The adjacent basement membrane and visceral epithelial cells are covered with negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of proteinuria can be classified as glomerular, tubular or overflow. Glomerular disease is the most common cause of pathologic proteinuria. 8Several glomerular abnormalities alter the permeability of the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in urinary loss of albumin and immunoglobulins. 7Glomerular malfunction can cause large protein losses; urinary excretion of more than 2 g per 24 hours is usually a result of glomerular disease.

13, 14 Correlation between the UPr/Cr ratio and 24-hour protein excretion has been demonstrated in several diseases, including diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia and rheumatic disease. 15–17 Recent evidence indicates that the UPr/Cr ratio is more accurate than the 24-hour urine protein measurement. 18 Fortunately, the ratio is about the same numerically as the number of grams of protein excreted in urine per day. Thus, a ratio of less than 0. 2 is equivalent to
0. 2 g of protein per day and is considered normal, a ratio of 3. 5 is equivalent to
3. 5 g of protein per day and is considered nephrotic-range proteinuria. To diagnose orthostatic proteinuria, split urine specimens are obtained for comparison. The first morning void is discarded. A 16-hour daytime specimen is obtained with the patient performing normal activities and finishing the collection by voiding just before bedtime. An eight-hour overnight specimen is then collected.

The daytime specimen typically has an increased concentration of protein, with the nighttime specimen having a normal concentration. Patients with true glomerular disease have reduced protein excretion in the supine position, but it will not return to normal, as it will with orthostatic proteinuria. 7 Isolated proteinuria with urinary protein excretion of more than 2 g per day is rare and usually signifies glomerular disease. 7 These patients need further testing, and a nephrology consultation should be considered.

### Mechanism of proteinuria… [^115xqKTp]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

At least one half of the proteins in normal urine are Tamm-Horsfall proteins, which are localized to the thick ascending limbs of the loop of Henle. 11 The remaining proteins are filtered plasma proteins of different molecular sizes, including mostly low-molecular-weight proteins, such as transferrin, microglobulins, and intermediate-sized albumin. 1, 2, 12, 13 Most filtered proteins at the glomerulus are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The sulfosalicylic acid method, or turbidimetry, detects all forms of protein and is generally used as a supplementary test when the presence of a low-molecular-weight or other protein is suspected but not detected by the dipstick test. In the sulfosalicylic acid method, three drops of a sulfosalicylic acid 20% solution are added to 5 mL of urine. Depending on the amount of protein precipitated, various grades of turbidity from minimal to heavy flocculation are noted. 2, 3.

The single-void urine protein/creatinine ratio calculated in milligrams of protein per milligrams of creatinine is a convenient method for estimating urine protein excretion without a 24-hour urine collection. 2, 17 Multiple studies have found that the 24-hour urine protein test correlates well with UPr/Cr. 18–20 Multiplying UPr/Cr by 0. 63 can give an estimate of the total amount of protein in the urine. Tubular secretion of creatinine increases in the presence of a significant reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, and this might lead to an artificially low UPr/Cr. 2 Glomerular diseases are more common than tubulointerstitial diseases. 2, 29, 30 Albumin and immunoglobulin G in the urine are the usual indicators for glomerular diseases. Glomerular diseases can have nephrotic and/or nephritic features, and making a distinction between these features can help narrow the differential diagnosis.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia.
