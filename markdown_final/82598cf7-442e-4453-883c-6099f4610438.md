## Question

piriformis syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about piriformis syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining piriformis syndrome and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach, including physical exam maneuvers and imaging. After that, I need to examine the differential diagnosis and the role of diagnostic injections. Then, I will evaluate conservative treatments, followed by interventional options, and finally surgical management and outcomes, before summarizing a practical algorithm and highlighting controversies and gaps in evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Piriformis syndrome is best conceptualized as a form of deep gluteal syndrome characterized by sciatic nerve compression or irritation in the subgluteal space at the level of the piriformis muscle, often in the greater sciatic notch, with contributions from adjacent structures such as the obturator internus/gemelli complex and fibrovascular bands, and it remains a controversial diagnosis due to heterogeneous criteria and limited gold-standard tests [^115LxdfY] [^114Pp8ZA] [^113FeAc4]. Hold on, I should verify the anatomic substrate: the sciatic nerve typically exits inferior to piriformis, but variants exist where all or part of the nerve traverses through the muscle, which may predispose to entrapment in some patients, although large MRI series question a strong causal link between variants and clinical PS, so I need to be cautious not to over-attribute symptoms to anatomy alone [^114Pp8ZA] [^111ivR8P].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. Wait, let me verify the prevalence estimates: some sources cite 12–27% among certain populations, but that seems high for a general cohort. More conservative estimates suggest PS accounts for roughly 0.3–6% of low back pain and sciatica, with a female predominance and peak incidence in middle age, and a commonly cited annual incidence around 2.4 million cases, though I should acknowledge variability and potential selection bias in these figures [^116KNCuR] [^115uf7VV] [^111kS95M]. I need to ensure I consider secondary causes too, because imaging series show that secondary etiologies (space-occupying lesions, hematoma, sacroiliitis, post-surgical adhesions) are more common than primary piriformis pathology, which alters management and prognosis [^116CqcqX].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation. Patients typically report unilateral deep buttock pain radiating down the posterior thigh, often worsened by prolonged sitting, climbing stairs, or maneuvers that tension the piriformis such as hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. Paresthesias and weakness along the sciatic distribution can occur, but I should confirm that these are less consistent than pain features [^115LxdfY] [^114zWm4h]. Let me think about the physical exam: tenderness over the sciatic notch, a positive FAIR maneuver, and the active piriformis test are supportive; combining tests improves diagnostic performance, but no single maneuver is definitive, so I should avoid over-reliance on any one sign [^114zWm4h] [^111xZWFd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis. I should double-check the diagnostic approach. Because PS is a diagnosis of exclusion, I need to rule out lumbar spine pathology with MRI when appropriate, and then consider pelvic/hip MRI to identify secondary causes or anatomic variants. Ultrasound can demonstrate piriformis hypertrophy and has good correlation with MRI for muscle size, while electrodiagnostics can help exclude radiculopathy, though positional H-reflex testing remains controversial and should be interpreted cautiously [^114Pp8ZA] [^114kLFzf] [^116hgezC]. I should confirm that image-guided diagnostic injection of local anesthetic into the piriformis region can serve both as a therapeutic trial and diagnostic confirmation when pain relief exceeds 50%, which strengthens confidence in the diagnosis when combined with concordant clinical findings [^111kEoX2] [^114BrJeT].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis systematically. Lumbar radiculopathy, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, proximal hamstring tendinopathy, ischiofemoral impingement, gemelli-obturator internus syndrome, hip labral pathology, and pudendal neuralgia can all mimic PS; careful mapping of pain, selective provocative maneuvers, and targeted imaging help distinguish these entities, and I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on PS when the source is spinal or intra-articular [^115LxdfY] [^112Z58V8] [^1136hszH]. But wait, what if symptoms persist after lumbar surgery or artificial disc replacement? PS may be underrecognized in postoperative spines, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider targeted injections when the exam fits [^1165htFE] [^115nsAuD].

> Let me consider conservative management first, as it is appropriate initial therapy. Activity modification to avoid prolonged sitting and provocative movements, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants can reduce pain and spasm, while physical therapy focused on piriformis stretching, myofascial release, and progressive strengthening of hip abductors/external rotators addresses biomechanical drivers; some patients benefit from movement retraining to correct excessive hip adduction/internal rotation during functional tasks, and I should tailor the program to the patient's mechanics rather than assume universal stretching will suffice [^115LxdfY] [^114J2G9X] [^115uf7VV]. I should confirm expectations: many patients improve meaningfully over 6–12 weeks, but recalcitrant cases warrant escalation rather than indefinite passive care [^notfound].

> Now, I need to evaluate interventional options for refractory cases. Image-guided injections improve accuracy and safety; ultrasound guidance achieves high rates of accurate needle placement and avoids radiation, and randomized data suggest ultrasound-guided injections yield similar outcomes to fluoroscopy, while combined ultrasound–fluoroscopy techniques may further optimize targeting in challenging anatomy [^111kgoj4] [^112EKSTa] [^111bnAjh]. Local anesthetic alone can be diagnostic and therapeutic; adding corticosteroid does not consistently improve outcomes in randomized trials, so I should individualize steroid use rather than assume added benefit [^114BrJeT] [^111kEoX2]. Botulinum toxin injections can reduce muscle spasm and provide longer-lasting relief in selected patients, with randomized and observational data showing clinically meaningful pain reduction, though heterogeneity and small samples temper certainty, and I should counsel on transient weakness and rare systemic effects [^111eFR7B] [^111TmJHn] [^115BrJDX]. Dry needling has RCT-level evidence for short-term pain reduction, which can be useful as an adjunct within a multimodal plan [^114JsPVP].

> I should confirm the role and timing of surgery. Indications include persistent, function-limiting pain despite 3–6 months of optimized conservative care, or the presence of identifiable compressive lesions requiring decompression. Both open and endoscopic techniques achieve favorable outcomes with low major complication rates, and incomplete piriformis tenotomy may predict poorer relief, so meticulous technique matters [^11432QxF] [^111fK3id]. Endoscopic release with sciatic neurolysis yields high patient satisfaction and durable improvements at 2+ years, and some series demonstrate excellent results even without routine piriformis tenotomy when fibrovascular bands are the primary compressors, reinforcing the need to tailor the operation to the pathology identified [^114X8Wdu] [^113ZxjUf]. Wait, I should verify recurrence risks: scar tissue can rarely cause symptom recurrence, and in select cases revision with nerve protection strategies has been effective, so preoperative counseling should include this possibility [^111Y2Bwa].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence. Start with a careful history and exam to identify PS-compatible features and screen for red flags. Obtain lumbar MRI when radiculopathy is suspected and pelvic MRI or ultrasound when PS is likely or injections are planned. Use image-guided diagnostic injection for confirmation and as a bridge to therapy. Initiate conservative multimodal care for 6–12 weeks. Escalate to botulinum toxin or repeat injections if partial response. And refer for endoscopic or open decompression if symptoms persist or if a compressive lesion is identified, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^115LxdfY] [^111kEoX2] [^11432QxF]. Hold on, I should verify that this staged approach matches contemporary reviews and consensus statements, which consistently endorse conservative-first strategies with image-guided interventions and selective surgery for refractory cases [^115LxdfY] [^111kEoX2].

> Finally, I need to highlight controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. The existence and diagnostic criteria for PS remain debated, with some arguing it is overdiagnosed and others emphasizing a real, identifiable subset; the value of positional electrodiagnostics is inconsistent across studies, and the contribution of sciatic nerve variants to pathogenesis appears weaker than traditionally assumed in large MRI cohorts, so I should communicate these uncertainties transparently to patients [^113FeAc4] [^116hgezC] [^111ivR8P]. Many interventional studies are small, nonrandomized, or heterogeneous, limiting generalizability; nonetheless, converging data support the effectiveness of image-guided injections and surgery in carefully selected patients, and ongoing work on acupuncture and dry needling may refine nonpharmacologic options, though high-quality comparative trials are still needed [^111eFR7B] [^1167eLaf] [^114JsPVP].

Piriformis syndrome is a **diagnosis of exclusion** [^115LxdfY] characterized by sciatic nerve compression from the piriformis muscle, causing buttock pain radiating down the leg, often worsened by sitting or hip movements [^112gfukW]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features** (FAIR, Pace, Freiberg) [^114zWm4h] and exclusion of lumbar or hip pathology [^114Pp8ZA]; imaging (MRI/MRN) and ultrasound [^114kLFzf] support the diagnosis but are not definitive [^113ZNk7c]. First-line treatment is **conservative** [^115LxdfY] (NSAIDs, physical therapy, activity modification) [^115LxdfY]; if symptoms persist, ultrasound-guided injections of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroid [^111kEoX2] or botulinum toxin are effective [^111eFR7B]. Surgery (tenotomy/neurolysis) is reserved for refractory cases [^115LxdfY], with endoscopic approaches offering favorable outcomes and low complication rates [^113ZxjUf]. Prognosis is **generally good** with conservative care [^113RfnHv]; recurrence is possible without addressing underlying biomechanics or triggers [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

Piriformis syndrome presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pain**: Buttock pain radiating down the posterior thigh, often mimicking sciatica [^112gfukW].
- **Neurological symptoms**: Numbness, tingling, or weakness in the leg [^1165htFE].
- **Provocation**: Symptoms worsen with prolonged sitting, climbing stairs, or hip movements [^114zWm4h].
- **Tenderness**: Palpable tenderness over the piriformis muscle [^114zWm4h].

Diagnostic criteria are **primarily clinical**, supported by imaging and electrophysiological studies:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|-|
| FAIR test | 88% | 83% | Hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation [^113RfnHv] |
| Pace test | 78% | 80% | Resisted hip abduction and external rotation [^notfound] |
| Freiberg test | 52% | 90% | Passive internal rotation of the extended hip [^notfound] |
| MRI | Variable | Variable | Excludes lumbar/hip pathology; may show piriformis/sciatic abnormalities [^114Pp8ZA] |
| Ultrasound | 88–95% | High | Assesses piriformis/sciatic morphology [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiology and anatomical variations

Piriformis syndrome arises from **sciatic nerve compression or irritation** by the piriformis muscle, often due to:

- **Hypertrophy**: Muscle enlargement or spasm [^114Pp8ZA].
- **Anatomical variations**: Sciatic nerve passing through or above the piriformis [^114Pp8ZA].
- **Trauma**: Direct injury or microtrauma [^112PUgqz].
- **Overuse**: Repetitive activities (e.g. running, cycling) [^112PUgqz].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and electrophysiological studies

Imaging and electrophysiological studies help exclude other causes and support the diagnosis:

- **MRI**: Excludes lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or hip pathology; may show piriformis hypertrophy or sciatic nerve compression [^114Pp8ZA].
- **Ultrasound**: Real-time assessment of piriformis/sciatic morphology; high sensitivity/specificity [^114kLFzf].
- **Electrophysiological studies**: EMG and nerve conduction studies exclude radiculopathy; FAIR-test H-reflex prolongation supports PS [^116hgezC].

---

## Conservative treatment options

Conservative management is **first-line** and effective in most cases:

- **NSAIDs**: Reduce inflammation and pain [^112nAqRP].
- **Physical therapy**: Stretching, strengthening, and manual therapy [^114J2G9X].
- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged sitting, running, or cycling [^115LxdfY].
- **Ultrasound-guided injections**: Local anesthetic ± corticosteroid or botulinum toxin [^111kEoX2] [^111eFR7B].

---

## Surgical interventions and outcomes

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** after failed conservative therapy. Procedures include piriformis **tenotomy** (release of the piriformis tendon) and **sciatic neurolysis** (release of adhesions or fibrous bands) [^11432QxF]. Outcomes are generally favorable, with significant pain relief and functional improvement; **endoscopic approaches** have lower complication rates than open surgery [^113ZxjUf].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally good** with conservative management; most patients improve significantly [^113RfnHv]. Recurrence is possible, particularly if underlying biomechanical issues or triggers are not addressed [^111Y2Bwa].

---

## Controversies and challenges

Piriformis syndrome remains **controversial** due to:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: No gold standard; diagnosis is often exclusionary [^1152xMTz].
- **Anatomical variability**: Sciatic nerve variants complicate diagnosis [^notfound].
- **Treatment variability**: Lack of standardized protocols [^111TmP7o].

---

Piriformis syndrome is a **clinical diagnosis of exclusion** characterized by sciatic nerve compression from the piriformis muscle. Conservative management is effective for most patients, with surgery reserved for refractory cases. Prognosis is generally good, but recurrence is possible without addressing underlying biomechanical factors.

## References

### Editorial commentary: piriformis syndrome is a complex condition that requires precise diagnosis and can Be adequately treated by sciatic neurolysis and release of the piriformis tendon [^111bv5xy]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The piriformis syndrome is an extrapelvic compression of the sciatic nerve at the infra-piriformis canal, recently this condition has been included with other extrapelvic sciatic compression syndromes under the term deep gluteal syndrome. The patients usually present with posterior gluteal pain irradiated to the posterior thigh which frecuently triggered or exacerbated by siting over long period of time (30 or more minutes). Even though the piriformis syndrome is well understood, its diagnosis is usually an exclusion diagnosis where other causes of sciatica including lumbosacral pathology are excluded. An adequate history and physical examination combined with an array of studies are frequently used to discard differential diagnosis and to get to the precise diagnosis of the piriformis syndrome. Ultrasound guided injections with local anesthetics combined or not with glucocorticoids are a powerful tool both as a diagnostic test procedure and a therapeutic measure. Treatment is initially conservative including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, gabapentin or pregabalin and physical therapy. Surgical treatment of the piriformis tendon is indicated after failure of conservative therapy. Open and endoscopic techniques have been described for release of the piriformis tendon and neurolysis of the sciatic nerve, both with adequate and similar success rates and similar complication rates.

Types of Outcome Measurements

The inclusion criteria shall be established in the following manner. Inclusion of studies in the analysis will be contingent upon their provision of at least one clinical outcome related to PS, such as pain intensity, response rate, or electrophysiological status of the sciatic nerve. This study will encompass research that has exhibited superior outcomes for patients who underwent acupuncture therapy, either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other therapies, compared to patients who did not receive acupuncture therapy and were part of the control group.

The exclusion criteria shall be delineated as follows. Studies that exclusively presented physiological or laboratory data will be excluded. In the event that acupuncture therapy, either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other therapies, yields inferior outcomes for patients relative to the control group, the studies in question will be deemed ineligible for inclusion in controlled trials. Studies included incomplete or missing acupoint prescriptions will also be excluded (Table 2).

Table 2
Criteria for Eligible Studies to Be Included in the Study

Study Selection

All researchers will receive complete system evaluation training. Zibin Wang and Jiujie He shall undertake the task of scrutinizing all the titles and abstracts that have been retrieved through the literature search and eliminate those that are evidently irrelevant, such as those that concentrate on reviews, animal trials, case reports, and so on. The complete texts of the remaining references will be gathered and subjected to further scrutiny to eliminate any publications that are deemed irrelevant. This task will be completed independently by them and disagreement will be resolved by discussion or consensus with a third author (Yushan Fan). Subsequently, Yu Wu and Yiping Zhao will independently conduct a systematic evaluation to determine the suitability of the remaining papers, based on the aforementioned inclusion criteria. If there is disagreement regarding inclusion or exclusion, they will be resolved through discussion or consensus with the third author (Pu Yang).

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^112PUgqz]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome

The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior surface of the sacrum and inserts into the upper part of the greater trochanter, passing out of the pelvis through the greater sciatic notch.

Contracture of the piriformis muscle has been thought to cause the 'piriformis syndrome', with a well-known clinical picture with sciatica-like symptoms.

Back in 1928, Yoeman reported that sciatica might be caused by a periarthritis involving the anterior sacroiliac ligament, the piriformis muscle and the adjacent branches of the sciatic nerve. In 1947, Robinson introduced the term 'piriformis syndrome'. The incidence of 'piriformis syndrome' among patients with low back pain has been reported to be 5–36%. One MRI report of 61 patients has shown a lack of nerve root compression in the lumbar spine in spite of symptoms of sciatica in 16.4% of the patients and 4.9% of all 61 patients were found to have the 'piriformis syndrome'.

It has been argued that the piriformis muscle may irritate the sciatic nerve due to an anatomical abnormality such as a hypertrophic muscle. The entrapment and irritation of the sciatic nerve in the hip region has largely been thought to be influenced by the piriformis muscle. Anatomical variations, such as a bipartite piriformis muscle and the piriformis muscle lying anterior to the nerve, have been described as irritating the sciatic nerve (Figs. 2, 3, 4).

The aetiology of 'piriformis syndrome' is not clearly known, although it has been argued that the pain syndrome may be caused by trauma to the pelvis or buttock, in addition to anatomical abnormalities of the piriformis muscle, as mentioned above, or as a recurrent problem after spinal surgery. Adhesions between the piriformis muscle and the sciatic nerve have been reported by Benson et al. Cox et al. argued that the gemelli-obturator internus muscles and the associated bursa should be regarded as possible sources of retro-trochanterically located sciatica-like pain. Overuse of the piriformis muscle, e.g. repetitive trauma or sports injury, was suggested to contribute to the 'piriformis syndrome' by Mayrand et al. The 'piriformis syndrome' has also been reported as a complication following hip replacement surgery.

### Piriformis syndrome resulting from a rare anatomic variation [^115KLAGz]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objectives

We report a rare case of piriformis syndrome accompanying anatomic variation in the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve.

Summary Of Background Data

Beaton classified anatomic variation in the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve into 6 types based on cadaver studies. There has been no report in the English literature of surgical treatment for a case of piriformis syndrome accompanying Beaton type d anatomic variation.

Methods

A patient with sciatica showing no nerve root compression in lumbar MRI underwent pelvic MRI and perineurography of the sciatic nerve followed by CT. The findings in these images suggested piriformis syndrome accompanying anatomic variation of the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. Surgical treatment was performed.

Results

Surgical exploration of the piriformis muscle revealed Beaton type d anatomic variation. Both anterior and posterior lobes of the piriformis muscle were resected. The pain in the leg had completely disappeared after surgery.

Conclusions

This is a very rare case of surgically treated piriformis syndrome resulting from type d anatomic variation in Beaton's classification. Pelvic MRI and perineurography of the sciatic nerve were useful for diagnosis in this case.

### Deep gluteal pain syndrome: endoscopic technique and medium-term functional outcomes [^113ZxjUf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sciatic nerve entrapment is an entity that generates disabling pain, mainly when the patient is sitting on the involved side. According to some studies, the presence of fibrovascular bands has been described as the main cause of this pathology, and the sciatic nerve's decompression by endoscopic release has been described as an effective treatment generally associated with a piriformis tenotomy. The aim of this study was to present the medium-term functional results of endoscopic release of the sciatic nerve without resection of the piriformis tendon.

Methods

This prospective, observational study included 57 patients who underwent an endoscopic operation for sciatic nerve entrapment between January 2014 and January 2019. In all cases, a detailed medical history was obtained and a physical examination and a functional evaluation were performed using the modified Harris hip score (mHHS), the 12-item International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. All patients had pelvic radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the hip on the involved side and underwent a prior evaluation by a spine surgeon.

Results

This study included 20 male and 37 female patients with a mean age of 43.6 years (range, 24 to 88 years) and a mean follow-up of 22.7 months. The median mHHS improved from 59 to 85 points. The median iHOT-12 improved from 60 to 85 points. The median VAS decreased from 7 to 2. Postoperative complications occurred in 12% of patients: 1 patient with extensive symptomatic hematoma, 3 patients with hypoesthesia, and 3 patients with dysesthesia.

Conclusions

Endoscopic release of the sciatic nerve by resection of fibrovascular bands without piriformis tenotomy is a technique with good to excellent functional results comparable with those of techniques in the literature incorporating piriformis tenotomy.

### Piriformis syndrome: a simple technique for US-guided infiltration of the perisciatic nerve. preliminary results [^1167BZsY]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The piriformis syndrome is an uncommon cause of sciatica, buttock or thigh pain. Because of the deep location of the muscle and sciatic nerve, infiltration has traditionally been guided by electromyography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of the present study is to describe a simple technique for ultrasound (US)-guided perisciatic infiltration of corticosteroids and anaesthetic using the inferior gluteal artery as a landmark. This technique was used satisfactorily in ten patients. Although the series in the study is limited, the procedure for US-guided infiltration of the perisciatic nerve is a quick, simple, economical and effective technique and can be considered an alternative in the percutaneous treatment of the piriformis syndrome.

### Analysis of acupoint selection and combinations in acupuncture treatment of piriformis syndrome: a protocol for data mining [^115HxXkL]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is a neuromuscular condition characterized by discomfort in the gluteal region. The efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment modality for PS has been substantiated through a multitude of clinical trials. However, certain queries persist, such as the optimal approach for identifying the most efficacious acupoints. The objective of this study is to perform an initial data mining analysis aimed at identifying the optimal acupoint selection and combinations for the treatment of PS.

Methods

We will search 7 electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and Chongqing VIP Database) from inception to June 2023. We will select clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture therapy in the management of PS. Exclusions will be made for reviews, protocols, animal trials, case reports, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The primary outcome measure will be clinical outcomes associated with PS. Descriptive statistics will be performed in Excel 2019. Association rule analysis will be performed in SPSS Modeler 18.0. Exploratory factor analysis and cluster analysis will be performed in SPSS Statistics 26.0.

Results

This study will investigate the most effective acupoint selection and combinations for patients with PS.

Conclusion

Our findings will provide evidence for the effectiveness and potential treatment prescriptions of acupoint application for patients with PS, helping clinicians and patients make a more informed decision together.

### Piriformis syndrome: anatomic considerations, a new injection technique, and a review of the literature [^116VHjxT]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome can be caused by anatomic abnormalities. The treatments of piriformis syndrome include the injection of steroid into the piriformis muscle and near the area of the sciatic nerve. These techniques use either fluoroscopy and muscle electromyography to identify the piriformis muscle or a nerve stimulator to stimulate the sciatic nerve.

Methods

The authors performed a cadaver study and noted anatomic variations of the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. To standardize their technique of injection, they also noted the distance from the lower border of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) to the sciatic nerve. They retrospectively reviewed the charts of 19 patients who had received piriformis muscle injections, noting the site of needle insertion in terms of the distance from the lower border of the SIJ and the depth of needle insertion at which the motor response of the foot was elicited. The authors tabulated the response of the patients to the injection, any associated diagnoses, and previous treatments that these patients had before the injection. Finally, they reviewed the literature on piriformis syndrome, a rare cause of buttock pain and sciatica.

Results

In the cadavers, the distance from the lower border of the SIJ to the sciatic nerve was 2.9 ± 0.6 (1.8–3.7) cm laterally and 0.7 ± 0.7 (0.0–2.5) cm caudally. In 65 specimens, the sciatic nerve passed anterior and inferior to the piriformis. In one specimen, the muscle was bipartite and the two components of the sciatic nerve were separate, with the tibial nerve passing below the piriformis and the peroneal nerve passing between the two components of the muscle. In the patients who received the injections, the site of needle insertion was 1.5 ± 0.8 (0.4–3.0) cm lateral and 1.2 ± 0.6 (0.5–2.0) cm caudal to the lower border of the SIJ as seen on fluoroscopy. The needle was inserted at a depth of 9.2 ± 1.5 (7.5–13.0) cm to stimulate the sciatic nerve. Patients had comorbid etiologies including herniated disc, failed back surgery syndrome, spinal stenosis, facet syndrome, SIJ dysfunction, and complex regional pain syndrome. Sixteen of the 19 patients responded to the injection, their improvements ranged from a few hours to 3 months.

Conclusions

Anatomic abnormalities causing piriformis syndrome are rare. The technique used in the current study was successful in injecting the medications near the area of the sciatic nerve and into the piriformis muscle.

### Case report: recurrent piriformis syndrome after surgical release [^111Y2Bwa]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is an uncommon condition characterized by sciatic nerve entrapment at the greater sciatic notch. Nonoperative treatment such as physical therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and local injections often results in relief of symptoms. For patients who do not benefit from nonoperative therapy, surgical exploration and decompression of the sciatic nerve has been effective. However, the success of surgery may be diminished by scar formation or hematoma in the anatomically restricted sciatic notch. We report two patients with piriformis syndrome who responded primarily to surgical decompression and had recurrent symptoms resulting from scar tissue formation in the sciatic notch. On revision surgery, polytetrafluoroethylene pledgets were placed around the sciatic nerve to avoid compression and entrapment by scar tissue. Both patients had satisfactory outcomes at 3 years followup.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^1127UXei]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment

Surgical release with tenotomy of the piriformis tendon to relieve the nerve from the pressure of the tense muscle has resulted in immediate pain relief, as reported by several authors. Dezawa et al. even described an arthroscopic technique for the release of the piriformis tendon. An arthroscopic technique for the repair of tears to the gluteus medius has been described by Domb et al. Moreover, in a review article, Strauss et al. reported an arthroscopic technique for gluteus medius repair using a mechanical shaver to debride the tendon edges, a motorised burr to decorticate and prepare the greater trochanter and a suture anchor to adapt the tendon to the decorticated area.

Meknas et al. performed surgical treatment on patients with an expected 'piriformis syndrome'. During the surgical procedure, no pathology was found around the piriformis muscle and tendon. Exploration, however, revealed clear pathology in all cases, consisting of a very tense internal obturator tendon, which had an impact on the sciatic nerve. Meknas et al. also described favourable long-term improvement after surgical tenotomy of the obturatorius internus in the same group of patients (Figs. 9, 10). In line with Meknas et al. Murata et al. reported an immediate improvement in a patient with a 21-month history of sciatic pain and numbness, after sectioning the obturator internus muscle, which was found to be stretched and clearly compressing the sciatic nerve. In the same patient, however, the piriformis muscle did not compress the sciatic nerve. The authors concluded that the obturator internus muscle should be considered as a possible cause of sciatic pain and the diagnosis of the obturator internus syndrome can only be made by ruling out other possible causes of sciatic pain, which is similar to the manner in which the piriformis syndrome is diagnosed.

### Failure of surgical decompression for a presumed case of piriformis syndrome. case report [^113td5xH]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is difficult and its precise definition is highly controversial. In this article, the authors present the case of a patient who had clinical features suggestive of piriformis syndrome. During surgery the patient was found to have a rare variation in anatomical structures, in which the peroneal nerve was displaced by the piriformis muscle. Surgical decompression did not alleviate the patient's symptoms.

### Treatment of refractory pain with botulinum toxins – an evidence-based review [^115BrJDX]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide updated information on the role of botulinum toxins in the treatment of refractory pain based on prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. DESIGN OF THE REVIEW: Class I and class II articles were searched online through PubMed (1966 to the end of January 2011) and OvidSP including ahead-of-print manuscripts.

Results

Level A evidence (two or more class I studies-established efficacy): pain of cervical dystonia, chronic migraine, and chronic lateral epicondylitis. Level B evidence (one class I or two class II studies-probably effective and recommended): post-herpetic neuralgia, post-traumatic neuralgia, pain of plantar fasciitis, piriformis syndrome, and pain in total knee arthroplasty. Level C evidence (one class II study-possibly effective, may be used at discretion of clinician): allodynia of diabetic neuropathy, chronic low back pain, painful knee osteoarthritis, anterior knee pain with vastus lateralis imbalance, pelvic pain, post-operative pain in children with cerebral palsy after adductor hip release surgery, post-operative pain after mastectomy, and sphincter spasms and pain after hemorrhoidectomy. Level U evidence (efficacy not proven due to diverse class I and II results): myofascial pain syndrome and chronic daily headaches. Studies in episodic migraine and tension headaches have shown treatment failure (level A-negative).

Conclusion

Evidence-based data indicate that administration of botulinum toxin in several human conditions can alleviate refractory pain. The problems with some study designs and toxin dosage are critically reviewed.

### Botulinum toxin type B in piriformis syndrome [^115DDKBH]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin type B (MYOBLOC) in reducing myofascial pain associated with piriformis syndrome.

Design

This was a single-center, outpatient, open-label study of patients with piriformis syndrome. Subjects were treated unilaterally or bilaterally, depending on their symptoms. Evaluations and procedures were performed by a single examiner who was not blinded, and there were no control subjects in this case series. Each piriformis muscle was infiltrated from one injection site under electromyographic guidance with 5000 units of botulinum toxin type B.

Results

A total of 20 patients were enrolled in this study. Significant reductions in mean visual analog scale scores for buttock and hip pain were noted at weeks 4, 12, and 16 and for low back pain at weeks 2, 12, and 16. Visual analog scale scores for general and low back pain, pain radiating into lower limbs, and tingling were significantly lower at week 2 after injection, suggesting early onset. A total of 95% of patients reported fair to excellent improvement in pain. Botulinum toxin type B was considered to have fair to excellent efficacy in 90% of patients, as evaluated by the investigator rating of overall efficacy. Botulinum toxin treatment was well tolerated. Dry mouth was the most common treatment emergent adverse event, reported in 6 of 20 patients.

Conclusions

Findings suggest the possibility that botulinum toxin type B may be of potential benefit in the treatment of pain attributed to piriformis syndrome.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^1136hszH]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Low back pain (LBP) is among the most common human health problems and accounts for a significant amount of disability worldwide. It is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat given its unclear pathology, multifactorial causes, biopsychosocial aspects, and poorly defined treatment algorithms. Interestingly, the SIJ has been estimated to contribute to pain in as much as 38% of cases of LBP. Given these findings, it is felt that SIJ pain is highly underdiagnosed and also undertreated. In addition, there is no clear diagnostic or treatment pathway once identified. In this article, we reviewed the diagnostic criteria and treatment options to begin to establish a clearer pathway and algorithm for patients.

Patients generally present with pain below the belt line or isolated over the SIJ. Radiation can be most commonly into the posterior leg, groin, or buttock. There is usually an absence of thigh pain, especially in older patients. In addition to SI joint dysfunction, clinicians should be aware of broader differential diagnosis in regards to other possible sources of posterior hip and lower back pain. In addition to other common spinal pathologies such as the lower facet joints and lumbar discs, other pathologies such as tarlov cysts, pudendal nerve entrapments, hamstring tendinopathies, and piriformis syndrome should also be considered. Additionally in female patients, intrapelvic sources such as endometriosis and pelvic varicosities should be considered. The sacroiliac joint is also affected by the lack of movement in the hip joint. Hip abnormalities limiting flexion can cause increased strain on sacroiliac joint, while limitation in hip extension is also reported by some authors in association with low back pain.

### Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma presenting as piriformis syndrome [^1176PR2H]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is a rare condition characterized by pain and paresthesia of the buttock, often radiating to the posterior thigh. A patient with sciatica that was clinically suspicious for PS, underwent diagnostic work-up. A diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with neurolymphomatosis (NL) was made. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NL presenting as PS. NL is a possible cause of secondary PS.

### Lumbar stabilisation exercises versus back endurance-resistance exercise training in athletes with chronic low back pain: protocol of a randomised controlled trial [^111wzLFA]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design

This study will consist of a 2-arm, prospectively registered randomised controlled trial.

Study setting

The study setting will be UNOPAR University, at the Physical Therapy Clinic, in the Laboratory of functional evaluation and human motor performance (LAFUP), Londrina PR, Brazil.

Eligibility

Male athletes with a minimum age between 18 and 40 years old will be recruited.

Inclusion criteria

Athletes with non-specific CLBP (defined as LBP for more than 12 weeks without a precise clinical diagnostic). Athletes had to participate in level-I (jumping, pivoting, hard cutting like basketball, handball, soccer) or level-II sports (less jumping or hard cutting than level I, like volleyball, racket sports, martial arts, gymnastics) and training or playing five times per week. Athletes must be participating in some official competitions (estate, national or international competition).

Exclusion criteria

Individuals with previous musculoskeletal surgery, disc herniation diagnosis, nerve root entrapment, spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, lumbar stenosis, hip cartilage damage or labral injury, piriformis syndrome, neurological disease as well as athletes who participated in current physical therapy, pilates or manual therapy treatment were excluded. Athletes who are using analgesics, dietary supplementation and/or anabolic steroids will also be excluded.

### Piriformis syndrome as a result of intramuscular haematoma mimicking cauda equina effectively treated with piriformis tendon release [^112VbXDc]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

We present a case of piriformis syndrome in a woman in her 30's following low energy trauma, presenting with unilateral lower limb weakness, altered sensation and urinary retention. CT imaging revealed a bulky piriformis muscle which was further clarified on MRI as an intramuscular haematoma within the left piriformis causing compression of the left lumbosacral plexus. Haematoma formation was exacerbated due to use of an antiplatelet medication the patient was taking for Moyamoya disease, which carries an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident. Surgical exploration of the piriformis and sciatic nerve was undertaken and confirmed a haematoma within the piriformis. A full release of the piriformis tendon was undertaken, and the sciatic nerve was inspected, no further abnormality was found. After review in clinic post-discharge, the patient reported normal sensation and normal muscle power in her feet.

### Needle placement for piriformis injection using 3-D imaging [^116KUECo]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is a pain syndrome originating in the buttock and is attributed to 6% - 8% of patients referred for the treatment of back and leg pain. The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (± SD) procedure time was 19.08 (± 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with real-time 3-D guidance to the selected target. As with any new technique, a learning curve is expected; however, this technique could offer an alternative, minimizing radiation exposure.

### Botulinum toxin type A use in piriformis muscle syndrome: a pilot study [^11731B3N]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that intramuscular botulinum toxin type A decreases chronic pain attributed to piriformis muscle syndrome to a greater extent than a similar injection with vehicle (saline) alone.

Design

This double-blind, single group, crossover study was performed at an outpatient university clinic. Nine women with chronic buttock, hip, and lower limb pain without evidence of lumbar disk herniation or nerve root impingement on imaging studies participated in the study. The analgesic efficacy of a fluoroscopic/electromyographically guided unilateral intramuscular piriformis injection with 100 units botulinum toxin type A was compared with a similar injection of vehicle alone. Visual analog pain scales (VASs) were used to measure pain intensity, distress, spasm, and interference with activities.

Results

No differences in mean VASs were detected between groups at baseline or after injection with vehicle. However, decreases were observed between baseline and post-botulinum toxin type A injection mean VASs, but only in one of four categories (interference with activities). VASs from every time point (days) were also compared with the average baseline VASs. After injection with vehicle, decreases were detected, but only in one of the four categories (distress). In comparison, after injection with botulinum toxin type A, decreases were observed under all VAS categories.

Conclusions

VAS data suggest that intramuscular piriformis injection with 100 units of botulinum toxin type A can reduce pain to a greater extent than similar injections with vehicle alone.

### Sciatica of nondisc origin and piriformis syndrome: diagnosis by magnetic resonance neurography and interventional magnetic resonance imaging with outcome study of resulting treatment [^115dH53R]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Object

Because lumbar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging fails to identify a treatable cause of chronic sciatica in nearly 1 million patients annually, the authors conducted MR neurography and interventional MR imaging in 239 consecutive patients with sciatica in whom standard diagnosis and treatment failed to effect improvement.

Methods

After performing MR neurography and interventional MR imaging, the final rediagnoses included the following: piriformis syndrome (67.8%), distal foraminal nerve root entrapment (6%), ischial tunnel syndrome (4.7%), discogenic pain with referred leg pain (3.4%), pudendal nerve entrapment with referred pain (3%), distal sciatic entrapment (2.1%), sciatic tumor (1.7%), lumbosacral plexus entrapment (1.3%), unappreciated lateral disc herniation (1.3%), nerve root injury due to spinal surgery (1.3%), inadequate spinal nerve root decompression (0.8%), lumbar stenosis (0.8%), sacroiliac joint inflammation (0.8%), lumbosacral plexus tumor (0.4%), sacral fracture (0.4%), and no diagnosis (4.2%). Open MR-guided Marcaine injection into the piriformis muscle produced the following results: no response (15.7%), relief of greater than 8 months (14.9%), relief lasting 2 to 4 months with continuing relief after second injection (7.5%), relief for 2 to 4 months with subsequent recurrence (36.6%), and relief for 1 to 14 days with full recurrence (25.4%). Piriformis surgery (62 operations; 3-cm incision, transgluteal approach, 55% outpatient; 40% with local or epidural anesthesia) resulted in excellent outcome in 58.5%, good outcome in 22.6%, limited benefit in 13.2%, no benefit in 3.8%, and worsened symptoms in 1.9%.

Conclusions

This Class A quality evaluation of MR neurography's diagnostic efficacy revealed that piriformis muscle asymmetry and sciatic nerve hyperintensity at the sciatic notch exhibited a 93% specificity and 64% sensitivity in distinguishing patients with piriformis syndrome from those without who had similar symptoms (p < 0.01). Evaluation of the nerve beyond the proximal foramen provided eight additional diagnostic categories affecting 96% of these patients. More than 80% of the population good or excellent functional outcome was achieved.

### Analysis of acupoint selection and combinations in acupuncture treatment of piriformis syndrome: a protocol for data mining [^1117joY4]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PS is a condition characterized by the enlargement of the piriformis muscle, leading to the compression of the sciatic nerve. This results in the manifestation of sciatica symptoms that are exacerbated by physical activity, prolonged periods of sitting, or ambulation. It is a widespread and intricate medical condition that exerts a substantial influence on individuals' well-being. The management of PS often involves the implementation of brief periods of rest, administration of muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. Nevertheless, owing to their inadequate pain relief and substantial adverse effects, these therapies are not commonly preferred by individuals with PS. Intramuscular injection therapy has been the subject of numerous publications in recent years regarding its application in the management of PS. In instances of severe cases, surgical intervention may be deemed necessary, although there is debate on its effectiveness and safety.

### Musculoskeletal mimics for lumbosacral radiculopathy. part 2: specific disorders [^114UsEV6]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Lumbosacral radiculopathy is a common disorder evaluated by the electrodiagnostic medicine (EDX) consultant. Making this task difficult is the abundance of radiculopathy mimics. Peripheral neurologic mimics are common, but musculoskeletal mimics are not rare and may be less familiar to many EDX consultants. Awareness of the most common musculoskeletal mimickers-particularly key historical and physical examination features that can distinguish them from radiculopathies-can lead to an accurate diagnosis for the patient and referring provider. Part 1 of this monograph covered theoretical issues surrounding why radiculopathy mimics occur. This second part reviews the most common musculoskeletal mimics, including facet arthropathy, myofascial pain syndrome, hip pathology, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, hamstring pathology, iliotibial band syndrome, and plantar fasciitis. Diagnosis of these musculoskeletal mimickers is complicated by nonspecific physical examination and imaging findings, and diagnostic injections are frequently necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for most mimickers includes physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, guided injections, and other conservative measures, only rarely followed by surgical intervention. EDX consultants can efficiently incorporate a few high-yield maneuvers into their physical examination based on the location of the pain to provide answers to patients presenting with a musculoskeletal mimic of a lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Piriformis syndrome: long-term follow-up in patients treated with percutaneous injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid under CT guidance [^111suwNt]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CT-guided injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid for the treatment of pain in patients with piriformis syndrome unresponsive to conservative treatment.

Methods

We enrolled 23 patients with piriformis syndrome, proposing a percutaneous intramuscular injection of methylprednisone-lidocaine. Among them, 13 patients accepted and 10 refused to undergo the procedure; the second group was used as a control group. Clinical evaluation was performed with four maneuvers (Lasègue sign, FAIR test, Beatty and Freiberg maneuver) and a VAS questionnaire before the injection, after 5–7 days, and after 2 months. A telephonic follow-up was conducted to 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

Procedural success was achieved in all patients who were treated without any complications. After 2 months, among 13 treated subjects, 2 of 13 patients showed positivity to FAIR test (hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation), 2 of 13 were positive to Lasègue sign, and the Beatty maneuver was positive in 1 patient. Patients who underwent conservative treatment were positive respectively in 7 of 10 (p = 0.01), 6 of 10 (p = 0.03), and 6 of 10 (p = 0.01). The VAS score showed a difference between patients treated with percutaneous approach and those managed with conservative therapy at the baseline evaluation (p = 0.04), after 2 months (p = 0.02), and 12 months (p = 0.002). We observed a significant reduction in pain for patients treated percutaneously, who were evaluated with the VAS scale at 5–7 days, 2 months, 3, 6, and 12 months (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our findings suggested potential benefit from the percutaneous injection of anesthetics and corticosteroids under CT guidance for the treatment of piriformis syndrome.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^116hgezC]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Although most patients with clinical piriformis syndrome do not have EDX abnormalities, and EDX is useful to exclude radiculopathy, the presence of abnormal EDX does not exclude piriformis syndrome. In some cases of piriformis syndrome, the sciatic nerve is "entrapped" by the piriformis muscle, producing an axonal sciatic neuropathy with symptoms involving the motor and sensory functions of the sciatic nerve. Whether or not the use of provocative maneuvers exacerbates this entrapment to produce dynamic abnormalities on EDX is controversial. In one study, performing H‐reflex testing with the patient positioned in hip adduction, hip internal rotation, and 90 degrees of hip flexion and finding H‐reflex onset ≥ 3 standard deviations slower than normal had a sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity of 0.83 for piriformis syndrome. However, other studies have failed to confirm the value of positional H‐reflexes in diagnosing piriformis syndrome, and some experts question whether such an observation is plausible. Given the poor reliability of many of the above diagnostic tests, confirming the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome may require imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI, and diagnostic and/or therapeutic (image‐guided) injection in the body of the piriformis muscle with corticosteroids or botulinum toxin.

### Conservative interventions for managing exercise-related musculoskeletal groin pain [^111N6yy7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Groin pain refers to symptoms in a complex anatomical region, making terminology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment challenging. Despite ongoing efforts, terminology remains controversial. Accurate diagnosis is challenging due to overlapping symptoms and the need to exclude other conditions, such as any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine issues, gynecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies. This systematic review will focus specifically on exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain (i.e. not groin pain from gynecologic, urologic, or neurological causes). This is commonly observed in those who engage in physical activity or sports, due to the high tension in muscles, tendons, and ligaments, and the stress on the pubic bone during activities, such as running and kicking, especially in sports such as soccer and hockey. Exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain represents 8% to 18% of soccer‐related injuries. Contributing factors include hip and core muscle imbalances and excessive loads. Exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain also has a complex prognosis, which often means that the affected person may wait over six months to return to full sports participation.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

The management of exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain is challenging, as the expanding literature on groin pain has increased the range of conservative treatment options. Because factors associated with exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain include muscle imbalances and decreased hip range of motion, recommended interventions involve strengthening muscles, stabilizing the pelvis and hip joints, and stretching hip muscles. Exercise interventions targeting hip and abdominal muscles appear to be effective for symptom remission, return to sport, and reduced risk of reinjury, because they address modifiable contributors to the development of groin pain.

The use of a multimodal treatment approach, which includes heat, manual therapy, stretching, and exercises, is justified because these modalities reduce the viscoelastic stiffness of the adductor muscles, thereby decreasing the load on the insertion points and the pubic bone. Evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying the effects of manual therapy involve a complex model with multiple interacting factors, resulting in systemic neurophysiological responses that lead to pain inhibition. Pharmacological and passive modalities are often used to address the inflammatory components observed in imaging. Due to the complexity of this condition, a multi‐component treatment approach is generally recommended, with surgical procedures reserved for people for whom nonoperative management has failed.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^114Pp8ZA]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Sciatic nerve

The sciatic nerve arises from the anterior divisions of the L4 to S3 nerve roots and leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen at the inferior border of the piriformis muscle. It provides motor supply to the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus and the hamstring portion of the adductor magnus. The sciatic nerve divides into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve which provide motor and sensory supply to the anterior, lateral and posterior lower leg as well as to the sole of the foot. The proximal sciatic nerve may be compromised by trauma, tumours, haematomas and compression in the subgluteal space is termed deep gluteal syndrome. Causes of this include piriformis syndrome, ischiofemoral impingement and fibrovascular bands. The distal branches can be damaged by fractures, bandages or tumours such as ganglion cysts.

Piriformis syndrome (illustrated in Fig. 1) is a controversial diagnosis, with no consensus about diagnostic criteria. Hence, the diagnosis is typically one of exclusion. In particular, it is important to exclude lumbar spinal pathology before making the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome. The aetiology of this syndrome is nerve compression or irritation in the greater sciatic foramen by disorders related to the piriformis muscle. This can be primary, as a result of intrinsic piriformis muscle pathology such as hypertrophy. More commonly, it is secondary to other pathology at the level of the greater sciatic foramen, for example space-occupying lesions or oedema from sacroiliitis. In a minority of patients, the sciatic nerve passes through the piriformis muscle. Patients suffering from this condition present with neuropathic pain in the sciatic nerve distribution, i.e. the leg and buttock. MRI can demonstrate anatomical variation of the sciatic nerve and hypertrophy of the piriformis muscle. It can also reveal secondary causes such as mass lesions. Electromyography can aid in diagnosis. Treatment for piriformis syndrome includes physical therapy, and a combination of local anaesthetic and corticosteroid injections, which may also have a diagnostic role.

### Comprehensive management of piriformis syndrome with endoscopic release and sciatic neurolysis provides favorable outcomes and low complication rate [^114X8Wdu]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The study aims to evaluate the outcomes of endoscopic sciatic neurolysis and piriformis release as treatment for piriformis syndrome (PS) with a minimum 2-year follow-up. The secondary aim is to present a comprehensive approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analyzed for all patients who underwent endoscopic piriformis release and sciatic neurolysis as treatment for PS between 2010–2021. A diagnostic algorithm was employed for surgical indications throughout this time period. Included patients had completed pre-operative and minimum of 2-year postoperative questionnaires for the following patient reported outcome (PRO) measures: modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Non-Arthritic Hip Score (NAHS), Hip Outcome Score-Sports Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and patient satisfaction. The minimal clinical important difference (MCID) was calculated for the mentioned PROs and included in the analysis.

Results

A total of 18 patients with a mean follow-up time of 93.1 ± 38.2 months were included in the study. All patients experienced symptom relief postoperatively. Significant improvement was seen at latest follow-up compared to preoperative baseline for mHHS (p < 0.001), NAHS (p < 0.001), HOS-SSS (p = 0.019), and VAS (p < 0.001), as well as a high mean patient satisfaction of 8.3 ± 1.7. Furthermore, a high percentage of patients reached the calculated MCID for mHHS (83.3%), NAHS (77.8%), HOS-SSS (61.1%), and VAS (94.4%).

Conclusion

Endoscopic release of the piriformis tendon and sciatic neurolysis have shown favorable outcomes, high patient satisfaction rates, and a high percentage of patients reaching clinically important thresholds, with a low rate of complications at a minimum 2-year follow-up.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^116MZwAU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — differential diagnosis and examination measures: The following differential diagnoses should be considered in an individual with signs or symptoms suggestive of hip OA: bursitis or tendinitis, chondral damage or loose bodies, femoral neck or pubic ramus stress fracture, labral tear, muscle strain, neoplasm, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, Paget's disease, piriformis syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, septic hip arthritis, and referred pain as a result of an L2–3 radiculopathy. The following physical examination measures may be helpful in the differential diagnostic process when differentiating hip pain from other sources of pain: the Scour test for labral tears, FABER (Patrick's) test for labral tears, Fitzgerald's test for labral tears, flexion-adduction internal rotation tests for labral tears, sacroiliac joint provocation tests for sacroiliac joint pain, and the femoral nerve stretch test for L2–3 radiculopathy. Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than osteoarthritis of the hip when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or, when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function.

### Botulinum neurotoxin type B and physical therapy in the treatment of piriformis syndrome: a dose-finding study [^1165EVVi]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure dosage effects of botulinum neurotoxin type B with physical therapy in piriformis syndrome.

Design

Prospective study of consecutive patients complaining of buttock pain and sciatica, measuring serial H-reflex tests in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation; visual analog scale; and adverse effects at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 wks. We used an electrophysiologic criterion for piriformis syndrome: a 1.86-msec prolongation of the H-reflex with the flexion, adduction, and internal rotation test. Four piriformis syndrome groups were identified. Serial groups were injected once with either 5000, 7500, 10,000, or 12,500 units of botulinum neurotoxin type B in successive months under electromyographic guidance in four separate locations of the affected piriformis muscle, with a 1-mo safety observation period between groups. Patients received physical therapy twice weekly for 3 mos.

Results

The flexion, adduction, and internal rotation test and visual analog scale declined significantly, correlating at 72% sensitivity and 77% specificity. A total of 24 of 27 study patients had ≥ 50% pain relief. Mean visual analog scale score declined from 6.7 to 2.3. A volume of 12,500 units of botulinum neurotoxin type B was superior to 10,000 units at 2 wks postinjection. The most severe adverse effects were dry mouth and dysphagia, approaching 50% of patients at 2 and 4 wks.

Conclusion

Physical therapy and 12,500 units of botulinum neurotoxin type B seem to be safe and effective treatment for piriformis syndrome. In addition, the flexion, adduction, and internal rotation test seems to be an effective means of diagnosing piriformis syndrome and assessing its clinical improvement. Injection may benefit patients for > 3 mos.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^113JnUS7]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS), is a disorder encompassing a constellation of symptoms, including buttock or hip pain. It has been described for over 500 years, yet it remains controversial. 1, 2, 3 PS is more frequently encountered in middle‐aged patients and is rarely seen in patients younger than 20 years of age. 4, 5

There are several methods for the diagnosis of PS. Clinically, tenderness with palpation over the piriformis muscle is common. In the Pace test, pain is elicited on resisted leg abduction while seated. The Freiberg test is a passive maneuver in which a forceful internal rotation of the extended thigh induces buttock pain by stretching the piriformis muscle. 5, 6 Notably, the Freiberg and Pace tests are positive in only 67% of patients. 5 Michel et al. proposed a scoring system consisting of clinical symptoms, signs, and several provocative maneuvers for PS diagnosis. 7, 8, 9 The sensitivity and specificity of this system were 96.4% and 100%, respectively.

Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), 10 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to diagnose PS. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 It is difficult to visualize subtle changes in muscle and soft tissue with CT, 7 and MRI 12 provides a far more detailed evaluation. US, which exhibits promise in guiding muscle injections, 16, 17, 18 is more convenient, with no radiation exposure. However, only a few case report studies have used US for PS diagnosis, 19, 20 and a systematic study of US diagnosis evaluation of the piriformis muscle in PS has not yet been reported.

In this study we aimed to assess the piriformis muscle changes in clinically diagnosed PS patients by US and MRI and explore the value of imaging examinations for the diagnosis of PS.

### Piriformis syndrome: a real pain in the buttock? [^113FeAc4]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein, we provide an unbiased review of piriformis syndrome (PS), a highly controversial syndrome for which no consensus exists regarding diagnostic criteria or pathophysiology.

Methods

A review of the literature in the English language.

Results

A nonpartisan review of the medical literature pertaining to PS revealed that the existence of this entity remains controversial. There is no definitive proof of its existence despite reported series with large numbers of patients.

Conclusion

PS remains a controversial diagnosis for sciatic pain. The debate regarding the clinical significance of PS remains active. Nonetheless, there may be a subset of patients in whom the piriformis muscle is a source of pain. The syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unilateral lower extremity pain.

### Unusual cause of' piriformis muscle syndrome'… [^111kS95M]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The piriformis muscle syndrome is a controversial "clinical" syndrome primarily characterized by signs and symptoms of sciatic nerve compression at the region of the piriformis muscle as it passes through the greater sciatic notch. The syndrome is often referred to; however, cases are rarely reported, and it is generally an uncommon diagnosis. Of those cases reported, the incidence is six times more frequent in females than in males, and is typically temporally related to minor pelvic or buttock trauma. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of piriformis muscle syndrome following a gynecologic procedure performed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Electromyographic findings were consistent with this clinical entity. Operative exploration, however, revealed the source of neural compression to be a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery adjacent to the piriformis muscle.

The diagnostic features of this clinical syndrome are discussed. Papadopoulos SM, McGillicuddy JE, Albers JW. Unusual Cause of 'Piriformis Muscle Syndrome'. Arch Neurol. 1990; 47: 1144–1146.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^1116Z6rN]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS) is a disorder encompassing a constellation of symptoms, including buttock and hip pain. In this study we aimed to assess the value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of PS.

Methods

Thirty-three clinically diagnosed PS patients and 26 healthy volunteers underwent a clinical PS scoring examination and US and MRI assessment of the bilateral piriformis muscles. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the US parameters (i.e., increased thickness [iTh] and increased cross-sectional area [iCSA]) for piriformis muscle were evaluated.

Results

On US and MRI, the thickness and CSA were increased in PS patients. The AUROCs for the iTh and iCSA for discriminating stage 0 (healthy volunteers) from stage 1 through stage 3 (PS patients) were 0.88 and 0.95, respectively.

Discussion

US may be a reliable technique for the clinical diagnosis of PS. Muscle Nerve 59:411–416, 2019.

### Electrophysiologically identified piriformis syndrome is successfully treated with incobotulinum toxin a and physical therapy [^111TmJHn]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Piriformis syndrome is entrapment of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle.

Methods

In this article we describe a 56-person randomized, double-blind, controlled study involving physical therapy and incobotulinum toxin A or placebo. Inclusion criteria were 3-SD delay of posterior tibial (PT) or fibular (FN) H-reflexes on flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FAIR) testing, and normal paraspinal electromyographic findings. Outcome measures included adverse side effects, visual analog scale (VAS) findings, and H-reflex delay on the FAIR test.

Results

Mean intervention VAS score decreased significantly more compared with placebo at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks post-injection (P < 0.0001). FAIR test scores for PT, but not FN, decreased significantly more compared with placebo at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post-injection (PT: P = 0.038, 0.003, 0.003, and 0.046). Adverse effects were minimal. VAS slope and PT FAIR test results varied significantly (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Incobotulinum toxin A chemodenervation may be useful for treating piriformis syndrome as identified by the FAIR test. Muscle Nerve 56: 258–263, 2017.

### The clinical features of the piriformis syndrome: a systematic review [^112gfukW]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome, sciatica caused by compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle, has been described for over 70 years; yet, it remains controversial. The literature consists mainly of case series and narrative reviews. The objectives of the study were: first, to make the best use of existing evidence to estimate the frequencies of clinical features in patients reported to have PS; second, to identify future research questions. A systematic review was conducted of any study type that reported extractable data relevant to diagnosis. The search included all studies up to 1 March 2008 in four databases: AMED, CINAHL, Embase and Medline. Screening, data extraction and analysis were all performed independently by two reviewers. A total of 55 studies were included: 51 individual and 3 aggregated data studies, and 1 combined study. The most common features found were: buttock pain, external tenderness over the greater sciatic notch, aggravation of the pain through sitting and augmentation of the pain with manoeuvres that increase piriformis muscle tension. Future research could start with comparing the frequencies of these features in sciatica patients with and without disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^111xzvJL]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

If the patient has not improved after 6–8 weeks of treatment, imaging should be considered to determine whether a herniated disc with nerve root compression is present. Surgery may be needed to relieve the pressure on the nerve root. There are several surgical methods for treating disc herniation; they include discectomy, microdiscectomy, microendoscopic discectomy, transforaminal endoscopic discectomy and chemonucleolysis. The cauda equine syndrome is an absolute indication for immediate surgery, but elective surgery is the treatment of choice for unilateral sciatica.

Niu et al. suggested that several patients had persistent sciatica, despite lumbar decompression surgery for lumbar disc herniation or stenosis, and the 'piriformis syndrome' was subsequently confirmed through a positive response to the injection of a local anaesthetic agent and pain and weakness on forced passive internal rotation of the extended hip (the Freiberg's sign). Eleven of 12 patients in their study were thus successfully treated for the 'piriformis syndrome' with injections and conservative treatment. The overall satisfaction rate was 83% and they therefore suggested excluding the 'piriformis syndrome' before diagnosing lumbar radiculopathy.

### Piriformis syndrome versus radiculopathy following lumbar artificial disc replacement [^1165htFE]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case series.

Objective

To describe the presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment of five patients with piriformis syndrome after lumbar artificial disc replacement.

Summary Of Background Data

Until recently, spinal fusion was considered the standard for surgical treatment of severe lumbar degenerative disc disease. However, artificial disc replacement now offers an alternative solution. Piriformis syndrome results from entrapment of the sciatic nerve at the greater sciatic notch, with symptoms of pain and numbness radiating from the buttock to the foot, mimicking radiculopathy.

Methods

In this case series, we report five patients who developed piriformis at our institution after artificial disc replacement.

Results

Five patients, aged 35 to 46 years, developed some or all of the following symptoms in the affected leg after artificial disc replacement: posterior leg and buttock pain, calf weakness, and toe and ball of foot numbness and tingling. The onset of symptoms ranged from 6 days to 8 months postoperative, and became debilitating over time. Each patient was diagnosed with piriformis syndrome through physical examination. Three of the patients received a piriformis injection and reported 50% to 100% pain relief lasting 1 to 3 weeks. The patients subsequently underwent physical therapy that provided relief of their piriformis syndrome-related pain and enabled them to resume their normal activities.

Conclusion

Piriformis syndrome has not previously been described in the literature as a sequela of lumbar artificial disc replacement. Our case series indicates that this complication may be underdiagnosed. Careful consideration after artificial disc replacement is required if the patient presents with buttock, leg or foot pain, and/or numbness. It is important for physicians to recognize the symptoms of piriformis syndrome and to differentiate piriformis syndrome from nerve root compression and irritation or referred pain from spinal structures. Although controversial, the proper diagnosis of piriformis syndrome may have prevented some of these patients from undergoing unnecessary surgical procedures.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^116YsWL6]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This was a cross‐sectional study. Ethics approval was granted by the institutional clinical research ethics committee of Qianfoshan Hospital. We collected written consent from all subjects before the examinations. From March 1, 2015 to February 28, 2017, we enrolled patients from the Qianfoshan Hospital with complaints of chronic pain in their buttocks, thighs, and lower limbs.

Inclusion Criteria

To be eligible, the patients had to be 20–80 years old and have no evidence of clinically significant lumbar disk herniation or lumbosacral radiculopathy on MRI. Inclusion criteria for the PS group were the presence of one or more positive PS physical examinations, whereas inclusion in the group of healthy volunteers required a normal physical examination for PS.

Physical Examination

PS was defined by the following criteria reported previously 21: (1) tenderness upon palpation of the greater sciatic notch or piriformis muscle line over the upper edge of the piriformis muscle and stretching from the greater trochanter to the superior boundary of greater sciatic foramen; (2) a positive FAIR test (hip flexion–adduction–internal rotation maneuver test); (3) a positive Pace maneuver test; (4) a positive Beatty maneuver test (buttock pain when the leg was flexed and elevated while the patients were lying on their asymptomatic side); and (5) a positive Freiberg maneuver test.

Exclusion Criteria

None of the patients had a previous surgical history involving the lumbar and/or hip region, abdominal cavity tumors, anatomic variations of the sciatic nerve by MRI, a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 35 kg/m 2, an autoimmune disorder for which they were being treated, clinically significant active or past disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system, a history of buttock or hip infection, active psychiatric diseases, vascular disease, malignancy, or diabetic neuropathy. MRI examination of the lumbar spine, pelvis, hips, and sacroiliac joint were used to rule out other causes of sciatica.

### Acupuncture methods for piriformis syndrome: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116KNCuR]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The piriformis muscle is closely related to the sciatic nerve, as the sciatic nerve passes under or goes through the piriformis muscle. Piriformis syndrome (PS) is a painful disease in the posterior part that restricts hip movement due to persistent contraction of the piriformis muscle and repetitive trauma or ischemia, which may lead to sciatic nerve entrapment, manifested as pain, numbness or tingling in the hip. The prevalence of PS ranged from 12.2% to 27%. PS usually occurs unilaterally in women and middle-aged people. It is estimated that 0.3% to 6% of the people suffering from low back pain and sciatica may be caused by PS, with an annual incidence of around 2.4 million cases of PS.PS not only seriously affects the patients' work and daily activities but also adds a heavy burden of medical costs to society and families.

### Is it painful to be different? Sciatic nerve anatomical variants on MRI and their relationship to piriformis syndrome [^111ivR8P]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the purported relationship between sciatic nerve variant anatomy and piriformis syndrome.

Methods

Over 49 months, 1039 consecutive noncontrast adult hip MRIs were completed for various clinical indications. Repeat and technically insufficient studies were excluded. Radiologists categorized sciatic nerve anatomy into Beaton and Anson anatomical types. Chart review using our institution's cohort search and navigation tool determined the prevalence of the explicit clinical diagnosis of piriformis syndrome (primary endpoint) and sciatica and buttock pain (secondary endpoints). A Z-test compared the prevalence of each diagnosis in the variant anatomy and normal groups.

Results

Seven hundred eighty-three studies were included, with sciatic nerve variants present in 150 hips (19.2%). None of the diagnoses had a statistically significant difference in prevalence between the variant and normal hip groups. Specifically, piriformis syndrome was present in 11.3% of variant hips compared with 9.0% of normal hips (p = 0.39).

Conclusions

There were no significant differences in the prevalence of piriformis syndrome, buttock pain, or sciatica between normal and variant sciatic nerve anatomy. This large-scale correlative radiologic study into the relationship between sciatic nerve variants and piriformis syndrome calls into question this purported relationship.

Key Points

- Large retrospective study relating variant sciatic nerve anatomy, present in 19.2% of hip MRIs, and piriformis syndrome
- While sciatic nerve variant anatomy has previously been implicated in piriformis syndrome in small studies, no relationship was identified between sciatic nerve variants and piriformis syndrome.

### Treatment of an individual with piriformis syndrome focusing on hip muscle strengthening and movement reeducation: a case report [^114J2G9X]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To describe an alternative treatment approach for piriformis syndrome using a hip muscle strengthening program with movement reeducation.

Background

Interventions for piriformis syndrome typically consist of stretching and/or soft tissue massage to the piriformis muscle. The premise underlying this approach is that a shortening or "spasm" of the piriformis is responsible for the compression placed upon the sciatic nerve.

Case Description

The patient was a 30-year-old male with right buttock and posterior thigh pain for 2 years. Clinical findings upon examination included reproduction of symptoms with palpation and stretching of the piriformis. Movement analysis during a single-limb step-down revealed excessive hip adduction and internal rotation, which reproduced his symptoms. Strength assessment revealed weakness of the right hip abductor and external rotator muscles. The patient's treatment was limited to hip-strengthening exercises and movement reeducation to correct the excessive hip adduction and internal rotation during functional tasks.

Outcomes

Following the intervention, the patient reported 0/10 pain with all activities. The initial Lower Extremity Functional Scale questionnaire score of 65/80 improved to 80/80. Lower extremity kinematics for peak hip adduction and internal rotation improved from 15.9 degrees and 12.8 degrees to 5.8 degrees and 5.9 degrees, respectively, during a step-down task.

Discussion

This case highlights an alternative view of the pathomechanics of piriformis syndrome (overstretching as opposed to overshortening) and illustrates the need for functional movement analysis as part of the examination of these patients.

Level Of Evidence

Therapy, level 4.

### Botulinum toxin assessment, intervention and aftercare for paediatric and adult niche indications including pain: international consensus statement [^112Rv8qJ]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence is emerging for the use of botulinum neurotoxin type-A (BoNT-A) for niche indications including pain independent of spasticity. Pain indications such as chronic nociceptive back pain, piriformis syndrome, chronic myofascial pain, pelvic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, facial pain and neuropathic pain are outlined in this paper. Of these, class I evidence is available for the treatment of chronic nociceptive low back pain, piriformis syndrome, myofascial pain, facial pain, neuropathic pain and plantar fasciitis. Peri-operative use of BoNT-A is emerging, with indications including planning for surgery and facilitating surgery, as well as healing and improving analgesia post-operatively. Evidence is limited, although there are some reports that clinicians are successfully using BoNT-A peri-operatively. There is class I evidence showing pre-operative use of BoNT-A has a beneficial effect on outcomes following adductor-release surgery. The use of BoNT for treatment of tremor, other than neck tremor in the setting of cervical dystonia, including evidence for upper limb tremor, cranial tremor and non-dystonic neck tremor is reviewed. The evidence is variable at this stage, and further study is required to develop definitive recommendations for the clinical utility of BoNT-A for these indications.

### Piriformis muscle syndrome: a cross-sectional imaging study in 116 patients and evaluation of therapeutic outcome [^116CqcqX]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To increase the clinical awareness of piriformis muscle syndrome (PMs) by reporting cross-sectional imaging findings, the clinical impact of imaging studies and treatment outcome.

Methods

Within a 10-year-period, 116 patients referred for radiological evaluation of clinically suspected PMs, with excluded lumbar pathology related to symptomatology, were prospectively studied with MRI and/or computed tomography (CT). Piriformis muscle (PM), sciatic nerve (SN), piriformis region and sacroiliac joints were evaluated. PMs was categorised into primary/secondary, according to a reported classification system. Treatment decisions were recorded. Outcome was categorised using a 3-point-scale.

Results

Seventy-four patients (63.8%) exhibited pathologies related to PMs. Primary causes were detected in 12 and secondary in 62 patients. PM enlargement was found in 45.9% of patients, abnormal PM signal intensity/density in 40.5% and sciatic neuritis in 25.7%. Space-occupying lesions represented the most common related pathology. Treatment proved effective in 5/8 patients with primary and 34/51 patients with secondary PMs. In 34 patients, imaging revealed an unknown underlying medical condition and altered treatment planning.

Conclusions

Secondary PMs aetiologies appear to prevail. In suspected PMs, PM enlargement represented the most common imaging finding and space-occupying lesions the leading cause. Imaging had the potential to alter treatment decisions.

Key Points

- In clinically suspected PMs cross-sectional imaging may reveal variable pathology.
- Secondary PMs aetiologies appeared to be more common than primary.
- PM enlargement represented the most common imaging finding in clinically suspected PMs.
- Space-occupying lesions in the piriformis region represented the leading cause of PMs.
- In clinically suspected PMs cross-sectional imaging may alter treatment planning.

### Letter to the editor involving the article' piriformis muscle syndrome: a cross-sectional imaging study in 116 patients and evaluation of therapeutic outcome' [^113to2ry]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points

- Lack of use of local injection test to confirm the diagnosis may lead to miss the diagnosis of PMS of myofascial origin.
- Piriformis muscle syndrome should be diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms, specific physical examinations, and positive response to local injection.
- Sciatic nerve entrapment is not a must in the diagnosis of PMS and PMS is mostly myofascial in origin.

### Piriformis syndrome: diagnosis, treatment, and outcome – a 10-year study [^113RfnHv]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To validate an operational definition of piriformis syndrome based on prolongation of the H-reflex with hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FAIR) and to assess efficacy of conservative therapy and surgery to relieve symptoms and reduce disability.

Design

Before-after trial of cohorts identified by operational definition.

Setting

Outpatient departments of 2 hospitals and 4 physicians' offices. Surgery performed at 3 hospitals.

Patients

Consecutive sample of 918 patients (1014 legs) with follow-up on 733.

Intervention

Patients with significant (3 standard deviations [SDs]) FAIR tests received injection, physical therapy, and serially reported pain and disability assessments. Forty-three patients (6.47%) had surgery.

Main Outcome Measures

Likert pain scale. Subjective estimates of disablement in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.

Results

At 3 SDs, the FAIR test had sensitivity and specificity of.881 and.832, respectively. Seventy-nine percent (514/655) of FAIR test positive (FTP) patients improved 50% or more from injection and physical therapy at a mean follow-up of 10.2 months. Average improvement was 71.1%. Of 385 FTP patients with disability data, mean disability fell from 35.37% prestudy (SD = .2275) to 12.96% poststudy (SD = .1752), a 62.8% improvement. Twenty-eight surgical FTP patients (68.8%) showed 50% or greater improvement; mean improvement was 68% at a mean follow-up of 16 months. Surgery reduced the mean FAIR test to 1.35 ± 2.17 months postoperatively. FTP patients generally improved 10% to 15% more than others after conservative treatment.

Conclusions

The FAIR test correlates well with a working definition of piriformis syndrome and is a better predictor of successful physical therapy and surgery than the working definition. The FAIR test, coupled with injection and physical therapy and/or surgery, appears to be effective means to diagnose and treat piriformis syndrome.

### Efficacy of botulinum toxin, local anesthetics, and corticosteroids in patients with piriformis syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111eFR7B]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is a painful condition caused by entrapment of the sciatic nerve within the piriformis muscle. PS is typically unilateral and mainly occurs related to entrapment of the sciatic nerve. Treatments include physiotherapy, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, behavioral modifications, injection therapy with local anesthetics (LAs) and steroids, epidural injection, botulinum toxin (BT) injection, and surgery.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy of BT, LA, and corticosteroid (CS) injections in relieving pain in patients affected by PS.

Study Design

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the "Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions" and the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses (PRISMA)" guidelines.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted through PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus through April 2021 for studies investigating the efficacy of BT, LA, or CS injection in improving pain in patients with PS. After screening retrieved studies, data were extracted from included studies and pooled. Overall results were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Analysis was performed using RevMan software version 5.4.

Results

Sixteen studies were included in this systematic review, and 12 of them were included in the quantitative synthesis. The pain scores decreased significantly after treatment with BT (SMD = -2.00; 95% CI [-2.84, -1.16], P < 0.001), LA and CS (SMD = -4.34; 95% CI [-5.77, 2.90], P < 0.001), LA (SMD = -3.73; 95% CI [-6.47, -0.99], P = 0.008), CS (SMD = -2.78; 95% CI [-3.56, -2.00], P < 0.001), and placebo injection (SMD = -0.04; 95% CI [-0.07, -0.01], P = 0.002). BT injection was less effective than LA and CS together (P = 0.006), more effective than placebo (P = 0.001), and similar to LA (P = 0.24) and CS (P = 0.18), when injected alone.

Limitations

A wide variety of study designs were utilized to obtain the largest sample size available. Many of the included studies lack randomization, and some are retrospective in nature. These limitations may introduce bias into the analyzed data and affect the results. Many studies had a low sample size and are of moderate quality, limiting the generalizability of the results. Also, we could not conduct a direct meta-analysis due to the lack of sufficient double-arm studies comparing different types of injection therapies.

Conclusions

In patients with PS, satisfactory pain improvement can be obtained by BT, LA plus CS, LA, or CS injection therapy. Injection of LA plus CS showed the best efficacy.

This is a case report of an arthroscopic treatment performed on a patient with piriformis syndrome due to perineural cyst on piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. Confirmation, incision, and drainage of benign cystic lesion on the sciatic nerve below the piriformis muscle were performed following the release of the piriformis tendon through the posterior and posteroinferior arthroscopic portal. Recurrence of the symptoms has not been observed since postoperative period of 20 months. Nor did the MRI taken after the procedure reveal any such recurrence.

### Differential diagnosis of pain around the hip joint [^117HR4ca]. Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad and includes intra-articular pathology, extra-articular pathology, and mimickers, including the joints of the pelvic ring. With the current advancements in hip arthroscopy, more patients are being evaluated for hip pain. In recent years, our understanding of the functional anatomy around the hip has improved. In addition, because of advancements in magnetic resonance imaging, the diagnosis of soft tissue causes of hip pain has improved. All of these advances have broadened the differential diagnosis of pain around the hip joint and improved the treatment of these problems. In this review, we discuss the causes of intra-articular hip pain that can be addressed arthroscopically: labral tears, loose bodies, femoroacetabular impingement, capsular laxity, tears of the ligamentum teres, and chondral damage. Extra-articular diagnoses that can be managed arthroscopically are also discussed, including: iliopsoas tendonitis, "internal" snapping hip, "external" snapping hip, iliotibial band and greater trochanteric bursitis, and gluteal tendon injury. Finally, we discuss extra-articular causes of hip pain that are often managed nonoperatively or in an open fashion: femoral neck stress fracture, adductor strain, piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint pain, athletic pubalgia, "sports hernia", "Gilmore's groin", and osteitis pubis.

### Piriformis muscle injection using ultrasonography and motor stimulation – report of a technique [^113vrQRm]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The piriformis muscle syndrome has been described in the literature since 1947 and accounts for 6–8% of patients presenting with buttock pain, which may variably be associated with sciatica. Through the years, there have been attempts to find safe and effective ways of managing this condition, whether through conservative treatment or with the use of interventional procedures. Several authors have reported injection techniques using the following: nerve stimulation; fluoroscopy with electromyography; and fluoroscopy with muscle stimulation. We aim to describe an injection method which is effective, simple, reproducible, easily available, and safe. This is the first report on the combined use of ultrasonography and motor stimulation in performing piriformis muscle injection. Our technique offers advantages such as: markedly decreased radiation exposure for both patient and doctor; improved visualization of sciatic nerve and surrounding muscles; improved portability; the possibility of being performed as an office-based procedure; and allows for an accurate confirmation of pain in the piriformis muscle with stimulation.

### Deep gluteal syndrome as a cause of posterior hip pain and sciatica-like pain [^115LxdfY]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Deep gluteal syndrome is an increasingly recognized disease entity, caused by compression of the sciatic or pudendal nerve due to non-discogenic pelvic lesions. It includes the piriformis syndrome, the gemelli-obturator internus syndrome, the ischiofemoral impingement syndrome, and the proximal hamstring syndrome. The concept of the deep gluteal syndrome extends our understanding of posterior hip pain due to nerve entrapment beyond the traditional model of the piriformis syndrome. Nevertheless, there has been terminological confusion and the deep gluteal syndrome has often been undiagnosed or mistaken for other conditions. Careful history-taking, a physical examination including provocation tests, an electrodiagnostic study, and imaging are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. After excluding spinal lesions, MRI scans of the pelvis are helpful in diagnosing deep gluteal syndrome and identifying pathological conditions entrapping the nerves. It can be conservatively treated with multidisciplinary treatment including rest, the avoidance of provoking activities, medication, injections, and physiotherapy. Endoscopic or open surgical decompression is recommended in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after conservative treatment or in those who may have masses compressing the sciatic nerve. Many physicians remain unfamiliar with this syndrome and there is a lack of relevant literature. This comprehensive review aims to provide the latest information about the epidemiology, aetiology, pathology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^112Rkiv9]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several studies in patients with piriformis syndrome showed that US-guided perisciatic injection of anesthetic-corticosteroids is a safe procedure that provides good symptom relief. In up to 50% of patients, symptoms may relapse, and additional perisciatic injections are warranted. A prospective randomized controlled study in patients with piriformis syndrome showed that the addition of corticosteroid to anesthetic does not provide additional benefit. On the other hand, a recent uncontrolled study on 30 patients showed that US-guided piriformis injection of corticosteroid-anesthetic seems to be effective for both somatic and neuropathic pain in piriformis syndrome patients at 1 week and 1 month.
4 US-guided injection of botulinum toxin A in the piriformis muscle might offer long-term management of piriformis syndrome but evidence is limited; thus, its application in daily practice is still questionable.

In the small case series by Rodríguez-Piñero et al. 6 months after the injection three patients were asymptomatic and three were feeling better. Multiple injections may be administered over the course of treatment. It has been shown that symptom relief after US-guided injections of botulinum toxin A into the piriformis muscle may be due to atrophy and fatty infiltration of the muscle.

### The effects of ultrasound guided ozone and lidocaine injections in… [^112Ze37B]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Piriformis Syndrome is defined as a trap neuropathy that involves compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle, leading to a number of symptoms along with sciatic pain, initially in the hip muscles. In clinical practice, it is estimated to be between 12. 2–27%. Repetitive movements with increased demand on the piriformis muscle can lead to increased muscle tension, compression of the sciatic nerve within the muscle, and the development of PS. Additionally, the anatomical structure of the piriformis muscle and the alignment and damage of adjacent structures play a role in the pathophysiology of sciatic nerve compression in PS. It is considered in pathophysiology that a morphological change may cause compression of the sciatic nerve or the relationships of different anatomical structures that change with biomechanical restrictions.

Pain is observed along the ipsilateral sciatic nerve distribution due to compression of the sciatic nerve. Additionally, it has been observed that patients with PS are accompanied by weakness in the gluteal muscles, mostly in the gluteus maximus and medius muscles. Accompanying weakness has an effect on static and dynamic posture. The negative effect of pain on posture has also been shown in studies. Pain and muscle changes in the lower extremities also cause disability and postural instability. It has been reported that static and dynamic postural balance is reduced in PS compared to healthy controls. Conservative treatment for PS significantly reduces pain with a wide range of therapeutic alternatives. Since ozone injection does not have side effects or major complications, its use in the treatment of myofascial pain syndromes and piriformis syndrome is supported by studies.

It has an analgesic effect, increasing the pain threshold by activating serotonin-mediated pathways to release endogenous opioids. It was planned as a randomized controlled study. Patients diagnosed with Priformis Syndrome will be evaluated and their demographic data and examination information will be recorded. Patients will be divided into 2 groups: ozone and lidocaine injections by computerized randomization. If there is a contraindication for ozone, the patient will be included in the lidocaine group, and similarly, if the patient has a contraindication for lidocaine, the patient will be included in the ozone group. According to G-power analysis, a total of 28 patients, 14 for each group, will be included in the study.

### BOTOX and physical therapy in the treatment of piriformis syndrome [^117KS4jD]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluates the efficacy of botulinum toxin A injections used in conjunction with physical therapy for the treatment of piriformis syndrome.

Design

This a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial using electrophysiologic criteria for patient selection and a visual analog scale to assess treatment efficacy in relieving pain.

Results

As measured on the visual analog scale, patients injected with botulinum toxin A experienced more relief from pain than patients receiving lidocaine with steroid (P < 0.05) and more relief than patients receiving placebo (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Injection with botulinum toxin A is an effective adjunct to physical therapy in the treatment of piriformis syndrome. H-reflex prolongation by flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FAIR test) beyond 1.86 msec (3 SD) of the mean is a clinical indication of piriformis syndrome.

### Piriformis syndrome, diagnosis and treatment [^1152xMTz]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is an uncommon cause of sciatica that involves buttock pain referred to the leg. Diagnosis is often difficult, and it is one of exclusion due to few validated and standardized diagnostic tests. Treatment for PS has historically focused on stretching and physical therapy modalities, with refractory patients also receiving anesthetic and corticosteroid injections into the piriformis muscle origin, belly, muscle sheath, or sciatic nerve sheath. Recently, the use of botulinum toxin (BTX) to treat PS has gained popularity. Its use is aimed at relieving sciatic nerve compression and inherent muscle pain from a tight piriformis. BTX is being used increasingly for myofascial pain syndromes, and some studies have demonstrated superior efficacy to corticosteroid injection. The success of BTX in treating PS supports the prevailing pathoanatomic etiology of the condition and suggests a promising future for BTX in the treatment of other myofascial pain syndromes.

### Treatment strategies for ischiofemoral impingement: a systematic review [^117XmSDt]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-surgical treatment

Of the 17 studies found in the systematic review, five studies reported on conservative treatment. The studies described the results of 'standard' conservative methods, e.g. the combination of rest, activity modification, taking NSAIDs and gabapentin, physiotherapy, hot packs, and ultrasound-guided injections. All the studies reported good short-term results (from 2 weeks to 1 year) without any complications. This seems to be similar to the management of other impingement syndromes wherein the first line of therapy is usually conservative, because of its less invasive approach and good patient outcomes. Females also tend to have a higher incidence of IFI than males and this might be due to the anatomy of the female pelvis. Females have a wider and a shallower pelvis with a more prominent LT than in males that could lead to IFI.

Ultrasound-guided QF muscle injection was reported to be clinically effective. The anatomical location of the QF and its relation to the sciatic nerve could explain why this intervention could be useful. The sciatic nerve is closely located between the anterior surface of the gluteus maximus and the posterior surface of the QF and therefore any inflammation or spasm of this muscle will lead to irritation of the sciatic nerve. Injection of steroid, in this case, would be effective in terms of relieving the pain. Another study reported that one of the ways to treat buttock pain arising from the piriformis muscle was to inject steroids and local anaesthetic. Another study proposed that injection of QF muscle under ultrasound guidance would be an accurate and safe procedure, as for a piriformis muscle injection, an ultrasound-guided injection was known to be more accurate than a fluoroscopically guided injection in a cadaveric model and the two techniques were reported to have no difference in clinical outcomes. Under ultrasound guidance, they injected 8 mL of 0.25% lidocaine into the QF muscle of 14 patients who had deep tenderness localised to a point halfway between the lateral prominence of the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity corresponding to the location of the QF muscle belly, and the mean pain score decreased by 49.3% in 2 weeks after the injection. They reported narrowing of the ischiofemoral space was not found in 3 of 14 patients, so their samples might include patients with other pathology, e.g. piriformis syndrome or myofascial pain syndrome.

### Botulinum toxin – A for the treatment of neuralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FZbHV]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we comprehensively summarized the current evidence and found lower pain scores up to 24 weeks after BTX-A treatment compared with saline in patients with neuropathic pain. Additionally, there were no serious adverse events associated with BTX-A injections.

Recently, there are several published meta-analyses regarding the use of BTX-A in neuralgia. Morra et alevaluated BTX-A therapy in trigeminal neuralgia, suggesting that BTX-A may be an effective and safe option. However, only four RCTs were included in their study. Shackleton et alanalyzed six RCTs and showed that BTX-A alleviated trigeminal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia. Another meta-analysis by Lakhan et alindicated that BTX-A treatment improved diabetic neuropathic pain with the results of only two trials. In our study, we included 12 RCTs to determine the effects of BTX-A treatment at three different time points (4, 12, and 24 weeks). Our results suggested that BTX-A treatment could relieve neuropathic pain both in the short term and in the long run.

This meta-analysis included studies of trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, and other types of chronic neuropathic pain (peripheral neuropathic pain, thoracic outlet syndrome, piriformis syndrome, and spinal cord injury). Of these, piriformis syndrome is a myofascial condition caused by a nerve entrapment where BTX-A injections reduce the pain by relieving muscle spasms. In cases of other conditions responsible for neuropathic pain including occipital neuralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, and phantom limb pain, BTX-A was also reported to help reduce the pain. For six patients with occipital neuralgia, BTX-A improved the sharp/shooting type of pain. One report showed that BTX-A relieved symptoms in five women with carpal tunnel syndrome suggesting the long-lasting antinociceptive effects of BTX-A, while another study found it did not provide significant relief of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. For amputee patients, BTX-A resulted in improvement of residual limb pain and pain tolerance. However, no RCT for these types of neuropathic pain could be identified through our literature search.

### Surgical management of deep gluteal syndrome causing sciatic nerve entrapment: a systematic review [^111fK3id]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the causes, surgical indications, patient-reported clinical outcomes, and complications in patients with deep gluteal syndrome causing sciatic nerve entrapment.

Methods

Three databases (PubMed, Ovid [MEDLINE], and Embase) were searched by 2 reviewers independently from database inception until September 7, 2016. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting on both arthroscopic and open surgery and those with Level I to IV evidence. Systematic reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, and technical reports with no outcome data were excluded. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed with the MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies) tool.

Results

The search identified 1,539 studies, of which 28 (481 patients; mean age, 48 years) were included for assessment. Of the studies, 24 were graded as Level IV, 3 as Level III, and 1 as Level II. The most commonly identified causes were iatrogenic (30%), piriformis syndrome (26%), trauma (15%), and non-piriformis (hamstring, obturator internus) muscle pathology (14%). The decision to pursue surgical management was made based on clinical findings and diagnostic investigations alone in 50% of studies, whereas surgical release was attempted only after failed conservative management in the other 50%. Outcomes were positive, with an improvement in pain at final follow-up (mean, 23 months) reported in all 28 studies. The incidence of complications from these procedures was low: Fewer than 1% and 8% of open surgical procedures and 0% and fewer than 1% of endoscopic procedures resulted in major (deep wound infection) and minor complications, respectively.

Conclusions

Although most of the studies identified were case series and reports, the results consistently showed improvement in pain and a low incidence of complications, particularly for endoscopic procedures. These findings lend credence to surgical management as a viable option for buttock pain caused by deep gluteal syndrome and warrant further investigation.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, systematic review of Level II through IV studies.

### Acupuncture methods for piriformis syndrome: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1167eLaf]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PS is caused by hypertrophy of the piriformis muscle compressing the sciatic nerve and manifests as signs and symptoms of sciatica, which are exacerbated by activity, prolonged sitting or walking.PS is a common and complex disease in the population, which seriously affects peoples' quality of life. The treatment of PS usually includes short-term rest, the use of muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. However, many patients with PS do not choose these treatments because of their poor pain relief and high side effects. In recent years, there have been many reports on the use of intramuscular injection therapy in the treatment of PS. Severe cases may require surgery, but the efficacy and safety of it for PS treatment is controversy. Recent studies have found that acupuncture is effective and safe in the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, there is a lack of relevant evidence-based medical evidence for PS.

NMA is a technique that integrates multiple variables for direct and indirect comparisons, which can be used to compare the efficacy of multiple treatments simultaneously in a single analysis.NMA for direct and indirect comparisons in a group of treatments, limited to the results of RCT studies, heterogeneity and inconsistency, which can analyze the inter-relationship between multiple interventions. In our protocol, only studies published in English or Chinese will be included, which may lead to potential selection bias. Our NMA will clearly define the types of acupuncture therapies included and their combined use to fully evaluate their effectiveness in the management of PS, which will be more persuasive. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first standard pairwise meta-analysis and NMA of acupuncture therapies for the treatment of PS. Despite these limitations, our proposed methodology will compare the efficacies of different acupuncture methods in the treatment of PS, so as to provide a clinical evidence-based medical basis.

### Ultrasound-guided piriformis injection: technique description and verification [^111djojy]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Piriformis injections are commonly used in the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with buttock pain syndromes. Because of its small size, deep location, and relation to adjacent neurovascular structures, the piriformis is traditionally injected by using electromyographic, fluoroscopic, computed tomographic, or magnetic resonance imaging guidance. This report describes and verifies a technique for performing ultrasound-guided piriformis injections. Ultrasound offers several advantages over traditional imaging approaches, including accessibility, compact size, lack of ionizing radiation exposure, and direct visualization of neurovascular structures. With appropriate training and experience, interested physiatrists can consider implementing ultrasound-guided piriformis injections into their clinical practices.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^112nAqRP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Non-surgical approaches for retro-trochanteric pain syndrome

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants have been reported to be beneficial in patients with low back pain, including the piriformis syndrome. Fishman et al. reported a good outcome in patients with piriformis syndrome using NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, ice and rest. Injections of anaesthetic agents with or without steroids have been reported with varying results, but this kind of disease often tends to be chronic and pharmacological treatment is recommended for a short time period. Physiotherapy is recommended as the first choice of treatment.

A number of methods exist for conservative treatment of the 'piriformis syndrome' in the hip region. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has also been suggested and injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), as used in other tendinopathies, can be an option.

Many studies have focused on the relaxation of the piriformis muscle. Even though it is an external rotator, the piriformis muscle has been found to rotate the femur internally when the hip is in flexion. Meknas et al. did not choose to perform the stretching exercises in external rotation. Assuming that a tense internal obturator muscle caused the problems, a different procedure was chosen. To our knowledge, there has been no description of a change in action for the internal obturator muscle from external to internal rotation when the hip is in flexion. In the above cohort study, Meknas et al. reported most pain during passive internal rotation and this was therefore regarded as an efficient stretching manoeuvre for the obturator muscle.

Maximum stretching of the internal obturator muscle was thought to be obtained by passive internal rotation, with simultaneous flexion and adduction of the hip. General stretching of the hip muscles was performed in addition, supported by the observation that most muscles around the hip appear to be tense in patients with retro-trochanteric pain syndrome. Specific attention was, however, paid to the small rotators, because their proximity to the sciatic nerve could theoretically cause problems with sciatica-like pain.

### Piriformis syndrome: comparison of the effectiveness of local anesthetic and corticosteroid injections: a double-blinded, randomized controlled study [^114BrJeT]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome (PS), which is characterized by pain radiating to the gluteal region and posterior leg, is accepted as one of the causes of sciatalgia. Although the importance of local piriformis muscle injections whenever PS is clinically suspected has been shown in many studies, there are not enough studies considering the clinical efficacy of these injections.

Objective

To investigate the differences between local anesthetic (LA) and LA + corticosteroid (CS) injections in the treatment of PS.

Study Design

A prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Physical medicine and rehabilitation department of a university hospital.

Methods

Fifty-seven patients having unilateral hip and/or leg pain with positive FAIR test and tenderness and/or trigger point at the piriformis muscle were evaluated. Out of 50 patients randomly assigned to 2 groups, 47 patients whose pain resolved at least 50% from the baseline after the injection were diagnosed as having PS. The first group (n = 22) received 5 mL of lidocaine 2% while the second group (n = 25) received 4 mL of lidocaine 2% + 1 mL of betametazone under the guidance of ultrasound.

Outcome Assessment

Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Likert Analogue Scale (LAS).

Results

No statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) was detected between the groups in NRS score values at resting (P = 0.814), night (P = 0.830), and in motion (P = 0.145), and LAS values with long duration of sitting (P = 0.547), standing (P = 0.898), and lying (P = 0.326) with evaluations at baseline, first week, and first and third months after the injection. A statistically highly significant (P < 0.005) reduction of pain was evaluated through NRS scores at resting (P = 0.001), in motion (P = 0.001), and at night (P = 0.001) and LAS values with long duration of sitting (P = 0.001), standing (P = 0.001), and lying (P = 0.001) in both of the groups.

Limitations

Presumed limitations of this study include having a relatively small sample.

Conclusion

LA injections for the PS were found to be clinically effective. However, addition of CS to LA did not give an additional benefit. This gives us the idea that PS is mostly muscular in origin and responds well to both LA and LA+CS injections.

### A novel piriformis injection technique utilizing combined fluoroscopy and ultrasound – A pilot study [^111bnAjh]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome is a constellation of symptoms associated with low back, gluteal, and sciatic pain. One treatment for piriformis syndrome is the injection of local anesthetic, steroid, or botulinum toxin into the piriformis muscle. Various approaches for needle navigation into the piriformis muscle have been described using fluoroscopy or ultrasound. This study introduces a new method of image guidance combining fluoroscopy and ultrasound.

Objectives

The primary aim of this study was examining whether the imaging modality used for needle guidance was associated with significant differences in pre- and post-piriformis injection pain scores. Secondary objectives were assessing differences in adverse events and procedure time.

Study Design

This study is a retrospective cohort study.

Settings

This study was conducted at Oregon Health and Science University's Comprehensive Pain Center, Portland, OR, USA.

Methods

Institutional chart review was performed from 09/21/2014 to 01/21/2020 to identify patients that underwent piriformis steroid injections which generated a list of 95 patients and totaled 154 procedures. Inclusion criteria were met for 78 patients and 109 procedures. Pain scores were modeled longitudinally using robust variance estimates. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for procedure duration, while adverse events were too rare to evaluate statistically.

Results

Piriformis steroid injections using the combined ultrasound and fluoroscopy technique had the lowest mean post-procedure pain score of 1.3 (SD 1.7) and the largest change in pain with a score difference of -3.9 (SD 2.1). Procedure durations were 8 (quartiles 5 to 10), 10 (quartiles 7 to 13), and 11 minutes (quartiles 9 to 13) for fluoroscopy alone, ultrasound alone, and combined techniques, respectively. All 3 modalities had duration ranges of minimum time of 3–5 minutes and a maximum time of 25–28 minutes. Adverse events across all imaging strategies were noted in 5 patients at the time of procedure and in 7 patients during follow-up appointments, the most common symptom being transient leg weakness or numbness.

Limitations

The major limitation is the retrospective collection of data. Another limitation is that 6 different providers performed the injections, which may influence procedural consistency. Additionally, the inclusion of subjects with low pre-procedure pain scores could create a floor effect that minimized the occurrence of clinically significant shifts in pain scores. Adverse events were too few across all groups to assess.

Conclusion

Piriformis injections using combined fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance provides comparable efficiency to standard techniques and may result in improved accuracy into the target and thus improved efficacy. Larger prospective trials are required to comprehensively examine the efficacy of this novel technique.

### Evaluation of the complications and outcomes of endoscopic and open surgical treatment of piriformis syndrome: a systematic review [^11432QxF]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Piriformis syndrome (PS), also known as deep gluteal pain syndrome, is a disorder for which surgical treatment has been proven to be effective. However, there is no current consensus on the types and rates of complications after surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the types of complications and the frequency at which they occur based on the surgical technique, as well as determine whether complete versus incomplete tenotomy affects outcomes.

Methods

Searches using Pubmed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were done for PS surgical outcomes studies. Reporting quality was assessed through MINORs criteria. Complications were compared across studies.

Results

Seventeen studies were identified with inclusion of 386 total patients (range 1 to 64). Mean MINORS reporting quality was 10.3 of 16 for noncomparative and 17.6 of 24 for comparative studies. Complications were seen in 49 of 386 cases (12.7%). The most common reported complication was lack of relief (4.9%), followed by recurrence of symptoms (2.6%), wound/infection (2.3%), hip abduction weakness (1.6%), posterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury (1%), and foreign body reaction (0.3%). Outcomes were favorable across all studies, and complication type and frequency were similar regardless of open versus endoscopic surgical approach. We found limited evidence that incomplete tenotomy is a negative predictor of improvement with piriformis surgery. No acute or delayed sciatic nerve injuries were reported.

Conclusion

For surgical treatment of PS, complication type and frequency are similar regardless of an open versus endoscopic approach. Incomplete tenotomy may increase the risk for lack of symptom relief.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^112Z58V8]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.7 ‐4 radiculopathy mimics

Conditions in this section are among the most challenging to diagnose, even for experienced specialists in musculoskeletal conditions, and may therefore be underrecognized radiculopathy mimics.

4.7.1 internus syndrome

The superior and inferior gemelli along with obturator internus, which are external rotators of the hip, form a conjoint tendon known as triceps coxae, which inserts into the greater trochanter between piriformis superiorly and quadratus femoris inferiorly. The putative pathoanatomic explanation for gemelli–obturator syndrome is compression of the sciatic nerve as it emerges from deep to piriformis and courses superficial to the gemelli–obturator complex due to stretching of the latter muscle group. This theory is supported by a study demonstrating curvature of the sciatic nerve resulting from the stretch of the gemelli and obturator internus with hip internal rotation as demonstrated with dynamic ultrasound in cadavers and healthy volunteers. Gemelli–obturator internus syndrome is thought to result in retro‐trochanteric pain, which could be confused with lower sacral radiculopathy. The clinician suspecting the presence of this syndrome should assess for a reproduction of symptoms with passive internal rotation of the hip. The imaging modality of choice is MRI.

4.7.2 Coccydynia

Coccydynia, or coccyx/tailbone pain, more commonly affects women than men and has many potential etiologies, including idiopathic and traumatic causes like coccyx fracture. Although a rare diagnosis, estimated to account for 1% of nontraumatic axial spine pain, coccydynia warrants mention because of its potentially disabling nature and the specific investigations and management required. While usually considered non‐neurogenic in origin, pain in the region of the coccyx may arise from compression of lower spinal nerve roots. Coccydynia is characterized by pain and tenderness of the lower sacrum at the site of the coccyx or sacrococcygeal articulation. Patients may report pain that worsens with prolonged sitting, pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), and pain with defecation (dyschezia). Imaging should include dynamic plain films with standing and sitting views that can reveal pathologic motion. A favorable response to interventional pain treatment would support coccyx pain over lower sacral radiculopathy.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: a comprehensive review [^111xZWFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Piriformis Syndrome

PS occurs when the piriformis muscle compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve, causing symptoms such as buttock and leg pain, altered sensations along the nerve's path, and discomfort while sitting. This condition is more commonly discussed in hip preservation literature, with a few reports in patients post-THA.

Clinical Presentation

Patients often present with vague symptoms that considerably overlap with those of other hip, pelvic, and lumbar spine pathologies, making precise clinical assessment challenging. Multiple clinical tests have been described: the straight leg raise test has a sensitivity of 15% and a specificity of 95%, the active piriformis test shows a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 80%, and the seated piriformis stretch test has a sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 90%. Furthermore, combining the active piriformis test with the seated piriformis stretch test yields a reported sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 80%.

Diagnosis Studies

A lumbar MRI examination should be considered to rule out underlying back pathology. Improved MRI resolution, the use of ultrasound-guided injections, and increased awareness may enhance the accuracy of diagnosing PS. However, in our experience, no single diagnostic tool is reliably accurate when used in isolation. The diagnosis is most accurately confirmed when guided injections are used in cases with a high degree of clinical suspicion.

Treatment

Initial management of PS involves rest, activities modifications, NSAIDs, and guided steroids injections, which typically yield positive responses in most cases.

For recalcitrant cases, surgical interventions, such as sciatic neurolysis and piriformis tenotomy, have been the mainstays of treatment, with both open and endoscopic techniques showing favorable outcomes. For instance, Uchio et al presented a case report of a patient with bilateral PS, 4 and 6 years after a cementless THA. After failing conservative treatment, the patient underwent open tenotomy and sciatic neurolysis, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms. The modern endoscopic release of the piriformis tendon and exploration of the sciatic nerve is currently the standard of treatment for these unresponsive cases(Figure 5).

### Evaluation and management of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome with an overview of surgical approaches: a comprehensive review [^11538j8u]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Minimally Invasive Treatment

There is evidence that supports the administration of botulinum toxin (BTX) to the cervicothoracic musculature as a treatment for NTOS. This toxin is produced by Clostridium botulinum, which can cause severe muscle weakness, nervous system dysfunction, and respiratory distress if poisoning occurs.BTX has 7 known serotypes, two of which are approved by the FDA for clinical use in humans: BTX type A and B. All types cleave SNARE proteins, thereby preventing the synaptic fusion that promotes release of neurotransmitters for muscle contraction (eg acetylcholine). Ultimately, the therapeutic use of this toxin results in reduced muscle overactivity, and possibly decreased pain and inflammation. Other approved uses of botulinum toxin include hemifacial spasm, blepharospasm, strabismus, cervical dystonia, and chronic migraine. At present, the use of botulinum toxin has expanded to include treatment of cervicothoracic muscular pain, lumbosacral myofascial pain, piriformis syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.

In NTOS, injection of BTX-A (eg onabotulinum toxin A) into the ASM, MSM, or even the pectoralis minor muscle can be a beneficial therapeutic intervention. One study suggests that BTX-A can also be used to predict patients who will respond positively to operative intervention. For instance, a recent study demonstrated that a better response to BTX injections correlated positively with a better response to surgery (generally first rib resection and scalenectomy) with a high degree of specificity (90%). This same study also noted that there was a positive predictive value of 99% for patients who responded to BTX and subsequently responded to surgery. Therapeutically, a retrospective analysis of 41 patients with suspected NTOS who underwent 92 BTX injections in total (58 ASM, 33 pectoralis minor, and 1 subclavius) showed a 69% rate of pain relief. The mean time to symptom improvement was 12 days, with an average duration of 31 days (range of 5–75 days). A prospective analysis by Christo et alshowed significant pain reduction at two months with extension to three months.

### Piriformis-sparing minimally invasive versus the standard posterior approach for total hip arthroplasty: a 10-year follow-up of a randomized control trial [^1139kY4F]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the popularity of minimally invasive approaches in total hip arthroplasty, studies regarding their impact on soft tissues and long-term benefits are lacking. This study aims to compare the 10-year functional outcome of the piriformis-sparing minimally invasive approach to the standard posterior approach for total hip arthroplasty surgery.

Methods

Hundred patients were randomized, 48 patients to the piriformis-sparing approach and 52 to the standard approach. Primary outcomes were hip function and piriformis muscle volume and grade on magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes were pain, satisfaction score, and complications. Evaluators were blinded to allocation. Participants were followed up to 10 years.

Results

Ten years following surgery, both groups reported excellent pain relief, improved hip function, and high satisfaction. The significant differences were improvement in piriformis muscle volume (P = 0.001) and muscle grade (P = 0.007) in the piriformis-sparing group compared to the standard group. There were no significant differences in all other outcomes.

Conclusion

Aside from being less injurious to the piriformis muscle, the piriformis-sparing approach offered the same long-term functional benefits as the standard posterior approach at 10 years.

### Botulinum toxin injections for low-back pain and sciatica [^113zTzbv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate relief from low-back pain (LBP) is not always possible. Emerging evidence suggests a role for botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections in treating pain disorders. Proponents of BoNT suggest its properties can decrease muscle spasms, ischemia and inflammatory markers, thereby reducing pain.

Objectives

To determine the effects of botulinum toxin injections in adults with LBP.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 3) and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to August 2009; screened references from included studies; consulted with content experts and Allergan. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials without language restrictions

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that evaluated BoNT serotypes versus other treatments in patients with non-specific LBP of any duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria, and extracted the data using standardized forms. We performed a qualitative analysis due to lack of data.

Main Results

We excluded evidence from nineteen studies due to non-randomisation, incomplete or unpublished data. We included three randomised trials (N = 123 patients). Only one study included patients with chronic non-specific LBP; the other two examined unique subpopulations. Only one of the three trials had a low risk of bias and demonstrated that BoNT injections reduced pain at three and eight weeks and improved function at eight weeks better than saline injections. The second trial showed that BoNT injections were better than injections of corticosteroid plus lidocaine or placebo in patients with sciatica attributed to piriformis syndrome. The third trial concluded that BoNT injections were better than traditional acupuncture in patients with third lumbar transverse process syndrome. Both studies with high risk of bias had several key limitations. Heterogeneity of the studies prevented meta-analysis. There is low quality evidence that BoNT injections improved pain, function, or both better than saline injections and very low quality evidence that they were better than acupuncture or steroid injections.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified three studies that investigated the merits of BoNT for LBP, but only one had a low risk of bias and evaluated patients with non-specific LBP (N = 31). Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it. Future trials should standardize patient populations, treatment protocols and comparison groups, enlist more participants and include long-term outcomes, cost-benefit analysis and clinical relevance of findings.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^116cMDkM]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Direct massage by a physiotherapist of the tendons of the small external rotators at their insertion at the trochanter was also a part of the treatment programme. Anatomically, the internal obturator muscle is deep to both the piriformis muscle and the sciatic nerve and it runs parallel to the piriformis in its attachment to the trochanter major. Because of its proximity, similar pathway and function, most conservative treatments for patients with 'piriformis syndrome' would affect the internal obturator muscle as well. Guvencer et al. suggested that the internal obturator, gemelli and quadratus femoris tendons share common insertions with the piriformis tendon and can thereby compensate for the loss of its function. The fusion of the piriformis tendon with the obturator internus tendon has previously been confirmed. In the study by Meknas et al. clinical improvement was seen only after the specific treatment programme. It has been suggested that retro-trochanteric pain caused by the piriformis or internal obturator syndrome is often under-diagnosed or overlooked in the clinical setting, because the symptoms may be similar to lumbar spine disorders, such as disc herniations or spinal stenosis.

### Analysis of acupoint selection and combinations in acupuncture treatment of piriformis syndrome: a protocol for data mining [^115TtEAu]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is a medical condition that is distinguished by sensations of tingling, numbness, and discomfort in the gluteal region, which often extend to the back of the thigh. This is caused by the entrapment of the sciatic nerve at the greater sciatic notch. The piriformis muscle exhibits a close association with the sciatic nerve, given that the sciatic nerve traverses beneath or within the piriformis muscle.PS is a condition characterized by persistent contraction of the piriformis muscle in the posterior region, resulting in restricted hip movement. This condition is often caused by repetitive trauma or ischemia, which can lead to the entrapment of the sciatic nerve. The symptoms of PS include pain, numbness, or tingling in the hip, which may be intensified by compression and deep palpation. The prevalence of PS ranged from 12.2% to 27%, and it typically affects women and middle-aged people.PS is believed to be responsible for low back pain and sciatica in a range of 0.3% to 6% of individuals, resulting in an estimated annual incidence of roughly 2.4 million cases. It not only severely affects the patients' work and daily activities, but also imposes a significant financial burden on society and families.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in piriformis syndrome: a case report [^113ZNk7c]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome (PS) is an unusual cause of sciatica that, because of the lack of strict diagnostic criteria, remains a controversial clinical entity. The diagnosis of PS is still primarily clinical because no diagnostic tests have proven to be definitive. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman, affected by a severe scoliosis, who developed a persistent buttock pain resembling that of PS. The clinical suspicion was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis, which showed an enlargement of the left piriformis muscle with an anterior isplacement of the sciatic nerve. The role of MRI in the diagnosis, clinical definition, and therapeutic approach to PS is discussed.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^111kEoX2]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Following a Delphi-based consensus, nine evidence-based statements on clinical indications of image-guided musculoskeletal interventional procedures of peripheral nerves of the lower limb were produced by an expert panel of the ESSR. None of the statements reached the highest level of evidence. Statements regarding image-guided interventional procedures to treat Morton's neuroma have been reported in a separate paper.

This consensus paper on the published evidence regarding image-guided procedures of the peripheral nerves of the lower limb offers some interesting insights. Most published papers on this topic concern interventional procedures on the sciatic nerve and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve; for these nerves, prospective randomized clinical trials have shown that US-guided perineural injection of anesthetics provides good pain improvement in piriformis syndrome (statement #3) and effective post-operative analgesia (statement #5), respectively. Several image-guided interventional techniques have been described to treat the piriformis syndrome involving different targets, drugs, and volumes. Most authors agree that US-guided perisciatic injection of local anesthetics alone or combined with corticosteroids is a reasonable and effective option that can be considered as a therapeutic alternative before surgery, especially when the diagnosis is not fully clear, but also as a diagnostic procedure. Turning to the US-guided block of the lateral femoral cutaneus nerve, several authors have investigated the potential application of this procedure reporting its safety and effectiveness for reaching post-operative analgesia after reconstructive surgery with lateral/anterolateral skin graft or hip arthroplasty. This intervention may be considered for optimal comfort throughout the post-operative period improving the management of patients subjected to surgery in the hip/thigh region. However, only small retrospective studies have investigated the efficacy of alternative procedures on these two nerves. Specifically, initial promising results have been obtained by injecting botulinum toxin A under US guidance in patients with piriformis syndrome (statement #4), but this procedure needs to be supported by further data. Also concerning US-guided corticosteroid perineural injections (statement #6) and ablation (statement #7) of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in meralgia paresthetica, only a small series have highlighted the effectiveness of these procedures.

### Piriformis syndrome: correlation of muscle morphology with symptoms and signs [^1132CbqX]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relation of symptoms and pain provocation tests to abnormal piriformis morphology among people with chronic buttock pain.

Design

Each of 2 clinical symptoms and 2 clinical signs were compared with the abnormal morphology found on ultrasound. The pain-free side was used as an internal control.

Setting

A tertiary referral center.

Participants

A series of 27 consecutive patients (26 women, 1 man; average age, 48 y) with chronic low lumbosacral or buttock pain, who presented to a musculoskeletal clinic over a 12-month period, underwent ultrasound assessment of piriformis muscle morphology. Four patients were excluded because their body mass index was in excess of 30 kg/m 2.

Intervention

The symptomatic piriformis muscle was injected with bupivacaine after pain was assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS), using the resisted abduction test.

Main Outcome Measure

A 70% reduction of pain on the VAS was considered positive for pain in the piriformis muscle.

Results

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing each of the signs and symptoms with normal morphology. The highest ORs were found for pain on walking up inclines (10.8), referred pain (5.3), and pain on needling the piriformis muscle (6.0).

Conclusions

This study did not provide a criterion standard for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome, but it did support the syndrome as a contributing factor in chronic buttock pain and very low back pain.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^114hAf6p]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Image-guided pudendal nerve block is safe, effective, and well tolerated with few complications.

Level of evidence: 2

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

A successful pudendal nerve block is crucial for the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia and provides guidance for treatment. Different studies, including two randomized controlled trials, demonstrated the absence of complications for this procedure. Furthermore, no significant difference in terms of efficacy was demonstrated between US and fluoroscopic guidance.
2 US-guided interventional procedures around the genitofemoral nerve are feasible and effective, but evidence is only supported by a small series.

Level of evidence: 4

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

US-guided procedures around the genitofemoral nerve are usually performed in conjunction with other nerve procedures (e.g. ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric nerves); thus, in some papers, it is not easy to differentiate the outcomes of the various procedures. Furthermore, the results are reported on small series. Lee et al. reported the results of radiofrequency ablation of the genitofemoral nerve in four patients, with a reported 100% reduction of pain up to 12 months.
3 US-guided perisciatic injection of anesthetic provides good symptom relief in patients with piriformis syndrome; however, the addition of corticosteroids to local anesthetics still has an unclear role.

Level of evidence: 2

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

### Piriformis syndrome and low back pain: a new classification and review of the literature [^115uf7VV]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is a common cause of low back pain. It is often not included in the differential diagnosis of back, buttock, and leg pain. Additionally it has received minimal recognition because it is often seen as a diagnosis of exclusion. Familiarity with the common elements of the syndrome should increase its recognition and facilitate the appropriate treatment. These include buttock pain and tenderness with or without electrodiagnostic or neurologic signs. Pain is exacerbated in prolonged sitting. Specific physical findings are tenderness in the sciatic notch and buttock pain in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) of the hip. Imaging modalities are rarely helpful, but electrophysiologic studies should confirm the diagnosis, if not immediately, then certainly in a patient re-evaluation and as such should be sought persistently. Physical therapy aims at stretching the muscle and reducing the vicious cycle of pain and spasm. It is a mainstay of conservative treatment, usually enhanced by local injections. Surgery should be reserved as a last resort in case of failure of all conservative modalities. Piriformis syndrome may constitute up to 5% of cases of low back, buttock, and leg pain. Recognition and widespread appreciation of the clinical presentation improves its early detection and accurate treatment.

### Ultrasound-guided dry needling decreases pain in patients with piriformis syndrome [^114JsPVP]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is a disorder that can lead to symptoms of buttock pain and limited hip-joint mobility, and may have an impact on quality of life.

Methods

Thirty-two patients with PMS were randomized to the treatment group, which included three sessions of ultrasound-guided dry needling (DN) of the piriformis muscle (n = 16), or a waitlist control group (n = 16). The primary outcome was pain intensity measured on the visual analog scale recorded at baseline and then at 72hours and 1week after treatment.

Results

At 1-week follow-up, pain intensity was significantly less in the DN group than in the waitlist control group (-2.16 [-1.01 to -3.32], P = 0.007) by an amount consistent with clinically meaningful improvement.

Discussion

The findings suggest that DN resulted in clinically meaningful short-term improvement in pain intensity of patients with PMS.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^111pwwxp]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

When patients report posterior hip or low back pain below the level L5 or the beltline, various causes other than sacroiliitis should be considered, including seronegative spondyloarthropathies, posterior femoro-acetabular pathology, proximal hamstring tendinopathy, piriformis syndrome, stress fracture of the sacrum, and referred pain from lumbar spinal pathology including lumbosacral facet-mediated pain and proximal L5 radiculopathy. Although there are some overlapping characteristics amongst these other diagnoses, the following list helps to correlate various differentials with their particular findings.
Localization of pain to the spine or radiating pain into the lower extremities with a positive straight leg raise may suggest a spinal or spinal nerve pathology.
Concomitant anterior and posterior hip pain with a FABER test producing pain localizing in the groin area may point towards femoro-acetabular pathology.
Tenderness to palpation over the body of the piriformis muscle with a positive FADIR (Hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation) test may suggest piriformis syndrome.
Perineal pain worsened with palpation over the ischial spine may point toward a pudendal neuropathy.
Patients with reproducible pain along with the proximal hamstring muscle or tendon through various active, passive and resisted range of motion may have a hamstring strain, rupture, or tendinopathy.
Axial low back pain that is worse with lumbar extension and positive for lumbar facet loading may be indicative of lumbar facet arthropathy.
Pain localized over the inferior sacrum and coccygeal region may represent sacrocoxalgia or coccydynia.

Understanding the relationship between these various findings and correlated pathologies is crucial to identifying and appropriately addressing a patient's source of low back and posterior hip pain. It is not uncommon for SIJ pain to present concomitantly with some of these other underlying pathologies and having them in your differential will help formulate an appropriate treatment plan for the patient.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^112P6P2D]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

There are no laboratory or radiographic methods for diagnosing the syndrome, but there are a few reports in the literature with regard to electrophysiological analysis.

A number of methods exist for the treatment of the 'piriformis syndrome' in the hip region. They include physiotherapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), injections of anaesthetic agents with or without steroids and the surgical release of the tendon. A surgical tenotomy of the piriformis muscle tendon to relieve the nerve from the pressure of the tense muscle has resulted in immediate pain relief. Dezawa et al. even described an arthroscopic technique for the release of the piriformis tendon with promising results.

Obturatorius internus syndrome (OIS)

The obturator internus muscle is located inferior to the piriformis and arises within the pelvis. It originates at the medial surface of the pubis, covers the obturator foramen and passes through the lesser sciatic notch to insert onto the greater trochanter laterally.

There are 6 external rotator muscles of the hip: the piriformis, superior gemellus, obturator internus, inferior gemellus, obturator externus and quadratus femoris. They are in close anatomical proximity to one another and they work as a functional unit.

The tendon of the piriformis muscle was found to have fused with the internal obturator tendon in 48 of 112 cases in an anatomical study, which can indicate a strong interaction between the piriformis and internal obturator muscles and the sciatic nerve, and it also runs parallel to the piriformis muscle in its attachment to the trochanter major. Pathology in the internal obturator muscle may be obscured by the complex anatomy in the region. Because of its proximity and similarity in both structure and function, most treatments for the 'piriformis syndrome' also affect the internal obturator.

### Ultrasound-guided interventional procedures for patients with chronic pelvic pain-a description of techniques and review of literature [^114SPeCx]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain can present in various pain syndromes. In particular, interventional procedure plays an important diagnostic and therapeutic role in 3 types of pelvic pain syndromes: pudendal neuralgia, piriformis syndrome, and "border nerve" syndrome (ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerve neuropathy). The objective of this review is to discuss the ultrasound-guided approach of the interventional procedures commonly used for these 3 specific chronic pelvic pain syndromes. Piriformis syndrome is an uncommon cause of buttock and leg pain. Some treatment options include the injection of the piriformis muscle with local anesthetic and steroids or the injection of botulinum toxin. Various techniques for piriformis muscle injection have been described. CT scan and EMG-guidance are not widely available to interventional physicians, while fluoroscopy exposes the performers to radiation risk. Ultrasound allows direct visualization and real-time injection of the piriformis muscle. Chronic neuropathic pain arising from the lesion or dysfunction of the ilioinguinal nerve, iliohypograstric nerve, and genitofemoral nerve can be diagnosed and treated by injection to the invloved nerves. However, the existing techniques are confusing and contradictory. Ultrasonography allows visualization of the nerves or the structures important in the identification of the nerves and provides the opportunities for real-time injections. Pudendal neuralgia commonly presents as chronic debilitating pain in the penis, scrotum, labia, perineum, or anorectal region. A pudendal nerve block is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of pudendal neuralgia. The pudendal nerve is located between the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments at the level of ischial spine. Ultrasonography, but not the conventional fluoroscopy, allows visualization of the nerve and the surrounding landmark structures. Ultrasound-guided techniques offer many advantages over the conventional techniques. The ultrasound machine is portable and is more readily available to the pain specialist. It prevents patients and healthcare professionals from the exposure to radiation during the procedure. Because it allows the visualization of a wide variety of tissues, it potentially improves the accuracy of the needle placement, as exemplified by various interventional procedures in the pelvic regions aforementioned.

### Acupuncture methods for piriformis syndrome: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1163Y31n]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Meta‐regression, Subgroup and Sensitivity Analysis

To assess the impact of covariates in heterogeneity, we will explore subgroup analysis or meta-regression when feasible. We will use the following study‐level covariates for meta‐regression: (I) sample size; (II) average age; and (III) the duration, frequency, and course of acupuncture methods. Subgroup analysis will be employed based on the different scales of pain, comparators and various forms of acupuncture methods. If subgroup analysis is still significantly heterogeneous, a sensitivity analysis will be performed. We will remove low-quality studies one by one and then merge the data. The meta-analysis will be repeated, and more low-quality studies will be excluded.

Assessment of Publication Bias

If more than 10 trials are included, we will use the funnel plot to assess the reported bias. We will use Egger's regression test to analyze if the funnel plot is found to be asymmetrical.

Credibility of the Evidence

We will use the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) pro system to grade the quality of evidence. This system assesses the following aspects: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^114zWm4h]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5.1 Piriformis syndrome

Piriformis syndrome, sometimes termed deep gluteal syndrome, refers to buttock and/or leg pain caused by impingement of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle where the muscle crosses the sciatic notch, coinciding with where the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis. This diagnosis is somewhat controversial and its prevalence is debated. In one prospective study, more than 6% of patients presenting with "sciatica" and low back or buttock pain had piriformis syndrome. In studies examining patients with piriformis syndrome, 35%–100% of patients with this condition had radiation of symptoms to the leg, mimicking radiculopathy. Importantly, the supine straight leg raise test, frequently used in radiculopathy, is often positive in persons with piriformis syndrome.

Patients with piriformis syndrome report buttock and/or radicular pain that is often worse with sitting and with increased tension on the piriformis muscle. Reproduction of buttock and/or leg symptoms using physical exam maneuvers that increase tension on the piriformis muscle, such as passive hip internal rotation and adduction with the hip flexed (the FAIR test) and resisted hip abduction with the hip flexed, support the diagnosis. For instance, the active piriformis test, in which patients lie on the contralateral side and tension the piriformis muscle by abducting and externally rotating their hip while the examiner resists these movements has a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.80. In the passive (seated) piriformis test, tension on the piriformis muscle is generated by having the patient sit with the hip flexed to 90 degrees with the knee in extension, and having the examiner move the hip in adduction and internal rotation while palpating the sciatic notch; this test has a sensitivity of 0.53 and a specificity of 0.90 for piriformis syndrome. The combination of these two tests improves the sensitivity to 0.91 and specificity to 0.80. Tenderness to palpation and/or reproduction of symptoms on palpation of the sciatic notch (Figure 2) is also suggestive of piriformis syndrome.

### A randomized comparison of the efficacy of 2 techniques for piriformis muscle injection: ultrasound-guided versus nerve stimulator with fluoroscopic guidance [^112EKSTa]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Piriformis muscle injections are most often performed using fluoroscopic guidance; however, ultrasound (US) guidance has recently been described extensively in the literature. No direct comparisons between the 2 techniques have been performed. Our objective was to compare the efficacy and efficiency of fluoroscopic- and US-guided techniques.

Methods

A randomized, comparative trial was carried out to compare the 2 techniques. Twenty-eight patients with a diagnosis of piriformis syndrome, based on history and physical examination, who had failed conservative treatment were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to receive the injection either via US or fluoroscopy. Injections consisted of 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 80 mg of triamcinalone. The primary outcome measure was numeric pain score, and secondary outcome measures included functional status as measured by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, patient satisfaction as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change scale, and procedure timing characteristics. Outcome data were measured preprocedure, immediately postprocedure, and 1 to 2 weeks and 3 months postprocedure.

Results

We found no statistically significant differences in numeric pain scores, patient satisfaction, procedure timing characteristics, or most functional outcomes when comparing the 2 techniques. Statistically significant differences between the 2 techniques were found with respect to the outcome measures of household chores and outdoor work.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided piriformis injections provide similar outcomes to fluoroscopically guided injections without differences in imaging, needling, or overall procedural times.

### Soft tissue techniques in piriformis syndrome… [^116yknpz]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Soft Tissue Techniques in Piriformis SyndromeClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Piriformis syndrome is caused by prolonged or excessive contraction of the piriformis muscle. Because of the close proximity to the sciatic nerve, piriformis syndrome is associated with pain in the buttocks, hips, and lower limbs. Yeoman was the first to describe pain in the sciatic distribution to piriformis syndrome. Many synonyms for the condition are used in the literature, such as "deep gluteal syndrome" and "pelvic outlet syndrome". It has been suggested that piriformis syndrome is responsible for 5–6% of cases of sciatica. In the majority of cases, piriformis syndrome occurs in middle-aged patients. The ratio of female to male patients with piriformis syndrome has been reported as 6:

1.
- dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint. Myofascial pain syndrome in the piriformis muscle is well recognized. Gluteal pain is reported to be observed in 97.

9% of cases, pain in the back, groin, perineum, buttocks, hip, back of the thigh, calf, foot, in the rectum, and in the area of the coccyx.
- The piriformis sign, is reported to be observed in 38. 5% of the patients.
- Freiberg's sign involves pain on passive forced internal rotation of the hip in the supine position, thought to result from passive stretching of the piriformis muscle and pressure on the sciatic nerve at the sacrospinous ligament. This test is positive in 56. 2% of the patients. Compared the effectiveness of ART with mulligan bent leg raise for hamstring tightness and concluded that ART was better in improving flexibility and ROM of hamstring. Compared post isometric relaxation with stretching on piriformis syndrome and concluded that PIR technique group significantly improved in all outcome measures.

The effects of PIR technique on myofascial tightness of lumbo-pelvic musculature in patients with chronic low back pain and concluded marked improvement in pain and functional disability.

### Ultrasound appears to be a reliable technique for the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome [^114BsYA2]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Although PS may only involve the piriformis muscle itself, in our study both the muscle and the surrounding tissue exhibited echoic and MRI changes in PS. To the best of our knowledge, the pathology of PS is not clear. 7, 22 Benson et al. reported spasms or enlargements of the piriformis muscle during surgery, 25 and Kanakis et al. concluded that the pathophysiology of PS includes single blunt trauma; overuse causing piriformis hypertrophy; and long‐term microtrauma causing scarring, piriformis muscle inflammation, and fibrosis. 22 In our study, the echoic changes found in the epimysium or adipose tissue may have been due to the spread of muscle inflammation to the surrounding area.

In addition, in PS patients who complained of sciatica, the sciatic nerve exhibited a coarse and blurred edge in this study. Some early case reports suggested that the sciatic nerve is compressed by hypertrophy or spasm of the piriformis muscle or is affected by inflammation and edema of this muscle. 26, 27

Our study has limitations, including a relatively small number of patients, wide age range of patients, and the intrinsic limitation of the technique for ultrasonographic muscle assessment. Further studies with larger populations will be required to validate both our results and the reliability of US measurements of the piriformis muscle. Furthermore, our study did not include assessments of variations in the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. However, Fishman et al. suggested that anatomic variation is unlikely responsible for PS. Furthermore, anatomical abnormalities are almost invariably bilateral, whereas PS is 90% unilateral. 10

In conclusion, US and MRI revealed similar muscle changes in PS patients. Our findings indicate that US may be a reliable and convenient technique for the diagnosis of PS.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^115nsAuD]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Postsurgery syndrome after lumbar spine surgery — the term failed back surgery syndrome is considered inaccurate and a more appropriate term is postsurgery syndrome, which does not necessarily indicate a failed surgical procedure and may follow a technically successful operation that does not yield a satisfactory long-term clinical outcome. Pain and disability may be secondary to epidural fibrosis, sacroiliac joint pain, disc herniation, discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, arachnoiditis, facet joint pain, acquired spondylolisthesis, and/or myofascial pain, along with inappropriate surgery, with adjacent level degeneration being a relatively common medium to long-term sequela; changes in posture and body dynamics may challenge muscle and ligamentous structures and lead to secondary pain generators such as the piriformis muscle.

### Conservative interventions for managing exercise-related musculoskeletal groin pain [^111QBETe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include randomized controlled trials (RCT), cross‐over RCTs, cluster RCTs, and trials in which a quasi‐randomized method of allocating participants to a treatment that is not strictly random, e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number, is used, which evaluate conservative interventions for managing exercise‐related musculoskeletal groin pain.

Types of participants

We will include adults (≥ 18 years old) with a diagnosis of exercise‐related groin pain caused by pubic bone‐related dysfunction, enthesopathy, muscle strains, or other musculoskeletal causes established by the primary studies. We will include amateur and professional athletes, community and university athletes, and active individuals. We will exclude trials with participants with groin pain from any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine, gynecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies. If a study includes a mixed population, we will include it in the review if at least 75% of the participants meet our eligibility criteria, or if outcome data can be extracted separately for the eligible subgroup.

Types of interventions

We will include all formats of conservative treatment (single or multimodal interventions), including: strengthening of muscles that stabilize the pelvis and hip joints; stretching of hip muscles; electrophysical resources (e.g. laser and ultrasound therapy); manual therapy; non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); steroidal injections or prolotherapy (an injection‐based treatment intended to stimulate tissue repair through irritant solutions); compression clothing therapy; intra‐tissue percutaneous electrolysis (an ultrasound‐guided minimally invasive technique that uses electrochemical ablation to degrade diseased tissue and induce a localized inflammatory response).

We will exclude studies comparing conservative treatment to surgical treatments.

Our main comparisons will be:

Conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus no or minimal intervention
Conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus placebo or sham intervention
One conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus another conservative intervention (single or multimodal)

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — botulinum toxin injections: Botulinum toxin is used to inhibit overactive spastic muscles and may be used to alleviate pain with overactive muscle spasms or contractions, and has been reported to reduce pain in peripheral joints, in the low back, and for the buttocks (piriformis syndrome) with alleged minimal side effects. It is being investigated as a potential alternative to corticosteroids as a pain control modality. A high-quality randomized controlled trial included 61 adults (n = 31 botulinum toxin injection and n = 30 corticosteroid injection) with subacromial bursitis and subacromial impingement syndrome who had not responded to physiotherapy or analgesic treatments, and reported that botulinum toxin injections significantly reduce pain.

### Piriformis syndrome in a patient after cesarean section under spinal anesthesia [^111APi4Y]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of piriformis syndrome as a cause of persistent buttock and hip pain after spinal anesthesia are presented in this case report.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented 5 days after cesarean delivery with sudden onset of pain in the left buttock and left hip radiating to the posterior knee with fever. She was subsequently diagnosed with piriformis syndrome.

Conclusions

Back pain with radiation into the buttocks after spinal anesthesia is frequently attributed to the spinal procedure itself. However, prolonged sitting and weight bearing in the upright position after cesarean delivery can cause sciatic nerve compression at the sacroiliac joint with concomitant irritation, inflammation, and spasm of the piriformis muscle. Piriformis syndrome is frequently underdiagnosed in the obstetric population. Because the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is based mainly on clinical signs and symptoms, the clinician must have a high index of suspicion.

ABSTRACT

Introduction: Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS) is a disorder encompassing a constellation of symptoms, including buttock and hip pain. In this study we aimed to assess the value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of PS. Methods: Thirty‐three clinically diagnosed PS patients and 26 healthy volunteers underwent a clinical PS scoring examination and US and MRI assessment of the bilateral piriformis muscles. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the US parameters (i.e. increased thickness [iTh] and increased cross‐sectional area [iCSA]) for piriformis muscle were evaluated. Results: On US and MRI, the thickness and CSA were increased in PS patients. The AUROCs for the iTh and iCSA for discriminating stage 0 (healthy volunteers) from stage 1 through stage 3 (PS patients) were 0.88 and 0.95, respectively. Discussion: US may be a reliable technique for the clinical diagnosis of PS. Muscle Nerve 59:411–416, 2019
