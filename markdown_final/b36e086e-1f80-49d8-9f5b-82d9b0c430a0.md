## Question

Is colonoscopy required Klipple

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colonoscopy is required in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and, if so, under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how often the gastrointestinal tract is involved in KTS. Then, I should verify what the literature says about when colonoscopy is indicated diagnostically or therapeutically. Next, I will check whether any guideline mandates routine screening colonoscopy in asymptomatic KTS patients. After that, I need to consider alternative imaging and endoscopic modalities and how they fit with colonoscopy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note peri-procedural considerations and special populations like pediatrics and pregnancy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology. KTS is a PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome with capillary malformations, venous and/or lymphatic malformations, and limb overgrowth. Gastrointestinal involvement is uncommon but not negligible, with estimates ranging from about 1% to 20% in different series, and when present, the rectum and sigmoid colon are the most frequently involved segments, which makes lower endoscopic evaluation particularly relevant when symptoms occur [^1117SZjB] [^115BYykV].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic role of colonoscopy in symptomatic patients. Multiple case reports and series show that in KTS patients with gastrointestinal bleeding or iron-deficiency anemia, colonoscopy directly visualizes cavernous hemangiomas or venous malformations in the colon and rectum, confirms the bleeding source, and enables targeted therapy such as endoscopic clipping or laser, whereas cross-sectional imaging alone may suggest bowel wall thickening but cannot reliably characterize mucosal lesions or provide therapy [^116HpwAt] [^114mt2ja] [^1117SZjB] [^116mBDoE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine screening. I need to check whether any guideline recommends colonoscopy for all KTS patients regardless of symptoms. I should double-check the cited sources and guidelines; I do not find any recommendation for universal screening colonoscopy in asymptomatic KTS, and the literature consistently frames endoscopy as problem-driven rather than population-wide in this syndrome, so routine colonoscopy is not required in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms or anemia [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the role of imaging and other endoscopic modalities to ensure I am not over-relying on colonoscopy. CT or MRI can demonstrate concentric bowel wall thickening with progressive enhancement and map disease extent, which is helpful for surgical planning, but they do not replace direct mucosal visualization; capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy can evaluate small-bowel involvement when colonoscopy is negative and bleeding persists, and nuclear medicine bleeding scans may show diffuse activity without localizing a discrete source in KTS-related angiomatosis, reinforcing that endoscopy remains pivotal when feasible [^1117SZjB] [^115BYykV] [^111kLeLC].

> I will now examine the therapeutic dimension because that often drives the need for colonoscopy. Endoscopic therapy such as clipping or laser can control bleeding from localized colorectal vascular malformations in KTS, and in refractory or extensive rectosigmoid disease, surgical resection may be required; preoperative angiographic embolization can reduce intraoperative hemorrhage, and case series document durable control with sphincter-preserving approaches when anatomy allows, which underscores why accurate endoscopic mapping is critical before definitive therapy [^1117SZjB] [^116mBDoE] [^1123mqW3].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or pregnant. I need to ensure age-appropriate strategies and safety. In pediatrics, colonoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic for lower GI bleeding from vascular malformations, with reports documenting benefit even in young children; in pregnancy, KTS increases hemorrhagic and thromboembolic risk, so if endoscopy is necessary, it should be planned with multidisciplinary input and hemodynamic precautions, and alternatives like CTA may be prioritized when colonoscopy is not feasible or safe in the acute setting [^116HpwAt] [^115qHrDb] [^116msyhh] [^114Zrtmu].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. Colonoscopy is indicated in KTS patients who have gastrointestinal bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, positive fecal occult blood, or other concerning lower GI symptoms, because it provides definitive diagnosis and enables therapy; colonoscopy is not required for asymptomatic patients without anemia or GI complaints, though a low threshold for evaluation is reasonable if risk factors or imaging suggest involvement, and persistent unexplained anemia should prompt endoscopic investigation even if overt bleeding is not seen [^1117SZjB] [^116HpwAt].

> Hold on, I should verify peri-procedural considerations because KTS patients can bleed substantially. Pre-procedure planning should anticipate higher blood loss, ensure adequate resuscitation capacity, and coordinate with interventional radiology or surgery if extensive lesions are suspected. Anesthesia reviews highlight that KTS surgeries can be associated with large estimated blood losses despite tourniquets, so the team should be prepared for transfusion and staged strategies when treating extensive colorectal venous malformations [^116B5uVz] [^1117SZjB].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Colonoscopy is not universally required in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. It is indicated when there is gastrointestinal bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, or compatible symptoms, serving both diagnostic and therapeutic roles, whereas asymptomatic patients without anemia do not need routine colonoscopic screening. Imaging complements but does not replace endoscopy for mucosal lesions, and management should be individualized in a multidisciplinary framework [^1117SZjB] [^116HpwAt].

Colonoscopy is **not routinely required** for patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) without gastrointestinal symptoms. It is indicated when there is **suspected GI involvement** — such as rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, or positive fecal occult blood tests [^116HpwAt] — because it allows direct visualization and diagnosis of vascular malformations that may cause bleeding [^1117SZjB]. Colonoscopy is also used to guide endoscopic therapy or surgical planning when GI lesions are present. Routine screening colonoscopy is not recommended in asymptomatic KTS patients, but clinicians should maintain a low threshold for endoscopic evaluation if GI symptoms occur.

---

## Indications for colonoscopy in KTS

Colonoscopy is **indicated in KTS** when there is clinical suspicion of gastrointestinal involvement, including:

- **Rectal bleeding**: Persistent or intermittent rectal bleeding, especially if associated with anemia or hemodynamic instability [^116mBDoE].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Unexplained iron deficiency anemia, particularly with positive fecal occult blood tests, suggesting occult gastrointestinal bleeding [^116HpwAt].

- **Abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms**: Symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation, especially if persistent or severe, warrant further evaluation [^notfound].

- **Imaging findings**: Abnormal imaging studies (CT, MRI) suggesting gastrointestinal vascular malformations or lesions [^1117SZjB].

---

## Diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in KTS

Colonoscopy provides **direct visualization** of the gastrointestinal mucosa, enabling identification and characterization of vascular malformations, such as cavernous hemangiomas or venous malformations, which are characteristic of KTS [^116HpwAt]. These lesions are often located in the rectum and sigmoid colon, although they can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract [^1117SZjB]. Colonoscopy also allows for **biopsy** of suspicious lesions to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy [^112MND4E].

---

## Therapeutic interventions enabled by colonoscopy

Colonoscopy not only aids in diagnosis but also enables **therapeutic interventions** for KTS-related gastrointestinal lesions:

- **Endoscopic laser therapy**: Laser photocoagulation can be used to treat localized vascular malformations, reducing bleeding and improving symptoms [^1117SZjB].

- **Endoscopic clipping**: Clipping devices can be used to control bleeding from specific lesions [^1117SZjB].

- **Sclerotherapy**: Injection of sclerosing agents can be used to obliterate vascular malformations, reducing bleeding risk [^notfound].

---

## Risks and complications of colonoscopy in KTS

While colonoscopy is generally safe, patients with KTS may face **increased risks** due to underlying vascular malformations:

- **Bleeding**: Increased risk of bleeding due to fragile vascular lesions [^116B5uVz].

- **Perforation**: Rare but serious complication, particularly in patients with extensive vascular malformations [^115hGVkf].

- **Infection**: Risk of infection, although rare, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

---

## Alternative diagnostic modalities

In cases where colonoscopy is contraindicated or not feasible, **alternative diagnostic modalities** include:

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Non-invasive imaging that can identify vascular malformations and assess the extent of gastrointestinal involvement [^1117SZjB].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful for detailed soft tissue evaluation and identifying vascular anomalies [^112fjZaY].

- **Capsule endoscopy**: Useful for evaluating small bowel involvement, particularly in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding [^111kLeLC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Currently, there are **no specific clinical guidelines** mandating routine colonoscopic screening for all patients with KTS. However, experts recommend a **low threshold** for endoscopic evaluation in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of bleeding [^notfound]. Multidisciplinary management involving vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and gastroenterologists is recommended for optimal care [^1167yfVz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Colonoscopy indicated?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Asymptomatic KTS patient | No | Routine screening not recommended |
| Rectal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia | Yes | Suspected gastrointestinal vascular malformations |
| Abnormal imaging findings | Yes | Confirm diagnosis and plan treatment |
| Severe gastrointestinal symptoms | Yes | Evaluate for underlying lesions |

---

Colonoscopy is **not routinely required** for patients with KTS without gastrointestinal symptoms. It is indicated when there is suspicion of gastrointestinal involvement, such as rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, or abnormal imaging findings. Colonoscopy provides direct visualization and enables therapeutic interventions, making it a valuable tool in managing KTS-related gastrointestinal complications.

### Anesthesia for surgery related to Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: a review of 136 anesthetics [^116B5uVz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by the triad of varicose veins or venous malformations, capillary malformations that may involve neurovascular structures, and bony or soft tissue hypertrophy in affected limbs. Areas such as the trunk, bowel, bladder, and spinal cord may be involved as well. KTS should not be confused with Klippel-Feil syndrome, which involves abnormalities of the cervical vertebrae. Anesthetic management for patients with KTS has only been described in limited case reports that caution about potential airway difficulty but do not report surgical hemorrhage requiring transfusion.

Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Mayo Clinic medical record database to identify patients who had undergone an anesthetic for surgery related to KTS. Review of medical records was performed for type of surgery, anesthetic technique, airway management and difficulty, medications used, intraoperative fluid administration, transfusion requirements, vascular access used, and postoperative complications.

Results

Eighty-two unique patients were identified who underwent 134 general anesthetics and 2 lumbar neuraxial anesthetics for surgeries related to KTS. Preoperatively, 27% of patients had a history of recurrent bleeding, 24% recurrent cellulitis, 9% deep vein thrombosis, and 2% pulmonary embolism. The mean age at time of surgery was 21 ± 15 years. The majority of surgical procedures involved laser coagulation or varicose vein sclerotherapy or stripping. All of the 74 direct laryngoscopies and tracheal intubations were performed on the first attempt without difficulty. Mask ventilation was possible in all 131 patients for whom this was attempted, with only 1 requiring an oral airway. Documented estimated blood loss ranged from 20 to 18,000 mL, with a mean of 740 ± 2739 mL. Use of a tourniquet did not obviate the possibility of substantial blood loss. The only significant postoperative complication involved a calf hematoma after vein stripping and avulsion that required return to the operating room for evacuation.

Conclusions

Patients with KTS have multiple associated comorbidities relevant to perioperative management. In contrast to previous reports, difficulty with airway management was not encountered. Surgery related to severe KTS may be associated with massive hemorrhage despite tourniquet use, and the anesthesiologist should anticipate the need for appropriate fluid resuscitation. Neuraxial techniques may be considered only if the possibility of trauma to neurovascular malformations has been excluded with recent spine imaging.

### Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: diagnostic criteria and hypothesis on etiology [^116qUisw]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital malformation syndrome involving blood and lymph vessels and disturbed growth of bone and soft tissues. The clinical presentation can be extremely variable. An extensive literature search showed that various authors used many different diagnostic criteria. Uniform diagnostic criteria are an absolute prerequisite for successful molecular studies and for comparisons between various studies on almost any aspect of the disorder. Based on data from 3 unusually experienced colleagues and our experience, we propose restrictive diagnostic criteria, which still respect the extremely variable nature of KTS. Important aspects are that growth can be both increased and decreased, very small arteriovenous fistula can be present, and varicosities do not need to be present. Several hypotheses regarding cause and pathogenesis in KTS exist, but none explains all KTS characteristics completely. We propose yet another hypothesis which is at variance with the hypothesis of paradominant inheritance.

Klippel-Trènaunay syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterised by vascular malformations, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy and pose considerable thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risk for obstetric patients. We report on a patient with this syndrome who underwent elective caesarean section which was indicated due to previous obstetric anal sphincter injury. We describe her multidisciplinary preoperative planning and successful management of major postpartum haemorrhage with uterine compression sutures and intrauterine balloon tamponade ('uterine sandwich').

Discussion and conclusions. Ultrasound is a "child friendly", non-ionising imaging modality with excellent spatial resolution, that is not expensive and is readily available. It's use may obviate the need for more expensive cross sectional CT and/or MR imaging. It should be the initial modality for the assessment of the floor of the mouth.

Klippel-Trenaunay, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber and Parkes Weber Syndromes. Should we still use these eponyms?

Cristian Garcia, Alejandro Zavala, Florencia De Barbieri, Claudio Berrios, Rodrigo Parra

Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Santiago (Chile)

Purpose-Objective. To discuss the actual usefulness of using the eponyms Klippel, Trenaunay and Parkes Weber in the diagnosis of some complex vascular anomalies in children.

Material and methods. In 1900, Klippel and Trenaunay reported a patient with hemihypertrophy of one extremity and hemangiomatous skin lesions (Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome). In 1907, Parkes Weber described three cases with dermal nevi, hemihypertrophy and varices (Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome) and in 1918 he added the additional component of AV fistula (Parkes Weber Syndrome). In 1982, Mulliken and Glowacki proposed the currently used classification for vascular anomalies and included these Syndromes within the group of vascular malformations.

Results. In the Vascular Anomaly Group of our Institution, we receive children with vascular anomalies from all over the country and we have found that many patients come with the diagnosis of one of these Syndromes, but they do not represent what was originally described and are really part of a wide spectrum of complex vascular anomalies. In order to illustrate this, we show a case of a 5-year-old boy with clinical diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, who presented with an extensive mixed capillary-venous-lymphatic vascular malformation of lower extremities, pulmonary hypertension and bladder, rectal, lung, splenic and adrenal involvement.

The Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare disorder characterized by a triad of port-wine stains, varicose veins, and bony or soft tissue hypertrophy of one extremity. Digestive bleeding is the most commonly observed gastrointestinal manifestation. In rare cases, the syndrome is associated with malignancies. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman with KTS and dysphagia caused by an oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Although acute LGIB is only about one fifth as common and is usually less hemodynamically significant than upper gastrointestinal bleeding, it presents numerous unique clinical challenges. The best diagnostic approach for patients with active bleeding is unknown, but urgent prepared colonoscopy is safe and likely to be beneficial (Fig. 3, Table 2). In patients who have aggressive bleeding or recurrent bleeding, it is critical for the practitioner to judge when angiography and surgery are necessary.

### Less common colorectal cancer predisposition syndromes [^114BwXZ8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of syndromes confer increased risk for intestinal polyp development, outside the more commonly occurring syndromes. Each of these uncommon syndromes predispose to pathognomonic histologies that are uncommonly observed. Accurate diagnosis of these syndromes is contingent on higher-level pathology review, evaluation of signs and symptoms beyond sole consideration of the polyps, and collection of a detailed family history. When a genetic mutation can be identified in the proband, the management of intestinal and extra-intestinal cancer screening can be more appropriately tailored.

### Wound-healing problems associated with combined vascular malformations in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome [^113YWaBo]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Significance: In Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), management of a wound in the affected limb can be difficult because of the underlying vascular malformations present. This review describes the characteristics of KTS with wound complications in light of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the disease. Recent Advances: KTS is a slow-flow combined vascular malformation characterized by the triad of capillary malformation, venous malformation with or without lymphatic malformation, and limb overgrowth. KTS is encompassed within the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), having recently been linked to activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene. This clearly has implications for both molecular diagnosis and potential treatment strategies for the disease. Critical Issues: KTS should be distinguished from Parkes Weber syndrome, a fast-flow-type combined vascular malformation with limb overgrowth. Individualized management is needed for KTS and should be focused on the treatment of symptoms. Future Directions: Targeted therapies that inhibit the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway are a potential treatment option for PROS.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^1165x6dS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)/MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)/attenuated polyposis — individuals at risk for or affected with classic adenomatous polyposis syndromes should have annual colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy beginning at puberty, and in AFAP or MAP, surveillance should be by colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Absolute indications for immediate colectomy include documented or suspected cancer or significant symptoms, with relative indications including multiple adenomas > 6 mm, a significant increase in adenoma number, or inability to adequately survey the colon (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Upper gastrointestinal surveillance should start at age 25–30 years using upper endoscopy including duodenoscopy, with surveillance every 0.5–4 years based on Spigelman stage (0 = 4 years, I = 2–3 years, II = 1–3 years, III = 6–12 months, IV = surgical evaluation); examination should include random sampling of fundic gland polyps, and surgery reserved for high-grade dysplasia or cancer (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Annual thyroid screening by ultrasound is recommended (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Biannual screening with α-fetoprotein and ultrasounds should be offered to affected infants until age 7 years (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Postsurgical surveillance should include yearly endoscopy of the rectum or ileal pouch and ileostomy examination every 2 years (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Lynch syndrome — colonoscopy screening in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer shows reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality, with observed effects including "62% Less CRC in screened (P = 0.03)" and "No deaths in screened vs. 5 deaths in nonscreened", and on follow-up "62% reduction in CRC in screened (P = 0.02)" with "No deaths from CRC in screened vs. 9 deaths in nonscreened". An additional series found an "Estimated 72% decrease in CRC death in screened individuals". More frequent colonoscopy was associated with "Earlier stage CRC", and colectomy extent affected 10‑year risk: "15.7% risk of CRC with partial vs. 3.4% with subtotal colectomy at 10 years".

### Gastrointestinal bleeding with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: a case report [^1153vRWs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is extremely rare and often overlooked. Case presentation A 9-year-old girl who presented with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory examinations revealed microcytic hypochromic anemia and a positive fecal occult blood test. Computed tomography (CT) of the lower limbs combined with physical examination confirmed KTS. The pelvic CT showed concentric thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum, with progressive enhancement after the administration of a contrast agent. Colonoscopy demonstrated vascular malformations of the sigmoid colon and rectum. The patient was finally diagnosed with KTS with gastrointestinal tract involvement. The patient improved after receiving conservative treatment.

Conclusions

A suspicion of gastrointestinal tract involvement as an etiology for gastrointestinal bleeding should not be overlooked in patients with KTS. Endoscopy and imaging modalities can synergistically help diagnose this condition.

### A mild and rare form of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome presenting with urethral bleeding due to penile hemangioma [^1135b5U7]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is characterized by a triad of cutaneous port-wine capillary malformations, hemihypertrophy, and varicose veins. Intermittent gross painless hematuria is usually the first clinical sign. An 8-year-old boy with multiple hemangiomas, including glans penis, and associated with KTS presented with urethral bleeding. Radiologic and endoscopic evaluation revealed neither intra-abdominal nor intravesical hemangioma. Urethral bleeding was thought to be related to glanular hemangioma extending to the anterior penile urethra. Although we were able to manage the case conservatively, many patients require endoscopic or surgical interventions. Radiologic and endoscopic evaluations and careful follow-up is essential for diagnosis and prompt treatment.

### Bleeding from cavernous angiomatosis of the rectum in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: report of three cases and literature review [^116mBDoE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital vascular anomaly characterized by limb hypertrophy, cutaneous hemangiomas, and varicosities. GI hemorrhage is a potentially serious complication secondary to diffuse hemangiomatous involvement of the gut. We report on three patients with KTS who presented with transfusion-dependent anemia and life-threatening bleeding due to extensive cavernous hemangiomas involving the rectum. Two patients were treated by proctocolectomy and coloanal anastomosis, which preserved anal function while controlling bleeding. The third patient required an abdominoperineal resection because of extensive rectal, perianal, and perineal angiomatosis. The literature on the evaluation and management of GI hemorrhage in KTS, particularly of colorectal origin, is reviewed.

Objective

A dearth of information exists in the literature regarding current practice in the management of Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare condition. We review and describe the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of KTS.

Methods

Relevant data were synthesized from a Medline review using a combination of the keyterms "Klippel" and "Trénaunay". The majority of hits described singular case reports and were subsequently excluded. The remaining papers were then reviewed and included on the basis of the quality of evidence and the authors' discretion.

Conclusions

KTS is characterized by a clinical triad of extremity varicosities, cutaneous vascular malformations, and hypertrophy of soft tissues and long bones. The diagnosis is clinically supplemented with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Although this syndrome is associated with significant comorbidities, such as pain, edema, ulcerations, and pruritus, it is rarely the cause of death. The backbone of treatment is nonoperative in nature but should be supplemented with minimally invasive, endovascular, and rarely open surgical procedures for refractory cases.

Background

Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital and rare vascular malformation disorder that mainly involves the lower limbs. It is characterized by capillary, lymphatic and/or venous malformations and overgrowth of soft tissue and/or bone. Gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with KTS is uncommon, with associated bleeding accounting for approximately 1% of KTS cases according to a previous report. Herein we report the case of a patient with rare gastrointestinal bleeding who underwent computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic examination.

### Evaluation and management of the lateral marginal vein in Klippel-Trénaunay and other PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndromes [^114uTu8t]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

The lateral marginal vein is an anomalous clinical entity found in association with Klippel-Trénaunay and other PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndromes. Although it is reported to affect < 20% of patients with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, this venous anomaly has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality attributable to venous hypertension and potentially lethal thromboembolic events. Limited literature exists on the diagnosis and management of this rare anomaly, with most of the reports focusing on retrospective clinical experience at a few centers of excellence. Despite these limitations, a systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment of this anomaly is warranted and expounded on herein. When plausible, clinical recommendations based on best available literature are made.

### Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: incidence and treatment of genitourinary sequelae [^114h9Acn]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prior reviews regarding genitourinary manifestations of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome used data acquired from diverse specialty specific articles to define the incidence and sequelae of its genitourinary manifestations. We believe that this resulted in erroneous conclusions regarding the urological complications of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.

Materials and Methods

Data on genitourinary manifestations in patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome treated at 1 institution from 1970 through 2005 were acquired.

Results

Of 218 patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome 30% (66 of 218) had genitourinary involvement, including 7% (15) with cutaneous genital abnormalities, 7% (15) with visceral genitourinary involvement and 16% (36) with each type. Intermittent bleeding from cutaneous genital abnormalities developed in 65% of patients (33 of 51). Conservative treatment with compression and/or cauterization was attempted in all 33 patients and it was successful in 64% (21 of 33). Intractable hemorrhage resulted in excision of the cutaneous bleeding site in 36% of cases (12 of 33). A total of 39 hospitalizations for gross hematuria occurred in 9% of the patients (19 of 218). Hematuria developed from the bladder in 11 cases, the urethra in 4 and the kidney in 4. Conservative therapy resolved gross hematuria in 21% of the patients (4 of 19). Refractory hematuria was successfully treated with cauterization in 37% of the patients (7 of 19) and by angiographic embolization in 10% (2 of 19). Intractable gross hematuria resulted in open surgical excision of the bleeding site in 32% of the patients (6 of 19).

Conclusions

The incidence of genitourinary manifestations of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is 30%, which is triple the previously reported incidence of 9%. Unlike prior reports stating that the genitourinary abnormalities rarely caused problems, 52% of the patients (34 of 66) with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome who had urological manifestations eventually required interventional therapy for genitourinary complications.

### Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome [^11679V4L]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The association of three physical findings including capillary malformation, varicosities, and hypertrophy of bony and soft tissues corresponds to Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. This triad of findings, described by the two French physicians Klippel and Trenaunay in 1900, differs from Parkes-Weber syndrome, in that Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome does not incorporate significant hemodynamic arteriovenous fistulas. Generally, management of this disease process should be individualized. Surgery should be considered in cases where skin ulcerations lead to persisting and recurrent bleeding, or where digital deformities lead to functional disabilities or where significant limb overgrowth leads to both functional and psychological impairment. Persistent hematochezia, hematuria, and vaginal and esophageal bleeding are considered indications for surgical intervention. Recurrent attacks of thrombophlebitis and cellulitis are treated medically with antiinflammatory agents and antibiotics. Otherwise, management of this syndrome is generally conservative, consisting of psychological encouragement, reassurance, and the continued use of graduated compressive stockings for varicosities and intermittent pneumatic compression pumps for lymphatic edema.

Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation and are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, computed tomographic angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome: need for careful clinical classification [^111BWUJA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital malformation characterized by a triad of clinical presentations: (1) capillary malformations manifesting as a "port wine stain"; (2) limb hypertrophy; and (3) venous varicosities. It is distinguished from Parkes-Weber syndrome by the absence of substantial arteriovenous shunting. Due to the clinical implications of an arteriovenous fistula, differentiation between the two syndromes is important, as the prognosis and treatment greatly differ. We present a series of 5 cases of suspected KTS, while emphasizing the difficulties in distinguishing KTS from Parkes-Weber syndrome without diagnostic imaging and underscoring the importance of accurately classifying patients with the appropriate syndrome.

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital disorder characterised by capillary and venous malformations and soft-tissue hypertrophy with or without lymphatic malformation. The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract is uncommon in KTS. We present a case of a young adult who presented to us with bleeding per rectum and varicosities of the left lower limb. The patient was evaluated and diagnosed to have KTS. The patient was managed conservatively. To best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in literature where KTS was associated with atypical varicose veins of the left lower limb with mild hypertrophy of the lower limb, localised hypertrophy of the right gluteal region with involvement of pelvis, rectum, bladder and seminal vesicle.

### Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, pregnancy and the liver: an unusual interplay [^114168Vh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital malformation involving blood and lymph vessels, with disturbed growth of bone and soft tissues. The triad of varicose veins, cutaneous capillary malformation, and hypertrophy of bone soft tissue is characteristic. These vascular malformations may involve areas other than the affected extremity and may vary in depth of involvement; they may be limited to the skin, muscles or bones whereas some affect visceral organs. The risk of thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism is high among KTS patients.

Women with KTS have been reported to have normal pregnancies and the risk to deliver an abnormal child is low, with complications being proportional to the severity of the disease. It is recommended therefore to adopt careful monitoring with serial ultrasounds. The presence of vulval, vaginal, or cervical varicosities demand attention as lacerations may cause massive blood loss.

Gastrointestinal tract involvement is variable and may be more common than previously believed while the liver involvement is extremely rare in the context of KTS. We report a case of a lady who was diagnosed only after her third delivery and presented with a thrombotic complication related to KTS and a combination of additional factors. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing the case and the relevant photos.

### Rectal bleeding, deep venous thrombosis, and coagulopathy in a patient with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome [^1123mqW3]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare noninheritable congenital disorder comprising vascular malformations that predispose patients to a paradoxical condition where bleeding occurs in a hypercoagulable state. A 16-year-old boy with a complicated lifetime course of KTS presented with massive rectal bleeding. He underwent a partial colectomy, endorectal resection, and splenectomy. Postoperatively, he developed a saddle pulmonary embolus, ultimately requiring placement of an inferior vena cava filter. He eventually did well and has since had his diverting ostomy reversed and resumed his usual activities. This report validates the use of endorectal resection for venous malformation of the rectum in patients with KTS and highlights the difficult balance of controlling bleeding by correction of a consumptive coagulopathy and the increased risk of thromboembolic complications.

JPS and colorectal surveillance

​We suggest colonoscopic surveillance should commence from the age of 15 years or earlier if symptomatic. The surveillance interval should be 1–3 yearly, personalised according to colorectal phenotype.

​(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)​

Consensus reached: 85% agreement.

The polyps in JPS are thought to have the potential for malignant transformation with dysplasia present in 8% of resected polyps in one series. The risk of CRC is ill-defined, being based on small series, with inherent bias. Such cohorts have reported CRC in 14–22% of patientswith a reported lifetime CRC risk of 39–68%.CRC in childhood is not a clinically significant problem. The mean age of CRC in two of the larger studies was 44 years.

The risk of CRC is undoubtedly elevated, and the current consensus is that colonoscopic surveillance is required, with the aim of preventing or detecting early cancers. Colonoscopy and polypectomy also has the potential to prevent polyp-related morbidity (bleeding, anaemia or abdominal pain). There are few data regarding the outcomes of surveillance in JPS. In one of the largest cohorts, colonoscopy was safe. Two patients developed CRC on surveillance — one in the setting of carpeting of polyps, and the other arose following what was almost certainly an incomplete colonoscopy in the mid 1970s.

For those with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of JPS, or individuals with a clinical diagnosis of JPS in whom molecular genetic test results were uninformative, colonoscopic surveillance can be delayed until the age of 15 years if asymptomatic.

There are no data to guide the most appropriate interval for colonoscopy surveillance in JPS. There are no data to support accelerated carcinogenesis in JPS. A personalised approach with the surveillance interval (1–3 yearly) based on individual colonic phenotype appears to be a pragmatic approach and is in line with recent paediatric polyposis guidelines. Colonic resection may be considered for those with a polyp burden not manageable endoscopically. For those unaffected individuals from families with a clinical but not molecular diagnosis, 5 yearly colonoscopy would seem adequate. If normal, the interval to be reviewed if a JPS phenotype is found or other sporadic polyps are identified.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^114xhGnC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) — cancer risks and surveillance are summarized as follows: The risk of colon cancer is 17–22% by age 35 years and approaches 68% by age 60 years; the mean age of colon cancer is 34 years with a range of 15 to 68 years. Gastric cancer risk is 30% in those with SMAD4 mutations, and the median age of upper GI carcinoma is 58 years with a range of 21 to 73 years. Colonoscopy should be annual beginning at age 12 years or earlier if symptoms occur, especially bleeding, and upper endoscopy is recommended every 1 to 3 years beginning at age 12 years or earlier for symptoms; the small bowel past the duodenum should be periodically surveilled by enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy, and/or CT enterography if duodenal polyposis is present or if there is unexplained anemia, protein-losing enteropathy, or other small bowel symptoms. Colectomy with IRA is indicated if cancer, high grade dysplasia, or polyposis cannot be adequately controlled endoscopically; surveillance of the remaining rectum or pouch is necessary, and proctocolectomy with IPAA may be needed depending on the number of rectal polyps.

### Safety and efficacy of low-dose PI3K inhibitor taselisib in adult patients with CLOVES and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS): the TOTEM trial, a phase 1 / 2 multicenter, open-label, single-arm study [^114Qia29]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Authors of the present study are not aware of any other published clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a targeted inhibitor of the PI3K alpha subunit in patients with PROS. Our results show that, despite clinical improvements such as pain reduction, cessation of chronic bleeding or improved QoL, the negative safety profile makes long-term use of taselisib inappropriate in PROS.

Taselisib use led to two SUSARs, triggering early termination of our trial. This is at odds with the recent report of Venot et al. who claimed a favorable safety profile of another PI3K-alpha subunit inhibitor, alpelisib, in a cohort of 19 PROS patients. This discrepancy may be attributable in part to the more systematic reporting of AE in our study, in accordance with good clinical practice, documenting severity, type of event, incidence, and relationship with taselisib. The profile of vascular/overgrowth phenotypes, and disease severity, also differed between the two studies. Last but not least, differences may be explained by a difference in selectivity for the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K encodes by PIK3CA. Alpelisib is reported to have higher selectivity than taselisib; taselisib also inhibits the PI3Kγ and δ catalytic subunits of PI3K, which likely modulate the immune system and possibly explains the inflammatory adverse events that we report.

Purpose

PIK3CA pathogenic variants in the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling, providing a rationale for targeted therapy, but no drug has proven efficacy and safety in this population. Our aim was to establish the six-month tolerability and efficacy of low-dose taselisib, a selective class I PI3K inhibitor, in PROS patients.

Methods

Patients over 16 years with PROS and PIK3CA pathogenic variants were included in a phase IB/IIA multicenter, open-label single-arm trial (six patients at 1 mg/day of taselisib, then 24 at 2 mg/day). The primary outcome was the occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Efficacy outcomes were the relative changes after treatment of (1) tissue volume at affected and unaffected sites, both clinically and on imaging; (2) cutaneous vascular outcomes when relevant; (3) biologic parameters; (4) quality of life; and (5) patient-reported outcomes.

Results

Among 19 enrolled patients, 2 experienced a DLT (enteritis and pachymeningitis) leading to early trial termination (17 treated, 10 completed the study). No serious adverse reaction occurred in the 1 mg cohort (n = 6). No significant reduction in affected tissue volume was observed (mean −4.2%; p = 0.81; SD 14.01). Thirteen (76.4%) participants reported clinical improvement (pain reduction, chronic bleeding resolution, functional improvement).

Conclusion

Despite functional improvement, the safety profile of low-dose taselisib precludes its long-term use.

Although each of the above syndromes is quite rare, it is important for clinicians to know the characteristics of each syndrome and to understand the differences in cancer risks between the different conditions. This information is very important when treatment and surveillance plans are formulated for each individual patient.

### Sturge-Weber syndrome and associated congenital vascular disorders: a review [^112dvZ9T]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), and Parkes-Weber syndrome (PWS) represent a wide range of congenital vascular abnormality syndromes. Although many of the diagnostic criteria overlap for these syndromes, there are important differences among these diseases that carry important prognostic and therapeutic implications. This review attempts to clearly distinguish among SWS, KTS, and PWS, although loosely categorizing them as a family of congenital vascular disorders. A review of literature reveals that a variety of diagnostic tools exist that can help differentiate between the syndromes and assess risk for certain complications, which may help tailor various treatment modalities for a particular patient.

### Colonoscopy: what are we missing? [^111UvYmw]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of most colonoscopies is to detect and treat colorectal neoplasia, preventing or providing early diagnosis of cancer. Basic to this mission is the recognition and diagnosis of neoplasms. Recent data suggest that detection of neoplasia during colonoscopy is suboptimal, resulting in a failure of screening colonoscopy as an efficient strategy for the prevention of cancer.

Lynch syndrome (LS) colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance — colonoscopy recommendation and supporting data: In individuals at risk for or affected with LS, screening for CRC by colonoscopy should be performed at least every 2 years, beginning between ages 20 and 25 years, and annual colonoscopy should be considered in confirmed mutation carriers (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening and very low quality of evidence for annual surveillance and age of initiation). LS patients develop fewer (usually < 10) early-onset adenomas, and the adenoma–carcinoma dwell time is estimated at 35 months compared with 10–15 years in sporadic cancer. Lifetime CRC risk for MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers ranges from 22 to 74%, and among MSH6 carriers the cumulative risk by age 70 years is 39% in women versus 69% in men. The mean age of CRC diagnosis in LS is 44–61 years compared with 69 years in sporadic cases, and uptake of colonoscopic surveillance was associated with 65% (P = 0.003) less death from CRC compared with refusal.

### How many is too many? Polyposis syndromes and what to do next [^111GqTby]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The goal of this review is to help providers recognize, diagnose and manage gastrointestinal (GI) polyposis syndromes.

Recent Findings

Intestinal polyps include a number of histological sub-types such as adenomas, serrated, hamartomas among others. Over a quarter of individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy are expected to have colonic adenomas. Although it is not uncommon for adults to have a few GI polyps in their lifetime, some individuals are found to have multiple polyps of varying histology throughout the GI tract. In these individuals, depending on polyp histology, number, location and size as well as extra-intestinal features and/or family history, a polyposis syndrome should be considered with appropriate testing and management.

Summary

Diagnosis and management of polyposis syndromes has evolved with advent of multigene panel testing and new data on optimal surveillance strategies. Evidence-based recommendations and current practice guidelines for polyposis syndromes are reviewed here. Areas of uncertainty and future research are also highlighted.

### Exploratory laparoscopy combined with pathological examination in the diagnosis of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in a child: a case report [^111kLeLC]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

OGIB from VM in this case affected the delay in diagnosis because of its rarity and limitations in the diagnostic approach in pediatric patients.

Massive gastrointestinal haemorrhage in a child due to VM of the jejunum is very uncommon. To our knowledge this is the second case of an acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage in a child due to VM of the jejunum. Most VM cases may lay a false trail for the clinician because of accompanied IDA with no gastrointestinal symptoms at the initial time. In our case, IDA combined with asymptomatic pulmonary infection misled the diagnosis as IPH. The clinical conditions of our case are reported for the first time.

Syndromes such as the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and the blue rubber blebnevus syndrome usually encompass VM as a skin manifestation, so the possibility of visceral lesion may be suspected. In this case, however, the malformations were a unique manifestation without any associated syndrome, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis.

Angiography may detect OGIB lesions and also offers a therapeutic option with embolization if a bleeding lesion is identified. In OGIB patients, the bleeding rate may be slow or intermittent, thereby not allowing identification by either angiography or bleeding scan. A small case series also suggests that the overall yield of provocative angiography is low.

CE is currently the preferred test for the initial investigation in patients with OGIB due to its high diagnostic yield. However, this technology requires precision instruments and skilled endoscopic images interpreters. In addition, the increase of the cost-effectiveness, imprecise localization, the risk of capsule retention and a lack of therapeutic capability also restrict the wide application of CE among children patients, particularly in acute cases.

OGIB was a common indication for small bowel endoscopy. The development of BAE represents a decisive breakthrough in the diagnosis and management of small bowel diseases. The overall diagnostic yield of BAE was about 70%. The approach of CE followed by BAE might show a diagnostic yield over 90%. However, this technology has not been widely used in children's hospitals for concerns regarding safety, design of instruments, training, availability, and a lack of knowledge about its use and relative indications.

### Obstetric management of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome [^114Zrtmu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a rare congenital disease characterized by extensive cutaneous vascular malformations, venous varicosities, focal abnormalities of the deep venous system, and underlying soft tissue or bony hypertrophy. Given the rarity of the disease, there is little information available to counsel patients with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome regarding obstetric outcome.

Cases

We report our experience with 3 patients in whom Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome complicated 4 pregnancies. Successful delivery of a healthy infant at or beyond 36 weeks of gestation was achieved in all pregnancies. One of the 4 pregnancies was complicated by pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome was once thought to be a contraindication to pregnancy. With careful management, successful pregnancies can be achieved.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: a case report [^114mt2ja]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 9-year-old girl with an 8-year history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding was admitted to our hospital. The patient had no corresponding family history. Sclerotherapy in the varicose veins of her right lower limb was previously performed in another hospital. Physical examination showed a hypertrophic and longer right lower limb with vascular nevus. Blood was not observed during the digital rectal examination. Laboratory examinations revealed microcytic hypochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL (normal range; 11.0–15.0 g/dL) and a positive fecal occult blood test.

Pelvic CT showed concentric thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum, with a thickness of 7.8 mm (Fig. 1 A). The thickened intestinal wall showed progressive enhancement after the administration of a contrast agent (Fig. 1 B). Axial CT images and volume rendering also showed bone and soft tissue hypertrophy of the right lower limb (Fig. 1 C, D). Multiple tortuous varices, scattered cystic lymphatic malformations and lymphedema were noted in the fat and muscle layer in the right hip and right lower limb (Fig. 1 C). Varices were mainly located on the lateral aspect of her right lower limb (Fig. 1 D).

### Gastrointestinal bleeding with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: a case report [^116HpwAt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal bleeding caused by gastrointestinal tract involvement in patients with Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is extremely rare and often overlooked.

Case presentation

A 9-year-old girl who presented with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory examinations revealed microcytic hypochromic anemia and a positive fecal occult blood test. Computed tomography (CT) of the lower limbs combined with physical examination confirmed KTS. The pelvic CT showed concentric thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectum, with progressive enhancement after the administration of a contrast agent. Colonoscopy demonstrated vascular malformations of the sigmoid colon and rectum. The patient was finally diagnosed with KTS with gastrointestinal tract involvement. The patient improved after receiving conservative treatment.

Conclusions

A suspicion of gastrointestinal tract involvement as an etiology for gastrointestinal bleeding should not be overlooked in patients with KTS. Endoscopy and imaging modalities can synergistically help diagnose this condition.

### Incidental finding of diffuse cavernous rectal haemangiomatosis during bowel cancer screening [^115hGVkf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The appearance of the CT and MR findings combined with the macroscopic appearance on colonoscopy suggested a morphology highly consistent with diffuse cavernous haemangioma of the rectum (DCHR).

DCHR is a rare benign vascular tumour of the large intestine, of unknown prevalence. First described in 1839, approximately 350 cases have been reported in literature to date. Colonic haemangiomas are associated with a variety of conditions including Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. These syndromes are associated with haemangiomas throughout the alimentary canal and skin. Conversely, DCHR is not associated with cutaneous haemangiomas and typically originates from the dentate line; distribution is confined to the rectosigmoid and rectal mesentery.

Eighty percent of all colonic haemangiomas are cavernous, the other major type being capillary. Histologically these lesions arise from the submucosa, containing dilated tortuous blood vessels with a propensity for forming vascular sinuses. DCHR lesions have a thin wall containing either a single or multiple flattened layers of endothelial cells with no capsule. Phleboliths form within the haemangiomas secondary to blood flow stasis/thrombosis and subsequent chronic inflammation.

DCHR appears to have an equal sex distribution, and symptomatic patients tend to present in youth. The vast majority of patients with DCHR are asymptomatic, as with our patient. Haematochezia can occur secondary to erosion of the haemangioma through the mucosa into the gastrointestinal lumen. This was likely the cause of his positive FOBT. Chronic iron deficiency anaemia, bowel obstruction, intussusception, perforation, and consumptive coagulopathy mimicking disseminated intravascular coagulation have all been reported as complications of DCHR in literature.

### Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome [^111HXz4k]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or KTS is a complex vascular syndrome associated with overgrowth occurring as a result of somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene. Patients are diagnosed on the basis of physical findings, sometimes with supportive imaging, of commonly a segmental anomaly with a cutaneous port-wine stain, lymphatic and venous malformations and overgrowth. The severity of the component vascular malformations and the degree of overgrowth varies from patient to patient which demands care given by a multi-professional team with regular follow-up in a specialist clinic. Some patients may present with acute life-threatening problems, often as a result of veno-thromboembolic events (VTEs) especially following surgical and invasive radiological procedures. Awareness of such problems is vital and prophylactic measures to reduce such risks are paramount. The interventional radiologist is vital to the care team as he/she can undertake procedures including endovascular closure of significant venous anomalies which predispose to such VTEs. Although these procedures can be lengthy and complex, they can now provide a minimally invasive means to reduce the risk from life-threatening and sometimes fatal VTEs. The results however from such interventions will require long-term studies which to date are unavailable.

Inherited adenomatous polyposis syndromes — genetic testing thresholds and risk: Historically, patients with more than 100 adenomas found on colonoscopy are typically given a clinical diagnosis of polyposis, and polyp formation is an age-dependent phenomenon; patients with fewer adenomas or a family history suggestive of polyposis should undergo genetic testing. Guidelines recommend genetic testing for individuals with greater than 10 to 20 cumulative lifetime adenomas, and patients with more than 20 adenomas have a more than 10% risk of carrying a genetic pathologic variant.

### Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or not? An exploration of atypical presentations [^115kYpy2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare, congenital disorder typically emerging in early infancy or childhood. The classic presentation of KTS is distinguished by a triad of clinical features: a port-wine stain, early-onset varicosities and limb overgrowth. However, a notable variant of KTS has been documented, characterised by limb shortening rather than lengthening, occasionally referred to as 'inverse KTS'. This report details two cases that display this unusual presentation-both patients had classical features of port-wine stain and varicose veins but both experienced shortening of the affected limb. Whether these cases represent a variant of KTS or a new clinical syndrome altogether is uncertain. They however offer valuable insights into the nuances and breadth of clinical manifestations associated with this syndrome.

### Vascular anomalies: special considerations in children [^1167yfVz]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS) is the most well-known of the overgrowth syndromes, characterised by unilateral limb overgrowth, a capillary malformation of the skin ('port wine stain') and slow-flow vascular malformations (Uller et al.). A dysplastic embryonic marginal venous system is often present. It should be noted, however, that this label, like that of Proteus, is vastly over-used in patients with other forms of overgrowth and is often unhelpful. Limb overgrowth can have a myriad of underlying components. Patients with complex overgrowth require a simple label, such as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum or PROS, and a truly multi-disciplinary approach. Management should be carefully tailored according to the patient's individual needs. This may include endovascular closure of embryonic veins, sclerotherapy of low flow malformations, compressions garments, CO2 laser of skin lesions, surgical management of gastrointestinal or pelvic disease, and orthopaedic involvement for the management of overgrowth.

Sirolimus has a role in the treatment of both PIK3CA-related overgrowth and non-PROS growth disorders but it is clear that such medical therapies are still in their infancy (Adams et al; Horbach et al.). More specific gene mutations need to be identified so that the vast range of differing phenotypes can be targeted more effectively.

Vascular malformations occurring as part of a wider syndrome can be challenging to treat, occurring in difficult-to-reach sites and often presenting late. These can include the urogenital tract, GI tract, mesentery, bone marrow and orbit. As with so many other conditions, it often falls to IR to suggest minimally invasive and innovative interventions and encourage collaborative approaches to treatment. These include endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) for malformations with a predominantly 'dysplastic-vein' type anatomy and cryoablation for more solid overgrowth lesions (Cornelis et al; Shaikh et al; King et al.). Endoscopically-guided sclerotherapy of the bladder, mesentery and airway is both effective and extremely attractive to patients, compared to aggressive surgical options. We owe it to these patients to think collaboratively and push the boundaries of what is possible (Barnacle et al; Sinha et al; Stimpson et al.).

Klippel Trenaunay syndrome commonly manifests as lower limb hypertrophy where vascular malformation occurs. However, up to 20% of patients with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome can have gastrointestinal involvement. An 18-year-old man with known Klippel Trenaunay syndrome in the left lower extremity underwent Tc-labeled red blood cell imaging to determine the site of gastrointestinal bleeding. The images did not reveal the site of active bleeding. However, diffuse non-moving activity in the left abdomen and pelvis was noted, which corresponded to hypertrophied colon and related blood vessels, consistent with intestinal involvement of Klippel Trenaunay syndrome.

Lynch syndrome (LS) — for individuals at risk for or affected with LS, screening for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy should be performed at least every 2 years, beginning between ages 20 and 25 years, and annual colonoscopy should be considered in confirmed mutation carriers (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening, and very low quality of evidence for annual surveillance and age of initiation). Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) is the preferred treatment when colon cancer or colonic neoplasia is not controllable by endoscopy, with segmental colectomy an option if regular postoperative surveillance is conducted (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be offered to known LS mutation carriers who have finished child bearing, optimally at age 40–45 years (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Screening for endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer should be offered by endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound annually, starting at age 30 to 35 years before surgery or if surgery is deferred (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Screening for gastric and duodenal cancer can be considered by baseline esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with gastric biopsy at age 30–35 years with treatment of H. pylori when found, and ongoing surveillance every 3–5 years may be considered if there is a family history of gastric or duodenal cancer (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Screening beyond population-based recommendations for urinary tract, pancreas, prostate, and breast cancers is not recommended unless there is a family history (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Although daily aspirin may decrease cancer risk in LS, the evidence is not sufficiently robust or mature to make a recommendation for its standard use (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### Gastrointestinal bleeding with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: a case report [^1117SZjB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

KTS is a disorder combining vascular malformations and an affected overgrowth of a limb. It is believed to be caused by somatic mosaicism in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/PIK3CA signaling pathway, with an incidence of 1 per 100,000. Common clinical presentations include limb hypertrophy (limb-length asymmetry and soft tissue hypertrophy), varices and vascular nevus, commonly termed a classic triad. KTS diagnosis depends on physical and imaging examinations. Other site involvement causing compression and bleeding has also been reported, and include; the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, the uterus and the urinary bladder.

Gastrointestinal tract involvement accounts for approximately 20% of KTS cases. The sigmoid colon and rectum are the most commonly affected areas. Clinical manifestations range from symptom-free to life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. Thus, condition awareness is paramount for appropriate clinical management. In terms of treatment, conservative approaches can be used for patients with self-limiting bleeding. Endoscopic treatments such as endoscopic laser therapy and endoscopic clipping can be applied for localized lesions, whereas surgical resection such as sphincter-preserving excision of the affected sigmoid colon and rectum followed by a colon pouch anal anastomosis and protective loop ileostomy may be used for patients with more extensive lesions and severe symptoms. As a preoperative management for surgical resection, selective feeding vessels angiographic embolization can help reduce intraoperative bleeding.

In conclusion, gastrointestinal tract involvement should be considered an alternative etiology for unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with KTS. Imaging provides a non-invasive modality to identify lesion extent, especially if these lesions are located in the small intestine. Critically, using CT and contrast agents, marked thickening of the affected bowel and progressive enhancement can be observed. Endoscopy facilitates direct observation of the mucosa, helps determine the nature of the lesion and identifies the bleeding site. Thus, the synergistic combination of imaging examinations and endoscopy can help diagnose this condition. Treatment modalities depend on the extent of lesions, and patient symptoms.

Serrated/hyperplastic polyposis syndrome — Patients with serrated polyposis should undergo colonoscopies every 1–3 years with attempted removal of all polyps > 5 mm diameter (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Indications for surgery for serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS) include an inability to control the growth of serrated polyps, or the development of cancer, and colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis is a reasonable option given the risks of metachronous neoplasia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). There is no evidence to support extracolonic cancer surveillance for SPS at this time, and screening recommendations for family members are currently unclear and should be individualized based on results of baseline evaluations in family members (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).
