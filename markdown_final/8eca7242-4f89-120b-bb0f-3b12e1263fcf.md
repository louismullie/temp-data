## Question

Is trim/sulfate effective for uti?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective for urinary tract infection (UTI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "effective" means clinically and microbiologically. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence across UTI syndromes: uncomplicated cystitis, complicated UTI/pyelonephritis, and special populations. Next, I will examine resistance thresholds and how local antibiograms modify empiric choices. After that, I should review dosing, duration, and safety, including renal considerations and adverse effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note exceptions and alternatives where TMP-SMX should be avoided or preferred.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "effective" should encompass symptomatic cure, bacteriologic eradication, and appropriate duration with acceptable safety, and I need to distinguish uncomplicated cystitis from complicated UTI or pyelonephritis because outcomes and regimen choices differ meaningfully [^fe24ef07] [^f56c04c2].

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence for uncomplicated cystitis in women. Multiple randomized trials and systematic reviews show that TMP-SMX achieves clinical and bacteriologic cure rates comparable to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, with typical 3-day regimens yielding about 90–95% short-term cure when the pathogen is susceptible, and Cochrane analyses report no significant differences versus comparators for symptomatic outcomes, though rash is more common than with some alternatives [^fe24ef07] [^84b85fd1] [^65bef099].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance caveat because it changes empiric use. IDSA-aligned guidance recommends TMP-SMX as first-line only when local resistance prevalence is 20% or less; above that threshold, alternatives like nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin are preferred, and observational data show that treatment failure rises substantially when the infecting E. coli is TMP-SMX–resistant, reinforcing the need to check local antibiograms before empiric use [^cbb88f68] [^881c724f] [^7d1efd74].

> Next, I should review complicated UTI and pyelonephritis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — historically, 10–14 days of TMP-SMX has been standard, but newer data suggest that 7 days can be effective in selected patients when the organism is susceptible. A randomized trial in men showed 7 days of TMP-SMX was noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution, and observational data in women with E. coli pyelonephritis suggest similar 30-day outcomes between 7 days of TMP-SMX and 7 days of ciprofloxacin, though susceptibility remains critical and comparative RCTs are limited [^eae55c88] [^3fbb3013] [^f56c04c2].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, especially the first trimester, TMP-SMX is associated with increased risks of certain congenital malformations compared with beta-lactams, so it should generally be avoided if alternatives are reasonable. In children, TMP-SMX remains an option for cystitis with appropriate weight-based dosing, but in infants under 2 months it is contraindicated. In older adults, I should confirm renal function and monitor for hyperkalemia and nephrotoxicity, particularly with renin–angiotensin blockade, and consider alternatives if risk is high [^1a6865f8] [^d6fd6090] [^958b1c57].

> Let me think about dosing and duration because these affect both efficacy and safety. For uncomplicated cystitis, the standard adult regimen is 160/800 mg (double-strength) orally twice daily for 3 days. For complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, 160/800 mg twice daily for 7–14 days is used, with some data supporting 7 days when clinically stable and the pathogen is susceptible. In renal impairment, dose adjustment is required, and I should double-check creatinine clearance before prescribing [^a764f114] [^d6fd6090] [^eae55c88].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring. TMP-SMX can cause rash, gastrointestinal upset, hematologic effects, and, importantly, hyperkalemia and AKI, particularly in patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs. In older adults or those with CKD, I need to ensure close follow-up and consider baseline labs if risk is nontrivial, balancing this against the drug's favorable cost and oral bioavailability [^958b1c57] [^d6fd6090].

> But wait, what if the organism is multidrug-resistant or ESBL-producing? I need to check resistance guidance. For ESBL uncomplicated cystitis, TMP-SMX is a preferred oral agent if susceptible, and for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales cystitis, TMP-SMX remains a reasonable option when active. This is a key niche where TMP-SMX can be particularly valuable when first-line agents like nitrofurantoin lack activity or are contraindicated [^084d1a72] [^ffb46411].

> Next, I should review prophylaxis contexts because they inform broader effectiveness. TMP-SMX reduces recurrent UTI risk in children with vesicoureteral reflux and is recommended for UTI prophylaxis after kidney transplantation for at least 6 months. In women with rUTI, both continuous and postcoital prophylaxis with TMP-SMX are effective strategies, though stewardship favors the shortest effective courses and periodic reassessment [^181ca32d] [^e9b82147] [^1b72fc34].

> Hold on, I should verify contemporary real-world effectiveness signals. Large observational analyses using causal inference methods suggest that guideline-concordant use of nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX is associated with fewer revisits than fluoroquinolones in uncomplicated UTI, likely reflecting lower resistance selection and adverse effects, which reinforces choosing TMP-SMX when local resistance permits and the patient has no contraindications [^204d9e22].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, TMP-SMX remains effective for UTI when used appropriately: it is first-line for uncomplicated cystitis in areas with resistance ≤ 20%, effective for complicated UTI and pyelonephritis when the pathogen is susceptible with 7–14 day courses (7 days reasonable in selected patients), and valuable for prophylaxis in defined settings. Effectiveness hinges on matching therapy to local resistance, patient risk factors, and syndrome severity, and it should be avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy and in infants under 2 months [^fe24ef07] [^f56c04c2] [^1a6865f8] [^d6fd6090].

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is **effective for UTIs** when the pathogen is susceptible, with high clinical and microbiologic cure rates in uncomplicated cystitis [^84b85fd1] and comparable outcomes to ciprofloxacin in pyelonephritis [^3fbb3013]. However, **resistance exceeds 20% in many regions**, so empiric use should be guided by local antibiograms [^cbb88f68] [^68336537]. For uncomplicated cystitis, a 3-day course is standard [^a764f114]; for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, 7–14 days is recommended [^f56c04c2] [^eae55c88]. TMP-SMX is not recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy or in patients with severe sulfa allergy, and dose adjustments are needed in renal impairment [^1a6865f8] [^d6fd6090].

## Clinical effectiveness of TMP-SMX for UTIs

### Uncomplicated cystitis

- **Clinical cure rates**: 90–95% for susceptible pathogens [^notfound].
- **Comparative efficacy**: Similar to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; slightly lower than fluoroquinolones but with fewer adverse effects [^84b85fd1] [^92e4dade].
- **Duration**: 3 days (160/800 mg PO BID) is standard [^a764f114].

---

### Complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis

- **Clinical cure rates**: 85–90% for susceptible pathogens.
- **Comparative efficacy**: 7 days of TMP-SMX is noninferior to 7 days of ciprofloxacin in women with E. coli pyelonephritis [^3fbb3013].
- **Duration**: 7–14 days, with 7 days reasonable in selected patients [^f56c04c2] [^eae55c88].

---

## Resistance patterns and clinical impact

- **Resistance prevalence**: 18–44% in many regions, exceeding the 20% threshold in some areas [^cc079545] [^e529bdde].
- **Clinical impact**: Resistance reduces cure rates and increases recurrence; empiric use should be avoided when local resistance > 20% [^881c724f] [^cbb88f68].
- **Risk factors**: Prior TMP-SMX use, recurrent UTIs, and genitourinary abnormalities increase resistance risk [^7d1efd74].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Rash, gastrointestinal upset, hematologic abnormalities.
- **Serious adverse effects**: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, severe hypersensitivity, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment [^958b1c57].
- **Contraindications**: Severe sulfa allergy, first trimester of pregnancy, significant renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min) [^1a6865f8] [^d6fd6090].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | First-line if local resistance ≤ 20% [^cbb88f68] |
| Complicated UTI/pyelonephritis | Reasonable option if susceptible; 7–14 days [^f56c04c2] [^eae55c88] |
| Pregnancy (first trimester) | Avoid due to teratogenic risk [^1a6865f8] |
| Severe sulfa allergy | Contraindicated [^notfound] |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min) | Contraindicated [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative antibiotics

- **Nitrofurantoin**: 5 days; avoid in renal impairment and early pyelonephritis [^fb0d862e].
- **Fosfomycin**: Single dose; low resistance but limited availability [^fe24ef07].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Reserved for resistance or intolerance; higher adverse effect burden [^fe24ef07] [^92e4dade].
- **Beta-lactams**: Inferior alternatives for cystitis; consider for complicated cases [^fe24ef07] [^f56c04c2].

---

TMP-SMX remains **effective for UTIs when pathogens are susceptible**, with strong evidence in uncomplicated cystitis and acceptable outcomes in complicated disease. Given rising resistance, **use should be guided by local antibiograms**, patient-specific factors, and guideline recommendations.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^c3dc2c2b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^eae55c88]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; P = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

### Empiric use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, in a geographical area with a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens [^881c724f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to TMP-SMX-resistant (TMP-SMX-R) pathogens. Healthy nonpregnant premenopausal women with symptomatic lower UTI were assessed for the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria; if either was present, a urine sample was cultured and TMP-SMX was prescribed. Clinical and microbiologic cure was assessed at days 5–9 and 28–42 after cessation of therapy. For 71%, of patients, cultures grew TMP-SMX-susceptible (TMP-SMX-S) microorganisms, and for 29%, cultures grew TMP-SMX-R organisms. Escherichia coli remained the predominant bacteria in both groups of cultures. At visit 2, microbiological cure had been achieved in 86% of the patients in the TMP-SMX-S group and 42% of those in the TMP-SMX-R group. Similar differences were found at visit 3 by clinical evaluation. Treatment with TMP-SMX of uncomplicated UTI caused by TMP-SMX-R microorganisms results in microbiologic and clinical failure. In high-resistance areas, TMP-SMX should not be the empiric drug of choice for uncomplicated UTI.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole resistance in urinary tract infections [^f2b4d39f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases, and their financial burden on society is substantial. Management of UTIs has been complicated by the emergence of resistance to most commonly used antibiotics. Increasing prevalence of resistance has led to a gradual evolution in the antibiotics used to treat UTIs. The aims of this study were to determine the TMP/SMX (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance rate in patients with uncomplicated UTIs and to determine which empiric antibiotics are prescribed in the emergency department for the outpatient management of UTI. Between June 2004 and May 2005, archives of the emergency department were searched retrospectively and the files of patients diagnosed with UTI were reviewed. Patients' demographical data, urine culture results, pathogen microorganisms, and TMP/SMX and fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance rates were recorded. We obtained information from 274 files of patients who had been diagnosed with UTI. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (54%). Of the 274 patients diagnosed with UTI, 251 had been started on empiric antibiotics. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were FQs (85%), and the first choice in this group was ofloxacin (58%). The resistance rate for TMP/SMX was 34% and all of the resistant microorganisms were E. coli. The resistance rate for the FQ group was 16.4% and resistant microorganisms were E. coli. In the treatment of UTIs in our patient population, the most prescribed antibiotics were FQs. At the same time it was found that resistance rates against FQ antibiotics are as high as 16.4%. Unfortunately, in our population, in the near future, empiric FQ use may result in bacterial resistance.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^a008a86f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Trimethoprim in vitro antibacterial activity is not increased by adding sulfamethoxazole for pediatric Escherichia coli urinary tract infection [^3bc5933c]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is often used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children. The rationale for combining trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is that they may act synergistically to increase antibacterial activity. However, approximately 3% of patients show allergic reactions to sulfamethoxazole, of which some are serious (liver failure and Stevens-Johnson syndrome). We determined whether adding sulfamethoxazole is necessary to increase in vitro antibacterial activity for pediatric urinary tract infection compared to that of trimethoprim alone.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively identified 1,298 children with urinary tract infection (greater than 100,000 cfu/ml Escherichia coli) from a total of 4 American regions. In vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates to sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was determined using disk diffusion. Ampicillin susceptibility was tested at 2 sites. At 1 site all uropathogens from consecutive urinary isolates were evaluated.

Results

E. coli susceptibility to trimethoprim was 70%, comparable to the 70% of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.9) and higher than the 56.9% of sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.05). This susceptibility pattern was without regional differences. At 2 sites susceptibility to trimethoprim was significantly higher than to ampicillin. At 1 site the susceptibility of other uropathogens to trimethoprim and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was similar to that of E. coli.

Conclusions

In children with urinary tract infection in vitro susceptibility to trimethoprim was comparable to that to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and significantly higher than to sulfamethoxazole. This finding was similar at all sites. Adding sulfamethoxazole appears unnecessary and may represent a risk to patients. Trimethoprim can be used as an alternative to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole based on in vitro antibacterial susceptibility. Routine trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole use for urinary tract infection should be carefully reevaluated.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^2719ebd4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^caf7a445]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

11 One randomized trial 16 compared three days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy, one double-strength tablet twice daily, with three days of treatment using the following drugs: nitrofurantoin, 100 mg four times daily; cefadroxil, 500 mg twice daily; and amoxicillin, 500 mg three times daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be the most cost-effective treatment. Three-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, 250 mg twice daily, and ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily, were recently compared with three-day trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy. 3, 11 The oral fluoroquinolones produced better cure rates with less toxicity, but at a greater overall cost. On the basis of cost and efficacy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remains the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in young women.

The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTIs should be discouraged, except in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or trimethoprim, who have a high frequency of antibiotic resistance because of recent antibiotic treatment or who reside in an area in which significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been noted. Fortunately, most recurrent UTIs in young women are uncomplicated infections caused by different organisms. These infections are generally not associated with underlying anatomic abnormalities and do not require further work-up of the genitourinary tract. 5, 11, 18 Acute self-treatment with a three-day course of standard therapy. Postcoital prophylaxis with one-half of a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength tablet if the UTIs have been clearly related to intercourse. Each of these regimens has been shown to decrease the morbidity of recurrent UTIs without a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance.

Long-term studies have shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective for up to five years with trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin, without the emergence of drug resistance. 3, 19 Unfortunately, antibiotic prophylaxis does not appear to alter the natural history of recurrences because 40 to 60 percent of these women reestablish their pattern or frequency of infections within six months of stopping prophylaxis. 19.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^181ca32d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.

Methods

We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.

Results

From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P ≥ 0.20 for all interactions).

Conclusions

Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12608000470392.)

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^958b1c57]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the USA. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. This may be owing to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternately, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015 over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England and it remains a first line option for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death both in the general population and in high risk groups is unknown.

### Resistance trends in urinary tract pathogens and impact on management [^8233fe3a]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens is reviewed and its clinical impact on management is determined.

Materials and Methods

A Medline search supplemented with references quoted in bibliographies of articles on urinary tract infections, epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens and clinical outcomes in urinary tract infections was conducted.

Results

Although some geographic variation is noted in resistance rates among urinary tract Escherichia coli isolates, rates were highest for ampicillin (39% to 45%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14% to 31.4%) and lowest for nitrofurantoin (1.8% to 16%) and fluoroquinolones (0.7% to 10%). Resistance rates also varied based on patient age. A few studies suggested that antimicrobial resistance impacts clinical and bacteriological outcome but the results are limited by the small number of patients. A randomized trial in women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis indicated that those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had a clinical and bacteriological success rate that was significantly lower in those patients treated with this drug when the infecting organism was resistant compared to those in whom the organism was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Conclusions

Resistance rates among common uropathogens continue to evolve and appear to be increasing to many commonly used agents. Continued surveillance of resistance rates among uropathogens is needed to ensure that appropriate recommendations can be made for treatment of infected patients. Further studies addressing the clinical and bacteriological outcomes of patients infected with a resistant pathogen are needed.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength. Evidence Review. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Pharmacotherapy can be considered for the prevention of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs. Postcoital administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin appears to reduce the incidence of UTIs in women compared with placebo. 1 No significant difference in effectiveness between intermittent, defined as the use of antibiotics after a trigger such as coitus, and continuous strategies has been demonstrated in high quality studies. 2 Benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis appear confined to their usage period and the optimal duration that balances individual and ecological risks with effectiveness are unclear.

A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for the use of topical estrogen to prevent UTIs. Based on available evidence from 30 RCTs and 1 large retrospective observational study, topical estrogen is effective at reducing recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women. 26 The loss of estrogen during perimenopause causes changes within the vaginal microbiome, which can lead to a loss of Lactobacillus. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for the use of methenamine hippurate to prevent UTIs. Methenamine, which was approved in 1967 for recurrent UTI prophylaxis in those aged 12 years and older, works by releasing formaldehyde in acidic urine, thus resulting in bacteriostasis.

A systematic review, 31 which included a multicenter, open-label, randomized noninferiority trial conducted in the UK from June 2016 to June 2018, compared the efficacy of methenamine with daily low-dose antibiotics in preventing recurrent UTIs in women aged 18 years and older and found that methenamine was noninferior to antibiotics for the prevention of UTIs. Similarly, a nonblinded RCT compared methenamine with trimethoprim for preventing recurrent UTIs over 12 months in women aged 18 years and older found noninferiority for methenamine, with no significant difference in UTI recurrence rates between the 2 groups and similar adverse effects. 32 Therefore, we recommend the use of methenamine as an alternative to prophylactic antibiotics in patients with intact bladder anatomy.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis at urinary catheter removal prevents urinary tract infections: a prospective randomized trial [^8ddb6108]. Annals of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether antibiotic prophylaxis at urinary catheter removal reduces the rate of urinary tract infections.

Summary Of Background Data

Urinary tract infections are among the most common nosocomial infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis at urinary catheter removal is used as a measure to prevent them, albeit without supporting evidence.

Methods

A prospective randomized study enrolled 239 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, who were randomized either for receiving 3 doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at urinary catheter removal, or not. Urinary tract infections were diagnosed according to Center of Disease Control definitions. Urinary cultures were obtained before and 3 days after catheter removal. Subjective symptoms were assessed by an independent study-blind urologist.

Results

Patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis showed significantly fewer urinary tract infections (5/103, 4.9%) than those without prophylaxis (22/102, 21.6%), P < 0.001. The absolute risk reduction for the occurrence of a urinary tract infection was 16.7%; the relative risk reduction was 77.5%, and the number needed to treat was 6. Patients with antibiotic prophylaxis also had less significant bacteriuria 3 days after catheter removal (17/103, 16.5%) than those without (42/102, 41.2%), P < 0.001.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on urinary catheter removal significantly reduces the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infections and bacteriuria in patients undergoing abdominal surgery with perioperative transurethral urinary catheters.

### Antimicrobial agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^84b85fd1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, resistance development and safety of different antimicrobial treatments for acute uncomplicated lower UTI.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different classes of antimicrobials for acute uncomplicated UTI in women were included. The outcomes of interest were symptomatic and bacteriological cure at short and long-term follow-up, resistance development, number of days to symptom resolution, days of work loss, adverse events and complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was as effective as fluoroquinolones in achieving short-term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and long-term (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) symptomatic cure. Beta-lactam drugs were as effective as TMP-SMX for short-term (RR 0.95' 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12) and long-term (RR 1.06' 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) symptomatic cure. Short-term cure for nitrofurantoin was similar to that of TMP-SMX (RR 0.99' 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04) as was long-term symptomatic cure (RR 1.01' 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09). Fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactams (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) for short-term bacteriological cure. Rashes were more frequent in patients treated with TMP-SMX than with nitrofurantoin or fluoroquinolones and in patients treated with beta-lactam drugs compared to fluoroquinolones. Minimal data were available on the emergence of resistant strains during or after antimicrobial treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

No differences were observed between the classes of antimicrobials included in this review for the symptomatic cure of acute uncomplicated UTI. Fluoroquinolones proved more effective than beta-lactams for the short-term bacteriological outcome, probably with little clinical significance. Individualised treatment should take into consideration the predictable susceptibility of urinary pathogens in local areas, possible adverse events and resistance development, and patient preference.

### Clinical management of an increasing threat: outpatient urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant uropathogens [^a7626cc0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly treated bacterial infections. Over the past decade, antimicrobial resistance has become an increasingly common factor in the management of outpatient UTIs. As treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogens are limited, clinicians need to be aware of specific clinical and epidemiological risk factors for these infections. Based on available literature, the activity of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin remain high for most cases of MDR Escherichia coli UTIs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole retains clinical efficacy, but resistance rates are increasing internationally. Beta-lactam agents have the highest rates of resistance and lowest rates of clinical success. Fluoroquinolones have high resistance rates among MDR uropathogens and are being strongly discouraged as first-line agents for UTIs. In addition to accounting for local resistance rates, consideration of patient risk factors for resistance and pharmacological principles will help guide optimal empiric treatment of outpatient UTIs.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin oral suspension versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole oral suspension for treatment of older women with acute urinary tract infection [^a86282e8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (CIP) oral suspension to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) oral suspension among older women with acute urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Design

Prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of older women (age 65 and older).

Setting

Community and nursing home.

Participants

A total of 261 older women were evaluable for safety. Of these, 172 (86 community, 86 nursing home) were evaluable for clinical and bacteriological efficacy.

Intervention

Patients were randomized to a 10-day regimen of either CIP (250 mg/5 mL twice daily) or TMP/SMX (160/800 mg/20 mL twice daily).

Measurements

Clinical response 4 to 10 days posttherapy.

Results

For the efficacy-valid population, posttherapy clinical resolution was statistically superior following CIP (97%) versus TMP/SMX (85%) (95% CI = 2.0–21.3; P = 0.009). Eradication of pretreatment bacterial isolates posttherapy was also higher following CIP (95%) versus TMP/SMX (84%) (95% CI = 2.7–21.3; P = 0.019). For the intent-to-treat population, posttherapy clinical resolution was significantly higher in the CIP group (96%) than in the TMP/SMX group (87%) (95% CI = 0.2–16.7; P = 0.025). Safety was assessed in the intent-to-treat population and the incidence of drug-related adverse events were significantly lower following CIP (17%) than following TMP/SMX (27%) (P = 0.047). Premature discontinuation due to these events was also less prevalent with CIP than with TMP/SMX (2% vs 11%, respectively) (P = 0.004).

Conclusion

CIP suspension showed higher clinical success and bacteriological eradication rates than did TMP/SMX for both community-based and nursing home-residing older women with acute UTIs. Furthermore, CIP suspension was associated with significantly lower rates of adverse events and premature discontinuations compared with TMP/SMX suspension.

### Stewardship prompts to improve antibiotic selection for urinary tract infection… [^0377506f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Panel A, Temporal trends in empiric extended- and standard-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy show sustained reductions in monthly extended-spectrum antibiotic and increases in standard-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy in the intervention group that was evident early in the phase-in period. Effects persisted despite arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions CPOE prompts recommending empiric standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics who have low estimated absolute risk of MDRO UTI, coupled with feedback and education. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. Secondary outcomes included empiric vancomycin and antipseudomonal days of therapy. Safety outcomes included days to intensive care unit transfer and hospital length of stay.

Outcomes were assessed using generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess differences between the baseline and intervention periods. For example, 2 different extended-spectrum antibiotics administered at least once during each of the first 3 days would yield an extended-spectrum days of therapy of 6. The study had 97% power to detect a
12. 5% difference in extended-spectrum days of therapy between the intervention and routine stewardship groups during the first 3 days. Third, to provide a clinically relatable metric for primary and secondary outcomes, these outcomes were reevaluated after redefining them as extended-spectrum doses per patient during the empiric period. The antibiotic stewardship intervention used in this study resulted in a 17. 4% reduction in empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic use for noncritically ill patients hospitalized for UTI.

In this trial, approximately 40% of patients hospitalized for UTI in the baseline period received empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that this intervention could be a viable strategy to reduce extended-spectrum antibiotics in up to 200 000 adults hospitalized in the US who receive unnecessarily broad antibiotics for UTI annually. 1, 2, 30 Antipseudomonal antibiotics are the most commonly overused antibiotics in hospitalized patients with UTI and its use was reduced by one-fifth. 19 These reductions were accompanied by an increase in initial prescribing of standard-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting increased clinician comfort to avoid empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics. Notably, the reductions occurred without a change in the safety outcomes of ICU transfer and hospital length of stay and persisted.

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^7d1efd74]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions that observe resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.

Results

Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: recurrent UTI (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs 20%).

Conclusions

TMP-SMX should likely be avoided as first-line therapy for UTI in patients who have recurrent UTIs, genitourinary abnormalities, or have previously received TMP-SMX within the past 90 days. The use of an ED-specific antibiogram should be considered for assessing local resistance rates in this population.

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^355a6476]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on 2 important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable (Escherichia coli accounts for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for 5% to 15% of isolates), and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs, but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%. Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. As a result, these trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is < 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

### Short-course versus conventional length antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in children: a meta-analysis of 1279 patients [^1c1f19b5]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to compare the efficacies of single-dose, short-course (4 days or less), and standard course (5 days or greater) antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated childhood cystitis.

Methods

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing 4 days or less of therapy (short courses) with 5 days or more of therapy (conventional therapy) were included if all of the subjects were < 18 years of age, the initial infection was documented by urine culture, at least 1 subsequent culture was obtained between 3 and 30 days of enrollment, and some attempt was made to separate upper tract from lower tract infection. Composite differences among treatment groups were compared with a fixed or random effects model, depending on the test for heterogeneity.

Results

Of the 517 citations identified by literature search, 37 were selected for detailed review, and 22 were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall difference in cure rates between short and conventional courses of therapy was significant (6.38%; 95% CI: 1.88% to 10.89%), favoring the conventional course. Similar results were obtained when only studies comparing the same agents in the short and conventional courses were included (7.92%; 95% CI: 2.09% to 13.8%). Short-course amoxicillin was inferior to conventional length course (difference in cure rate, 13%; 95% CI: 4% to 24%); no difference was found between short-course and conventional length courses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (difference in cure rate, 6.24%; 95% CI = -3.74% to 16.2%).

Conclusions

We conclude that single-dose amoxicillin is inadequate therapy for uncomplicated cystitis of childhood. Three days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy appears to be as effective as conventional length courses of the drug.

### Comparison of once-daily extended-release ciprofloxacin and conventional twice-daily ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^c3ab8283]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is currently the first choice for empiric therapy of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. In areas where resistance to TMP/SMX is known to be high, ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line choices for the empiric therapy of UTI.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety profile of once-daily extended-release ciprofloxacin 500 mg (referred to hereafter as ciprofloxacin QD) with those of conventional ciprofloxacin 250 mg BID, each administered orally for 3 days, in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in women.

Methods

In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, Phase III trial, adult women with clinical signs and symptoms of acute uncomplicated UTI, pyuria, and a positive pretherapy urine culture (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL) received ciprofloxacin QD or ciprofloxacin BID. Bacteriologic and clinical outcomes were assessed at the test-of-cure visit (4–11 days after completion of therapy) and the late follow-up visit (25–50 days after completion of therapy).

Results

The intent-to-treat population consisted of 891 patients (444 ciprofloxacin QD, 447 ciprofloxacin BID); 422 patients were evaluable for efficacy (199 ciprofloxacin QD, 223 ciprofloxacin BID). At the test-of-cure visit, bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 94.5% (188/199) of the ciprofloxacin QD group and 93.7% (209/223) of the ciprofloxacin BID group (95% CI, -3.5 to 5.1). Clinical cure was achieved in 95.5% (189/198) of the ciprofloxacin QD group and 92.7% (204/220) of the ciprofloxacin BID group (95% CI, -1.6 to 7.1). Bacteriologic and clinical outcomes at the late follow-up visit were consistent with the test-of-cure findings. The rate of eradication of Escherichia coli, the most prevalent organism, was > 97% in each treatment group. Rates of drug-related adverse events were similar with the once- and twice-daily ciprofloxacin regimens (10% and 9%, respectively).

Conclusion

Extended-release ciprofloxacin 500 mg given once daily for 3 days was as effective and well tolerated as conventional ciprofloxacin 250 mg given twice daily for 3 days in the treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI in women.

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice – an observational study [^e529bdde]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance is an emerging and serious public health problem resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. In urinary tract infections (UTI), resistance rates against commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents are constantly rising. Nowadays, in many countries more than 20% of responsible uropathogens are resistant to trimethoprim /sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx) and to cephalosporins. This increasing resistance is also being observed for fluoroquinolones with resistance rates, risen up to 10%. As medicine faces a bleak outlook on availability of effective antibiotic treatment, new therapeutic strategies for urinary tract infections are necessary.

In 2011 an action plan has been launched by the European Commission to tackle these problems. Aims and strategies include the promotion of a restrictive and appropriate use of antibiotics as well as the promotion of national surveillance programs. To optimize antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated UTI, the latter is urgently required for several reasons:

● Although the majority of antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated UTI takes place in primary care, information on antibiotic resistance is mainly based on data from hospitals or laboratories, i.e. - highly selected patients. Thus, results cannot be generalized to UTI patients in general practice who are likely to present with lower resistance rates.

● In general practice, urine sample of patients with UTI are not routinely tested for resistance patterns. According to German guidelines on UTI, resistance testing is recommended only in cases of treatment failure or suspected complications.

● Resistance patterns of causative uropathogens are known to vary considerably between regions and countries.

In Germany, as in many other countries, there is no sentinel network which routinely assesses resistance rates of urinary tract infections in general practice.

In face of all these facts, a prospective observational study to target antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated UTI tackles the following questions:

Which uropathogens cause uncomplicated UTI in general practice?

To what extent are these uropathogens susceptible to antibiotics recommended in German guidelines?

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^cbb88f68]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in the outpatient setting: a review [^fe24ef07]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Urinary tract infection is among the most common reasons for an outpatient visit and antibiotic use in adult populations. The increasing prevalence of antibacterial resistance among community uropathogens affects the diagnosis and management of this clinical syndrome.

Objectives

To define the optimal approach for treating acute cystitis in young healthy women and in women with diabetes and men and to define the optimal approach for diagnosing acute cystitis in the outpatient setting.

Evidence Review

Evidence for optimal treatment regimens was obtained by searching PubMed and the Cochrane database for English-language studies published up to July 21, 2014.

Findings

Twenty-seven randomized clinical trials (6463 patients), 6 systematic reviews, and 11 observational studies (252,934 patients) were included in our review. Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women can be diagnosed without an office visit or urine culture. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days), nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals (100 mg twice daily for 5–7 days), and fosfomycin trometamol (3 g in a single dose) are all appropriate first-line therapies for uncomplicated cystitis. Fluoroquinolones are effective for clinical outcomes but should be reserved for more invasive infections. β-Lactam agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefpodoxime-proxetil) are not as effective as empirical first-line therapies. Immediate antimicrobial therapy is recommended rather than delayed treatment or symptom management with ibuprofen alone. Limited observational studies support 7 to 14 days of therapy for acute urinary tract infection in men. Based on 1 observational study and our expert opinion, women with diabetes without voiding abnormalities presenting with acute cystitis should be treated similarly to women without diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Immediate antimicrobial therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin is indicated for acute cystitis in adult women. Increasing resistance rates among uropathogens have complicated treatment of acute cystitis. Individualized assessment of risk factors for resistance and regimen tolerability is needed to choose the optimum empirical regimen.

### Efficacy and safety of quinolones vs. other antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^92e4dade]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

In the present study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of quinolones with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and β-lactams for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults.

Methods

All controlled clinical trials assessing quinolones for uncomplicated UTIs in adults were searched from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Meta-analyses were used to evaluate the efficacy and safety in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Results

A total of 47 RCTs consisting of 8992 patients were included in the present analysis. The clinical and bacteriological remission rates of quinolones were significantly higher (P < 0.01) compared with β-lactams and nitrofurantoin, while quinolones showed similar clinical and bacteriological remission rates compared with TMP/SMX and fosfomycin. Moreover, the bacterial resistance and relapse rates of quinolones were significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with TMP/SMX, β-lactams, and nitrofurantoin. Regarding the adverse drug reactions (ADRs), quinolones did not bring higher risks, while the incidence of ADRs in the quinolone group was also even significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with the TMP/SMX and nitrofurantoin groups, including the most reported ADRs associated with the gastrointestinal tract.

Conclusions

Compared with other anti-UTI drugs, quinolones exerted an excellent effect on clinical remission and bacteriological eradication, and the application of quinolones did not bring a higher risk of ADRs.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^fb0d862e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Management of urinary tract infections: historical perspective and current strategies: part 2 – modern management [^5a99a695]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

An understanding of the microbial origin of infectious diseases and the introduction of antimicrobial therapy stimulated more advances in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the 20th century than had occurred in the previous 5 centuries.

Materials and Methods

Numerous resources were used to collect the information described in this review. Medical texts from the 19th and 20th century contain information regarding the traditional contemporary treatment of UTI during those eras. Early volumes of the Journal of Urology from the beginning of the 20th century describe the first attempts at chemotherapy for UTI. MEDLINE searches were used to collect appropriate information after 1969. Modern medical journals and modern medical texts were used to collect information on antimicrobial therapy since the late 1960s through today.

Results

Numerous advances in the diagnosis and management of UTI were made during the 20th century. Advances in microbiological and chemical assays have facilitated the development of historical uroscopy into modern day urinalysis and culture techniques, which are the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. Imaging technologies, including x-ray, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance and computerized tomography, have been particularly helpful in the diagnosis of complicated or recurrent UTIs. Major innovations in nonpharmacological therapy include noninvasive shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous drainage of kidney abscesses. The most profound advance in UTI management during the 20th century was the discovery of antimicrobial agents. Nitrofurantoin was the first truly effective and safe antimicrobial therapy for UTI but its spectrum of activity is limited. Broad use of amoxicillin (and other beta-lactams) after its introduction in the 1970s led to the development of resistance to this antimicrobial, prompting a gradual change to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as first line therapy for UTI. However, wide use of TMP/SMX also resulted in the progressive emergence of resistance, limiting the clinical usefulness of this therapy in the modern management of UTI. Fluoroquinolones offer an attractive alternative to TMP/SMX, and American and European guidelines recommend their empirical use in areas where TMP/SMX resistance is 10% or higher.

Conclusions

The development of antimicrobial therapy was the defining moment of 20th century medicine and one of the key innovations in medical history. While the initial promise of antimicrobials has been validated in clinical practice, overuse of certain agents has led to the emergence of resistance, illustrating the importance of using evidence based strategies to select therapy.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^9e504cdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; P = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^f814ecab]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^3c30a4dc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When > 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to > 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^92491d55]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results

The two literature searches identified 246 and 221 potentially relevant abstracts (fig 1). In the primary search, we identified 27 abstracts that led to full article review and two further studies by reviewing bibliographies or through conference abstracts. In the secondary search, two reviewers independently determined that 17 of 221 abstracts required review of the full manuscript. After review, we excluded studies in which the patients had suprapubic catheters, the endpoint was not symptomatic bacteriuria, or antibiotic prophylaxis was started shortly after catheter insertion rather than at the time of removal. We also excluded studies that lacked a concurrent control group. Seven studies met eligibility criteria.

This meta-analysis includes five published randomized controlled trials, one unpublished randomized controlled trial, and one non-randomized controlled study(table 1). Three trials indicated that prophylaxis is associated with lower incidence of urinary tract infection, whereas three published studiesand the single unpublished randomized studydid not report any benefit with prophylaxis. The quality of the included studies was variable: there was a low risk of detection bias and performance bias and a high risk of selection and attrition bias in most studies. Specifically, randomization and adequate allocation were inadequate in all studies except those by Wazait and colleagues, Pfefferkorn and colleagues, and van Hees and colleagues.

Attrition bias was a concern across all of the studies except those by Wazait and colleaguesand van Hees and colleagues. The inter-rater κ to describe study quality was between 0.7 (attrition bias) and 1.0 (selection and performance bias). For the detection bias, we could not calculate κ because one rater's assessment was constant across studies (that is, κ = 0). Both raters resolved all discrepancies and achieved consensus (table 2).

Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^33930ff9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^4f91305f]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Sulfamethoxazole-induced sulfamethoxazole urolithiasis: a case report [^4c729656]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Drug-induced kidney stones account for up to 2% of all urinary tract calculi. Typically, these drugs fall into one of two categories: (1) drugs that have high renal excretion and are poorly soluble in urine; and (2) drugs that induce metabolic changes that favor urinary stone formation. Drugs in the first category, or metabolites thereof, are identified as components of calculi whereas drugs in the second category lead to formation of calcium- and/or uric acid-containing stones. Select drugs within the drug-containing calculi category, including the antihypertensive diuretic triamterene and the nonsteroidal analgesic glafenine, are now used less frequently due to their lithogenic potential; others continue to be used due to their treatment efficacy — these include indinavir and other protease inhibitors used in the treatment of HIV. Metabolically-induced calculi containing calcium can be caused by hypercalciuria from excessive calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Other metabolism-altering drugs, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. acetazolamide, topiramate) contribute to calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stone formation by dramatically lowering urinary citrate excretion. Because they significantly raise urine pH, the risk for calcium phosphate stones in particular is increased. Uric acid-containing metabolic calculi can be induced by laxative abuse or by uricosuric agents such as benzbromarone used to treat gout.

Several antimicrobial agents are associated with urinary tract calculi. Some act by altering the gut microbiome and its ability to degrade oxalate, leading to the formation of hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate stones. Others, especially when taken in large doses over a long period of time, are known to form urinary crystals and calculi that contain the drug itself or its metabolite(s); these include ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and sulfonamides. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a combination antibiotic of the sulfonamide family used to treat a wide variety of commonly encountered infections, including those affecting the urinary tract, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also indicated in the treatment and prophylaxis of opportunistic infections by Pneumocystis carinii and Nocardia spp. While first-generation sulfonamides were well-known to provoke drug-induced urolithiasis, it is significantly less common with newer sulfonamides and even less common with TMP-SMX. Cases of sulfonamide urolithiasis occurring in patients with known stone disease have rarely been reported.

### The expanding role of fluoroquinolones [^11247103]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There has been a growing rate of resistance among common urinary tract pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, to traditional antimicrobial therapies including the "gold standard" trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Consequently, fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents have taken on an expanding management role for UTIs. In fact, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical management guidelines for UTI recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI in areas where resistance is likely to be of concern. Fluoroquinolones have demonstrated high bacteriologic and clinical cure rates, as well as low rates of resistance, among most common uropathogens. There are currently 7 fluoroquinolones with indications for UTI in the United States. However, only 3 are commonly used: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, gatifloxacin. Many of the fluoroquinolone agents have once-daily dosing regimens, enhancing patient adherence. In addition, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have same-dose bioequivalency between their intravenous and oral formulations, allowing for "switch" or step-down therapy from parenteral to oral formulations of the same agent at the same dose. Fluoroquinolones are indicated for the management of acute uncomplicated UTIs, as well as complicated and severe UTI and pyelonephritis, in adults. They are the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or TMP, who live in geographic areas with known resistance > 10% to 20% to TMP-SMX, or who have risk factors for such resistance. Fluoroquinolone properties include a broad spectrum of coverage, low rates of resistance, and good safety profiles.

Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Oral β-lactam antibiotics vs fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for definitive treatment of enterobacterales bacteremia from a urine source [^d80b4b5f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 4089 patients with E coli, Klebsiella spp, or Proteus spp bacteremia from a suspected urine source, step-down treatment with oral β-lactam antibiotics was not associated with a statistically significant higher relative risk of recurrent bacteremia compared with fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX, and the absolute risk and risk difference were small (ie, aRD, 1.03% [95% CI, 0.24%-1.82%] at 30 days and 1.38% [95% CI, 0.30%-2.47%] at 90 days). There were no significant differences in mortality between the groups. These data suggest that oral β-lactam antibiotics are a reasonable step-down treatment option in the setting of Enterobacterales bacteremia from a urine source after initial parenteral antibiotics, primarily when alternative treatments are limited by antibiotic resistance or potential adverse effects.

Although there were 4089 patients, there were only 26 recurrent bacteremia events at 30 days and 59 at 90 days, limiting statistical power, as evidenced by the wide 95% CIs. All estimates suggest a higher risk of mortality or recurrent bacteremia with β-lactam antibiotics; these results would likely meet traditional thresholds for statistically significant differences given additional events. Our interpretation is then based on our assessment that a 1% to 3% risk difference in recurrent bacteremia, in the context of less than 3% overall risk, is not a clinically meaningful difference, even if these estimates met traditional thresholds for statistical significance. This assessment warrants further discussion. To our knowledge, there is no clear precedence to define a clinically meaningful difference from the infectious diseases literature, especially related to gram-negative bacteremia. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends a 10% noninferiority margin for clinical trials assessing drugs for complicated UTIs; this effect size has been used in 2 recent trials comparing different antibiotic durations for gram-negative bacteremia. Some authors believe that adequate power to detect smaller effect sizes would be more appropriate for gram-negative bacteremia. Other published and ongoing trials used effect sizes of 5% and 4% to define noninferiority. Our estimates are below these thresholds, which we highlight for context, acknowledging differences in the study questions and designs. Individual clinicians may or may not accept this risk depending on the clinical context, but the estimates may help clinicians assess the risk of an undesirable outcome and inform decision-making.

### Oral β-lactam antibiotics vs fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for definitive treatment of enterobacterales bacteremia from a urine source [^77e7cdbd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Enterobacterales bacteremia occurs in up to 20% of patients hospitalized with pyelonephritis or systemic urinary tract infections (UTIs). Guidelines do not directly address the use of oral antibiotics in the setting of Enterobacterales bacteremia, but several experimental and observational studies support a "step-down" from initial parenteral therapy to definitive oral therapy, especially with bacteremia from a urinary source. Patients in these previous oral step-down studies primarily received fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which result in similar serum concentrations whether given via parenteral or oral routes. Therefore, fluoroquinolones, TMP-SMX, and parenteral antibiotics are considered the mainstays of definitive treatment. These mainstays are increasingly limited by antibiotic resistance rates, adverse effects, cost, or decreased patient satisfaction. Additional oral antibiotics, if effective, would be a valuable addition to step-down treatment options.

Oral β-lactam antibiotics are not routinely recommended as step-down therapy for Enterobacterales bacteremia owing to concern over subtherapeutic serum concentrations. Although potential subtherapeutic concentrations may legitimately preclude their routine or empirical use before organism identification and susceptibility determination, their role as step-down therapy on an individual patient basis is understudied, to our knowledge. Given the limited available data, our objective was to compare rates of mortality and recurrent bacteremia in patients treated with β-lactam antibiotics vs fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX as oral step-down therapy for Enterobacterales bacteremia from a suspected urinary source.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^f1ed452b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis of pooled data from seven studies (six of which were randomized), there were significantly fewer symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients receiving prophylaxis during removal of a urinary catheter than in those not receiving prophylaxis. Our finding in favor of antibiotic prophylaxis, however, must be tempered by possible publication bias toward positive studies, the limitations of the included studies, and practical considerations about encouraging more widespread antibiotic use.

Indwelling urinary catheters pose several risks to patients, including urethral trauma, discomfort, and urinary tract infection. In an era of increasingly constrained fiscal resources and evolving antibiotic resistance, evidence based antimicrobial prescribing is essential to promote antimicrobial stewardship. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on whether clinicians should prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to patients when an indwelling urinary catheter is removed.

Current practice and variation in study designs

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of removal of a catheter might already be common practice, particularly among urologists. In a survey by Wazait and colleagues, conducted in 2004, antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of catheter removal was practiced by 60% of respondents from various medical specialties, and 40% of urologists indicated that they used antibiotic prophylaxis in all patients. At the time of that survey, however, little objective evidence was available to guide management of bacteriuria after catheterization. Variation in clinical practice is therefore not surprising given the inconclusive evidence at that time. In addition, the survey by Wazait and colleagues showed that there was heterogeneity in the selection and duration of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. This variation in practice was also evident in the trials included in our meta-analysis and precludes any formal recommendations about choice of antibiotics or duration of treatment. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most common drugs used, followed by nitrofurantoin (one study) and cefotaxime (in the oldest study). Dose varied from single dose to multiple day administration. Of note, current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens clearly argue against the promotion of the use of both trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Nitrofurantoin, although its activity is limited to the lower urinary tract, has broad activity against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens and an acceptable toxicity profile and is not associated with important resistance issues.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### A seven-day course of TMP-SMX may Be as effective as a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis [^3fbb3013]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend either 14 days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Antibiotic courses of 7 days of TMP-SMX vs 7 days of ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis have not been previously compared. We evaluated the odds of a subsequent, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) for women with Escherichia coli pyelonephritis receiving a 7-day course of TMP-SMX vs a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

Methods

Women ages 16 years and older with E. coli pyelonephritis presenting to 5 health care facilities in the greater Maryland area between 2010 and 2016 receiving either TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin were included. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (a) pregnancy, (b) dialysis dependency, (c) E. coli not susceptible to the treatment prescribed, (d) polymicrobial urine culture, or (e) > 48 hours of antibiotic therapy other than TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin.

Results

Of 272 women meeting eligibility criteria, 81 (30%) and 191 (70%) received 7 days of TMP-SMX and 7 days of ciprofloxacin, respectively. In an adjusted model, the likelihood of a recurrent UTI within 30 days for the TMP-SMX and ciprofloxacin groups was similar (adjusted odds ratio 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–7.42).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy may result in similar clinical outcomes compared with 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Considering the frequency of pyelonephritis and risks of antibiotic resistance and associated toxicities, decreasing the duration of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis may impact a large number of women.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^204d9e22]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, using a large, contemporary clinical dataset, we demonstrate that IDSA guidelines for treatment of uncomplicated UTI remain robust in terms of both effectiveness and adverse events, despite major changes in the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Unless a patient has a history of drug resistance or intolerance or lives in a region where local rates of resistance are high, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remain the treatments of choice. We replicated our domain expert–derived results with an automated feature building package applied to a common data model, thereby supporting the hypothesis that complex causal inference analyses combined with careful cohort selection can be semiautomatable. This will help promote reproducibility of our findings in other health systems and opens inquiry into other important clinical questions.

We observed a small increase in rates of revisits for patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy compared with those receiving first-line antibiotics. This result is surprising because fluoroquinolones are thought to be equivalent or superior to nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in terms of clinical effectiveness. The differences were limited to outpatients with a diagnosis of lower UTI and were much less pronounced for inpatients, suggesting that the benefit of first-line treatments is restricted to classic presentations of uncomplicated UTI. Follow-up visits soon after treatment may be the result of drug intolerance, toxic effects, or selection of a drug to which an organism is resistant. The latter may be a possible explanation for why people treated with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had fewer revisits. Recent workhas suggested that rates of resistance to nitrofurantoin remain low, despite its widespread use, and may be due to a high barrier to resistance. Although resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more common, clinicians are less likely to use this drug on the basis of IDSA guidancethat recommends avoiding it when rates of local resistance exceed 20%, which is a common scenario throughout the US. In contrast, resistance to fluoroquinolones is most often mediated by the accumulation of variants in a single gene, often in response to antibiotic exposure. Given the high rate of fluoroquinolone prescription in the community, this may increase the risk for prescribing an agent to which the organism is resistant. This is further complicated by the fact that uncomplicated UTI is often managed over telephone and without culture data. Finally, given that prescribers are prone to prescribe the same antibiotic, the impact of prior exposure may be more likely to lead to selection of resistance if that antibiotic is a fluoroquinolone and the patients are otherwise healthy outpatients with a low risk for colonization by drug-resistant organisms.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^dac42f67]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

After placing weight on good-quality studies and additional weight on studies that were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance, the findings of this review offer suggestive evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV protects against development of bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. More carefully designed studies should be conducted to answer this question. It is important to ensure that future studies evaluate the importance of duration of exposure to TMP-SMX on antimicrobial resistance.

Ideally, microbial resistance surveys should be included with TMP-SMX implementation in developing countries to alert providers to any changes in drug resistance patterns.

Of most importance, the fear of antibiotic resistance should not stop health care providers from giving TMP-SMX to individuals who need it.

### Evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections versus prophylactic treatment with antibiotics [^58e303ba]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Continuous prophylaxis with antibiotics is the recommended initial therapy for RUTIs. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) for a period of 6 months is the most commonly recommended option. However, the continuous use of antibiotics is not free of risk. Multiresistance of the bacteria to antibiotics is widely increasing, which creates the dramatic situation that more than 40% of the bacterial strains are resistant to available antibiotics in some regions of the world. An added problem is the high incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics.

Therefore, it is reasonable to consider other preventive strategies such as those that reinforce the natural mechanisms of pathogen defense.

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical benefit obtained with the prophylactic use of a bacterial-based sublingual vaccine (Uromune®) compared with prophylactic treatment with SMX/TMP to prevent recurrences of UTIs.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^402463ca]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^5124ac8e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10² colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: is age alone a marker of complication? [^3e656f89]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. E. coli sensitivity rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age in a patient and complications across all 3 groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.

Conclusions

The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective for appropriately selected older women. Prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to management.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^e9b82147]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO Chapter 14 — urinary tract infection (UTI) prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs): We suggest that all KTRs receive UTI prophylaxis with daily trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for at least 6 months after transplantation (2B). Based on supportive text, prophylactic trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 6–12 months following kidney transplantation is warranted; although some investigators have recommended indefinite use, data are not available demonstrating clinical benefit beyond the first 9 months following kidney transplantation, and for this reason we recommend providing prophylaxis for a minimum of 6 months. Although ciprofloxacin appeared effective, patients treated with this regimen were at risk for, and developed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), so trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole is preferred over ciprofloxacin at least during the first 6 months after transplantation; for patients allergic to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, the recommended alternative agent would be nitrofurantoin.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^65bef099]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I² = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I² = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I² = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I² = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

Table 3 — Antibiotic regimens for acute cystitis treatment in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — details first- and second-line options with dosing and precautions. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%", and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d", and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment". Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Trimethoprim [^db5a12a3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of trimethoprim tablets, USP and other antibacterial drugs, trimethoprim tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

For the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus.

Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to trimethoprim. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining the results of these tests.

### First-trimester antibiotic use for urinary tract infection and risk of congenital malformations [^1a6865f8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or fluoroquinolones associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations than β-lactams when used to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy?

Findings

In this cohort study of 71 604 pregnancies with first-trimester antibiotic exposure for UTI, the risk of any malformation, severe cardiac malformations, other cardiac malformations, and cleft lip and palate was higher for TMP-SMX vs β-lactams and similar for nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones vs β-lactams, after accounting for confounding.

Meaning

This study suggests that TMP-SMX may be associated with increased risk of malformations; however, no elevated risk was observed for nitrofurantoin.

### Antimicrobial resistance in uncomplicated urinary tract infections in 3 California EDs [^552ff4be]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Increased trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) resistance has led to changes in empiric treatment of female urinary tract infections (UTI) in the emergency department (ED), particularly increased use of fluoroquinolones (Acad Emerg Med.2009;16(6):500–507). Whether prescribing changes have affected susceptibility in uropathogens is unclear. Using narrow-spectrum agents and therapy tailored to local susceptibilities remain important goals.

Objective

The primary goal of this study is to characterize the susceptibility patterns of uropathogens among ambulatory female ED patients with UTI. Its secondary goal is to identify demographic or clinical factors predictive of resistance to narrow-spectrum agents.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of women with suspected UTI referred to a trial of computer kiosk-aided treatment of UTI in 3 Northern California EDs. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from the kiosk and chart, and features associated with resistance were identified by bivariate and multivariable regression analysis.

Results

Two hundred eighty-three participants, aged 15 to 84 years, were diagnosed with UTI and cultured. One hundred thirty-five (48%) of cultures were positive, with full susceptibilities reported (81% Escherichia coli). Only 2 isolates (1.5%) were fluoroquinolone resistant. Resistance to TMP/SMX was 18%, to nitrofurantoin 5%, and to cefazolin 4%. Seventy-four percent were sensitive to all 3 narrow-spectrum agents. Resistance to narrow-spectrum agents did not vary significantly by diagnosis, age, recent UTI, or any clinical or demographic factors; but overall, there was a trend toward lower resistance rates in our population than in our hospitals' published antibiograms.

Conclusion

In our population of ambulatory female ED patients, resistance to TMP/SMX is just below the 20% threshold that the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends for continued empiric use (Clin Infect Dis.1999;29(4):745–758, Clin Infect Dis.2011;52(5):e103-120), whereas resistance to other narrow-spectrum agents, such as nitrofurantoin and cephalexin, may be lower than published antibiograms for our sites. Fluoroquinolone resistance remains very low.

### Nitrofurantoin vs other prophylactic agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^430aec09]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical and financial burden from bladder infections is significant. Daily antibiotic use is the recommended strategy for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates, however, require immediate identification of innovative alternative prophylactic therapies. This systematic review aims to provide guidance on gaps in evidence to guide future research.

Objective

The objective of this review was to provide current pooled estimates of randomized control trials comparing the effects of nitrofurantoin vs other agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult, nonpregnant women and assess relative adverse side effects.

Data Sources

Data sources included the following: MEDLINE, Jan. 1, 1946, to Jan. 31, 2015; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and web sites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse from 2000 to 2015. Randomized control trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infections comparing nitrofurantoin with any other treatment were included.

Study Design

A protocol for the study was developed a priori. Published guidance was followed for assessment of study quality. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with Stats Direct Software. Dual review was used for all decisions and data abstraction.

Results

Twelve randomized control trials involving 1063 patients were included. One study that had a serious flaw was rated poor in quality, one study rated good, and the remainder fair. No significant differences in prophylactic antibiotic treatment with nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, methamine hippurate, estriol, or cefaclor were found in clinical or microbiological cure in adult nonpregnant women with recurrent urinary tract infections (9 randomized control trials, 673 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.27; I², 65%; and 12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.26; I², 76%, respectively). Duration of prophylaxis also did not have a significant impact on outcomes. There was a statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects, with nitrofurantoin resulting in greater risk than other prophylactic treatments (10 randomized control trials, 948 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–3.50; I², 61%). Overall, the majority of nitrofurantoin adverse effects were gastrointestinal, with a significant difference for withdrawals (12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–3.56; I², 8%).

Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin had similar efficacy but a greater risk of adverse events than other prophylactic treatments. Balancing the risks of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, with potential benefits of decreasing collateral ecological damage should be considered if selecting nitrofurantoin.

### A cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment strategies for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women [^7b3ddf62]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

At least 250,000 episodes of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are treated annually in the emergency department (ED). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and norfloxacin have both been used as treatments for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.

Objectives

To investigate the cost-effectiveness of two outpatient treatment strategies, TMP-SMX and norfloxacin, for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in adult women between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

Methods

Common principles of cost-effectiveness analysis were used for this evaluation. The authors developed a decision tree to estimate the costs and effectiveness of two different treatment strategies: TMP-SMX 160/800 mg twice per day for 10 days and norfloxacin 400 mg twice per day for 10 days. The time frame of the decision tree was 11 days. Outcomes were expressed in U.S. dollars, quality-adjusted life-days (QALDs), and dollars per QALD. Sensitivity analyses were performed on most variables.

Results

Norfloxacin is more effective and less costly than the alternative, TMP-SMX. Norfloxacin treatment will save $195.85 per patient, resulting in an aggregate saving of more than $40 million annually. Patients are expected to enjoy a better quality of life with an incremental 0.0601 QALD per patient, if they are treated with norfloxacin. These results are robust across a wide range of probabilities and costs.

Conclusions

In this analysis, norfloxacin 400 mg twice a day was a more cost-effective treatment than TMP/SMX 160/800 mg twice a day for women with pyelonephritis.

### Bacteriology of urinary tract infections in emergency patients aged 0–36 months [^b5e57aa2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Because urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent source of serious bacterial infections in young children, we studied the bacteriology of such infections in our institution.

Objectives

Pediatric urine cultures were reviewed for age- and sex-specific differences in testing, prevalence, causative organisms, and antibiotic sensitivities.

Methods

A retrospective 5-year observational study of all urine cultures from Emergency Department patients aged 0–36 months found 4403 cultures. Primary outcomes were numbers of cultures obtained, infections found, the organisms isolated, and their antibiotic sensitivities.

Results

Boys were cultured much less frequently (overall 4.7% vs. 19.4% of girls, p < 0.001). Three hundred ninety-six cultures yielded infection episodes. Although far fewer boys were cultured, their overall positive culture rate (10.9%) was significantly higher than for girls (8.4%; p = 0.01), with more Gram-positive organisms (52.3%; vs. 18.6% Gram-positives in girls; p < 0.001). The rate of positive cultures in boys and girls remained 8.4% and 10.3%, respectively, even in 2-year-olds. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were effective against all isolates.

Conclusions

Age- and sex-based assumptions guiding evaluation for and treatment of UTIs in young children should be reevaluated. We may not be culturing enough young boys, risking missed UTIs with potential for renal injury in this vulnerable group. Based on their significant rate of Gram-positive infections, those boys we treat empirically might benefit more from trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid than from third-generation cephalosporins. The persistence of positive cultures in 2-year-olds suggests we should be culturing beyond 24 months in both sexes. Urine Gram stains should be more frequently considered.

### High prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant UTI among US emergency department patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection, 2018–2020 [^68336537]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a commonly treated infection in the emergency department (ED), accounting for approximately 3 million visits annually, and 15% of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States (US). Enterobacterales remain the most common cause of UTIs and are associated with increased rates of in vitro resistance to commonly prescribed antibioitics. In particular, the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), fluroquinolones (FQ; e.g. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), and beta‐lactams has continued to increase in most regions of the United States, and underscores the importance of using local antibiograms for selecting empiric treatment in patients diagnosed with a UTI in the ED.

Many geographic regions in the United States are reporting prevalences of FQ‐resistant (FQR) and TMP/SMX‐resistant Enterobacterales of > 10%, with some areas with rates > 20%, exceeding threshold rates (> 10%) recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to change from one antibiotic class to another for empirical treatment. Additionally, the prevalence of extended spectrum β‐lactamase (ESBL)‐producing Enterobacterales continues to increase, now exceeding 20% in some US locations.

Given a shrinking armamentarium of effective antibiotic treatment for UTIs, the IDSA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified the need for continued surveillance of resistance patterns at the local and national health care system level as a top priority to best inform antibiotic treatment decisions. In 2019, the CDC classified ESBL‐producing Enterobacterales as a serious threat due to the increase in community infections.ESBL‐producing Enterobacterales are oftentimes also resistant to FQ as well as other agents commonly used to treat UTIs. As antimicrobial resistance can change rapidly, surveillance and reporting of the prevalence of E.coli resistant and ESBL‐producing uropathogens is necessary to guide empiric antimicrobial treatment. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of FQ resistance among patients presenting to the ED and diagnosed with a UTI among a geographically diverse group of US sites. Secondary objectives were to identify geographic variation in E. coli resistance and risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance.

Oral Step-Down Antibiotic Distribution, Dosing Regimens, and Outcomes

In the 30 days after starting oral step-down therapy, repeated hospitalization with UTI occurred for 14 patients (1.5%) in the oral β-lactam antibiotic group and 22 patients (0.7%) who received fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX (aRD, 0.81% [95% CI, −0.06% to 1.67%]; aRR, 2.08 [95% CI, 0.72–5.99]) (Table 2). During the initial antibiotic treatment course, 70 patients (7.3%) in the oral β-lactam antibiotic group and 228 patients (7.3%) who received fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX were switched back to a parenteral antibiotic, for any reason, after day 1 of oral step-down therapy. The median time to switch back to parenteral antibiotics after day 1 of oral step-down therapy was 3 days (interquartile range, 1–8 days) for patients in the β-lactam antibiotic group and 3 days (interquartile range, 1–7 days) for those who received fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f67f36fc]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are a common global health issue, particularly affecting women, with approximately 7 million women seeking outpatient care annually for uncomplicated UTIs. These infections, caused by bacterial invasion of the urinary tract, include conditions such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Due to anatomical factors, women are more susceptible to UTIs, and recurrence is a significant concern. with up to 27% of women experiencing a repeat infection within six months. This recurrence contributes to both clinical and economic burdens.

Antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin, are commonly prescribed for acute UTI treatment but come with side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. More critically, widespread antibiotic use is fueling the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which complicates treatment. Long-term antibiotic use in treating UTIs leads to high overall resistance to commonly used antibiotics, such as ampicillin (39.6%), trimethoprim (23.8%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (22.4%), Despite the current approach to managing UTIs predominantly involves antibiotics, there are ongoing concerns about overuse, antibiotic resistance, and potential aftereffects.

While current guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) focus on optimizing UTI management, challenges remain in antibiotic selection, treatment duration, and the management of recurrent infections. Recent studies, including a meta-analysis by Bakhit et al. (2021), suggest that methenamine hippurate may offer a promising alternative for preventing recurrent UTIs, though the results have been inconclusive, necessitating further investigation.

Given the concerns over antibiotic resistance and adverse effects, exploring non-antibiotic alternatives like methenamine hippurate is essential. This urinary antiseptic works by releasing formaldehyde in acidic urine, exerting bactericidal effects within the urinary tract. Its unique mechanism and favorable safety profile make it an attractive candidate for UTI prevention.

This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs through an updated analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). By incorporating trial sequential analysis, we aim to provide more reliable estimates of its efficacy compared to standard antibiotics and placebo. The findings of prior systematic reviews, such as those by Lee et al. and Bakhit et al. suggest some potential benefits of methenamine hippurate, but further robust data is needed to confirm its role in UTI prophylaxis.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^757d747a]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Randomization and interventions

The allocation of patients to either the PCT-pyuria group or the control group was based on a pre-specified computer generated randomization list and was concealed on the study website.

Clinical presentation without (control group) or with PCT and pyuria (PCT-pyuria group) was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy. The choice of antibiotics and the minimal duration of therapy were based on recent guidelines. The algorithm is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Algorithm for procalcitonin (PCT) and pyuria-guided therapy. TMP-SMX, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; NSAIDs, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; eGFR, Estimated glomerular filtration rate with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation.

For simple UTIs, we used fosfomycin (3 g single dose), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (800/160 mg twice daily) for estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m² or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In the PCT-pyuria group, patients with uncomplicated simple UTIs were planned to receive only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 3 days regardless of PCT-values.

For febrile UTIs/pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin was chosen as standard oral treatment for better comparability with recent studies (500 mg orally twice daily, respectively ciprofloxacin 250 mg orally twice daily for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), if intravenous therapy was necessary ceftriaxone (2 g once daily) was chosen. When known, antibiotic resistance profiles of prior or current pathogens were taken into account and antibiotic therapy was adjusted.

In inpatients in the PCT-pyuria group, antibiotic duration was based on absolute PCT-values and relative decreases of PCT-levels, as well as pyuria. PCT and pyuria were measured on admission in all patients; in hospitalized patients, the measurements were continued every other day till the end of antibiotic therapy. For outpatients in the PCT-pyuria group, antibiotic duration was calculated according to absolute values of PCT at baseline. In the control group, antibiotic therapy durations were recommended based on current guidelines (Figure 1).

### Treatment and prevention of urinary tract infection with orally active fimH inhibitors [^7e283597]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic and recurrent urinary tract infections pose a serious medical problem because there are few effective treatment options. Patients with chronic urinary tract infections are commonly treated with long-term prophylactic antibiotics that promote the development of antibiotic-resistant forms of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), further complicating treatment. We developed small-molecular weight compounds termed mannosides that specifically inhibit the FimH type 1 pilus lectin of UPEC, which mediates bacterial colonization, invasion, and formation of recalcitrant intracellular bacterial communities in the bladder epithelium. Here, we optimized these compounds for oral bioavailability and demonstrated their fast-acting efficacy in treating chronic urinary tract infections in a preclinical murine model. These compounds also prevented infection in vivo when given prophylactically and strongly potentiated the activity of the current standard of care therapy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, against clinically resistant PBC-1 UPEC bacteria. These compounds have therapeutic efficacy after oral administration for the treatment of established urinary tract infections in vivo. Their unique mechanism of action-targeting the pilus tip adhesin FimH-circumvents the conventional requirement for drug penetration of the outer membrane, minimizing the potential for the development of resistance. The small-molecular weight compounds described herein promise to provide substantial benefit to women suffering from chronic and recurrent urinary tract infections.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^569bf3a3]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

American Urological Association/Canadian Urological Association/SUFU UTI management recommendations — Clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B).

### Outpatient antibiogram and predictors of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant urinary tract infections [^cc079545]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context: Rising antibiotic resistance has transcended hospital boundaries and impacted individuals with community acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). Scant data on antibiotic resistance in outpatient settings exists and most studies in the United States (U.S.) have identified predictors of resistance in acute-care settings. Objective: Determine the antibiogram among Escherichia coli isolates and factors associated with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistant gram-negative urinary isolates. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Two primary care, safety-net clinics in Houston, TX between 11/2018 and 3/2020. Population studied: Patients aged 18 and older presenting with provider suspected uncomplicated or complicated UTI. Outcome measures: Resistance and predictors of resistance to UTI-relevant antibiotics. Results: Among 1265 cultures collected, 372 (28.4%) were positive. We detected E. coli (50.3%) and Group B Streptococcus (18.6%) most frequently. Our patient population consisted mostly of Hispanic (75.7%) females (92.5%) born outside the U.S. (67.3%) with a mean age of 47. Among patients with E. coli isolated (n = 189), antibiotic resistance was highest to ampicillin (63%), TMP-SMX (44%), ciprofloxacin (31%), and cefazolin (30%); no or low resistance against amikacin (0%), fosfomycin (0%), and nitrofurantoin (2.7%) was detected. Approximately 12% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive. Having a prior UTI caused by a TMP-SMX resistant gram-negative organism and being born outside the U.S increased the odds of TMP-SMX resistance by 3.71 (95% confidence interval: 1.6–9.2) and 3.08 (95% CI: 1.6–6.3), respectively. Having a complicated UTI (odds ratio (OR): 3.58; 95% CI: 1.1–12.1), prior fluoroquinolone use (OR: 6.81; 95% CI: 1.7–34.1) and a prior UTI with ciprofloxacin resistance (OR: 7.84; 95% CI: 3.2–20.7) increased the odds of having a ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusion: The Infectious Disease Society of America cautions against prescribing an antibiotic if regional resistance exceeds 20%. We constructed an antibiogram and found resistance surpassed this threshold for TMP-SMX and ciprofloxacin and identified factors associated with resistance to these agents. Assessing these characteristics during clinical decision making may improve antibiotic-organism susceptibility concordance in primary care.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^51bfa2bd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — intermittent self-administered TMP-SMX versus daily prophylactic TMP-SMX: In a medium risk of bias crossover trial (N = 38), intermittent self-administered TMP-SMX for acute symptoms was associated with increased risk of ≥ 1 UTI versus daily prophylactic TMP-SMX (68% versus 6.1%; RR: 11.16; 95% CI: 2.86 to 43.63) and was also associated with increased UTI frequency (2.2 versus 0.2 microbiologically confirmed episodes per patient-year; p < 0.001). Most UTI episodes in women on intermittent dosing resolved with single-dose TMP-SMX treatment, and the rest responded to 10- to 20-day courses of antibiotics, and there was no difference in risk of any adverse event (8.8% versus 15.2%; RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.15 to 2.24).

### Gepotidacin: a novel antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^c38c5f23]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of gepotidacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs).

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar (both January 2010 to March 2025) with the search terms gepotidacin and GSK2140944. Other resources included conference abstracts, the manufacturer's web site, and prescribing information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All relevant English-language studies assessing gepotidacin efficacy and safety for the treatment of uUTIs were included.

Data Synthesis

Gepotidacin is a first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic with a novel mechanism of action that is active against strains of Escherichia coli resistant to other classes of antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones. Gepotidacin was non-inferior to nitrofurantoin in the treatment of healthy, non-pregnant females aged 12 years and older with uUTIs. Gastrointestinal effects are the most common adverse effects, and it has several potential drug-drug interactions. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison to Existing Drugs Gepotidacin has been directly compared to nitrofurantoin for the treatment of uUTIs, but not to other commonly used drugs, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, beta-lactams, and fluoroquinolones. However, it may be active against organisms resistant to these traditionally used agents due to its novel mechanism of action, making it an attractive option for patients with UTIs due to multidrug-resistant organisms. It should be administered with food to help decrease gastrointestinal-related adverse effects.

Conclusions

Gepotidacin is an antibiotic with a novel mechanism of action that is efficacious in the treatment of women with uUTIs caused by common uropathogens, including resistant strains.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^eca74bdc]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — asymptomatic bacteriuria: clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with NLUTD. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) The guideline notes that antibiotic resistance is a significant problem in NLUTD and that unnecessary antibiotic use should be avoided; treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheter-free spinal cord injury (SCI) patients leads to early recurrence with more resistant strains and has no effect on subsequent asymptomatic bacteriuria or UTI in SCI patients performing intermittent catheterization. The exception is pregnancy and prior to urologic procedures in which urothelial disruption or upper tract manipulation is anticipated; for contaminated or clean-contaminated procedures, perioperative antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis is stated as best practice, with related guidance suggesting obtaining a urine culture and giving a targeted, short course regimen rather than empiric therapy before endoscopic urologic procedures, and recommending a single oral dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for patients with NLUTD.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections-United States, 2014 [^474a59de]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. † For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment of pregnant women are available, though the current estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported antibiotic treatment, similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

The current estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the 3 months before LMP are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study that examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999 found that the antibiotics most commonly dispensed within 3 days of a nonrecurrent episode of cystitis were fluoroquinolones (32%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (37%), and nitrofurantoin (16%). A recent study using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to examine > 7,000 outpatient visits for UTIs among women aged ≥ 18 years from 2002 to 2011 found that 80% were prescribed antibiotics within 7 days of diagnosis; the most commonly prescribed medications were fluoroquinolones (39%), sulfonamides (22%), and nitrofurantoin (15%). By comparison, in the current analysis, women with UTIs during the 3 months before LMP were most often dispensed ciprofloxacin (25.5%), nitrofurantoin (24.0%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (18.7%).
