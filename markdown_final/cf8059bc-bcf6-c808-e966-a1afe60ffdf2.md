## Question

What is a sitz bath

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a sitz bath is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal definition and mechanics of a sitz bath. Then, I should verify the clinical indications and how guidelines position sitz baths. Next, I will examine the evidence base for efficacy and safety, including any conflicting data. After that, I need to check practical implementation details like water temperature, duration, frequency, and additives. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a balanced, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition. A sitz bath is a warm-water bath in which the patient immerses the perineal and perianal region, typically using a basin or tub that allows the hips and buttocks to be submerged while keeping the rest of the body out of water; salt may be added, and the purpose is local cleansing and symptom relief rather than whole-body bathing [^2c84a5cf].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical indications before I overgeneralize. Sitz baths are commonly recommended for benign anorectal conditions such as anal fissures, hemorrhoids, and postoperative anorectal care, and they are included in first-line conservative management for acute anal fissure alongside fiber and fluids; they are also used after hemorrhoidectomy and fistula surgery, and occasionally for perineal trauma or obstetric healing, though the strength of evidence varies by condition [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d] [^72b6ccca] [^3b323dda] [^2c84a5cf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy. I need to check the quality of evidence. High-credibility guidelines endorse sitz baths for acute anal fissure as part of conservative therapy, citing good tolerability and meaningful symptom relief in many patients, with nearly half healing without further intervention in some series, which supports their routine use despite limited high-quality trials [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d]. But wait, what if the effect is modest or context-dependent? A randomized study after sphincterotomy found no pain advantage but did show significant reduction in anal burning with sitz baths, suggesting symptom-specific benefit rather than global pain control, which aligns with clinical experience that patients often report comfort and cleansing benefits even when pain scores are unchanged [^2365d38d]. I should also note that a systematic review of non-surgical therapies for anal fissure found sitz baths among many interventions with variable evidence, reinforcing that while they are safe and reasonable, head-to-head superiority data are limited [^df6a9b84].

> I will now examine post-hemorrhoidectomy data, because that's where conflicting results appear. Some contemporary randomized data suggest ice packing may outperform warm sitz baths for early pain, edema, and wound healing metrics, implying that warm sitz baths may be less effective than previously assumed in the immediate postoperative window; however, this does not negate the role of sitz baths for hygiene, comfort, and later-phase recovery, and guidelines still allow for sitz baths based on surgeon and patient preference, so I should be cautious not to overstate equivalence or superiority of either modality [^4e10f446] [^3b323dda]. Let me reconsider: this conflict likely reflects differences in timing, patient selection, and outcome measures, and it argues for individualized use rather than abandonment of sitz baths altogether [^4e10f446].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details. Typical instructions use warm water at roughly 40°C for about 10–20 minutes, once or twice daily, often after bowel movements; additives such as salt, potassium permanganate, or herbal decoctions are sometimes used, but evidence for specific additives is limited and should be guided by local practice and patient tolerance; cleanliness and gentle drying afterward are important to avoid maceration or irritation [^2c84a5cf] [^0b448e27] [^cd9498e7]. Hold on, I should verify safety: burns and infections are rare but reported, so patients should test water temperature and use clean equipment; in pregnancy and other special populations, the same general principles apply with attention to comfort and infection prevention [^d393f4e6].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, sitz baths are commonly used for hemorrhoidal symptoms and perineal care, and are generally considered safe when performed with warm, not hot, water and appropriate hygiene; maternal hyperthermia thresholds are well studied, and short immersions in warm water within physiologic ranges are not associated with teratogenic risk, which supports the safety of warm sitz baths when used sensibly [^d4c07429] [^7e845e6c]. For infants and children, sitz baths are sometimes used for anorectal conditions like fissures, but evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized; in older adults, attention to mobility and infection risk is prudent, and sitz baths remain a low-risk adjunct when supervised [^1d143bd1] [^d393f4e6].

> I should double-check the bottom line. A sitz bath is a localized, warm-water immersion of the perineal and perianal area used for cleansing and symptom relief in benign anorectal disease and postoperative care; it is endorsed by major guidelines for acute anal fissure and is commonly offered after anorectal procedures, with benefits that are likely modest, symptom-specific, and patient-dependent, and with a favorable safety profile when performed correctly; conflicting data in post-hemorrhoidectomy pain management suggest tailoring the modality and timing to patient preference and clinical context rather than rejecting sitz baths outright [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d] [^3b323dda] [^4e10f446].

---

A sitz bath is a **warm-water immersion** of the perineal and perineal area, typically used after childbirth, surgery, or for conditions such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or infections [^2c84a5cf]. It provides **symptom relief** by reducing pain, swelling, and irritation, and supports hygiene and wound healing [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d]. Sitz baths are generally safe, but patients should use clean water, avoid harsh additives, and consult a clinician if symptoms persist or worsen [^d393f4e6].

---

## Definition and purpose

A sitz bath is a **localized bath** that immerses the perineal and perineal regions in warm water, with the legs and upper body kept out of the water. The primary purposes include:

- **Pain relief**: Reduces discomfort from conditions such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and postpartum perineal trauma [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d].

- **Hygiene**: Cleanses the perineal area, particularly after childbirth or surgical procedures, reducing the risk of infection [^2c84a5cf].

- **Wound healing**: Promotes healing by increasing blood flow to the affected area and reducing inflammation [^cd6be12e].

---

## Indications

Sitz baths are commonly recommended for the following **medical conditions and situations**:

| **Condition/situation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Hemorrhoids | Reduces pain, swelling, and irritation [^b352c010] [^836b3c1b] |
| Anal fissures | Relieves pain and promotes healing [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d] |
| Postpartum perineal care | Cleanses and soothes the perineal area, reducing discomfort and promoting healing [^2c84a5cf] |
| Postoperative care after anorectal surgery | Reduces pain, swelling, and promotes wound healing [^3b323dda] [^2365d38d] |
| Infections (e.g. perianal abscess, cellulitis) | Provides local hygiene and symptom relief [^a4e73200] [^6fed47e2] |

---

## Technique and procedure

The **standard procedure** for a sitz bath includes the following steps:

- **Preparation**: Fill a sitz bath basin or bathtub with warm water (approximately 40°C or 104°F). Additives such as salt, baking soda, or medicated solutions may be included based on medical advice [^2c84a5cf] [^0b448e27].

- **Immersion**: The patient sits in the bath, immersing the perineal and perineal area for about 15–20 minutes.

- **Frequency**: Typically recommended 2–3 times daily, especially after bowel movements or as advised by a healthcare provider [^cd9498e7].

- **Post-bath care**: Gently pat the area dry with a clean towel. Avoid rubbing or using harsh soaps.

---

## Benefits

Sitz baths offer several **therapeutic benefits**, including:

- **Pain relief**: Significant reduction in pain and discomfort associated with various anorectal conditions [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d].

- **Reduced inflammation**: Decreases swelling and inflammation, promoting faster healing [^cd6be12e].

- **Improved hygiene**: Enhances cleanliness, particularly important postpartum or post-surgery [^2c84a5cf].

- **Psychological comfort**: Provides a soothing effect, improving patient comfort and well-being [^notfound].

---

## Risks and precautions

While sitz baths are generally safe, certain **precautions** should be observed:

- **Infection risk**: Ensure clean water and proper hygiene to prevent infections [^d393f4e6].

- **Burns**: Avoid excessively hot water to prevent burns or skin irritation.

- **Allergic reactions**: Be cautious with additives; discontinue use if allergic reactions occur.

- **Medical consultation**: Persistent symptoms or worsening conditions should prompt medical evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence

Several studies and clinical guidelines support the use of sitz baths for symptom relief and healing in various conditions:

- **Anal fissures**: Conservative management including sitz baths and fiber supplementation is effective in healing acute anal fissures [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d].

- **Post-hemorrhoidectomy pain**: Sitz baths provide symptomatic relief and improve patient comfort post-surgery [^notfound].

- **Postpartum care**: Sitz baths are recommended for perineal hygiene and comfort after childbirth [^2c84a5cf].

---

## Alternative therapies

Alternative therapies may be considered when sitz baths are not feasible or effective, including:

- **Topical medications**: Corticosteroids, local anesthetics, and calcium channel blockers for anal fissures and hemorrhoids [^b352c010] [^12b6a90d].

- **Ice packs**: Useful for acute pain and swelling, particularly post-hemorrhoidectomy [^4e10f446].

- **Pelvic floor physiotherapy**: For chronic pelvic pain syndromes and levator ani syndrome [^c7c74769].

---

A sitz bath is a simple, effective, and safe therapeutic intervention for perineal and perineal conditions, providing pain relief, promoting hygiene, and supporting wound healing. Proper technique and hygiene are essential to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

### Sitz bath: where is the evidence? Scientific basis of a common practice [^d393f4e6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to determine if evidence exists to justify and support the recommendation of sitz bath in the management of anorectal disorders.

Methods

A Medline search was conducted using the key words "sitz bath" and "hot bath".

Results

Thirty-six articles were found which highlighted the physiology, benefits, risks, complications, and techniques of sitz bath. Most of the studies were published in gynecologic or nursing journals. One randomized study comparing sitz bath to placebo was found. Two articles speculated that sitz bath induces relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle. Cold sitz bath was reported to decrease perineal edema more than warm sitz bath, although patients tended to prefer the latter. Five articles reported complications of sitz bath, including dissemination of herpes, maternal-neonatal Streptococcus outbreak, and skin burns.

Conclusion

A review of the literature demonstrated a lack of scientific data to support the use of sitz bath in the treatment of anorectal disorders. Additional randomized and controlled clinical studies are needed to investigate whether this time consuming recommendation is beneficial to patients.

### Effects of warm water sitz bath on symptoms in post-anal sphincterotomy in chronic anal fissure – a randomized and controlled study [^2365d38d]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Sitz bath is frequently recommended by physicians for a variety of anal disorders including anal fissure. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sitz bath does have any therapeutic properties improving upon a patient's postoperative symptoms after a closed lateral sphincterotomy.

Materials and Methods

Forty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive analgesics and fiber supplement alone (control patients) or a twice-daily sitz bath along with identical fiber and analgesics (sitz bath group). A 24-h pain score — post-defecation anal burning and symptom improvement — was evaluated on a visual analog scale (VAS).

Results

The groups were equally matched for age, gender distribution, and duration of disease. No significant difference in mean pain score between groups (p = 0.284) was noticed after one week. However, the patients from the control group experienced significant anal burning compared with patients from sitz bath group (p < 0.0001). The improvement score was higher in the sitz bath group when compared with the control group; however, it did not reached a statistically significant level.

Conclusions

Patients after sphincterotomy for anal fissure receiving sitz bath experienced similar levels of pain when compared with those not receiving sitz bath. However, they reported a significant relief in anal burning and a marginally better satisfaction score and no reported adverse side effects.

### Ice packing versus warm sitz baths for post-hemorrhoidectomy pain management: a randomized controlled trial [^4e10f446]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-hemorrhoidectomy pain management remains challenging, with warm sitz baths being a common yet debated intervention.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of ice packing versus warm sitz baths in managing post-hemorrhoidectomy pain and wound healing.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Settings

Single-center study at E-DA Hospital in Taiwan.

Patients

A total of 166 patients undergoing Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy were included.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ice packing (n = 82) or warm sitz bath (n = 84) for initial postoperative care.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were pain (visual analog scale) and swelling. Secondary outcomes included wound healing (Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge, Approximation scale), analgesic consumption, and adverse events.

Results

The ice packing group showed lower pain scores within 16 hours postsurgery (p < 0.01), reduced swelling at 24 hours (76.8% vs 56.0% with no or mild swelling, p = 0.03), superior wound healing at 7 days (Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge, Approximation score: 2.56 ± 1.89 vs 3.27 ± 2.12, p = 0.02), and lower 24-hour morphine consumption (4.58 ± 2.56 vs 6.39 ± 2.7mg, p < 0.01).

Limitations

Single-center design, short follow-up period, lack of validated hemorrhoid-specific wound assessment tools, and exclusion of ASA III patients limit the present study's generalizability.

Conclusions

Ice packing demonstrated superior efficacy in managing post-hemorrhoidectomy pain, reducing edema, and promoting wound healing, with a comparable safety profile and lower opioid requirements. See Video Abstract.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^72b6ccca]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

7.C - in patients with an acute anal fissure, what is the role of non-operative management?

In patients with acute anal fissure, we recommend non-operative management as the first-line treatment (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

In patients with acute anal fissure, we recommend dietary and lifestyle changes, with increased fiber and water intake (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidences, 1B).

In patients with acute anal fissure, we recommend against the use of manual dilatation (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidences, 1B).

No recommendation can be made regarding the use of controlled anal dilatation in patients with acute anal fissure, based on the available literature.

Initial treatment of anal fissures is medical or non-operative. There are only few studies concerning non-operative management in the treatment of acute AF: 50% of patients will not require further therapy solving the problem, in 10–14 days, with non-operative measures such as sitz baths, fiber, and topical agents. However, to prevent a recurrence of AF, the combined use of dietary and lifestyle changes and medical therapy are recommended.

### Guidance for the prevention and treatment of monkeypox (mpox) [^699026a3]. ACOEM (2022). High credibility.

Monkeypox (mpox) symptom management — pain and rash care includes using Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen for pain, rinsing oral rash with salt water at least 4 times a day, and considering prescription mouthwashes or viscous lidocaine; chlorhexidine mouthwash can help keep the mouth clean. Patients are advised to avoid touching or scratching the rash to prevent spread and secondary infection; topical benzocaine/lidocaine gels can provide temporary relief, oral antihistamines and topical calamine or petroleum jelly may help itching, and warm baths may offer relief. For rash involving the anus, genitals, or perineum, sitz baths may help and clinicians may prescribe additives like povidone-iodine for the water.

### Constipation, haemorrhoids, and heartburn in pregnancy [^9c4ebc1e]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation, heartburn, and haemorrhoids are common gastrointestinal complaints during pregnancy. Constipation occurs in 11% to 38% of pregnant women. Although the exact prevalence of haemorrhoids during pregnancy is unknown, the condition is common, and the prevalence of symptomatic haemorrhoids in pregnant women is higher than in non-pregnant women. The incidence of heartburn in pregnancy is reported to be 17% to 45%.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent or treat constipation in pregnancy? What are the effects of interventions to prevent or treat haemorrhoids in pregnancy? What are the effects of interventions to prevent or treat heartburn in pregnancy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found seven systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acid-suppressing drugs; anaesthetic agents (topical); antacids with or without alginates; bulk-forming laxatives; compound corticosteroid and anaesthetic agents (topical); corticosteroid agents (topical); increased fibre intake; increased fluid intake; osmotic laxatives; raising the head of the bed; reducing caffeine intake, intake of fatty foods, and the size and frequency of meals; rutosides; sitz baths; and stimulant laxatives.

### Chronic prostatitis [^dc96a053]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic prostatitis can cause pain and urinary symptoms, and usually occurs without positive bacterial cultures from prostatic secretions (known as chronic abacterial prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome, CP/CPPS). Bacterial infection can result from urinary tract instrumentation, but the cause and natural history of CP/CPPS are unknown.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic bacterial prostatitis? What are the effects of treatments for chronic abacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, allopurinol, alpha-blockers, biofeedback, local injections of antimicrobial drugs, mepartricin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral antimicrobial drugs, pentosan polysulfate, prostatic massage, quercetin, radical prostatectomy, sitz baths, transurethral microwave thermotherapy, and transurethral resection.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of anal fissures [^12b6a90d]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Acute anal fissure — conservative therapy outcomes and tolerability: Nearly half of all patients who have an acute anal fissure will resolve their symptoms with nonoperative measures such as sitz baths and fiber or other bulking agents, with or without topical anesthetics or topical steroids, and these interventions are well tolerated with minimal to no side effects. In a prospective randomized trial of 103 patients, sitz baths plus fiber yielded greater pain relief than topical anesthetics or topical hydrocortisone (91% vs 60% vs 68%, respectively; p < 0.05). In a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 75 patients with healed acute fissures, maintenance fiber reduced fissure recurrence versus placebo (16% vs 60%; p < 0.01), and there are no data supporting one type of fiber over another. Healing rates with conservative treatment decline as symptom duration increases, with a prospective study of 60 patients observing a 100% healing rate for symptoms of < 1-month duration compared with only a 33.3% healing rate for > 6-month duration.

### Xiaozhi decoction reduced posthemorrhoidectomy pain and analgesic medication consumption: a prospective study [^10bfb012]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhoids as one of the most common chronic anorectal diseases severely affect patients' quality of life.–Hemorrhoidectomy is utilized to treat severe hemorrhoids (especially for III or IV degree hemorrhoids) or hemorrhoids failing to respond to conservative therapies. However, hemorrhoidectomy is always associated with significant postoperative pain, which may make the patient and the surgeon anxious. Moreover, poor wound healing may retard return to work or daily activities. During the early period after hemorrhoidectomy, patients usually need analgesics medication to relieve postoperative pain and discomfort.

Sitz bath with warm water was well accepted as a safe postoperative care after anal surgery and routinely utilized to relieve postoperative pain and promote wound healing during the posthemorrhoidectomy period. However, recent studies have revealed that warm sitz bath did not relieve pain, promote wound healing or reduce consumption of analgesics after anal surgery but offered only a significant relief in anal burning and a marginally higher satisfaction score. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat hemorrhoids for centuries in our country. Therefore, Chinese herbal decoction, Xiaozhi decoction (XZD), was added into sitz bath as posthemorrhoidectomy care in our clinical practice due to its positive effect on pain relief. The aim of the current prospective study was to clarify the efficacy of sitz bath with XZD as postoperative care for patients who underwent hemorrhoidectomy.

### Chronic prostatitis [^411aba1d]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic prostatitis can cause pain and urinary symptoms, and usually occurs without positive bacterial cultures from prostatic secretions (known as chronic abacterial prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome [CP/CPPS]). Bacterial infection can result from urinary tract instrumentation, but the cause and natural history of CP/CPPS are unknown.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic bacterial prostatitis? What are the effects of treatments for chronic abacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 33 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, allopurinol, alpha-blockers, biofeedback, local injections of antimicrobial drugs, mepartricin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral antimicrobial drugs, pentosan polysulfate, prostatic massage, quercetin, radical prostatectomy, sitz baths, transurethral microwave thermotherapy, and transurethral resection.

### Nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment vs placebo in the treatment of pain resulting from chronic anal fissure: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^ad39fa78]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary end point was absolute change from baseline in patient-reported 24-hour average CAF pain intensity as measured using the 100-mm VAS over days 14 to 18 of treatment. The VAS has been shown to be a reliable measurement of acute pain and is a validated tool to measure clinically important changes in pain severity. The pain score was averaged over days 14 to 18 to minimize the effect of a bowel movement on pain scores on an individual day.

Secondary end points were as follows: time to improvement in 24-hour average VAS (defined as a decrease of 10 mm and 50% from baseline); patients' global assessment of treatment at day 21 (last assessed visit day); percentage of responders, defined as patients with a decrease in 24-hour average pain intensity VAS score of ≥ 10 mm and ≥ 50% from baseline for treatment days 14 to 18; and absolute change in 24-hour average VAS score at days 7, 14, and 21 (not reported).

Five clinic visits were scheduled (screening and days 0 [randomization], 7, 14, and 21). Patient global assessment of 24-hour average pain intensity (VAS score) was obtained on day 0 and daily thereafter at bedtime until the evening before the day 21 assessment. Patients completed their final VAS and assessment of therapy on day 21 at the clinic. Patients who withdrew early from the study were asked to continue to record VAS scores until day 21.

Safety assessments included physical examination findings, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), orthostatic hypotension assessment, laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and AEs and serious AEs.

Patients were instructed to complete daily diary cards to record time of administration of study medication (NTG ointment and acetaminophen), VAS assessments, number of sitz baths, and incidence and severity of headaches. For pain, patients were asked to record their response to the question "What has been your average pain today?"on a VAS at the end of each day.

### Hemorrhoids: diagnosis and treatment options [^836b3c1b]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Many Americans between 45 and 65 years of age experience hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal size, thrombosis, and location (i.e., proximal or distal to the dentate line) determine the extent of pain or discomfort. The history and physical examination must assess for risk factors and clinical signs indicating more concerning disease processes. Internal hemorrhoids are traditionally graded from I to IV based on the extent of prolapse. Other factors such as degree of discomfort, bleeding, comorbidities, and patient preference should help determine the order in which treatments are pursued. Medical management (e.g., stool softeners, topical over-the-counter preparations, topical nitroglycerine), dietary modifications (e.g., increased fiber and water intake), and behavioral therapies (sitz baths) are the mainstays of initial therapy. If these are unsuccessful, office-based treatment of grades I to III internal hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation is the preferred next step because it has a lower failure rate than infrared photocoagulation. Open or closed (conventional) excisional hemorrhoidectomy leads to greater surgical success rates but also incurs more pain and a prolonged recovery than office-based procedures; therefore, hemorrhoidectomy should be reserved for recurrent or higher-grade disease. Closed hemorrhoidectomy with diathermic or ultrasonic cutting devices may decrease bleeding and pain. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy elevates grade III or IV hemorrhoids to their normal anatomic position by removing a band of proximal mucosal tissue; however, this procedure has several potential postoperative complications. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation may be useful in grade II or III hemorrhoids because patients may experience less pain and recover more quickly. Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids can greatly reduce pain if performed within the first two to three days of symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perianal Crohn disease: NASPGHAN clinical report and consensus statement [^f1905e81]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Anal fissures in perianal Crohn disease (PCD) — prevalence and treatment approach: Fissures make up approximately 20% to 30% of anal lesions in PCD. Fissures suggest active CD and are therefore treated medically, and in the presence of acute inflammation it is futile and potentially dangerous to attempt to excise a fissure or close it with suture. Symptoms typically respond to effective medical therapy using nitrate-based ointments and sitz baths, and no controlled trials show any efficacy of oral antibiotics in the treatment of perianal fissures.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^5ed06463]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Eligibility criteria

Articles were eligible if they were guidelines following the Institute of Medicine definition.

We focused on guidelines published from January 2011 to the date of the last search of 1 October 2021, with the most up to date guideline version being selected if there was more than one. We excluded guidelines not focused solely on haemorrhoids, expert reviews, other forms of recommendations (e.g. quality indicators) and guidelines published in a language other than English.

Search

The electronic databases used for the search included Embase, MEDLINE and CINAHL. The search strategy included words relating to haemorrhoids, guidelines, clinical standards and quality standards (combination of keywords tailored to each database). See Data S1 for the exact syntax searches. An additional search of the grey literature was carried out on Guidelines International Network, CPG InfoBase, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network and Google Scholar (first 80 pages).

Study selection process

Four reviewers (HTM, AC, BB, CG) independently screened the title and abstracts of the papers for eligibility, with questions and disagreements referred to a clinical specialist (SRB). Full texts of potentially eligible papers were retrieved and screened against the eligibility criteria.

Data extraction

Four reviewers (HTM, AC, BB, AES) independently reviewed and extracted descriptive data from the guidelines. Data were extracted on organization and country. Recommendations were classified under medical therapy (lifestyle, laxatives, phlebotonics, sitz baths and topical), office therapy (banding, sclerotherapy, others), surgery (excisional haemorrhoidectomy, haemorrhoidopexy, haemorrhoidal artery ligation, others) and special situations (pregnancy, thrombosed haemorrhoids, anticoagulants, impaired immunity, Crohn's, radiation proctitis, portal hypertension).

### Non surgical therapy for anal fissure [^df6a9b84]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the disability associated with surgery for anal fissure and the risk of incontinence, medical alternatives for surgery have been sought. Most recently, pharmacologic methods that relax the anal smooth muscle, to accomplish reversibly what occurs in surgery, have been used to obtain fissure healing.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and morbidity of various medical therapies for anal fissure.

Search Methods

Search terms include "anal fissure randomized". Timing from 1966 to August 2010. Further details of the search below.

Selection Criteria

Studies in which participants were randomized to a non-surgical therapy for anal fissure. Comparison groups may include an operative procedure, an alternate medical therapy or placebo. Chronic fissure, acute fissure and fissure in children are included in the review. Atypical fissures associated with inflammatory bowel disease or cancer or anal infection are excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted from published reports and meeting abstracts, assessing method of randomization, blinding, "intention to treat" and drop-outs, therapies, supportive measures (applied to both groups), dosing and frequency and cross-overs. Dichotomous outcome measures included Non-healing of the fissure (a combination of persistence and recurrence), and Adverse events (including incontinence, headache, infection, anaphylaxis). Continuous outcome measures included measures of pain relief and anorectal manometry.

Main Results

In this update 23 studies including 1236 participants is added to the 54 studies and 3904 participants in the 2008 publication, however 2 studies were from the last version reclassified as un included, so the final number of participants is 5031.49 different comparisons of the ability of medical therapies to heal anal fissure have been reported in 75 RCTs. Seventeen agents were used (nitroglycerin ointment (GTN), isosorbide mono & dinitrate, Botulinum toxin (Botox), diltiazem, nifedipine (Calcium channel blockers or CCBs), hydrocortisone, lignocaine, bran, minoxidil, indoramin, clove oil, L-arginine, sitz baths, sildenafil, "healer cream" and placebo) as well as Sitz baths, anal dilators and surgical sphincterotomy. GTN was found to be marginally but significantly better than placebo in healing anal fissure (48.9% vs. 35.5%, p < 0.0009), but late recurrence of fissure was common, in the range of 50% of those initially cured. Botox and CCBs were equivalent to GTN in efficacy with fewer adverse events. No medical therapy came close to the efficacy of surgical sphincterotomy, though none of the medical therapies in these RCTs were associated with the risk of incontinence.

Authors' Conclusions

Medical therapy for chronic anal fissure, currently consisting of topical glyceryl trinitrate, botulinum toxin injection or the topical calcium channel blockers nifedipine or diltiazem in acute and chronic fissure and fissure in children may be applied with a chance of cure that is marginally better than placebo. For chronic fissure in adults all medical therapies are far less effective than surgery. A few of the newer agents investigated show promise based only upon single studies (clove oil, sildenifil and a "healer cream") but lack comparison to more established medications.

### Analysis of the distribution characteristics of infecting microorganisms in the wound tissue of patients with perianal abscess combined with infection and the influencing factors of wound healing [^a4e73200]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative treatment

Wound cleansing and dressing change: Wound cleansing and gauze drainage are performed every day after surgery until the skin is closed. At the same time, regular dressing changes are needed to prevent pseudo-healing.

Sitz bath and medication: Use potassium permanganate solution for a sitz bath after bowel movements to keep the perianal area clean and hygienic. Follow the doctor's instructions for antimicrobial treatment to control the infection and promote healing.

Diet and life adjustment: keep a light diet, avoid spicy, greasy, cold and other stimulating food. Eat more foods rich in vitamins and dietary fiber, such as apples, bananas, carrots, etc. as well as foods rich in protein, such as eggs and beef. At the same time, maintain good bowel habits and avoid prolonged bowel movements and excessive straining.

Review and Follow-up: Regularly visit the General Surgery Department of the hospital for review and tightening of hanging wires to understand the wound healing. If there are any uncomfortable symptoms, you should seek medical treatment in time.

Pollution prevention measures: Ensure that all sampling tools (such as disposable sterile syringes, scrapers, etc.) are sterile packaged and not contaminated before use. During the sampling process, the operator should wear sterile gloves to avoid direct contact with the patient's skin or surgical area. When using a syringe to extract pus, ensure that the needle is fully inserted into the abscess cavity to avoid pus overflow or contamination of the surrounding skin. The collected specimenss should be immediately sent to the laboratory for bacterial culture, avoiding prolonged storage at room temperature to reduce the risk of bacterial proliferation and contamination. During transportation, sterile containers should be used to store specimenss and ensure the sealing of the containers. After arriving at the laboratory, the specimenss should be processed immediately to avoid prolonged exposure to the laboratory environment. When handling specimenss, the laboratory's sterile operating procedures should be strictly followed.

All patients' surgeries are performed by the same surgeon.

### Management of perianal abscesses in infants: a systematic review from the APSA outcomes and evidence-based practice committee [^6fed47e2]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of infant perianal disease, including perianal abscess and fistula-in- ano (FIA), remains controversial. There is lack of consensus regarding the risks and benefits of operative and non-operative approaches.

Methods

The American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence Based Practice Committee created a priori consensus-based questions regarding the various approaches to management of perianal abscess and FIA in infants. A comprehensive search strategy was created, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to identify and review relevant articles and answer the established questions.

Results

Over 2,460 titles and abstracts were screened to identify 31 manuscripts describing the expected course of perianal disease when managed with nonoperative management (NOM) strategies (such as hygiene, sitz baths, and systemic antibiotics), operative intervention for abscess only (incision and drainage (I&D)) or direct surgical management of the FIA (e.g. upfront fistulotomy). Initial failure of NOM is approximately 37.5%. Recurrence rate after initial success with NOM or I&D is approximately 21% and 24%, respectively. The rate of FIA development is approximately 21% after NOM and 20% after I&D. Recurrence after operative management of FIA, regardless of approach, is 7%. Time to complete resolution varies widely and does not appear to differ based on treatment strategy.

Conclusions

Both operative and non-operative approaches can be safely used in the management of perianal abscess and FIA but recurrence is common regardless of approach. Risks and benefits of each approach should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Level Of Evidence

Level 4.

### Xiaozhi decoction reduced posthemorrhoidectomy pain and analgesic medication consumption: a prospective study [^90dde7e6]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Xiaozhi decoction (XZD) on posthemorrhoidectomy pain and analgesic medication consumption.

Methods

From May 2013 to March 2015, 315 patients who underwent open hemorrhoidectomy in our hospital were enrolled in this study, of whom, 160 patients were randomly assigned to accept sitz bath with warm water after hemorrhoidectomy (control group) and 155 patients were randomly assigned to accept sitz bath with XZD (XZD group) after hemorrhoidectomy. Postoperative pain at 12 hours after surgery and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 was evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Pain on defecation on PODs 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 was also recorded using the VAS. The consumption of analgesics was also analyzed.

Results

No significant difference was found in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Postoperative pain score of the XZD group was significantly lower on POD 2 (6.04 ± 1.11 vs 6.33 ± 1.14, P = 0.0229), POD 7 (3.35 ± 0.75 vs 4.22 ± 0.87, P = 0.0000) and POD 14 (2.87 ± 0.64 vs 3.64 ± 0.77, P = 0.0000) than that of the control group. Similarly, patients in the XZD group experienced significantly less pain on defecation on POD 2 (5.02 ± 1.34 vs 5.43 ± 1.56, P = 0.0130), POD 7 (3.08 ± 1.17 vs 3.52 ± 1.29, P = 0.0017) and POD 14 (2.31 ± 0.85 vs 2.68 ± 0.99, P = 0.0004). Patients in the XZD group consumed significantly less analgesic medication on POD 2 (P = 0.0136), POD 7 (P = 0.0074) and POD 14 (P = 0.0046) than the control group.

Conclusion

XZD could effectively relieve postoperative pain and reduce analgesic medication consumption after hemorrhoidectomy.

### Benign anorectal disease: hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^b039c83a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Medical treatment

Treatment of anal fissures starts with conservative treatment including stool softeners, fiber supplementation, sitz baths, and topical lidocaine gel for pain control. Stool softeners and lidocaine gel together will heal 8–51% of fissures, with most studies showing healing rates of 16–31% in acute and chronic fissures. Almost half of acute fissures will heal with sitz baths and fiber, with or without lidocaine gel. The effect of topical steroids or lidocaine gel in healing fissures is equal to or worse than sitz baths and fiber. Lidocaine by itself does not appear to contribute to healing of fissures, but provides symptom relief.

The goal of medical treatment of anal fissures is to decrease the internal sphincter tone and allow healing. Topical nitrate use leads to healing of chronic anal fissures in about 50% of patients, and demonstrates a 13.5% improvement in healing over placebo. Up to 50% of fissures healed with nitrates have recurrences. The topical nitrates commonly used are isosorbide dinitrate and glyceryl trinitrate. Since the advent of topical calcium channel blockers, nitrates are not usually used in the treatment of anal fissures, because of the common side-effect of headaches that occur in a dose-related manner. A double-blind multicenter randomized trial comparing nifedipine gel to topical hydrocortisone and lidocaine found that the nifedipine treatment healed fissures within 21 days in 95% of patients, compared to 50% in the control treatment group. Additionally, anal manometry confirmed that nifedipine decreased the resting anal pressure by 30%, whereas there was no change in the control group.

### Xiaozhi decoction reduced posthemorrhoidectomy pain and analgesic medication consumption: a prospective study [^7f136f7b]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hemorrhoidectomy is a standard treatment for extensive hemorrhoids and usually causes significant postoperative pain which would harm postoperative quality of life. Posthemorrhoidectomy pain is mainly caused by surgical incision per se and tissue inflammation related to bacterial infiltration of the wound. In the first few hours after hemorrhoidectomy, wound inflammation is the primary cause of pain, while during the days after hemorrhoidectomy bacterial infiltration mainly causes the posthemorrhoidectomy pain. Another factor of posthemorrhoidectomy pain could be spasm of the internal sphincter which is always aggravated by wound inflammation, swelling and infection during the PODs.

In our clinical practice, sitz bath with XZD was routinely performed after hemorrhoidectomy and was found effective for pain relief and wound healing. In its composition, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici primarily diminishes tissue swelling, complemented by Mirabilitum. Rhizoma Corydalis and Flos Carthami remove blood stasis and relief pain. Galla Chinensis and Herba Taraxaci help to clear wound infection. Olibanum and Myrrha promote wound healing. Radix Sophorae Flavescentis and Radix Glycyrrhizae have antiphlogistic effect. Radix et Rhizoma Rhei promotes defecation. Theoretically, the XZD could not only directly relieve postoperative pain but also diminish the major adverse factors such as wound inflammation, swelling and infection which cause postoperative pain after hemorrhoidectomy.

In the current study, we found that patients in the XZD group experienced significantly less postoperative pain and pain on defecation and consumed less analgesic medication than those in the control group on PODs 2, 7 and 14.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^80856035]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Synthesis of results

There was significant variation in all aspects of key recommendations for each of the nine guidelines and these are summarized in Table 2. Particular areas are commented on below.

TABLE 2
Summary of guideline variation for individual recommendations

Note

Non‐operative management

Topical agents are recommended for symptom relief by all guidelines except the Belgian guidelines. Only the Portuguese and Indian guidelines emphasize avoiding long‐term topical agents. A sitz bath is only recommended by four guidelines.

Whilst the use of phlebotonics is recommended by most guidelines the European and Belgian guidelines comment on the weakness of the evidence and phlebotonics are not mentioned in the Japanese or Danish guidelines.

Office procedures

Rubber band ligation is mentioned by all. However, there is some variation in recommendation based on individual grade of haemorrhoids. All appear to agree that grade II haemorrhoids are an indication. The treatment is recommended for grade I haemorrhoids by some but not by others. Whilst some guidelines recommend rubber band ligation for all grade III haemorrhoids, others recommend selective treatment or treatment is not recommended.

There is variation in the recommendation of injection sclerotherapy, with one guideline not recommending use at all. There was no consensus amongst the other guidelines as to which grade of haemorrhoid that injection sclerotherapy should be used.

Surgical management

Surgical management was mentioned in all but one guideline. However, there was significant variation in the grade of haemorrhoid recommended for surgical interventions. This included haemorrhoidopexy being recommended for only grade III haemorrhoids, only grades II–III haemorrhoids or all grades Similarly, haemorrhoidectomy was recommended for grades III–IV haemorrhoids in some guidelines, yet recommended for all grades in another. For Doppler‐guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation, half the guidelines recommended this procedure for grades III–IV haemorrhoids, one suggested the procedure was not appropriate for grade IV two guidelines recommended the procedure for grades II and III haemorrhoids and one made no recommendation.

Special situations

In general, there was consensus that conservative management was recommended for special situations, such as haemorrhoids in pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, portal hypertension, immunocompromised, post irradiation therapy and thrombosed external haemorrhoids. Nevertheless, mention of these situations was completely absent in one guideline. The detail within recommendations varied. For example, recommendations for the treatment for patients on anticoagulants ranged from extensive to brief to absent.

### Is chemodenervation with incobotulinumtoxinA an alternative to invasive chronic anal fissure treatments? [^16c9db89]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anal fissure (AF) is a tear in the skin of the anal canal that extends from the dentate line to the anal verge. It is the most common cause of anorectal pain on defecation. AFs are most commonly located in the posterior midline (73%) but can be found in the anterior midline in 13% of women and 8% of men, with 2.6% occurring both anteriorly and posteriorly simultaneously. The overall annual incidence of AF is 0.11% without sex differences, and it affects mainly young and middle-aged patients. The main symptom associated with AF is anal pain (present in 90,8% of patients) occurring during defecation and for several hours afterwards, that sometimes radiates to the buttocks, lower back, or upper posterior tights. Moreover, bleeding appears in 71.4% of patients, and anal pruritus can also emerge. The AF pathophysiology is not entirely clear, but trauma to the anal canal seems to be an important factor: constipation, diarrhea, vaginal delivery trauma, history of anal trauma or IAS hypertonia. Patients with chronic AF exhibit higher resting pressures of the IAS than normal controls. Relative ischemia of the posterior commissure of the anal canal is another possible explanation for AF. Lower blood flow was found in the posterior midline than in the rest of the anal canal, which may also account for the predominance of fissures in the posterior midline. There are also secondary AFs, caused by surgical anal procedures, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases (Crohn's disease), cancer, or sexually transmitted diseases. These secondary AFs are considered atypical due to their location usually off the midline position. Several therapeutic options are available for AFs. The conservative option is considered as the initial approach and it is based on the hypothesis of constipation as the one of the causes of AF. Sitz baths and fiber supplementation are the core of this treatment, and topical steroids or anesthetics can be added. These dietary and behavioral modifications are considered safe since they entail few adverse effects, and they might heal the AF and even prevent recurrence if maintained. When AFs persist, there are surgical (i.e. open and closed lateral internal sphincterotomy conventional or tailored, and anocutaneous advancement flap) and nonsurgical (pharmacological) options. The latter is based on achieving IAS transitional relaxation. It helps overcome hypertonia and favors vascularization of anal mucosa, allowing normal tone to be reached subsequently, and therefore avoiding incontinence. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) strongly recommends topical nitrates (ASCRS grade 1B: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), associated with healing of approximately 50% of chronic AFs. With a superior side effect profile than nitrates, calcium channel blockers (CCB) have a similar efficacy and are also recommended as first-line treatment (ASCRS grade 1B), with healing rates ranging 65–95%. Botulinum toxin type A (BT) local injection is considered when topical therapy fails (ASCRS grade 1B: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). BT inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, preventing neural transmission, and reducing anal sphincter tone at rest. Moreover, BT reduces pain by inhibiting the release of other non-cholinergic neurotransmitters. Local chemical denervation produced by BT begins 3 to 4 days after injection and fades gradually during the third or fourth month. The maximal benefit is detected 4–6 weeks post-injection. BT is comparable to topical treatments as a first-line therapy for chronic anal fissures and shows modest improvement in healing rates when used as a second-line therapy after unsuccessful topical treatments. BT showed similar healing rates at 8 weeks when compared to nitrates but presented the highest recurrence rate of all treatments. The main adverse effect of BT was temporary incontinence, while patients treated with both nitrates and CCB presented headaches that caused treatment cessation in some cases. However, the ideal site, number of injections and dosage of BT have not been established yet and most studies follow-up duration is short.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^811909ee]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal itching is a common yet often under-recognized condition affecting women across all age groups. Despite its prevalence, many dermatologists receive minimal training in vulvar diseases, leading to delayed diagnoses and prolonged discomfort for patients. This review explores the broad spectrum of causes, including infections, inflammatory conditions, neuropathic disorders, and systemic illnesses. The complexity of vulvovaginal pruritus often requires a multidisciplinary approach to accurately diagnose and treat. Contributing factors such as hormonal changes, personal hygiene practices, and environmental exposures must also be considered. Treatment strategies typically begin with lifestyle modifications and topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and antifungals, but can extend to systemic medications and biologics for resistant cases. Additionally, nonpharmaceutical options such as sitz baths and psychological interventions can be crucial for managing chronic symptoms. However, there remains a significant gap in research, particularly regarding the characterization of female-specific pruritus and its long-term impact on quality of life. Despite some advances, the available studies largely focus on isolated causes rather than the holistic nature of the condition. Further research is urgently needed to develop comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating vulvovaginal itching, a condition that has a profound effect on both physical and emotional well-being.

### Trajectory of self-reported pain and association with quality of life in patients with perianal abscesses after surgery [^dd56e615]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain Assessment

Self-reported pain was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale, a widely used and validated tool for measuring pain intensity. Participants were asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable) at regular intervals post-surgery (eg, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks). The Visual Analog Scale scores were used to construct pain trajectories over the 4-week follow-up period. All patients received a multimodal analgesia management, involving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids as required, typically for less than 5 days. Antibiotics were routinely prescribed for 5–7 days to prevent secondary infections, consistent with surgical guidelines for perianal abscess management. Patients were also instructed to use adjunctive strategies, such as warm sitz baths, for additional symptom relief during recovery. In the follow-up period, pain management focused on a multimodal approach. Patients were regularly re-evaluated during outpatient visits to adjust the treatment plan based on their reported pain levels. NSAIDs remained the primary therapy, supplemented by opioids. Adjunctive therapies, such as warm sitz baths, were emphasized to promote local healing and alleviate discomfort. Education on medication adherence and lifestyle adjustments was also provided to optimize recovery outcomes.

Quality of Life Assessment

QoL was assessed using the Short Form-36 health Survey (SF-36), a validated instrument that measures eight domains of health-related quality of life: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The SF-36 was administered for 4 weeks post-surgery.

### A randomized controlled trial on the effect of topical phenytoin 2% on wound healing after anal fistulotomy [^11658117]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

Laying open fistulotomy is the standard treatment for simple anal fistula. However, healing of the resultant anal wound may be prolonged and may adversely affect a patient's lifestyle and work. This randomized trial aimed to assess the effect of topical phenytoin 2% powder spray on healing of the anal wound following fistulotomy.

Method

Adult patients with simple anal fistula who underwent anal fistulotomy were divided into two equal groups: group I applied topical phenytoin 2% powder spray on the anal wound regularly with sitz baths until complete healing was confirmed clinically and group II had regular sitz baths only. The primary outcome of the study was time to complete wound healing. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, complications, time to return to work and impact on lifestyle.

Results

Sixty patients (50 of whom were men) with a mean age of 41.4 ± 12.5 years were included. Both groups had comparable pain scores at 1 week after surgery (1 ± 0.83 vs 0.86 ± 0.81; P = 0.51). The duration to complete wound healing was 41.2 ± 2.4 days in group I and 42 ± 2.5 days in group II (mean ± SD, P = 0.21). The time to return to work was 13.5 ± 2.8 days in group I and 14.1 ± 2.6 days in group II (mean ± SD, P = 0.39). No significant differences were noted between the two groups with regard to postoperative complications or impact on lifestyle.

Conclusion

The use of topical phenytoin 2% powder spray did not promote wound healing, relieve postoperative pain or accelerate patient recovery after anal fistulotomy for simple anal fistula.

### Factors influencing health promotion behavior on puerperal sepsis among postpartum mothers [^8cd79cd8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Health promotion model and puerperal sepsis preventive behavior

In perceived benefit, the majority of the participants (55.4%) perceived that using hygienic and comfortable sanitary napkins will help to prevent puerperal sepsis, more than half (53.6%) of the participants perceived washing hands before and after perineal care can prevent puerperal sepsis, almost two-thirds (61.6%) stated identification and avoidance of source of infection is essential to prevent puerperal sepsis. Near about two-third (73.2%) of participants strongly believed that postnatal exercise is important to get back pre-pregnant condition. Whereas less than one-third (12.5%) of participants mentioned checking the colour and odour of lochia for any change is required to identify puerperal infection, and nearly one-third (27.7%) strongly agreed that practising perineal sitz bath helps prevent puerperal sepsis. The mean score of perceived benefit was 3.91. This is supported by a study conducted in Thailand, which found that high perceived benefits are strongly associated with health-promoting behaviour. It illustrates pregnant women who believed that adopting healthier habits would help their pregnancy spent additional resources and time on better pregnancy outcomes.

In perceived barrier, the majority of the participants (65.2%) agreed and strongly agreed that healthcare personnel did not suggest carrying perineal care during the postnatal period, more than half (64.3%) agreed and strongly agreed that healthcare facilities did not share standard guideline for perineal care. However, less than one-tenth (5.4%) of participants strongly stated their family culture inhibits them from going for postnatal check-ups. On the other hand, less than one-tenth (5.4%) of participants strongly agreed that they have a busy schedule with household work, which inhibits them from performing effective perineal care. The mean score of perceived barriers was 1.92. This finding reveals that perceived barriers influence postnatal mothers to engage in puerperal sepsis preventive behaviour. It goes with the line of a study conducted in Thailand on factors and health-promoting behaviours that influence maternal and infant outcomes in older pregnant Thai women, which found that perceived barriers are also associated with health-promotion behaviour.

### Transanal suture mucopexy for hemorrhoids [^13e824aa]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Hemorrhoids are a common clinical entity; minor improvement in their treatment will benefit many people. Transanal suture mucopexy has addressed the core factors in the treatment of hemorrhoids by simple, repeatable suturing, and it avoids excision of engorged hemorrhoids, rectal mucosa‚ or anoderm. Pain is the major changing factor in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Transanal suture mucopexy was used in 5634 consecutive cases of hemorrhoids. Minimal pain of visual analog score 1 to 2 was noted in 5308 cases, and 126 (2.2%) patients reported a dull pain of visual analog score 2 to 3 on the second postoperative day. They were given paracetamol (500 mg) as an analgesic. Transanal suture mucopexy is a less painful procedure than conventional hemorrhoidectomy. As there is no perianal or anal wound, no painful dressings or sitz baths are required.

We compare this new procedure primarily with the Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and Doppler-guided hemorrhoid artery ligation procedures with respect to pain, safety, bleeding, hospital stay, recurrence, incontinence, cost, and early resumption of work.

The Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy — the gold standard procedure — is painful and requires 2 to 3 days' hospitalization in India. Sitz baths, dressings, and heavy analgesics or sedation are necessary. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy was described by Longoas a less painful procedure; however, postoperative pain has been observed in 25% and local discomfort in 38% of cases. Intervention for the removal of granuloma, infection‚ or staples is required in 3% to 11% of patients to reduce pain. In 1995, Morinaga reported a new technique to locate the terminal branches of the superior hemorrhoid artery by Doppler. These are identified and ligated using a figure 8 suture at the Doppler-located position, 4- to 6- cm proximal to the dentate line. It is a less painful procedure. The anorectal repair procedure, involving plication of the anal mucosa, is used for prolapsed grade III and IV hemorrhoids and is associated with a certain amount of pain.

### A systematic review of the patient burden of Crohn's disease-related rectovaginal and anovaginal fistulas [^efd0b004]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the surgical and procedural burden, this SLR indicated that patients with RVF/AVF report a heavy medication burden for both CD and fistula. For example, 94% of patients (48/51) who underwent treatment for RVF during 1998–2005 had received previous medication therapy, though it is unclear whether this was therapy for CD or fistula, specifically. Seven of the 12 studies reporting on treatment patterns provided details on prior use of medications to manage CD and/or fistula. In a hospital-based study of 65 women who underwent surgery to close a RVF, 40% (26/65) had taken immunomodulators and 30.8% (20/65) had taken steroids within 3 months prior to surgery. Reported medications include anti-TNF biologics, corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, 6 mercaptopurine, and antibiotics (Table 3).

In addition to these surgical and medical treatments, other treatments for CD and RVF/AVF may include conservative management techniques, such as local wound debridement, a low residue diet, and sitz baths, although the data for these approaches are not enumerated in the literature.

Delayed bathing — World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and observed benefits: Delayed bathing is the practice of not performing the first bath for several hours after birth. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that bathing be delayed until after 24 hours after birth, and if cultural reasons prohibit this 24-hour delay, then the delay should be a minimum of 6 hours. Outside of a general recommendation for delayed bathing, no other organizations apart from the WHO have explicit recommendations on timing, and the optimal time for delaying bathing is not clear. The most-often cited benefit of delayed bathing is increased rates of breastfeeding, which has been observed in several retrospective studies.

Outcomes

The three primary outcomes were: clinically suspected sepsis, laboratory-confirmed sepsis, and all-cause mortality during the first 60 days of life. Clinically suspected sepsis was defined as the collection of 0·5 mL or more of blood for culture from a neonate where the clinician had identified sepsis symptoms. In neonates with clinically suspected sepsis, laboratory-confirmed sepsis was defined as a positive blood culture. Blood cultures with suspected contaminants (appendix p 10) were excluded from laboratory-confirmed sepsis. All-cause mortality was defined as being reported deceased by a clinician or family member at one of the predefined follow-up points; date of death was recorded to determine neonatal age.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^cd6be12e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary goals of AF therapy are to achieve IAS relaxation, thus reducing pain and facilitating the healing process; minimize anal trauma; increase blood flow; and treat pain. To obtain these results the cornerstones of NOM are as follows:
Stool softeners (increased intake of oral fluids, high-fiber diet or fiber supplements, and bulk forming laxatives);
Sphincter muscle relaxers (warm sitz baths, local application of calcium channel blockers like Diltiazem or Nifedipine, local application of Nitrates like Nitroglycerin and Botulinum injection that determines a temporal paralysis of the anal sphincter muscle for 2–3 months). As already mentioned above, the literature regarding acute AF is scarce and the available data are often mixed with those regarding chronic AF, and this is especially true regarding muscle relaxers. Several pharmacological agents have been used with the purpose of inducing the so-called chemical sphincterotomy: based on the pathophysiology of the disease, NO donors (glyceryl trinitrate) are vasodilator and may support AF healing; they promote an increase in local blood flow and reduce IAS tone. On the other hand, calcium channel blockers (CCB) block slow L-type calcium channels of vascular smooth muscle cells, thus reducing the IAS tone and promoting an increase in local blood flow. In a single double-blind, randomized, prospective trial on 110 patients with chronic AF, Perrotti et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of an industrially manufactured ointment (0.3% nifedipine; 1.5% lidocaine). The authors reported a healing rate of 95% after 6 weeks compared to 16% of control group (1% hydrocortisone and 1.5% lidocaine). According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, including 148 trials and 29 different non-surgical treatments, CCBs (diltiazem or nifedipine) were more effective than glyceryl trinitrate and with less risk of headache and hypotension. In particular, CCBs are associated with a healing rate ranging from 65 to 95% and with a remarkable cost-effectiveness compared to other non-operative treatments. Furthermore, considering the possibility of systemic side-effects and the similar rates of healing and pain relief, the topical use of CCBs is suggested.

### A case report of spontaneous bilateral perineal hematoma during pregnancy and literature review [^80099978]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Postpartum management

Marked perineal swelling persisted postpartum. Ice packs and 50% magnesium sulfate dressings were continued for edema reduction (Fig. 2). Cefoperazone-sulbactam was administered for infection prophylaxis. On postpartum day 4, external stitches were removed, and the patient was discharged (Fig. 3). She continued potassium permanganate sitz baths twice daily, 20–30 min each.

Fig. 2
The first postpartum day

Fig. 3
The fourth postpartum day

On postpartum day 6, the episiotomy incision showed partial skin and subcutaneous dehiscence (Fig. 4) without apparent purulent discharge. Sitz baths continued. By day 15, the wound was healing, and the hematoma had diminished in size (Fig. 5). Sitz baths were maintained through one month postpartum.

Fig. 4
The 6th postpartum day

The 15th postpartum day

At 48 days postpartum, the wound had fully healed on the left, and its hematoma was absorbed; however, a firm, 2-cm nodule remained on the right, accompanied by a small adhesion band near the vaginal introitus (Fig. 6). It was excised using electrocautery.

Fig. 6
Follow-up at 48 days postpartum

At 4 months postpartum, a residual 1.5-cm nodule persisted in the right perineum. Ultrasound revealed a 17 × 16 × 11 mm hypoechoic area (Fig. 7). By 8 months postpartum, the right-sided hematoma had fully resolved.

Fig. 7
Ultrasound at 4 months postpartum showing right perineal nodule

Second pregnancy and delivery

Nine months postpartum, the patient conceived again. She attended antenatal clinics at our hospital, and the pregnancy proceeded uneventfully, without further perineal massage.

At 40 + 5 weeks, she was admitted at 6:15 with "premature rupture of membranes." Her height was 166 cm, weight 85 kg. Oxytocin infusion was started at 10:45. By 22:30, she felt a strong urge to defecate. Examination revealed 1.0 cm cervical length, soft, mid-position cervix, fetal station S-2, and intact membranes. Artificial rupture of membranes showed clear fluid, and oxytocin continued. At 2:10 the next morning, the cervix was fully dilated; at 2:21, under perineal support, she spontaneously delivered another healthy female infant, with no laceration or hematoma recurrence. She was discharged on postpartum day 3 without complications.

### Xiaozhi decoction reduced posthemorrhoidectomy pain and analgesic medication consumption: a prospective study [^cd9498e7]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

All patients underwent a standard Milligan–Morgan hemorrhoidectomy by the same surgeon under standard general anesthesia. After surgery, metronidazole tablets were administrated at a dose of 250 mg, twice a day for 1 week. Analgesic tablets containing a combination of tramadol hydrochloride 37.5 mg and paracetamol 325 mg (Ultracet; Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd. Xian, People's Republic of China) were prescribed as needed but not more than four tablets each day.

Sitz bath was begun on postoperative day (POD) 1 and lasted for 7 days. Patients accepted sitz bath for 15 min each time, twice a day, once in the morning after defecation and another just before bedtime. Patients in the control group accepted sitz bath with warm water alone, while in the XZD group 100 mL of XZD was added into the warm water.

The composition of XZD (Table 1) consisted of Flos Chrysanthemi Indici 10.0 g, Radix Sophorae Flavescentis 10.0 g, Herba Taraxaci 10.0 g, Mirabilitum 10.0 g, Rhizoma Corydalis 10.0 g, Olibanum 10.0 g, Myrrha 10.0 g, Galla Chinensis 10.0 g, Radix et Rhizoma Rhei 7.5 g, Flos Carthami 5.0 g and Radix Glycyrrhizae 3.0 g. All the herbs were decocted in 1000 mL of water and finally condensed into 100 mL of decoction.

Outcome measurements and follow-up

Patients were monitored and discharged within 72 hours after surgery. All patients were followed up after discharge from the hospital via phone. Postoperative pain at 12 hours after surgery and on PODs 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 was evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scored 0 (no pain) to 10 (very severe pain). Pain on defecation on PODs 1, 2, 7, 14 and 28 was also recorded using the VAS. The number of analgesic tablets consumed by each patient per day was also recorded and analyzed.

### Haemorrhoidal disease in pregnancy: results from a self-assessment questionnaire administered by means of a social network [^d4c07429]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Quality of life during pregnancy and immediately after delivery can be marred by anal symptoms, not rarely severe, related to hemorrhoidal disease (HD). The prevalence of HD in pregnancy is considered high with data from literature, mainly obtained by means of interview, ranging from 24 to 35%, up to an estimated peak about 85% particularly in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. However, data on the true prevalence are limited and variably reported. Symptoms commonly associated with HD are bright red blood at defecation, anal pain, pruritus ani, mucus discharge and prolapse. Hemorrhoids can be divided into external and internal. These last are usually classified in four degrees, according to Goligher's grading of prolapse. External haemorrhoids may develop a painful thrombosis, a frequent cause of consultation during pregnancy and after childbirth. HD and in less extent anal fissures are certainly among the leading causes of rectal bleeding in pregnant women and a proctological examination can make a differential diagnosis. Different etiologic factors are deemed responsible for HD in pregnancy, such as increased pelvic pressure, obstruction to pelvic venous outflow, relaxing effect of progesterone on the venous wall, increased circulating blood volume and constipation, with age and parity hypothesized as predisposing factors. A history of HD and constipation has been associated to HD in pregnancy but no association was found with gestational hormonal changes. In a recent study by Bužinskiene et al. additional risk factors were identified, such as prolonged pregnancy (more than 40 weeks), prolonged labour or straining duration of more than 20 min, instrumental delivery and newborn weight of more than 3,800 g. Interestingly in spite of this, guidelines for HD prevention and treatment during pregnancy are the same as those recommended in the general population and thus mainly focused on bowel function suggesting dietary changes, fluid and bran intake, however with controversial results. Other treatments recommended consist of warm sitz baths or local ointment, whereas flavonoids use is not supported, lacking evidence of their safety profile in pregnancy.

### Frequency of bathing in the management of atopic dermatitis: to bathe or not to bathe? [^f01e91ae]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis prevalence has increased in the developed world in recent decades, and effective management is vital to improve patients' quality of life.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, case-control study with a purposive sample of 28 children, aged 6 months to 10 years, diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. Participants received bathing instructions to be followed either daily or twice a week, with a follow-up duration of 2 weeks. Improvement of symptoms over time was measured using the SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) tool.

Results

Overall symptoms decreased significantly at follow-up compared with baseline (difference = 5.0938, confidence interval = 0.2116 to 9.9759) but the differences in scores before and after interventions were not statistically significant between the groups (difference = -1.0937, confidence interval = -5.9759 to 3.7884).

Conclusions

The frequency of bathing did not seem to play an important role in the management of atopic dermatitis. Clinicians should focus on the need for adequate skin hydration.

### A rare and extreme case of vulvar swelling in the setting of nephrotic syndrome in a prepubertal girl [^d7c9cbd3]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We present a rare case of severe vulvar edema secondary to steroid-refractory nephrotic syndrome in a prepubertal girl.

Case

The patient is an 8-year-old girl who presented during nephrotic syndrome relapse. She exhibited severe mons pubis and labial edema. She was treated with local symptomatic measures such as sitz baths, barrier ointment, and labial sling, with minimal relief. Improvement ultimately occurred after bilateral nephrectomy.

Summary and Conclusion

Vulvar edema is rare in prepubertal girls. In this case, the edema was secondary to steroid-refractory nephrotic syndrome and was not responsive to local treatment measures. There is a paucity of data on effective treatment of vulvar edema in young girls. Our goal is to raise awareness of such pathology, which might lead to development of uniform guidelines for treatment of this condition.

### Effect of active wound dressing on postoperative pain and wound healing in patients undergoing anorectal surgery [^0b448e27]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Commercially available alginate dressings were selected to align with real-world clinical practices, ensuring the study's findings could be readily implemented in routine medical settings. This choice allows for broader reproducibility across healthcare institutions. Both groups underwent conventional potassium permanganate solution sitz baths (1/1000 concentration, 20 min, twice daily), regular dressing changes, and observation of wound conditions. SG and CG groups were matched based on age, comorbidities, and the severity of the surgical condition using propensity score matching. This approach was chosen to minimize the impact of potential confounders and ensure comparability between the groups. The CG received conventional dressing post-sitz bath, using sterilized Vaseline gauze (Zhejiang Aoqi Medical Dressing Co. LTD.) applied to the surgical wound and secured with medical tape. The SG was given active wound dressing, self-adhesive alginate dressing [Kelu (Wuhan) Biotechnology Co. LTD. (80–300) mm× (80–300) mm], external wound dressing. In both groups, wound dressings were changed twice daily during the first 7 days postoperatively, followed by once daily until complete epithelialization was achieved.

Surgical procedures

All patients underwent standardized procedures: lateral internal sphincterotomy for anal fissures, fistulotomy/seton for anal fistulas, Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy for hemorrhoids, and Delorme's or Altemeier procedure for rectal prolapse. All operations were performed under spinal anesthesia in the jackknife position.

### Management guidelines for low anterior resection syndrome-the MANUEL project [^ea61f29d]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Diet, laxatives, constipating agents and medications

Up to 96% of patients report a change in diet. Changes usually involve intake of high‐fibre low‐fat food, avoidance of wine, cold beverages and spicy or stimulating food. However, a high content of insoluble fibre may worsen diarrhoea, the frequency of bowel movements and bloating [50]. Soluble fibre (bulking agents) should be preferred since it is better tolerated and may be beneficial in decreasing clustering and improving stool consistency, provided adequate doses are taken (clinical experience of the panel). The use of probiotics does not seem to alter the postoperative bowel function associated with LARS [51]. Inappropriate dietary habits should also be avoided, and patients might benefit from a consultation with a specialized dietician [52, 53, 54].

Loperamide is one of the most commonly used medications for bowel control, together with sitz bath or local ointments for perianal soreness or itching. Protection of underwear with pads or other absorbents is usually reported. Enemas are also used to optimize incomplete emptying or to plan defaecation.

5‐HT3 antagonists (Ramosetron, in particular) and bile acid sequestrants (colesevelam) have shown interesting preliminary results, but they still need further evaluation in patients with LARS [55].

Unfortunately, in the absence of structured guidance and due to a wide variability of symptoms with different effects on patients' lives, conservative measures often yield inconsistent results. Their impact on patient satisfaction and HRQoL is doubtful and still poorly supported by evidence [56].

Pelvic floor rehabilitation

Although few studies have been published about rehabilitation in patients suffering from LARS, results are encouraging. The majority of studies reported improvement in stool frequency, incontinence episodes, severity of faecal incontinence and HRQoL after pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback [57]. Moreover, irradiated patients show short‐ and long‐term results comparable to those of nonirradiated patients, despite the higher degree of incontinence at baseline [58]. Table 2 summarizes the potential benefits for patients with LARS of each component of pelvic floor rehabilitation.

TABLE 2
Pelvic floor rehabilitation: possible benefits for patients with low anterior resection syndrome

Despite this, the different protocols used regarding duration of training, method and application modality still do not allow firm conclusions, in particular with respect to patient selection.

However, a multimodal approach, managing all the rehabilitative techniques according to the individual needs of the patient, could significantly improve symptoms more than a single technique alone [59].

Results

The socio-demographic and pregnancy-related characteristics

This correlational study included 112 participants who were convenient during data collection. The mean age of the participants was 25.04 years. Most participants completed their secondary education, which is about 50%. Most participants were Muslim 96.4% and lived in urban areas 67%. The mean family income was 22,879 Taka. About 49.1% of participants became pregnant more than 2 times and have more than two children alive. Among all the participants, 57.1% visited for antenatal check-ups at different facilities 5 to 9 times during their last pregnancy. They visited for this reason to physicians at medical colleges & other healthcare facilities, which is about 55.4%. Most of the participants delivered their child at MCH & other facilities 86.6% and delivered their child through caesarean Sect. 71.4%. During hospital admission, the participant's amniotic membrane was intact, about 58.9%. The majority of participants suffered from labour complications 68.8%, and most of them suffered from premature rupture of membrane (PROM) 34.1%. The mean duration of labour was 5.20 h (Table 1).

Perceived benefits, perceived barriers and social support of puerperal sepsis preventive behavior of postpartum mothers

The result of perceived benefit showed that the average perceived benefits were 3.19 (SD = 0.46). More than half (55.4%) of the participants strongly agreed that using hygienic and comfortable sanitary napkin will help to prevent puerperal sepsis, 53.6% mentioned washing hand before and after perineal care can prevent puerperal sepsis, 61.6% stated identification and avoidance of source of infection is essential to prevent puerperal sepsis, 73.2% strongly opinionated postnatal exercise is vital to get back to pre-pregnant condition. Whereas only 12.5% of participants strongly mentioned checking the colour and odour of lochia for any change is required to identify puerperal infection, and 27.7% strongly agreed that practising perineal sitz bath helps prevent puerperal sepsis (Table 2).

### Evaluation and management of common anorectal conditions [^827921ee]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of benign anorectal conditions in the primary care setting is high, although evidence of effective therapy is often lacking. In addition to recognizing common benign anorectal disorders, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for inflammatory and malignant disorders. Patients with red flags such as increased age, family history, persistent anorectal bleeding despite treatment, weight loss, or iron deficiency anemia should undergo colonoscopy. Pruritus ani, or perianal itching, is managed by treating the underlying cause, ensuring proper hygiene, and providing symptomatic relief with oral antihistamines, topical steroids, or topical capsaicin. Effective treatments for anal fissures include onabotulinumtoxinA, topical nitroglycerin, and topical calcium channel blockers. Symptomatic external hemorrhoids are managed with dietary modifications, topical steroids, and analgesics. Thrombosed hemorrhoids are best treated with hemorrhoidectomy if symptoms are present for less than 72 hours. Grades I through III internal hemorrhoids can be managed with rubber band ligation. For the treatment of grade III internal hemorrhoids, surgical hemorrhoidectomy has higher remission rates but increased pain and complication rates compared with rubber band ligation. Anorectal condylomas, or anogenital warts, are treated based on size and location, with office treatment consisting of topical trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin, cryotherapy, or laser treatment. Simple anorectal fistulas can be treated conservatively with sitz baths and analgesics, whereas complex or nonhealing fistulas may require surgery. Fecal impaction may be treated with polyethylene glycol, enemas, or manual disimpaction. Fecal incontinence is generally treated with loperamide and biofeedback. Surgical intervention is reserved for anal sphincter injury.

### Treatment of levator ani syndrome with cyclobenzaprine [^81d19662]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of levator ani syndrome (LAS) that was successfully treated with cyclobenzaprine.

Case Summary

A 26-year-old male presented with a 3-week history of severe, intermittent, aching anorectal pain that would last for 30–60 minutes per episode and occurred between 1 and 3 times per day. The pain was aggravated by squatting, with no alleviating factors. Physical examination revealed no prostate tenderness, lesions, hemorrhoids, or fissures and rectal tone was intact. The patient had moderate posterior rectal tenderness. After a standard workup, he was diagnosed with LAS and treated with oral cyclobenzaprine 5 mg 3 times daily for 7 days. The patient experienced resolution of his symptoms after 3 days of treatment and remained symptom-free 6 months after completion of therapy. The only reported adverse effect was mild drowsiness, which resolved after discontinuation of the cyclobenzaprine.

Discussion

A review of the literature via StatRef (April 1965-December 2011), Ovid (April 1965-December 2011), and MEDLINE (April 1965-December 2011) reveals that existing treatment options for LAS have been limited to levator massage, sitz baths, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, diazepam, biofeed-back, botulinum toxin, steroid injections, and electrogalvanic stimulation, all of which offer minimal support. Cyclobenzaprine is a muscle relaxant; however, its mechanism of action is unclear. It is thought to influence the α and γ motor neurons in the central nervous system, which leads to the attenuation of muscle spasm. To our knowledge, cyclobenzaprine has not been reported as a treatment for LAS. In our patient, however, the clinical efficacy of cyclobenzaprine was clearly apparent.

Conclusions

Cyclobenzaprine effectively treated our patient's LAS. Given that cyclobenzaprine is safe, inexpensive, and shown to be effective in our case study, we believe it warrants further investigation as a first-line treatment option for LAS.

### Benign anorectal disease: hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^d557f07c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment

Surgical treatment is indicated for grade III or IV internal hemorrhoids and for thrombosed external hemorrhoids with persistent symptoms. Excision is recommended within the first 48 h of symptoms for thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Incision and drainage is ineffective, and complete excision of the hemorrhoid with the associated external skin is advised. This procedure can take place in the clinic or in an emergency care setting with local anesthesia. A retrospective review of 231 patients comparing excision to non-operative treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids showed that excision symptoms resolved on average in 3.9 days (vs. 24 days in the non-operative group) and were less likely to recur.

Acute hemorrhoid crisis is rare, and will appear as beefy red, ulcerated or necrotic hemorrhoids on examination. This occurs when internal hemorrhoids prolapse and become incarcerated as a result of sphincter spasm and warrants hospital admission. It is not uncommon to have concurrent thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Most patients with acute hemorrhoid crisis benefit from hospitalization and conservative management, including bowel rest, pain control and sitz baths. Necrotic hemorrhoids and/or perineal sepsis are indications for urgent exploration and excision.

### Nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment vs placebo in the treatment of pain resulting from chronic anal fissure: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^63271e97]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Participants

Women and men aged 18 to 75 years were eligible to participate if they had a single, chronic posterior midline anal fissure accompanied by anal pain during the 6 weeks prior to screening and a 24-hour average pain score of ≥ 50 mm (on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]) at baseline and on 2 of the 4 days before randomization, indicating moderate-to-severe pain. Evidence of at least one of the following criteria for chronic fissure also was required for study inclusion: sentinel skin tag, hypertrophied anal papillae, exposed internal anal sphincter, fibrotic fissure margins, or fibrotic anal sphincter. Patients had to be willing to discontinue or avoid nonprescription and prescription medicine (apart from conservative care fiber supplements, adequate fluid, and sitz baths) for the treatment of CAF for the duration of the study, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; except at low doses for cardiovascular prophylaxis [162 mg/day or ≤ 325 mg on alternate days]), acetaminophen (paracetamol), and any other analgesic for the treatment of headache or any other condition.

Patients were ineligible if they had more than one anal fissure, fistula-in-ano or anal abscess, inflammatory bowel disease, fibrotic anal stenosis, anal fissure secondary to an underlying condition, or a history of anal surgery. Additional key exclusion criteria included a recent history of migraine or chronic headaches; hypotension or uncorrected hypovolemia; increased intracranial pressure or inadequate cerebral circulation; use of nitroglycerin or any other nitric oxide donors, potassium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, or any medications that could cause a drop in blood pressure when given in combination with nitrates; and the presence of any chronic pain requiring treatment with prohibited medications.

### Levator ani syndrome presenting with vaginal pain [^c7c74769]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Levator ani syndrome (LAS), also known as levator ani spasm, puborectalis syndrome, chronic proctalgia, pyriformis syndrome and pelvic tension myalgia, produces chronic anal pain. The levator ani muscle is susceptible to the development of myofascial pain syndrome, and trigger points may be elicited on physical examination. The pathophysiology remains to be fully delineated. The diagnosis of LAS is suggested primarily by the clinical history, physical examination and the exclusion of organic disease that can produce recurrent or chronic proctalgia. Digital massage, sitz bath, electrogalvanic stimulation and biofeedback are the treatment modalities most frequently described in the literature. Pharmacological management includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, diazepam, amitriptyline, gabapentin and botulinum toxin. The evaluation of these patients can be challenging due to a diversity of causative factors. The authors present the case of a nulliparous woman in her mid-30s presenting with acute onset of lower abdominal and rectal pain radiating to her vagina. There was no history of trauma, inflammatory bowel disease, anal fissure or altered bowel habit. Each pain episode lasted longer than 20min and was exacerbated by sitting. Neurological examination showed no evidence of neurological dysfunction. Rectal examination was unremarkable. During vaginal examination, palpation of the levator ani muscles elicited pain indicating pelvic floor dysfunction. Laboratory investigations including a full blood count and C reactive protein were within normal range. Further investigation with a transabdominal ultrasound scan, CT of the abdomen and pelvis and MRI of the lumbar spine were unremarkable. She commenced treatment with amitriptyline 20 mg once daily. She was referred for pelvic floor physiotherapy. Functional pain syndromes, such as LAS, should be regarded as diagnoses of exclusion and considered only after a thorough evaluation has been performed to rule out structural causes of pain. Knowledge of the pelvic floor and pelvic wall muscles may enable the physician to identify LAS, a possible cause of chronic pelvic pain.

### Behçet's disease in pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^3f572f77]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 20-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, has experienced recurrent oral ulcers since the first trimester without receiving treatment. Due to the presence of genital ulcers accompanied by swelling and pain, she underwent treatment with potassium permanganate (1:5000) in water during a sitz bath, as well as topical anti-inflammatory medications, three days prior at another hospital; however, there was no significant improvement. Consequently, she presented to our inpatient department with recurrent oral and genital ulcers at 28 weeks and 3 days of gestation. She reported no history of rheumatic, genetic, infectious, or psychiatric disorders. Additionally, there was no history of mental or genetic disorders.

Upon admission, physical examinations revealed scattered, round ulcers of varying sizes and depths on the mucosa of the lower lip and the margin of the tongue, with a yellowish coating covering the base. There was congestion of the uvula, and round-like ulcers were also visible on the uvula (Fig. 1). The vulvar clitoris was swollen, and scattered ulcers of varying depths were observed on both the labia majora and labia minora, with notable adhesions on the right labium and a significant amount of yellowish-white discharge present, which was associated with evident tenderness (Fig. 1).

### Topical sucralfate treatment of anal fistulotomy wounds: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^5c09e2e4]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Sucralfate is a cytoprotective agent which adheres to mucoproteins and forms a protective barrier at wound sites. In oral form it is a common ulcer medication, and as a topical preparation it has been used to treat a wide variety of wounds.

Objective

The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical sucralfate in wound healing after anal fistulotomy.

Design

Double-blind, randomized controlled study comparing topical application of sucralfate or placebo.

Setting

Private outpatient clinic specializing in anorectal disease in Nagpur, India.

Patients

Patients with a wound length of at least 5 cm after low anal fistulotomy were eligible for the study.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ointment containing 7% sucralfate or a placebo ointment consisting of petroleum jelly. Patients were instructed to apply approximately 3 g of ointment to the wound twice daily after a sitz bath for 6 weeks or until the wound had healed.

Main Outcome Measures

The wounds were examined by a blinded independent observer at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the operation. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with wounds that had completely healed. Secondary end points included amount of mucosal covering (scored by the observer), adverse events, and postoperative pain (self-rated on a visual analog scale).

Results

Of 80 participants (29 women, 51 men; median age, 23 (range, 17–49) years), 76 participants completed the trial (sucralfate, 39; placebo, 37). At 6-week follow-up, complete wound healing was achieved in 37 patients (95%) in the sucralfate group and 27 patients (73%) in the placebo group (P = 0.009). Mucosal coverage of the wound was significantly greater with sucralfate than with placebo at each measurement point (P = 0.01). No adverse events were observed. Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower for sucralfate than for placebo at 2 and 4 weeks after the start of treatment.

Limitations

Wound tissue specimens were not available for morphological and ultrastructural analysis.

Conclusions

The results of this study add support to the evidence that topical sucralfate is a safe and effective method for promoting mucosal healing and for providing analgesia during wound treatment. Patients undergoing anal fistulotomy can benefit from the use of topical application of sucralfate.

### Efficacy of nitroglycerine ointment in the treatment of pediatric anal fissure [^1d143bd1]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anal fissure is the most common anal disease in children. In the past few decades, the understanding of its pathophysiology has led to a progressive reduction in invasive procedures in favor of conservative treatment based on stool softeners and the relaxation of the anal sphincter. This randomized controlled study assessed the safety and efficacy of nitroglycerine (NTG) ointment in the treatment of pediatric anal fissure, which had not yet been proved.

Patients and Methods

An unequal randomized controlled study included 105 pediatric patients with anal fissure who had presented to the private and outpatient clinics of the Central Teaching Hospital of Pediatrics during the period from February 2015 to May 2016. The control group consisted of 70 patients. Both groups were treated with classical conservative therapy of sitz bath, stool softener, and local anesthetic. In the second group, chemical sphincterotomy with 0.2% NTG ointment was used in 35 patients, and was applied at the anal canal twice daily for 8weeks. The primary outcomes of symptomatic improvement and healed fissure, as well as side effects, were analyzed.

Results

The average age of patients was 2years (range, 4months to 5years). Patients in the NTG group had 77% symptomatic relief and 60% healed fissure compared to the control group, which had 54% and 32.8% respectively. All were statistically significant. No serious adverse effects were noticed during the treatment period.

Conclusion

The use of 0.2% NTG ointment is an effective therapy for anal fissure in children in terms of good healing rate and rapid symptom relief, but it has the drawback of a long treatment period, making patient compliance more difficult, in addition to the problems of tolerance and recurrence.

Type Of Study

Prospective randomized controlled study (treatment study).

### Bathing and associated treatments in atopic dermatitis [^12924723]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common complaints presenting to dermatologists, and patients typically inquire as to appropriate bathing recommendations. Although many dermatologists, allergists, and primary-care practitioners provide explicit bathing instructions, recommendations regarding frequency of bathing, duration of bathing, and timing related to emollient and medication application relative to bathing vary widely. Conflicting and vague guidelines stem from knowledge related to the disparate effects of water on skin, as well as a dearth of studies, especially randomized controlled trials, evaluating the effects of water and bathing on the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. We critically review the literature related to bathing and associated atopic dermatitis treatments, such as wet wraps, bleach baths, bath additives, and balneotherapy. We aim to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the impact of water and related therapies on atopic dermatitis as well as recommendations based upon the published data.

### Heat stress and fetal risk. environmental limits for exercise and passive heat stress during pregnancy: a systematic review with best evidence synthesis [^7e845e6c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pregnant women are advised to avoid heat stress (eg, excessive exercise and/or heat exposure) due to the risk of teratogenicity associated with maternal hyperthermia; defined as a core temperature (T core) ≥ 39.0°C. However, guidelines are ambiguous in terms of critical combinations of climate and activity to avoid and may therefore unnecessarily discourage physical activity during pregnancy. Thus, the primary aim was to assess T core elevations with different characteristics defining exercise and passive heat stress (intensity, mode, ambient conditions, duration) during pregnancy relative to the critical maternal T core of ≥ 39.0°C.

Design

Systematic review with best evidence synthesis.

Data Sources

EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched from inception to 12 July 2017.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies reporting the T core response of pregnant women, at any period of gestation, to exercise or passive heat stress, were included.

Results

12 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria (n = 347). No woman exceeded a T core of 39.0°C. The highest T core was 38.9°C, reported during land-based exercise. The highest mean end-trial T core was 38.3°C (95% CI 37.7°C to 38.9°C) for land-based exercise, 37.5°C (95% CI 37.3°C to 37.7°C) for water immersion exercise, 36.9°C (95% CI 36.8°C to 37.0°C) for hot water bathing and 37.6°C (95% CI 37.5°C to 37.7°C) for sauna exposure.

Conclusion

The highest individual core temperature reported was 38.9°C. Immediately after exercise (either land based or water immersion), the highest mean core temperature was 38.3°C; 0.7°C below the proposed teratogenic threshold. Pregnant women can safely engage in: (1) exercise for up to 35min at 80%-90% of their maximum heart rate in 25°C and 45% relative humidity (RH); (2) water immersion (≤ 33.4°C) exercise for up to 45min; and (3) sitting in hot baths (40°C) or hot/dry saunas (70°C; 15% RH) for up to 20min, irrespective of pregnancy stage, without reaching a core temperature exceeding the teratogenic threshold.

### Newborn care practices among slum dwellers in dhaka, Bangladesh: a quantitative and qualitative exploratory study [^1e2f4ef6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

I bathed the baby daily. There is a variation between persons in terms of the practice of bathing the baby. There are some women who get the baby cold during the bathing. They don't understand how to bathe [a newborn baby] properly. I bathe my baby in a way so that it does not get cold. The water is warm and I add savlon or mustard oil to the water. (Woman from Korail)

The risk of cold was the main factor in determining the time of the bath. Women mentioned some measures to prevent their newborn babies from cold including mustard oil massage (before and after the bath) and wrapping the baby after the bath.

### Unavoidable risks: local perspectives on water contact behavior and implications for schistosomiasis control in an agricultural region of Northern Senegal [^850ca942]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Children only know swimming. You know, they are happy when they bathe. It's a kind of a pool. They like that. In this moment, if you go to the lake, you find children in the process of bathing. It's this that… gives us bilharzia. (68-year-old female gardener, Lake Village W)

Adult participants in focus group discussions often emphasized the importance of protecting children from schistosomiasis. Some mentioned that they forbid their children from going to the water points at hot times of day. They also said that many parents do not enforce rules about water contact with their children. Following this thread, the same woman from Lake Village W continued:

Nobody now controls their children. No one controls anything anymore. They [the children] are there [at the water access point]. Every child who pees, he pees blood. Because now we sit and let the children be. They will bathe. Nobody holds them back. If we had said, if they have given up bathing only, bilharzia would leave here. Because she [schistosomiasis] had left here. But she [schistosomiasis] came back. Because we let the children swim, swim, swim. (68-year-old female gardener, Lake Village W)

Even so, for those parents who did make rules regulating their children's contact with water, adult focus group participants described the difficulty of enforcing rules. With these hurdles to reducing exposure among kids along with the health-livelihood trade-offs that many adults face, it is understandable that the local sentiment of schistosomiasis being an unavoidable artifact of the disturbed landscape has become pervasive. A 60-year-old female gardener from Lake Village W articulated this sense of inescapability:

It [water contact]'s not good for you. It's not good. But we have no choice… Because we, we are near the lake. If you say that I will not do it [go to the lake]… it is certainly not possible. It cannot happen like this. Fortunately, we pray for ourselves and he [Allah] gives us medicine [praziquantel]… But we cannot protect ourselves… we are not easy to protect. (60-year-old female gardener, Lake Village W)

### Heat reacclimation using exercise or hot water immersion [^fb217569]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

HWI

Passive heating, using hot water (40°C) immersion for 40 min, was selected based on its high practical value; baths are accessible to most, and the protocol will have minimal effect on training schedules. The water temperature of 40°C is below the thermal pain threshold, and pilot testing confirmed that the proposed protocol was challenging but tolerable. This seemed a good balance between providing a strong enough stimulus but still achievable for all to complete.

Participants sat in a neutral room for 5–10 min while a 5-min baseline value of physiological and perceptual responses was collected. They then entered the bath (Lay-Z-Spa BW54113 Monaco 2018 Model, Shanghai, China), which was set at 40°C, for 40 min. Water temperature was recorded using a PT100 sensor (GMH3750-SET1; Greisinger electronic GmbH, Germany) every 5 min. Participants were required to keep their shoulders under the water; however, this protocol is challenging and the risk of syncope is high. Participants were allowed "relief" breaks for 2 min, every 10 min, whereby they could sit on a stool, with the lower body still submerged to provide some relief from the oppressive bath temperature. If T re rose > 39°C, participants were required to sit on a stool with the water to their waist. While immersed, participants were free to drink water ad libitum, and the volume consumed was recorded. During immersion, T re and heart rate were monitored continuously, and thermal sensation and thermal comfort were reported every 5 min. Immersion ended after 40 min unless the participants withdrew themselves or T re exceeded 39.5°C. After immersion, participants lay supine for a minimum of 10 min and sat upright for a minimum of 5 min to ensure T re began to decline and blood pressure appeared well regulated.

### Ultrasound-guided trans-perineal pudendal nerve block for post-hemorrhoidectomy voiding complications: a prospective randomized double-blinded study [^d4bfbfba]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemorrhoidectomy is a common surgical procedure. Despite the assumed simplicity of the procedure, the associated complications can be notably disappointing. Post-hemorrhoidectomy urine retention stands as a common and serious event, with an incidence reaching 50% of patients in some studies.

The mechanism of post-hemorrhoidectomy retention (PHUR) is multifactorial. The exact mechanism may include autonomic system imbalance or detrusor muscle dysfunction. The risk factors include the type of anesthesia, use of opioids, the surgical technique, female gender, and the volume of the intravenous fluids.

Employed strategies to decrease the incidence of PHUR involved comparing different surgical techniques, fluid restriction, sitz bath, and alpha blocker medications. Postoperative pain was also associated with a higher incidence of urinary retention after anal surgeries, necessitating adequate analgesic plan.

Pudendal nerve block (PNB) was successfully used to alleviate pain and urinary symptoms after anal surgeries. PNB was associated with a significantly lower incidence of urinary symptoms and retention in different surgeries involving the perineal region. In our study, we applied the trans-perineal approach for ultrasound-guided pudendal nerve block in cases of hemorrhoidectomy under general anesthesia. The applied block was be performed in lithotomy position which is traditionally used for anal surgeries. Also, the ultrasound guidance allowed employing a small local anesthetic (LA) dose, minimizing the possible complications.

This study hypothesizes that US-guided trans-perineal approach is a safe and applicable technique that would decrease the incidence of PHUR (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included postoperative voiding symptoms, postoperative pain scores, and postoperative analgesia consumption.

### Is sauna bathing protective of sudden cardiac death? A review of the evidence [^d6a62d95]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a global public health burden accounting for 15–20% of all deaths. Though established atherosclerotic risk factors explain a large proportion of the risk of SCD, these factors are often absent in a large proportion of SCD victims and the pathogenesis of SCD is still not fully established. It therefore appears that additional factors may be involved. Sauna bathing is a traditional Finnish activity that is mainly used for the purposes of relaxation and pleasure. Beyond its use for these purposes, sauna bathing has been linked with several health benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that sauna bathing is associated with reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) and non-CVD outcomes as well as mortality. A number of reports have linked sauna bathing with reduced or increased risk of SCD, but the evidence is uncertain. This review summarizes available studies linking sauna bathing with SCD, the postulated mechanistic pathways underlying these associations, outlines areas of outstanding uncertainty, and the implications for prevention. We employed a comprehensive search for observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and non-RCTs from MEDLINE and Embase since their inception until March 2019. Observational data suggest that regular sauna bathing is associated with a substantial risk reduction in SCD. Furthermore, the data suggest that a combination of regular physical activity and sauna baths confers substantial risk reduction for SCD compared with either modality alone. Few reports have linked sauna baths with SCDs, but these single case incidents have been attributed to the effects of dehydration, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias due to a combination of sauna exposure and alcohol consumption. Sauna bathing is generally safe for most healthy people and even among patients with stable CVD, if used sensibly and with caution. Plausible pathways underlying the protective effect of sauna bathing on SCD may be linked to the impact on CV function via reduced arterial stiffness, decreases in inflammation and oxidative stress, stabilization of the autonomic nervous system, beneficial changes in circulating lipid profiles and other CVD risk markers, and lowering of systemic blood pressure. Sauna is a potential novel tool to promote SCD prevention in addition to other known means, being an enjoyable way to take care of general health and well-being.

### "Why not bathe the baby today? ": a qualitative study of thermal care beliefs and practices in four African sites [^cd030876]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

'I asked the traditional birth attendant 'why not bath the baby today?', she told me in the hospital they… don't allow you to bath you have to wait up to tomorrow… the traditional birth attendant follows directions which she hears from the hospital' [34 year old Tanzanian mother]

'Since her baby did not have that white thing on his skin, he was bathed later' [35 year old Ethiopian mother]

Findings from all respondent groups show that in Tanzania and Nigeria warm water was used for the first bath as the baby was perceived as delicate, could get cold, and because warm water gives strength and cold water could shock the baby and make it sick: 'The baby's body is very soft and delicate at this tender age and that is why in this community we normally bathe the baby with warm water' [65 year old Borno grandmother]. In Ethiopia, water temperature varied with some mothers, particularly those in lowland areas, reporting that they used unheated water to get the baby used to cold water or to help the baby feel warm: ' If a baby is bathed with cold water, the cold will not get in to her body. She will not feel the cold and will not shiver. But if a baby is bathed with warm water, she will feel cold and shiver when she gets out of the warm water' [46 year old Ethiopian grandmother]. Other Ethiopian mothers reported using warm water for similar reasons to those given in other sites.

### Medical and surgical treatment of haemorrhoids and anal fissure in Crohn's disease: a critical appraisal [^083d8cb2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Haemorrhoids

Conservative approach was initially adopted in all the patients; in absence of diarrhoea, it included high fibre diet, fibre supplements and oral fluids intake in order to produce soft, well-formed stools and regular bowel movements. Warm Sitz baths were also suggested. Oral diosmin was added to this first line therapy if symptoms persisted after 12 weeks or in case of thrombosis at the first outpatient visit. Moreover it represented the main treatment in CD patients with frequent diarrhoea (n = 5).

This conservative approach failed in 17 (37.8%) out 45 patients. Indication to surgical treatment in the nine patients with known CD at the time of evaluation was given only in case of stable intestinal disease, without need of steroid medications and with CDAI < 150.

Table 3 resumes types of surgical approach and overall complications in this group of patients; moreover the statistical analysis between the two subgroups is reported.

Table 3
Treatments and postoperative complications after failure of conservative management of haemorrhoids (n = 17)

Mean time to complete healing after surgery was 38 ± 8 days.

The most common complication was postoperative bleeding, observed in 3 (17.6%) out 17 patients, during the first four days postoperatively. One bleeding was self-limiting, while the other two required Emergency Room visits, during which local compression with hemostatic gauze (Tabotamp, Johnson & Johnson) was effective.

During the follow up we observed two (11.8%) postoperative anal fissures, effectively treated with topic glycerin trinitrate (GTN) 0.4% for eight weeks. In two cases (11.8%) perianal sepsis was detected one month and forty days after surgery, in the form of abscess and intersphinteric fistula close to one site of haemorrhoid excision. These patients were then successfully treated by drainage and fistulotomy.

Atopic dermatitis skin care (Table 1) — bathing, cleansing, moisturizing, and anti-inflammatory use are specified as follows: "Bath or shower for 5–10 minutes in lukewarm water, a comfortable temperature but not too hot," and "Optimal bathing frequency is once daily." If using topicals, "they should be applied first to inflamed skin within minutes of patting dry," and "A fragrance-free cream or ointment moisturizer should be applied to all other skin subsequently." For cleansing, "A gentle, fragrance-free cleanser should be used," "Bubble baths should be avoided," and "Dilute bleach baths may be recommended." For anti-inflammatories, "Apply a thin layer of the appropriate strength anti-inflammatory medication to the affected area(s) until clear, and then 3–5 days after clearing, up to 14 consecutive days unless otherwise directed." The table adds that "For those children who do not bathe every day, a moisturizer should still be applied twice daily," and that "Infants may need little to no cleanser or shampoo; true soap should be avoided in all patients."

### Clinical application of the intersphincteric approach with internal incision combined with counter-drainage for deep perianal abscess [^1b13d9f6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative treatment

(1) Postoperative analgesia: Oral analgesics, either alone or in combination with intramuscular analgesic drugs, were routinely administered on the day following surgery. (2) Postoperative anti-infection therapy: Antibiotics were administered to patients with severe DPA accompanied by local perianal and perineal infections, or those with systemic infections, diabetes. Complete blood counts were reassessed on the first and third days post-surgery. Antibiotic treatment was discontinued once the blood count returned to normal, and antibiotics were adjusted, if necessary, based on the results of the pus culture. (3) Postoperative dressing change and fumigation: 24 h post-surgery, remove the gauze packing from the abscess cavity and irrigate the cavity with a compound Huangbai solution. From the second day onwards, herbal sitz baths were administered twice daily in warm water (40 °C) for 10 to 15 min after defecation. Specialized proctology dressing changes were performed twice daily, supplemented with bedside infrared and microwave physiotherapy, until the patient was discharged. (4) Removal of postoperative drainage tube: The drainage tube placed in the abscess cavity postoperatively was gradually withdrawn daily, starting one week after surgery, based on the drainage condition, until it was completely removed. For the annular drainage tube, it was replaced with a rubber band drainage one week later. The rubber band drainage was changed from double to single strands after one week, depending on the secretion condition, and was completely removed after a few days. The principles for removing the rubber bands were as follows: from top to bottom (removing the upper abscess cavity drainage bands first and the lower ones last), and from outside to inside (removing the outermost abscess cavity drainage bands first and the innermost ones last).

Follow‑up

All patients underwent outpatient follow-up evaluations after discharge, during which the surgeon assessed wound healing, therapeutic efficacy, and anal function based on predefined primary and secondary outcome measures. During the first two months postoperatively, patients attended outpatient reviews twice a week. Follow-up assessments were conducted via telephone 6 months later and continued for a total of 12 months. Specialized examinations, such as transrectal ultrasound, perianal MRI, and anorectal manometry, were performed when necessary.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^736562b7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — Recommendation 12 (mild disease; dilute bleach baths): In patients with mild atopic dermatitis, the JTF panel suggests against adding dilute bleach baths to topical therapy (no dilute-bleach based) baths (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). The estimated treatment effect of dilute bleach baths for milder AD (eg, EASI of 10) was, on average, small (−2.2 points in comparison to a minimally important difference of 6.6). The guideline panel inferred that most well-informed patients with mild AD are likely to place a high value on maintaining a simple treatment routine that is minimally disruptive, and most fully informed patients are likely to value avoidance of the burdens of bleach baths and their uncertain harms over likely a small, possibly unimportant, benefit in AD severity, while acknowledging substantial variability in values such that a number of patients might opt for adjunctive dilute bleach baths even if disease activity is mild.

### Surgical outcomes of ligaSure hemorrhoidectomy in the elderly population: a retrospective cohort study [^18e0a049]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Postoperative management

The definition of the five postoperative complications in this study included: (1) Anal stenosis: patients have postoperative anal stenosis and cannot undergo anal digital examination and have symptoms such as difficulty in defecation and pain. (2) Delayed bleeding: unexpected bleeding occurs 24 h after the operation, and patients required emergency room or outpatient treatment. (3) Fecal impaction: the difficulty of postoperative defecation and patients need to excavate the feces through an enema or digital anus examination. (4) Urine retention: The difficulty of postoperative urination and require catheterization. (5) Wound infection: the wound has persistent redness, swelling, heat, and pain after the operation.

Postoperatively, all patients were prescribed oral metronidazole (250 mg four times daily) for 5 days and a bulk laxative (Normal 1 pk/day) for 2 weeks. Postoperatively, all patients were prescribed oral metronidazole (250 mg four times daily) for 5 days and a bulk laxative (Normal 1 pk/day) for 2 weeks. After the hemorrhoidectomy, oral metronidazole was used as it was previous revealed as a cheap, safe, and effective intervention for reducing postoperative pain referring. Oral diclofenac, 75 mg twice a day, was given for pain control. If patients could not tolerate the pain, morphine (5 mg IV per time) or ketoprofen (30 mg IM per time) was given as needed every 6 h. Patients were instructed to irrigate the anal wound with warm water or sitz baths three times a day, and after every bowel movement. The neomycin ointment was prescribed for topical uses. In the morning of each postoperative day during hospitalization, the patients were instructed to complete a subjective pain survey using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain). Patients were not discharged from the hospital until their pain was considered tolerably with oral analgesics, and there were no postoperative complications. After discharge, patients returned to the outpatient clinic at 2-week intervals for at least 3 visits. All the patients received follow-up at OPD for at least 6 weeks. The digital examination was performed to detect any possible stenosis. Patients were instructed to return to the clinic if any problems occurred in the future.

### "Why not bathe the baby today? ": a qualitative study of thermal care beliefs and practices in four African sites [^53366a28]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Perception of warmth

All respondent groups in all sites understood the need to keep newborns warm, especially if the weather was cold. This was linked to a belief that babies were used to the warmth in the womb and were fragile: 'When a baby was yet to be born the womb where he was was very hot, that is why if a baby is delivered he wants to be keep warm at all time' [42 year old Borno mother], and a belief that cold could cause illness 'Cold can make them have chest pain, the air goes inside the chest of the baby and makes the baby fail to breath properly' [35 year old Tanzanian mother]. Mothers and grandmothers described cold air entering the body rather than the baby losing body heat.

Respondents were asked how newborns were kept warm in their communities. Themes across the sites were dressing/wrapping the baby well and applying emollients to the skin. Other themes were: bathing the baby with warm water (all sites except Borno); putting the baby on the back (all sites except Ethiopia); delaying the first bath (Ethiopia and Tanzania only) and warming the house in general or during bathing (all sites except Tanzania):

'She puts heavy clothes, socks, hat and she warms oil… and rubs on the body of the baby… also she bathes the baby with warm water [28 year old Tanzanian mother]

'We set a fire in order to warm the room and bathe the baby near the fire. A house with a newborn should always stay warm' [25 year old Ethiopian mother]

During the bathing observations in Ethiopia, we observed that young babies were bathed inside very close to heavily smoking fires.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^3ff543f0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Health literacy — developing written materials for patients — Develop written materials, keep the messages simple, and limit the number of messages (the general guideline is four main messages). Focus on action with specific recommendations based on behavior (eg, "Take a warm-water bath two times a day"). Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, use familiar language and avoid jargon, and use visual aids, such as drawings or models, for key points. Use at least a 12-point type size to make the messages easy to read and leave plenty of white space around margins and between sections.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^f67b7f98]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis bathing practices and dilute bleach baths: Patients with AD have higher rates of skin surface colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, and research on dilute bleach baths is conflicting; dilute bleach baths appear safe and may be recommended as an adjunct because they are unlikely to cause harm, though further studies are needed. Bathing frequency guidance favors more frequent bathing, with daily baths commonly recommended by pediatric dermatologists; it is reasonable to recommend frequent, short baths with lukewarm water and gentle cleansers, and moisturizer application should occur immediately after the bath.

### "Why not bathe the baby today? ": a qualitative study of thermal care beliefs and practices in four African sites [^97b70635]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Many of the thermal care practices were suboptimal. Of particular note was the near universal early bathing of babies in both Nigerian sites, the length of time babies are left undressed during bathing in Ethiopia, and a common belief that bathing with warm water keeps the baby warm.

The link between delayed bathing and body odour later in life has been found in other West African countries but not in East Africa. Encouragingly, interventions in Asia have successfully changed bathing practices, but results from African trials have been less impressive. Given the regional nature of this deep-rooted belief in the importance of early bathing, behaviour change may be slower in West African countries and programme planners and implementers should be realistic about the time required for behaviour change interventions to have an effect.

Despite significant variation in contexts, we found similarities across sites in relation to understanding the importance of warmth, a lack of opportunities for skin to skin care, multiple baths in a day and negative views of the vernix. An understanding of the importance of newborn warmth has been found in other African studies, and makes the adoption of appropriate thermal care practices more likely. Skin to skin care was not practised in any of the study sites, even in facilities, and in most cases the baby was physically away from the mother immediately after birth. In Nigeria and Tanzania, respondents mentioned putting the baby on the back to keep them warm, suggesting an understanding that the warmth of the mother can pass to the baby. This understanding may facilitate the adoption of skin to skin care. Only one African study has explored mothers' actual experiences of skin-to-skin care and identified concerns around disease transmission, harm to the umbilicus, being dirty after birth, and the effect on maternal rest. Mothers liked having immediate access to the baby, feeling close and starting breastfeeding early. More research on the acceptability of skin to skin care is needed.

### Sauna bathing is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and improves risk prediction in men and women: a prospective cohort study [^7ae5ca72]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The current prospective study provides novel evidence that higher frequency and duration of sauna bathing may be related to a lower risk of CVD mortality in a representative population-based sample of female and male participants. In addition, the frequency of sauna bathing significantly improves the prediction and classification of the 10-year risk for CVD mortality beyond established cardiovascular risk factors. Our results extend previous evidence that sauna bathing may have cardiovascular benefits; however, further studies are still needed to confirm our findings in different populations and also assess the associations of sauna bathing habits with cause-specific cardiovascular events.

### Not as simple as it seems: extensive facility and training gaps in nursing home bathing [^bccae80c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

To evaluate whether complaints of being cold affected the quality of bathing, we stratified the likelihood of inadequate body site cleansing and inaccurate bathing procedures by whether the resident was cold (Table 1). Failing to clean specific body sites was not significantly different between the groups, with the exception that staff were less likely to wash the hair of residents who were cold (89.5% vs 64.3% not washed; P = 0.02). However, sufficiently warm water significantly improved adherence to bathing procedures (46.5% mean failure rate across procedural elements when water was warm versus 79.9% when water was cold). Nevertheless, errors in bathing procedures remained common even with adequate bathing temperatures.

The case is reported of a male track and field athlete with breathing difficulties at rest and during exercise, which were exacerbated in the supine position and during water immersion. Right hemidiaphragmatic paralysis was diagnosed. The cause of this relatively benign disorder is not known and there are no serious clinical implications. There is no treatment, but a continuation of exercise together with interventions to strengthen the subsidiary inspiratory muscles is recommended.

### Balneotherapy for osteoarthritis [^585d3846]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Balneotherapy (or spa therapy, mineral baths) for patients with arthritis is one of the oldest forms of therapy. One of the aims of balneotherapy is to soothe the pain and as a consequence to relieve patients' suffering and make them feel well. In this update we included one extra study.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of balneotherapy for patients with osteoarthritis (OA).

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases up to October 2006: EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane 'Rehabilitation and Related Therapies' Field database, PEDro, CENTRAL (Issue 3, 2006) and performed reference checking and communicated with authors to retrieve eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing balneotherapy with any intervention or no intervention. At least 90% of the patient population had to be diagnosed with OA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. Disagreements were solved by consensus. In the event of clinical heterogeneity or lack of data we refrained from statistical pooling.

Main Results

Seven trials (498 patients) were included in this review. Two studies compared spa-treatment with no treatment. One study evaluated baths as an add-on treatment to home exercises and another compared thermal water from Cserkeszölö with tap water (placebo). Three studies evaluated sulphur or Dead Sea baths with no treatment or mineral baths with tap water baths or no treatment. Only one of the trials performed an intention-to-treat analysis and two studies provided data to perform an intention-to-treat analysis ourselves. A 'quality of life' outcome was reported by one trial. We found: silver level evidence concerning the beneficial effects on pain, quality of life and analgesic intake of mineral baths compared to no treatment (SMD between 1.82 and 0.34). a statistically significant difference in pain and function of Dead Sea + sulphur versus no treatment, only at end of treatment (WMD 5.7, 95%CI 3.3 to 8.1), but not at 3 month follow-up (WMD 2.6, 95%CI -1.1 to 6.3). no statistically significant differences in pain or function at one or three months of Dead Sea baths versus no treatment (WMD 0.5, 95%CI -0.6 to 1.6) or at one or three months of sulphur baths versus no treatment (WMD 0.4, 95%CI -0.9 to 1.7). Adverse events were not measured in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

We found silver level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) concerning the beneficial effects of mineral baths compared to no treatment. Of all other balneological treatments no clear effects were found. However, the scientific evidence is weak because of the poor methodological quality and the absence of an adequate statistical analysis and data presentation. Therefore, the noted "positive findings" should be viewed with caution.

### Risks of infectious diseases in newborns exposed to alternative perinatal practices [^50e31172]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Delayed bathing in newborns — benefits and infection risk guidance: Delayed bathing may preserve the initial neonatal skin microbiome, and parents contemplating breastfeeding should be counseled that delaying the first bath is beneficial for successful and sustained efforts, and delayed bathing may have benefit in promoting initiation and exclusivity of breastfeeding. At this time, the only explicit AAP recommendation regarding bathing related to infectious risks is for infants exposed to HIV, and for these infants, the Red Book recommends that the child be bathed and cleaned of secretions as soon as possible after birth. Bathing should be initiated as soon as possible after delivery in cases in which newborn infants are exposed to active HSV genital lesions or when there is a known history of bloodborne pathogens (HIV, HBV, or hepatitis C virus), and delayed bathing in neonates exposed to active HSV genital lesions or with known history of HIV infection in the birth parent should be discouraged. Clinical assessment and management of an ill-appearing neonate does not change with regard to a history of delayed bathing.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy [^b6f6a0f7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Bath PUVA — dosing, comparative effectiveness, patient preference, and risks: Bath PUVA involves mixing a psoralen with the bathwater and soaking affected areas before treatment with UVA light. Bath PUVA is commonly administered as 0.5 to 1 mg/L of 8-MOP in water or 0.33 mg/L of TMP in water. Bath PUVA is as effective as oral PUVA in the treatment of psoriasis, although a recent systematic review concluded that bath PUVA is less effective than oral PUVA, with only 47% of patients obtaining PASI 75 compared with 73% of patients receiving oral PUVA. Bath PUVA tends to cause fewer adverse effects, such as erythema and nausea, there are fewer drug interactions, and it offers the added benefit of requiring a lower cumulative dose of UVA than oral PUVA to obtain clearance. In 1 survey of 99 patients, 55% of patients chose bath PUVA over oral PUVA. TMP, which is frequently used for bath PUVA in Europe, is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and thus cannot be utilized in the United States. No long-term studies on risk of photocarcinogenesis with bath PUVA have been reported; systemic psoralen absorption is minimal; and phototoxicity can occur, with the same restrictions as with oral PUVA regarding patients in whom treatment should be avoided or used with caution.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^8443b79b]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis sample action plan — patient instructions include bathing, topical therapy, wet wraps, and proactive care with key quantitative parameters: Bath daily in lukewarm water for up to 10–15 minutes using a gentle, fragrance-free soap or non-soap cleanser to soiled areas only, and clinicians may recommend bleach baths with dilution guidance of 1/2 cup of household bleach for every half bathtub full of water and frequency wording of "Please do bleach baths ___ times per week." After patting skin dry, apply prescription medications to active dermatitis followed by a cream or ointment-based moisturizer over the entire body, with site-specific medication lines for face/neck/armpits/groin and for the body. For severe flares, apply wet wraps after medications and moisturizer, soaking cotton pajamas (as close to 100% cotton as possible) in warm tap water, wringing out until damp, keeping warm during treatment, then removing after the recommended time and rubbing in residual topicals; vinegar dilution for dampening may be used at 1/8 cup vinegar to every 2 cups tap water. Repeat medications and moisturizer, with or without wet wraps, a second time during the day. For maintenance, continue daily baths and moisturization even when dermatitis is not active, and proactive treatment may include applying prescribed therapy on typical problem areas 2-3x per week before bed/after bathing even when skin is clear; restart prescription medications when eczema flares.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^8b390fdf]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Hypothermia first aid — showers and warm water immersion: People with simple cold stress were generally able to safely rewarm in a warm shower or warm water immersion, but in a single-patient experimental study of mild hypothermia with core temperature ≈36° C, warm bath rewarming was associated with transient core temperature drop, decreases in mean arterial pressure, and increases in heart rate and cardiac output; these effects can decrease perfusion and, in severe cases, cause arrhythmia, and attempting to manage a confused or less alert person with hypothermia in a shower or bathtub is potentially dangerous.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^03b876e4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — bathing and bleach baths: Data on bathing for adults with AD is minimal. A study comparing magnesium chloride ("dead sea salt") to tap water suggested that the additive may help reduce skin redness but patients did not have active dermatitis, thus limiting conclusions. Bleach baths may be helpful in infection prevention and bacterial colonization in AD but most studies are in children. In adults, one study of 10 patients with AD compared to 10 controls found bleach baths are well tolerated and safe without negative impact on stratum corneum hydration, transepidermal water loss, or pH after one 10-minute exposure. Another study comparing 18 patients receiving bleach baths twice weekly to 18 patients receiving distilled water baths twice weekly for 8 weeks reported a clinically significant within-group EASI reduction at 1 month (mean difference [MD]: 9.30 lower, P = 0.017) and a significant, but possibly not clinically meaningful, improvement versus placebo at 2 months (MD: 12.70 lower, 95% CI: 20.06 lower to 5.34 lower).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 195: prevention of infection after gynecologic procedures [^76c13be3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Preoperative bathing before abdominal surgery — Advise patients to shower or bathe (full body) with soap (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) or an antiseptic agent on at least the night before abdominal surgery. The 2017 CDC guidelines recommend a preoperative bath or shower and do not specify any particular soap or antiseptic and, citing a 2015 Cochrane review including seven randomized controlled trials, found no difference between agents (most frequently 4% chlorhexidine gluconate) and soap or placebo; a second meta-analysis showed no benefit of whole-body bathing with soap compared with placebo or no bathing. The CDC did not make recommendations regarding use of chlorhexidine, optimal timing of washing, or number of applications. Although the CDC guidelines and other major guidelines do not specifically recommend chlorhexidine, it is a reasonable choice based on limited evidence that suggests increased efficacy compared with soap or placebo, and one large study reported benefit with chlorhexidine (relative risk [RR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17–0.79) over no washing; in a 10-year prospective surveillance study, the surgical site infection rate was lower with preoperative hexachlorophene bathing than with no showering or a nonmedicated soap.
