## Question

What is it called when someone is hyperglycemic and hyponatremic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the condition is called when someone is hyperglycemic and hyponatremic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking hyperglycemia to low measured sodium. Then, I should verify the correct medical terminology used in guidelines and reviews. Next, I will distinguish this entity from pseudohyponatremia and other causes of hyponatremia. Finally, I will consider the clinical context and whether this reflects a hyperglycemic emergency like HHS or DKA, and I will double-check the sodium-correction formulas used in practice.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Hyperglycemia raises effective plasma osmolality, which draws water from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment, diluting serum sodium and producing a measured hyponatremia that does not reflect true sodium loss; this is a translocational or hypertonic hyponatremia rather than a sodium deficit, and it reverses as glucose normalizes [^111sjqQX] [^117H1HeX].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology. The condition is called hyperglycemic hyponatremia, or equivalently translocational hyponatremia, reflecting that the low sodium is due to osmotic water shifts rather than true hypotonic hyponatremia; guidelines explicitly instruct measuring serum glucose and correcting measured sodium for hyperglycemia to distinguish this from other etiologies [^113Mdnha] [^113g8d3Y] [^111sjqQX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should distinguish this from pseudohyponatremia. Pseudohyponatremia is a laboratory artifact from high paraprotein or triglycerides that falsely lowers sodium on certain assays; by contrast, hyperglycemic hyponatremia is a true physiologic dilutional effect and is not an artifact, though both can coexist and must be differentiated by measuring serum osmolality and using appropriate analytic methods [^113g8d3Y] [^111sjqQX].

> I need to check the clinical context. Hyperglycemic hyponatremia commonly accompanies hyperglycemic emergencies such as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and diabetic ketoacidosis, where marked hyperglycemia drives osmotic diuresis and dehydration; recognizing and correcting the measured sodium for glucose is essential to avoid misclassification and to guide safe rehydration and insulin therapy [^113Mdnha].

> Let me consider the correction formulas, and I should double-check the factors. The classic Katz correction adds 1.6 mEq/L for each 100 mg/dL rise in glucose above 100 mg/dL, but Hillier's data suggest a larger correction of about 2.4 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL when glucose is very high, reflecting nonlinear effects; many clinicians use 1.6 for moderate hyperglycemia and 2.4 for severe hyperglycemia, and calculators often present both approaches [^117H1HeX] [^113vZZey].

> In summary, I should confirm the answer clearly. The condition is called hyperglycemic hyponatremia, also described as translocational hyponatremia, which is a dilutional, hypertonic hyponatremia caused by osmotic water shifts from hyperglycemia; it is not pseudohyponatremia, and it requires glucose correction of measured sodium to assess true sodium status and guide management [^113Mdnha] [^111sjqQX] [^117H1HeX].

---

The condition is called **hyperglycemic hyponatremia** (also known as **translocational hyponatremia**), a dilutional hyponatremia caused by hyperglycemia driving water from intracellular to extracellular compartments, thereby lowering measured serum sodium [^111sjqQX] [^117H1HeX]. It is **not true sodium loss** and corrects as glucose normalizes. Clinicians should **calculate the corrected sodium** using standard formulas (typically add 1.6–2.4 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL glucose above 100 mg/dL) to assess true sodium status and guide management [^113Mdnha] [^117H1HeX]. This phenomenon is common in hyperglycemic emergencies such as DKA and HHS, and recognizing it prevents misclassification and inappropriate treatment [^113Mdnha] [^117UPrdD].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hyperglycemia increases plasma osmolality, drawing water from intracellular to extracellular compartments and diluting serum sodium, producing a **measured hyponatremia without true sodium loss** [^111sjqQX]. This is a **translocational effect** that reverses as glucose normalizes [^117H1HeX].

---

## Clinical significance

Hyperglycemic hyponatremia is common in **hyperglycemic emergencies** (DKA, HHS) and can be severe when glucose is markedly elevated [^113iRuC9] [^117XyrDZ]. It is a **marker of disease severity** and correlates with higher mortality and complications, including osmotic demyelination if sodium is overcorrected [^111fLWER] [^114XjLFG].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Confirm hyperglycemia**: Measure serum glucose and sodium simultaneously [^113Mdnha].
- **Calculate corrected sodium**: Use standard formulas (e.g. Katz: add 1.6 mEq/L per 100 mg/dL glucose > 100 mg/dL; Hillier: add 2.4 mEq/L for severe hyperglycemia) [^117H1HeX] [^114GTgKZ].
- **Exclude other causes**: Rule out pseudohyponatremia (hyperlipidemia, paraproteinemia) and true hyponatremia (SIADH, diuretics, adrenal insufficiency) [^113g8d3Y] [^111sjqQX].

---

## Management

- **Treat hyperglycemia**: Use insulin and fluids to correct glucose and osmolality; sodium will normalize as glucose falls [^113iRuC9] [^117XyrDZ].
- **Avoid rapid sodium correction**: Limit correction to ≤ 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination [^114mqwBU] [^11621z9d].
- **Monitor closely**: Track sodium, glucose, and osmolality during correction [^114vVwFU].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, severity of hyperglycemia, and comorbidities. Persistent or severe hyponatremia signals higher risk of complications and mortality, especially in critical illness or stroke [^111fLWER] [^117MLSXd].

---

Hyperglycemic hyponatremia is a **dilutional hyponatremia** from hyperglycemia; **correcting sodium for glucose** is essential to avoid misclassification and to guide safe management.

### Adjusting sodium levels in patients with hyperglycemia… [^114GTgKZ]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The effect of hyperglycemia is well known for its lowering of serum sodium levels. The most commonly used correction factor is a 1. 6 mEq per L decrease in serum sodium for every 100 mg per dL increase in glucose concentration. Hillier and associates challenged this correction factor in a study that monitored serum sodium levels in a group of otherwise healthy persons who were rendered acutely insulin deficient. Healthy young volunteers were eligible for the study if they had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus and were not taking any medications. After an overnight fast, baseline serum glucose and sodium levels were measured. Subsequently, somatostatin was infused to suppress insulin secretion, along with a solution of 20 percent dextrose to increase the glucose concentration to more than 600 mg per dL within one hour.

Once this glucose level was attained, the dextrose infusion was stopped and regular insulin was given until the glucose concentration was less than 140 mg per dL. Serum sodium and plasma glucose levels were measured three times in three subjects during induction of hyperglycemia. These measurements were obtained in all subjects every 10 minutes once the glucose infusion was stopped and their glucose levels had returned to normal. This factor is significantly greater than the conventional correction factor. However, the decrease in serum sodium did not actually appear to be a linear value, particularly in volunteers whose glucose concentration was greater than 440 mg per dL. At this level, the slope was about −4. 0, but it dropped to −1. 6 when glucose concentration dropped below 440 mg per dL.

The authors conclude that the conventional correction factor used to correct serum sodium in patients with hyperglycemia is inaccurate and leads to serious underestimation of serum sodium values in association with glucose levels higher than 500 mg per dL. Therefore, the authors recommend using 2. 4 as the correction factor to prevent such underestimations, particularly in patients with severe hyperglycemia who require more of a correction.

### Diagnosis and management of the critically ill adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^115Fcj6U]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is important for emergency physicians to be aware of this unique diagnosis and treatment considerations.

Objective

This manuscript reviews the emergency department evaluation and management of the adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

Discussion

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is diagnosed by an elevated glucose, elevated serum osmolality, minimal or absent ketones, and a neurologic abnormality, most commonly altered mental status. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. It is important to monitor these patients closely to avoid overcorrection of osmolality, sodium, and other electrolytes. These patients are critically ill and generally require admission to an intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### Hyponatremia is associated with unfavorable outcomes after reperfusion treatment in acute ischemic stroke [^117MLSXd]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we found that patients who were both hyponatremic and hyperglycemic had the highest risk of a worse mRS at 3 months. Hyperglycemia has been shown to promote downstream microvascular thromboinflammation and decreased fibrinolytic ability of alteplase. Combined with the deleterious effects of hyponatremia, this may synergistically diminish the likelihood of achieving good outcomes after reperfusion therapy.

Based on the available data, it is difficult to ascertain the etiology of hyponatremia, which would require information on urinary osmolality and sodium. Similarly, we cannot determine whether hyponatremia was acute or chronic. Acute hyponatremia may occur as a result of increased vasopressin secretion secondary to acute stroke, although it is also conceivable that many patients had preexisting chronic hyponatremia due to comorbidities or medication. For example, chronic hyponatremia may have been caused by thiazide diuretics, which were more commonly used by the hyponatremic patients in this study.

Strengths of the present study include the large, diverse cohort of patients treated with IVT, EVT, or both in a real‐world setting, which enhances the generalizability of our findings. Another strength is the availability of corresponding CTP data in a subset of the patients, which allowed quantification of core and penumbra volumes to identify a radiological substrate for the clinical findings. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the relationship of hyponatremia with CTP‐derived ischemic core and penumbra volumes. We also performed sensitivity analyses based on glucose‐corrected plasma sodium in addition to the main analysis, which controlled for hyperglycemia. The results of these analyses corroborate an effect of hyponatremia independent of hyperglycemia.

Our study also has a number of limitations. First, mRS scores at 3 months were missing in 16.6% of the patients. Because loss to follow‐up was similar in patients with and without hyponatremia, and there were no differences in discharge destination, we believe that the missing data did not introduce bias. Second, lack of statistical power in the subgroup analyses may have prevented us from detecting a significant association with infrequent complications such as symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Third, due to the lack of repeated plasma sodium measurements, it remains unknown whether hyponatremia was transient or persisted throughout hospitalization.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis / hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^116dCz1V]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Based on the reduction of serum sodium concentration ([Na +]), mild hyponatremia (serum [Na +] between 130 and 135 mEq/L) occurs in about 20% of patients, and moderate/severe hyponatremia (serum [Na +] < 130 mEq/L) is found in up to 7% of patients. Such a frequent occurrence is not surprising, if the different pathological conditions that can be associated with this electrolyte alteration are considered. Admittedly, hyponatremia encompasses a broad spectrum of different situations encountered in clinical practice. Essentially, hyponatremia covers every field of medicine.

According to serum osmolality, hyponatremia can be divided into hypotonic and non-hypotonic forms. Non-hypotonic hyponatremias include hypertonic hyponatremia, also defined as translational hyponatremia, isotonic hyponatremia, and pseudohyponatremia. Hypertonic hyponatremia is the result of a shift of water from cells into the extracellular fluid. In case of hyperglycemia, for instance, this shift is driven by the accumulation of glucose into the extracellular compartment. Isotonic hyponatremia may occur as a consequence of the retention of isotonic fluids that do not contain sodium into the extracellular space. This situation may be secondary to the infusion of large volumes of isotonic fluids during uro/gynecological surgery. Finally, pseudohyponatremia is the result of a laboratory artifact that occurs in the presence of severe hypertriglyceridemia or paraproteinemia, when serum [Na +] is measured by flame photometry. Hypotonic hyponatremia, also indicated as dilutional hyponatremia, is characterized by an excess of water in relation to sodium. This situation is most often due to impaired renal excretion of water and less frequently to an excess of water intake in a short period of time (i.e. water intoxication). Patients, in which hyponatremia is a consequence of impaired renal excretion of water, can be divided into three categories, according to the extracellular fluid volume (EFV), which can be reduced, normal or increased (Fig. 1). To address EFV instead of volemia appears more appropriate to describe different forms of hyponatremia, because the former includes both the circulating volume and the interstitial fluids. Therefore, in this review the terms hyponatremia with reduced, normal or increased EFV will be used instead of the most commonly used hypovolemic, normovolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Diabetes prevalence and outcomes in hospitalized cardiorenal-syndrome patients with and without hyponatremia [^117PLCKN]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), defined as concurrent acute or chronic heart failure (CHF) and acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), is associated with a poor prognosis as the presence of renal disease is a stronger predictor for death CHF patients than the degree of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In CHF patients, an AKI is a leading cause for an acute decompensation. The term acute "renocardiac" syndrome acknowledges this pathophysiology. A more practical definition differentiates between a severe and a stable, chronic CRS, regardless of the pathophysiology. Animal models of CRS demonstrated the bidirectional nature, where the failure of the one organ system adversely affects the function of the other. The consideration of hypo- and hypervolemic states may further differentiate CRS on clinical grounds.

Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is released from the posterior pituitary gland upon changes in osmolality and neurally via baroreceptor-mediated activation due to intraarterial hypovolemia or arterial hypotension, thus representing an adaptive mechanism in CHF. AVP acts on vascular smooth muscle cells via vasopressin 1A receptors and on renal collecting-duct cells via vasopressin 2 receptors. In CHF, AVP release occurs in a linear fashion to the functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. On the flip side, an inappropriate release of AVP may lead to a dilutional hyponatremia and to a deleterious outcome in CHF. Conversely, hypovolemia, e.g. due to diuretic medication, may lead to hypotension as a trigger for an appropriate non-osmotic AVP release, possibly leading to a dilutional hyponatremia as well. Except for sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors in type-2 diabetes patients and in patients with heart failure with reduced LVEF, the use of diuretics has not reduced mortality in CHF. Counter-regulators of hypovolemia such as an appropriate AVP release and a sympathetic-nervous-system activation may account for this lack of benefit.

In the present study, possible contributing factors for hyponatremia such as presence of hypovolemia, use of diuretics, sodium deficiency and hyperglycemia were obtained from patient records. Furthermore, the prevalence of hypoglycemia on admission in the diabetics among CRS patients was also analyzed. This is because hypoglycemia has been found to be linked to excess mortality in cardiovascular outcome studies, and a poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus is usually characterized by post-hypoglycemic hyperglycemic episodes, which, in turn, may depress serum sodium. As a correlate to the fact that hyponatremic CHF patients have a poorer outcome, we hypothesized that hyponatremia in CRS worsens patient outcome.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114XjLFG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent Revival of the Controversy

Support for the idea that osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely rare was provided by uncritical acceptance of the results of a recent, large retrospective study; the investigators concluded that myelinolysis affects only 0.05% of patients with hyponatremia and is unrelated to rapid correction (defined as an increase of > 8 mmol/L per day). However, nearly 90% of the patients studied had a sodium > 120 mmol/L, and others may have had acute hyponatremia due to self-induced water intoxication or exacerbation of hyponatremia by hyperglycemia. Although the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome in such patients is known to be vanishingly low, the study weighed the benefits of a therapeutic limit that was intended for patients whose risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome was unusually high.

Adherence to an 8-mmol/L daily correction limit in patients with a serum sodium > 120 mmol/L would reflect an abundance of caution; but, predictably, if that limit was marginally exceeded, very few patients would be harmed. Notwithstanding, myelinolysis was documented in 2.6% of patients in a subset of the study's population with a sodium < 110 mmol/L, a population that has been shown to be at higher risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome when rapidly corrected. But even that figure likely underestimates the true prevalence of osmotic demyelination syndrome among such patients because of the method used to identify patients with the disorder. To identify patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome, this study relied on diagnostic coding of medical records and neuroimaging reports during the index hyponatremia admission and during readmissions within 7 days. However, as discussed above, osmotic demyelination syndrome is a clinical, not a radiologic, diagnosis, with varying severity. Symptoms of osmotic demyelination syndrome are delayed, often leading to readmission more than a week after discharge, if at all. Lesions consistent with osmotic demyelination syndrome are seldom evident on MRI at the onset of symptoms and may not become positive for weeks, if at all.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

Statistical analyses

Baseline characteristics were compared between hyponatremic and nonhyponatremic patients on admission. Normally distributed continuous data are presented as mean ± SD and nonparametric data as median with interquartile range (IQR). Categorical data were analyzed with the chi‐squared test and continuous nonparametric data with the Mann–Whitney U ‐test. The primary outcome measure was the adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for a shift toward a worse mRS at 3 months, estimated with a generalized multivariable ordinal regression/partial proportional model. The secondary outcomes were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression and reported as adjusted odds ratio (aOR). The multivariable model included age, sex, CCI, prestroke ADL dependency, NIHSS on admission, and history of hypertension. Hyperglycemia was added to the second model, because previous studies reported that admission hyperglycemia is a risk factor for poor outcomes after reperfusion therapy. Because high glucose levels can induce translocational (hypertonic) hyponatremia, we also performed a sensitivity analysis with hyponatremia based on glucose‐corrected plasma sodium. In the case of hyperglycemia, the corresponding plasma sodium was corrected for the blood glucose value using the Katz formula. We also performed a sensitivity analysis excluding patients who presented with hypernatremia (plasma sodium > 145 mmol/L). Furthermore, we performed a predefined subgroup analysis excluding patients treated in the late window (> 4.5 h for IVT and > 6 h for EVT). We also performed a predefined stratification analysis according to reperfusion therapy: IVT versus EVT(+IVT). The EVT(+IVT) group included patients who were treated with EVT only and those who were treated with both IVT and EVT. The association between hyponatremia and CTP‐derived parameters was analyzed with univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses. The multivariable model included age, sex, NIHSS on admission, and hyperglycemia. Multicollinearity in all multivariable models was ruled out. Missingness for all covariates was ≤ 2%, except for mRS at 3 months (16.6%) and onset‐to‐treatment time (2.8%). Missing values were not imputed. All tests were two‐sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28.01.1, with the exception of the generalized ordered logistic regression analyses, which were performed with Stata SE version 17.0.

### Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113vZZey]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

When blood glucose exceeded 10 mmol/L on presentation, serum sodium concentration was corrected for hyperglycemia. For glucose values between 10 and 22.1 mmol/L or greater than or equal to 22.2 mmol/L, we used a correction factor of 1.6 or 2.4 mmol/L, respectively, decrease in sodium concentration per 5.6 mmol/L increase in glucose value above 10 mmol/L. Serum sodium was measured on days 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18 to determine changes to sodium status longitudinally. Accordingly, serum sodium status was stratified into 3 categories: 135 to 145 mmol/L, normal as per the laboratory reference ranges; less than 135 mmol/L (hyponatremia); and greater than 145 mmol/L (hypernatremia). Hyponatremia was further classified into mild (130–134 mmol/L) and moderate to severe (< 130 mmol/L).

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prior to admission was defined as the most recent estimated glomerular filtration rate within 12 months preadmission at less than 60 mL/min. A diagnosis of chronic hyponatremia was established if the last sodium value within 12 months preadmission was less than 135 mmol/L. AKI was diagnosed and classified based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definitions using the peak creatinine during hospitalization and last creatinine value preadmission. The etiology of hyponatremia was ascertained through the results of laboratory investigations, including serum osmolality, spot urinary osmolality and sodium, serum cortisol, and thyrotropin. In the absence of those data, plasma urea was used to discriminate euvolemic from hypovolemic hyponatremia since a plasma urea value greater than 5 mmol/L has a predictive power of 80% for hypovolemic hyponatremia, whereas urea less than 5 mmol/L indicates euvolemic hyponatremia in 80% of patients.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111sjqQX]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), previously known as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, is a disorder of sodium and water balance characterized by "inappropriate" (ie, nonosmotic) retention of water. The first published cases of SIAD were 2 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with hyponatremia, yet ongoing renal sodium loss, described by Schwartz et al in 1957. Through careful observation of sodium and water intake and urine output, they attributed this syndrome to sustained, inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The diagnostic criteria for SIAD later published by the same authors in 1967 have remained remarkably current (Table 1).

Table 1.
Criteria for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate diuresis

Over the decades since, understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and complications of SIAD has progressed. Substantial advances have been made in understanding the principles of management of acute severe hyponatremia that have led to improvements in immediate mortality. A small but growing number of randomized trials have been conducted to inform management protocols. This review seeks to summarize the current understanding of SIAD, examine the evidence base informing current guidelines, and to appraise important studies conducted more recently. We aim to synthesize the literature to derive practical and clinically relevant management principles to aid the understanding of clinicians and researchers, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

While one of the key characteristics of SIAD is low serum osmolality, it is more precisely referred to as low effective osmolality or tonicity. "Effective" osmolytes (eg, sodium, glucose, potassium, organic osmolytes) do not cross the cell membrane freely, so they have the capacity to create osmotic forces to influence the movement of water across cell membranes. In contrast, "ineffective" osmolytes (eg, ethanol, urea) freely cross cell membranes and therefore do not cause water shifts.

In hypotonic hyponatremia the low serum sodium concentration is primarily due to a relative excess of circulating free water, with or without a sodium deficit. Nonhypotonic hyponatremia can either be measured due to a method-dependent laboratory artifact, in which case it is termed pseudohyponatremia, or can be caused by excess of an effective osmolyte in the circulation (eg, hyperglycemia), in which case it is termed translocational hyponatremia (Fig. 1).

### Hyperglycemia-induced hyponatremia – calculation of expected serum sodium depression [^117H1HeX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1973). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia" for hypernatremia, hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, diabetic nephropathy and in-hospital hyperglycemia.

The Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia calculator adjusts the measured serum sodium levels to account for hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia causes a dilutional hyponatremia due to the osmotic effect of glucose, pulling water from intracellular to extracellular compartments. This correction is vital for accurately assessing a patient's sodium status in the presence of elevated blood glucose levels.

The Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia calculator takes inputs of measured sodium and blood glucose levels to compute corrected sodium levels using three different formulas: Katz, Hillier, and Adrogué-Madias. These corrections are necessary because hyperglycemia can lead to artificially low sodium measurements, and adjusting for this helps in more accurate clinical assessments.

Inputs:

1. **Measured Sodium**: This is the serum sodium level provided by the user, which can be in units of mEq/L or mmol/L. The acceptable range is 100 to 180 for both units.
2. **Blood Glucose**: The glucose level provided by the user, which can be in units of mg/dL or mmol/L. The acceptable range is 70 to 1000 mg/dL or 3.9 to 55.5 mmol/L.

Computation:

1. If the blood glucose input is in mmol/L, it needs to be converted to mg/dL using the conversion factor (1 mmol/L = 18.02 mg/dL).
2. The calculator applies the following formulas to compute corrected sodium levels:

- **Corrected Sodium (Katz)**: `measuredSodium + 0.016 * (glucose - 100)`
- **Corrected Sodium (Hillier)**: `measuredSodium + 0.024 * (glucose - 100)`
- **Corrected Sodium (Adrogué-Madias)**: `measuredSodium + 0.02 * (glucose - 100)`

3. Each of these corrected sodium values is rounded to the nearest integer to provide a precise reading in units of mEq/L.

Outputs:

1. **Corrected Sodium (Katz)**: The adjusted sodium level using the Katz formula, rounded to the nearest integer, within the range of 100 to 200 mEq/L.
2. **Corrected Sodium (Hillier)**: The adjusted sodium level using the Hillier formula, also rounded, within the range of 100 to 200 mEq/L.
3. **Corrected Sodium (Adrogué-Madias)**: The adjusted sodium level using the Adrogué-Madias formula, rounded similarly, within the range of 100 to 200 mEq/L.

Interpretation:
The different formulas account for varying perspectives on how hyperglycemia affects sodium levels. The Katz correction typically provides a more conservative correction, while the Hillier correction is more aggressive. The Adrogué-Madias correction falls between the two. Clinicians can interpret these corrected sodium values to assess the severity of hypernatremia in hyperglycemic patients more accurately, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^1118o3e1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Adult patients with a first-time seizure who have returned to baseline — laboratory evaluation is primarily guided by history and physical examination, and the literature suggests that laboratory testing is of very low yield in patients with a new-onset seizure who have returned to baseline. The history and physical examination will predict the majority of patients who will have a laboratory abnormality, and patients with altered mental status, fever, or a new local neurologic deficit require more extensive evaluation. Glucose abnormalities and hyponatremia are the most frequent abnormalities identified and are usually predicted by the history and physical examination. In 1 prospective study of 163 patients, 1 unexpected case of hypoglycemia was discovered, and in a prospective study of 136 patients, Turnbull et al found 4 cases of hypoglycemia and 4 cases of hyperglycemia. Two of the cases of hypoglycemia were not suspected on the basis of the history and physical examination. The diagnosis of an alcohol withdrawal seizure should be a diagnosis of exclusion, especially in patients presenting with a first-time seizure.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117PhQQY]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Another alternative therapy for acute severe hyponatremia that is not in wide use, and that we do not recommend, is the use of more highly concentrated sodium chloride (eg, 23.4% or 29.2% NaCl) via central venous access. This therapy has been investigated as an alternative treatment to mannitol to raise plasma tonicity in traumatic brain injury to reduce cerebral herniation. There are no quality data in hyponatremia to support its use, especially when considering the expected higher risks of overcorrection, and the potential adverse sequelae of extravasation with these formulations.

Treating the potentially reversible neurotoxicity of severe hyponatremia may help clarify its contribution to clinical symptomatology (eg, altered conscious state) in sick patients with multiple potential causes for their symptoms. If symptoms do not improve with the modest pNa increments suggested earlier, alternative or additional causes should be sought.

Confirming a Diagnosis of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

Review of history, medications, and clinical examination can all assist in determining the cause of hyponatremia (see Fig. 8). There are many potential causes of hyponatremia, and SIAD is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Evaluation of urine and serum osmolality and sodium concentrations are some of the most useful investigations in establishing whether the diagnostic criteria for SIAD are met, alongside clinical assessment of volume status (see Table 1).

Measurement of serum osmolality aids in excluding nonhypotonic causes of hyponatremia, such as pseudohyponatremia (due to raised lipids or protein) or translocational hyponatremia (due to raised glucose, or exogenous effective osmolytes, eg, mannitol) (see "Introduction"). For this reason, it is useful to obtain serum glucose and lipid profile in most patients to ensure accurate sodium assessment.

If the glucose is raised, the anticipated serum sodium concentration can be calculated according to the formula from Hillier et al (see Fig. 2). This formula adds 2.4 mmol/L to the measured serum sodium concentration for every 5.5-mmol/L (100 mg/dL) incremental rise in serum glucose, to give the anticipated serum sodium concentration if the hyperglycemia was corrected. This is necessary only for significantly raised glucose concentrations, as for glucose levels below 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) this amounts to correction of pNa by 1 mmol/L or less.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^1113fNgY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Suspicion

Patients who have symptoms of polyuria, nocturia, or polydipsia are candidates for further evaluation of a possible arginine vasopressin-related polyuria (AVP-D or AVP-R). However, before embarking on more complex pathways of investigation, it is important to exclude common causes of polyuria and polydipsia, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Certain scenarios are suggestive of a solute diuresis, for example uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high protein intake from parenteral or enteral feeding, tissue catabolism from high-dose glucocorticoids, resolving kidney injury including relief of urinary obstruction, use of diuretics and SGLT-2 inhibitors, administration of mannitol or high volumes of isotonic NaCl. The presence of nocturia without daytime polyuria suggests nocturnal polyuria (production of 20%-33% of total urine volume during sleep). In the absence of such obvious causes of symptomatic polyuria, possible AVP-related disorders should be evaluated. The first step is measurement of plasma osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration. Although these are within normal ranges in most patients with polyuria due to the ability of thirst and renal water excretion to maintain osmotic homeostasis, hypernatremia strongly suggests AVP-D or AVP-R, and hyponatremia strongly suggests PP as the most likely causes of polyuria. If the plasma osmolality and serum sodium are normal, the next step is confirming the presence of hypotonic polyuria. Because patients' estimations of both fluid intake and urine output are not always reliable, this should be assessed via measurement of a 24-hour urine. It is notable that there is no universally accepted definition of polyuria. Past studies have used an absolute urine volume (eg, ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m²/24 hours in children), and others have used a weight-based urine volume (eg, > 40 mL/kg/24 hours or > 50 mL/kg/24 hours). Consequently, clinical judgment and experience should be used to identify patients requiring further evaluation, but the least stringent criteria would be either a urine volume ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m²/24 hours in children, or > 40 mL/kg/24 hours. If these minimal criteria are not met, the patient should undergo urological evaluation for causes of increased urine frequency or nocturnal polyuria. Once polyuria is established, the second step is to confirm hypotonicity via measurement of osmolality in the 24 hours urine sample. A urine osmolality ≤ 300 mOsm/kg H₂O confirms a hypotonic urine, and a urine osmolality ≥ 800 mOsm/kg H₂O indicates a solute diuresis (due to glucose, sodium, urea, or administered diuretics such as mannitol). Urine osmolalities between 300 and 800 mOsm/kg H₂O can be seen with partial AVP-D or AVP-R, so in such cases further evaluation is necessary. Once hypotonic polyuria is confirmed, additional testing is necessary to identify the cause (Table 1).

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^111xGoif]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

Table 2.
Prevalence of hyponatremia — summary of key studies in adults

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands of nearly 3000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250 000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%. An outlying US study of nearly 200 000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring 2 sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L. There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia — for example, following pituitary surgery, where a meta-analysis showed 5.6% cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies do seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia such as increased serum lipids or proteins, or erroneous results from hemolyzed or contaminated blood samples, are not specifically excluded.

### Diabetes prevalence and outcomes in hospitalized cardiorenal-syndrome patients with and without hyponatremia [^115jApq5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and causes of hyponatremia in CRS patients

On admission, 34.4% of CRS patients presented with hyponatremia. Among them, 9 (3.4%) patients had a severe, 22 (8.4%) patients a moderate, and 59 (22.5%) patients a mild hyponatremia on admission. In 7 (2.7%) non-hyponatremic CRS patients, a hypernatremia (maximum Na: 150 mmol/L) was found. As Fig. 2 demonstrates, hyponatremia correlated with serum osmolality in terms of a hyposmolar hyponatremia. A reduced urinary-sodium concentration (< 30 mmol/L) was found in 5 (5.6%) patients of the hyponatremic cohort versus 6 (3.5%) patients of the non-hyponatremic cohort. Likewise, collecting urine measurements showed a reduced urinary sodium excretion of less than 100 mmol/d (equaling 6 g/d sodium chloride) in 13 or 14.4% of hyponatremic versus 14 or 8.1% of non-hyponatremic CRS patients. As a contrasting finding, urinary sodium wasting (sodium excretion of > 300 mmol/d or > 18 g/d sodium chloride) was seen more often in the hyponatremia (26%) than in the non-hyponatremia cohort (13%).

Fig. 2
Group-wise display of calculated serum osmolality on admission according to presence or absence of mild (Na < 135 mmol/L, Na ≥ 130 mmol/L) or moderate-to-severe (Na < 130 mmol/L) hyponatremia. The following formula was used: serum osmolality = 2 × Na (mmol/L) + Urea (mmol/L) + Glucose (mmol/L). Numbers indicate the available calculated results per group

Hypovolemia was more frequently encountered in hyponatremic than in non-hyponatremic CRS patients (Fig. 3). Thee prevalence of diarrhea, the number of prescribed diuretic drug classes and, if applicable, the dosages of hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide were the possible underlying reasons accounting for the observations made. (Table 1). Diarrhea on admission was more frequently present in CRS patients both with mild (9 of 59 or 15.3%) and moderate-to-severe hyponatremia (7 of 31 or 22.6%) than in non-hyponatremic ones (9 of 172 or 5.2%, p = 0.0025).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111zz2s4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical hyperglycemia — prehospital management directs providers to provide volume expansion with normal saline bolus; adult dosing is normal saline 20 mL/kg at rate of 1000 mL/hr, and pediatric dosing is normal saline 10 mL/kg bolus IV, reassess, and repeat up to 40 mL/kg total; if symptoms of hypovolemic shock, follow Shock Guideline. If findings of hyperkalemia are present, administer IV fluids and consider administration of calcium chloride 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes (do not exceed 1 mL per minute) OR calcium gluconate 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring. If findings of hyperkalemia, consider administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes and consider albuterol 5 mg via nebulizer (can be repeated if no response is seen). Reassess patient status, including vital signs, mental status, and signs of dehydration, and if mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate treatment if hypoglycemia has developed. Disposition guidance is to transport to closest appropriate receiving facility. Patient safety notes state that overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia, and that cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults; closely monitor for signs of altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure, immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop; asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics

A total of 726 patients underwent IVT and/or EVT, of whom 680 patients met the inclusion criteria (Figure S1). Four hundred thirty patients were treated with IVT (63%), 120 patients (18%) were treated with EVT, and 130 patients (19%) were treated with both IVT and EVT. The median admission plasma sodium was 139 mmol/L (IQR = 137–141 mmol/L; Figure S1). Ninety‐two patients (14%) were hyponatremic. The majority of the hyponatremic patients (90%) had mild hyponatremia (130–135 mmol/L). Patients with hyponatremia were older and had a higher CCI than patients without hyponatremia (Table 1). In addition, patients with hyponatremia more often were hyperglycemic, more often had a history of hypertension, and more often used diuretics including thiazides. The onset‐to‐treatment time and proportion of patients treated in the late window were similar between patients with and without hyponatremia.

### Prevalence of hyponatremia and association with mortality: results from NHANES [^1123KjGH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients and is associated with adverse outcomes, but its prevalence and significance in the general US population is unknown. Our aims were to determine the prevalence of hyponatremia and its association with mortality in the population.

Methods

We performed a population-based, cross-sectional study of 14,697 adults aged ≥ 18 years who participated in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 1999–2004. By using measurements of serum sodium corrected for dilutional effect of hyperglycemia, we determined the association of hyponatremia with patient characteristics, comorbidities, and prescription medications, and performed unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression to find the association of hyponatremia with all-cause mortality.

Results

We provide the first estimate of the prevalence of hyponatremia in the US population, which in our weighted analysis was 1.72%. Prevalence of hyponatremia was significantly higher in women (2.09%, P = 0.004) and increased with age. Hyponatremia was more common in subjects with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and psychiatric disorders, and less common in those with no comorbidities (1.04%, P < .001). There was a significant risk of death associated with hyponatremia in unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR], 3.61; P < .001) and adjusted Cox models controlling for demographics, smoking, comorbidities, and insurance status (HR, 2.43; P < .001). There was a U-shaped relationship between serum sodium and HR for mortality.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that hyponatremia is a predictor of mortality in the general population independently of age, gender, and comorbid conditions.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^111ek5VT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

5.4 Hyponatremia

XPOVIO can cause severe or life-threatening hyponatremia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 100 mg once weekly (BOSTON, n = 195), hyponatremia was reported in 58% of patients and Grade 3–4 hyponatremia was reported in 14% of patients. The median time to first onset was 21 days for any grade hyponatremia and the median time to first onset for Grade 3 or 4 hyponatremia was 22 days.

In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 80 mg twice weekly (STORM, n = 202), hyponatremia was reported as an adverse reaction in 39% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 hyponatremia was reported in 22% of patients. The median time to onset of the first event was 8 days.

In patients with DLBCL (SADAL, n = 134), hyponatremia developed in 62% of patients and Grade 3 hyponatremia developed in 16% of patients treated with XPOVIO. In approximately 63% of cases, hyponatremia occurred in the context of gastrointestinal toxicity such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and anorexia.

Monitor sodium level at baseline and throughout treatment. Monitor more frequently during the first two months of treatment. Correct sodium levels for concurrent hyperglycemia (serum glucose > 150 mg/dL) and high serum paraprotein levels. Assess hydration status and manage hyponatremia per clinical guidelines, including intravenous saline and/or salt tablets as appropriate and dietary review. Interrupt, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of the adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Evaluation of hyperglycaemic emergency admissions to a major tertiary centre over a two-year period [^116Stmmd]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyper‐glycaemic state (HHS) and mixed presentations are diabetes emergencies. We performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment approaches and outcomes of participants requiring inpatient management for DKA and/or HHS at Prince of Wales Hospital, a tertiary facility in Sydney, Australia, between May 2022 and April 2024.

Definitions of HHS and DKA based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus report were used. Individuals with combined DKA and HHS had to meet both DKA and HHS criteria. We extracted demographic data from each participant during the index hospitalisation, the type of treatment protocol used (DKA, HHS) alongside the outcome and complications of treatment. Outcomes and complications of treatment included the presence of electrolyte derangements (corrected hyponatremia, hypokalaemia), hypoglycaemia, intensive care unit admission, length of stay and mortality. The SPSS statistics software (version 24.0; IBM) was used to undertake all statistical analyses. Independent sample t‐tests were undertaken for continuous data and Pearson's chi‐squared tests for categorical data. Adjustment for multiple comparisons were not undertaken. p < 0.05 defined statistical significance.

Characteristics on individuals with mixed DKA/HHS treated with either the DKA or HHS protocol.

TABLE 2
Comparison between participants who were admitted into HDU/ICU vs. those who were admitted directly onto the wards. [Correction added on 20 May 2025 after first online publication: In the first column of the hypokalaemia row, the numbers have been updated.]

Our study has several limitations. As it was conducted at a single tertiary hospital with a small cohort, the findings may not be extrapolated to all participants. Additionally, we only reviewed participants who presented through the Emergency Department and were admitted under Endocrinology. Although it is unlikely, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some participants with hyperglycaemic emergencies were admitted under a different specialty.

In conclusion, in a small cohort of mixed DKA/HHS participants, treatment with either the HHS or DKA protocol did not result in substantially different outcomes. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia are common complications in all subtypes of hyperglycaemic emergencies, and enhanced recognition is necessary to prevent these issues. Larger studies, informed by the more recent 2024 ADA guidelines, are required to determine the optimal IV insulin infusion regimens for participants presenting with mixed DKA/HHS.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^117XyrDZ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is an underrecognized diabetic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Many features of HHS overlap with those of diabetic ketoacidosis but key differentiators for HHS are serum osmolality greater than 320 mOsm/kg, lack of metabolic acidosis, and minimal to no presence of ketones. HHS is often triggered by an underlying illness-most commonly infection but may also be triggered by stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and other acute illnesses. Treatment guidelines recommend aggressive volume-repletion of osmotic losses in addition to insulin therapy, plus treatment of the underlying cause.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Osmolar gap hyponatremia in critically ill patients: evidence for the sick cell syndrome? [^1125UdmX]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Accumulation of nondiffusible solutes in plasma leads to redistribution hyponatremia with an increased osmolar gap (i.e., the difference between measured and calculated osmolality). In critically ill patients, intracellular solutes may leak out of the cell because of an increased membrane permeability and may lead to redistribution hyponatremia with increased osmolar gap, a concept called the "sick cell syndrome". The aims of this prospective study were to determine whether an increased osmolar gap related to endogenous solutes accumulation was present in intensive care patients with true hyponatremia and to identify the solutes accounting for this increased osmolar gap.

Setting

A 14-bed medical intensive care unit in an 821-bed university hospital.

Design

A 20-wk prospective observational study.

Patients

Fifty-five consecutive patients with a measured plasma sodium concentration ≤ 130 mmol/L (mean ± sd, 126 ± 6 mmol/L) were automatically identified by the Biochemistry Department. Patients were excluded in the case of reduced plasma water content resulting from hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, in the case of hyperglycemia, or if exogenous compounds known to increase the osmolar gap were present.

Interventions

Plasma osmolar gap was calculated.

Measurements and Main Results

Plasma osmolar gap was considered significant if > 10 mosm/kg. Total plasma amino acid concentration also was measured. Organ dysfunctions were assessed with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Thirty of the 55 patients (54%) had an osmolar gap > 10 mosm/kg (17.2 ± 7.1 mosm/kg). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was significantly higher in the osmolar gap patients (6.4 ± 3.2 vs. 4.5 ± 2.0; p = .015). No difference of amino acids concentration was observed between osmolar gap and non-osmolar gap patients, and no correlation was observed between osmolar gap and amino acid concentration. Accumulation of ketone bodies and lactic acid was also unlikely. During correction of hyponatremia in osmolar gap patients, a significant decrease of plasma osmolar gap was observed and a statistically significant inverse relationship was demonstrated between osmolar gap decrease and plasma sodium concentration increase.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia with increased osmolar gap related to endogenous solutes accumulation is observed frequently in hyponatremic intensive care patients, especially in patients with the most severe organ dysfunctions. The nature of the endogenous solutes accounting for the increased osmolar gap remains to be determined. Simultaneous correction of sodium and osmolar gap suggests a causal link between increased osmolar gap and hyponatremia and may support the concept of sick cell syndrome.

Although there are multiple precipitating causes, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, nonadherence to therapy, undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. In children and adolescents, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is often present when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. Physical findings include profound dehydration and neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma. Treatment begins with intensive monitoring of the patient and laboratory values, especially glucose, sodium, and potassium levels. Vigorous correction of dehydration is critical, requiring an average of 9 L of 0.9% saline over 48 hours in adults. After urine output is established, potassium replacement should begin. Once dehydration is partially corrected, adults should receive an initial bolus of 0.1 units of intravenous insulin per kg of body weight, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 units per kg per hour (or a continuous infusion of 0.14 units per kg per hour without an initial bolus) until the blood glucose level decreases below 300 mg per dL. In children and adolescents, dehydration should be corrected at a rate of no more than 3 mOsm per hour to avoid cerebral edema. Identification and treatment of underlying and precipitating causes are necessary.

Outcome Variable

The primary outcome of interest for this analysis was the daily number of patients who experienced hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0). Hyponatremia was further categorized by its severity using the following cutoffs: sodium level 130 to 135 mEq/L for mild hyponatremia, sodium level 125 to 129 mEq/L for moderate hyponatremia, and sodium level less than 125 mEq/L for severe hyponatremia. Furthermore, cases of pseudohyponatremia due to hyperglycemia were corrected.

The sodium level of some patients was measured multiple times throughout the same day. For those hospitalized over several days, hyponatremia status was reevaluated daily when a sodium measurement was available. To avoid inflated rates from repeated daily measurements, we considered the lowest recorded value for each day as relevant for risk assessment purposes.

### Child with suspected type 2 diabetes [^111VguVi]. PES (2021). High credibility.

Child with suspected type 2 diabetes — diagnostic criteria and laboratory features include the following: diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/ kg (maximum dose: 75 gm), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or random blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl in patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, and in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be repeated. Simultaneous c-peptide level is elevated and undetectable pancreatic autoantibodies include islet cell antibodies (ICA), GAD-65, insulin antibodies, IA2A and ZnT8. Most commercial laboratories may have the assays to test for some/ most of the autoantibodies accurately. Should be done after discussion with the endocrinologist. Electrolyte abnormalities include pseudo-hyponatremia (secondary to blood glucose elevation), metabolic acidosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (secondary to dehydration), and liver function abnormality (secondary to Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis [NASH]). Children with Type 2 diabetes can present in DKA and are also more likely to present with Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), both of which are medical emergencies.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Dextrose and sodium chloride [^1157CMW1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyponatremia

Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Avoid Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.4 Hypokalemia

Excessive administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may result in significant hypokalemia. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet, or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. Avoid the administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk of hypokalemia or taking medications that may increase the risk. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^115KxMA7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy — initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

### Central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with hyperosmolar hyperglycemia and consistently normal serum sodium [^11447VVW]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is almost always described in association with a disturbance in sodium homeostasis, most commonly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. It has only rarely been described in patients with disturbances of serum osmolality in the absence of abnormal serum sodium concentrations.

Methods

Case report.

Results

A 93 year-old-man developed marked gait ataxia 2 days after the diagnosis and treatment of hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. MRI demonstrated a symmetric lesion in the central pons consisting of increased T2 signal intensity and restricted diffusion, consistent with CPM. Calculated serum osmolality on admission was 344 mOsm/kg and fell to 300 mOsm/Kg over 20 h. Serum sodium concentration stayed between 137 and 140 mEq/l throughout the admission. One month after admission, his ataxia had nearly completely resolved and the MRI changes had improved.

Conclusion

CPM can develop in the setting of hyperosmolar hyperglycemia without abnormalities of sodium homeostasis. This supports the theory that the pathogenesis of CPM is dependent on a relatively hypertonic insult, which may occur independently of sodium abnormalities. CPM can present as isolated gait ataxia. Clinical manifestations of the disorder may show significant improvement despite a dramatic initial presentation.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^112JHuzX]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — hyponatremia epidemiology, mechanisms, and therapies: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance in patients with aneurysmal SAH, occurring in 30–50% of cases. More recent work emphasizes that the diagnosis of CSW requires hypovolemia, whereas SIADH usually results in euvolemia or modest hypervolemia, and it appears that in SAH both entities may coexist in the same patient. Older studies reported an association between hyponatremia and higher risk of cerebral infarctions, especially with fluid restriction, but subsequent studies during aggressive fluid administration found no conclusive evidence that hyponatremia influences prognosis. Controlled studies of fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone to prevent hyponatremia found both consistently effective when started early, but use was associated with increased hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and significantly increased infection. Data suggest that 3% saline may be safe but are too scant to assess its value. Vasopressin-receptor antagonists, such as conivaptan, are effective in euvolemic or hypervolemic conditions and in hyponatremic SAH patients, but they can produce a significant rise in urine output raising concern about intravascular volume contraction, especially in the setting of DCI.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^115GLRMT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Hyperglycemic hyponatremia in nondiabetic patients… [^1157SxJK]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Physicians managing patients under hypothermia or after major operations, particularly cardiac procedures, will observe with increasing frequency an acute, seemingly paradoxical hyponatremia. The low serum sodium concentration develops abruptly, apparently out of proportion to the amount of fluid recently administered, and without producing any of the symptoms of water intoxication which might be expected to accompany such rapid dilution of electrolytes. As the underlying mechanism of this deceptive hyponatremia often is not appreciated, incorrect diagnosis and potentially harmful therapy may follow its discovery. A discussion of the problem therefore seems warranted. Report of Cases Typically, this type of hyponatremia has been discovered after 24 hours of therapeutic hypothermia or on the day following major surgery.

On routine determination, a previously normal serum sodium concentration unexpectedly has been found below 120 mEq/liter in asymptomatic patients, as demonstrated in the following cases: Case 1. — A 13-year-old girl aspirated secretions 36 hours after WRIGHT HK, GANN DS.

### Prognosis of patients with severe hyponatraemia is related not only to hyponatraemia but also to comorbidities and to medical management: results of an observational retrospective study [^111LyDnV]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has certain limitations. First, the retrospective nature imposing the study of handwritten medical records certainly limited the access to certain valuable information, including final diagnosis. Secondly, plasma sodium was not corrected herein by plasma glucose as recommended, as it was difficult to retrospectively obtain blood glucose for each value of plasma sodium. Nevertheless, the low threshold value chosen to characterise severe hyponatraemia makes it unlikely that hyperglycaemia could have completely distorted the relationship between plasma sodium and osmolality. In addition, two studies found identical mortality rates with and without using correction of osmolality by glucose. On the other hand, in the present series, the relatively limited number of patients from one single centre allowed access to the entire medical records and to correlate the prognosis with a wide variety of parameters. Thus this is, to our knowledge, the first study demonstrating that prognosis is influenced independently by hyponatraemia itself, by comorbidity, and by medical management.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^113iRuC9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

### Treatment… [^117UPrdD]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a triad of hyperglycemia, ketonemia and acidemia, each of which may be caused by other conditions. 1 Although diabetic ketoacidosis most often occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes, more recent studies suggest that it can sometimes be the presenting condition in obese black patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 2, 3. 6 These hormonal alterations bring about three major metabolic events: hyperglycemia resulting from accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glucose utilization, increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis and increased lipolysis and ketone production.
7. Hyperglycemia initially causes the movement of water out of cells, with subsequent intracellular dehydration, extra-cellular fluid expansion and hyponatremia. It also leads to a diuresis in which water losses exceed sodium chloride losses.

Urinary losses then lead to progressive dehydration and volume depletion, which causes diminished urine flow and greater retention of glucose in plasma. The net result of all these alterations is hyperglycemia with metabolic acidosis and an increased plasma anion gap.
8. FLUID REPLACEMENT The severity of fluid and sodium deficits 4 is determined primarily by the duration of hyperglycemia, the level of renal function and the patient's fluid intake. Dehydration can be estimated by clinical examination and by calculating total serum osmolality and the corrected serum sodium concentration. Total serum osmolality is calculated using the following equation: When the blood glucose concentration is approximately 250 mg per dL, glucose should be added to the hydration fluid. This allows continued insulin administration until ketonemia is controlled and also helps to avoid iatrogenic hypoglycemia.

Another important aspect of rehydration therapy in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is the replacement of ongoing urinary losses. 1, 22 A protocol for the administration of subcutaneous insulin is included in Figure 2. In patients who are unable to eat, 5 percent dextrose in hypotonic saline solution is continued at a rate of 100 to 200 mL per hour. Blood glucose levels are monitored every four hours, and regular insulin is given subcutaneously every four hours using a sliding scale (.

### An unusual case of hyponatraemia in diabetic ketoacidosis [^1174h7ta]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

This report outlines a case of diabetic ketoacidosis associated hyponatraemia in an 18 year old woman with type 1 diabetes who presented to the accident and emergency department and was quickly admitted to the intensive treatment unit. Causes of hyponatraemia include sodium depletion, pseudohyponatraemia, and extracellular hypertonicity. Hypertonicity secondary to hyperglycaemia is thought to be the major cause of hyponatraemia in diabetic ketoacidosis. Indirect and direct sodium measurements were performed until the glucose concentration stabilised. The large difference between the presenting sodium concentrations is consistent with pseudohyponatraemia. However, the causes of pseudohyponatraemia (large increases in total protein, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentrations) were excluded. Analytical error should always be considered when the laboratory results do not agree with the clinical picture. Sometimes, however, even after excluding all known effects, the cause may remain unexplained, as in this case.

Background

The diversity in presentation and cause of hyponatremia leads to a wide array of treatment modalities which are selected based on severity, chronicity, volume status, and putative cause. Due to the variability in treatment selection, it is pertinent to identify the clinical impact of the various treatment modalities and rescue therapies to inform future care.

To evaluate the association between treatment modality and length of stay for patients with severe hyponatremiaMethods:This single-center, retrospective study included patients 18years of age or older with glucose-corrected serum sodium levels of < 125 mEq/L upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary endpoint was ICU length of stay, and its association with treatment modality was assessed using multivariable Poisson regression with the following explanatory variables: 3% sodium chloride, 1.8% sodium chloride or isotonic fluids, diuretics, proactive therapy, rescue therapy, nephrology consultation, baseline volume status, and pretreatment sodium level.

Results

Eighty-two patients were included with a median age of 65years old (Q1, Q3: 57, 72). The median glucose-corrected serum sodium was 116.3 mEq/L (Q1, Q3: 112.9, 120.5) and the median ICU length of stay was 3days (Q1, Q3: 2, 4). Multivariable analysis, adjusting for baseline serum sodium levels, revealed the use of proactive and early reactive therapy (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.71) and nephrology consultation (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.46) were associated with increased length of ICU stay.

Conclusions and Relevance

Nephrology consultation and the use of proactive therapies were associated with increased ICU length of stay. Accurate identification of patients at high risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome that may benefit from proactive therapies is imperative, as use of proactive therapies in low-risk patients may prolong length of stay.

### Integrated safety profile of selinexor in multiple myeloma: experience from 437 patients enrolled in clinical trials [^113d4Lhi]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common AE observed with selinexor treatment with the highest incidence occurring in MM trials. A majority (> 95%) of the hyponatremia was asymptomatic, and generally correctable with sodium tablets or electrolyte-containing fluids. The causes of hyponatremia are not completely understood and are likely to be multifactorial. Furthermore, pseudohyponatremia in many cases could not be ruled out and can be caused by elevated paraprotein levels and/or hyperglycemia. Appropriate laboratory methods using direct potentiometry in a gas analyzer are required to correct for pseudohyponatremia.

There are several limitations of this analysis which should be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, the data were pooled from four independent clinical trials that treated patients with MM at different stages of their disease, and 35% of the patients received combination therapies which could exacerbate AE prevelance and grade. Among these studies, there was a wide range of baseline characteristics, including: prior treatment history (0–3 prior lines; 22%, and ≥ 4 prior lines, 78% of patients), disease burden, frailty, ECOG performance status, as well as differences in the treatment schedule, dose, and regimen. Previous studies have demonstrated that AE burden increases with each line of therapy, age, and frailty of patients. While the majority of the patients were heavily pretreated (median 6 prior lines of therapy), 22% of the population analyzed received ≤ 3 prior antimyeloma regimens, which could impact onset, duration, and resolution of specific AEs. An additional limitation to this analysis is that patients may have received multiple interventions, at different times of AE onset, and controlling for these interventions and interpreting the effect in small subsets of patients was challenging. Furthermore, as knowledge of the AE profile of selinexor improved with clinical experience, prophylactic supportive care and early follow-up to mitigate AE severity became more common, resulting in nonstandardized or controlled AE prevention and management.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: a historic review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^116UJ3X3]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the most serious acute hyperglycemic emergency in patients with type 2 diabetes. von Frerichs and Dreschfeld described the first cases of HHS in the 1880s in patients with an "unusual diabetic coma" characterized by severe hyperglycemia and glycosuria in the absence of Kussmaul breathing, with a fruity breath odor or positive acetone test in the urine. Current diagnostic HHS criteria include a plasma glucose level > 600 mg/dL and increased effective plasma osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg in the absence of ketoacidosis. The incidence of HHS is estimated to be < 1% of hospital admissions of patients with diabetes. The reported mortality is between 10 and 20%, which is about 10 times higher than the mortality rate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite the severity of this condition, no prospective, randomized studies have determined best treatment strategies in patients with HHS, and its management has largely been extrapolated from studies of patients with DKA. There are many unresolved questions that need to be addressed in prospective clinical trials regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of pediatric and adult patients with HHS.

Nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is found mostly in type 2 diabetic patients with marked hyperglycemia. HHS is a metabolic emergency and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by extreme dehydration and neurologic symptoms, which are related directly to the degree of hyperosmolality. We describe a 65-year-old patient who was admitted because of impaired consciousness caused by HHS. The relevant clinical and laboratory findings are discussed, and a brief overview of the pathophysiology and therapeutic management is provided.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia (inpatient management), WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a 100 mL bolus of IV hypertonic saline in patients with biochemically confirmed severe exercise-associated hyponatremia or symptomatic exercise-associated hyponatremia. Consider administering repeated boluses twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol/L and reversing cerebral edema.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state in adults with diabetes [^114vVwFU]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is a medical emergency, which differs from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and requires a different approach. The present article summarizes the recent guidance on HHS that has been produced by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care, available in full at http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS/JBDS_IP_HHS_Adults.pdf. HHS has a higher mortality rate than DKA and may be complicated by myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, cerebral oedema and central pontine myelinolysis and there is some evidence that rapid changes in osmolality during treatment may be the precipitant of central pontine myelinolysis. Whilst DKA presents within hours of onset, HHS comes on over many days, and the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are more extreme. The key points in these HHS guidelines include: (1) monitoring of the response to treatment: (i) measure or calculate the serum osmolality regularly to monitor the response to treatment and (ii) aim to reduce osmolality by 3–8 mOsm/kg/h; (2) fluid and insulin administration: (i) use i.v. 0.9% sodium chloride solution as the principal fluid to restore circulating volume and reverse dehydration, (ii) fluid replacement alone will cause a fall in blood glucose (BG) level, (iii) withhold insulin until the BG level is no longer falling with i.v. fluids alone (unless ketonaemic), (iv) an initial rise in sodium level is expected and is not itself an indication for hypotonic fluids and (v) early use of insulin (before fluids) may be detrimental; and (3) delivery of care: (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible and (ii) patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of HHS.

### Where Do the salt and water Go? A case of profound hyponatremia [^112PdBSU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of profound hyponatremia is challenging. Severe symptoms mandate correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L within hours, but with risk factors for osmotic demyelination, daily correction should be < 8 mEq/L. With a therapeutic window this narrow, clinicians would like to know how serum sodium (SNa) concentration will respond to their therapy. Based on isotopic measurements, Edelman showed SNa level to be a function of exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water. Edelman defined this relationship with linear regression yielding an equation of the form y = mx + b, where y is SNa level, x is exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water, m is the slope, and b is the intercept. Edelman said that the intercept of his regression "probably is a measure of the quantity of osmotically inactive exchangeable sodium and potassium per unit of body water". Predictive formulas are derived from Edelman's original linear regression, some including and some omitting the regression's intercept. We illustrate the performance and limitations of these formulas using comprehensive data for electrolyte and fluid balance obtained during the treatment of a critically patient who presented with an SNa concentration of 101 mEq/L.

### Euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state: a variant subtype of traditional hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with higher mortality [^115jax66]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes, defined by serum glucose > 600 mg/dL and effective osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg. However, some patients present with hyperglycemia (serum glucose levels ≥ 180 mg/dL but < 600 mg/dL), hypernatremia, and effective osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg. We refer to this subtype of HHS as euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state.

Objective

We aimed to investigate its clinical characteristics compared to traditional HHS.

Methods

A retrospective observational study of consecutive adult patients with diabetes and effective osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg admitted between January 2021 and February 2023 in a single medical institution. The study analyzed age, sex, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum glucose, serum sodium, effective osmolality, and mortality of encounters of euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state and traditional HHS.

Results

We encountered 34 cases of euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state and 19 cases of traditional HHS. Patients with euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state were older, had less severe diabetes with lower baseline HbA1c, worse hypernatremia, lower effective osmolality, and higher mortality (35.3% vs. 0%; p = 0.002) compared to patients with traditional HHS. Euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state had a similarly high mortality rate as hypernatremia alone.

Conclusions

Euglycemic hyperosmolar hypernatremic state is a variant subtype of HHS. It shares the same pathophysiological mechanisms as traditional HHS but is associated with higher mortality, thus warranting increased recognition as it requires similar treatment strategy as traditional HHS.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113cR4vq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and classification — Type 2 diabetes phenotype — Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes and encompasses individuals who generally have relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes and, when seen, usually arises with insulinopenia, missed or inadequate insulin doses, ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, intercurrent illness such as dehydration or infection, or in association with medications such as glucocorticoids, second-generation antipsychotics, or SGLT2 inhibitors. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is more typically associated with type 2 diabetes and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis, and mixed DKA/HHS presentations can occur.

### Hypercortisolism manifesting as severe weight loss, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia in the emergency department [^116otDmm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The concurrence of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (ectopic Cushing syndrome) and cancer is uncommon in the emergency department (ED) setting, but a constellation of nonspecific signs and symptoms can suggest the presence of Cushing syndrome.

Case Report

A 65-year-old woman with diabetes visited the ED complaining of severe weight loss, generalized weakness, and hypokalemia. She was treated for hypokalemia and thrush. She was found to have a lung mass with a large pleural effusion. Upon discovery of the suspected malignancy, the patient was referred to the ED of a comprehensive cancer center, where she was diagnosed with ectopic Cushing syndrome and admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. WHY SHOULD THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The emergency physician should be able to recognize Cushing syndrome in cancer patients so that the paraneoplastic syndrome can be managed to avoid complications during cancer treatment.

### Sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride and dextrose monohydrate (lactated Ringer's and dextrose) [^114s31pA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected, which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

Fluid Overload

Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, the intravenous administration of Lactated Ringer's and 5% Dextrose Injection, USP can cause electrolyte disturbances such as overhydration and congested states, including pulmonary congestion and edema.

Avoid Lactated Ringer's and 5% Dextrose Injection, USP in patients with or at risk of fluid and/or solute overloading. If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance, as needed and especially during prolonged use.

Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State

Administration of solutions containing dextrose and lactate in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus may worsen hyperglycemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use). Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death.

Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality, resulting in osmotic diuresis, dehydration and electrolyte losses.

### Is our understanding of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state accurate? [^1138ALru]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) are two distinct hyperglycemic emergencies with different pathophysiological and clinical profiles. While DKA is more common, HHS carries higher mortality rates. Although low-dose insulin protocols used for DKA are often applied, no optimal, evidence-based strategies specific to HHS have been established.

Objectives

To examine clinical characteristics and the outcomes of HHS and DKA syndromes, and to characterize the factors contributing to a higher mortality rate in HHS. To contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies, with the goal of reducing HHS mortality in future research.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of admissions for HHS and DKA in adult patients between 2015 and 2021 in a large tertiary center. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with HHS vs. DKA were compared. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

Results

Total 608 patients were included in the study, 223 (37%) patients in the HHS group and 385 (63%) in the DKA group. Patients in the HHS group were older (77.4 vs. 43.6 years, p < 0.001), had more infection as a trigger (41.7% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001) and more co-morbidities. In-hospital mortality rate was higher in the HHS group (41.2% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.001), however, matched multivariate analysis showed no significant differences for in-hospital mortality (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.18–1.02).

Conclusion

Metabolic abnormalities alone do not appear to explain the worse outcomes observed in HHS compared to DKA. Our findings indicate that baseline comorbidities, age and infection trigger have more significant impact on outcomes than the patients' metabolic status.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state… [^113nZmv5]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a relatively common, life-threatening endocrine emergency that is reported in all age groups. 1 but it most frequently affects older patients with type 2 diabetes. 2 The hallmark of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is profound dehydration, marked hyperglycemia, and often some degree of neurologic impairment with mild or no ketosis. Traditionally, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and diabetic ketoacidosis have been described as distinct entities; however, one third of patients exhibit findings of both conditions.
2. Pathophysiology The initiating event in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is glucosuric diuresis. Glucosuria impairs the concentrating capacity of the kidney, further exacerbating water loss. Under normal conditions, the kidneys act as a safety valve to eliminate glucose above a certain threshold and prevent further accumulation.

However, decreased intravascular volume or underlying renal disease decreases the glomerular filtration rate, causing the glucose level to increase. The loss of more water than sodium leads to hyperosmolarity. 10 Insulin is present, but it is not adequate to reduce blood glucose levels, particularly in the presence of significant insulin resistance.
11. Physical findings reveal profound dehydration that is manifested by poor tissue turgor 10 23; dry buccal mucosa membranes; soft, sunken eyeballs; cool extremities; and a rapid, thready pulse. 10 A low-grade fever often is present. Abdominal distention may occur because of gastroparesis induced by hypertonicity, 23 but resolves quickly following adequate rehydration. Abdominal distention that persists after rehydration may be related to other underlying causes. Various changes in mental status may manifest, ranging from complete lucidity to disorientation to lethargy to coma.

The degree of neurologic impairment is related directly to the effective serum osmolarity, 15 with coma often occurring once the serum osmolarity is greater than 350 mOsm per kg. Seizures are present in up to 25 percent of patients and may be generalized, focal, myoclonic jerking, or movement induced. 23 Hemiparesis may occur, 13, 23 but it is reversible with correction of the fluid deficit.

### Hypoglycemia during hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crises is associated with long-term mortality [^117VHpAZ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperglycemic crises, such as a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), are severe acute complications of diabetes mellitus. HHS, which is typical but not exclusive of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is characterized by marked hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and severe dehydration. DKA, typical but not exclusive of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or insulin-deficient diabetes, is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap due to increased ketone body concentrations, and variable degrees of osmolality and dehydration. Both entities share common symptoms, such as weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria, the latter being a major cause of dehydration. In addition, infectious symptoms can be common to both conditions, given that infections often act as precipitants of these crises. However, there are some differences in the symptom presentation of HHS and DKA. The course of HHS is generally slow and insidious, whereas that of DKA is typically abrupt. This is because the accumulation of ketones that occurs in DKA can produce acute symptoms characteristic of DKA: acetone breath, Kussmaul breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain. This acute symptomatology can lead patients with DKA to seek medical attention quickly, so the polyuria of DKA usually has a short evolution time and produces only a state of mild hypovolemia. However, if the DKA is not treated in time, hyperglycemia and dehydration can progress, producing a hyperosmolar state similar to that of HHS, which can contribute to altered mental status. Therefore, cases can overlap between HHS and DKA.
