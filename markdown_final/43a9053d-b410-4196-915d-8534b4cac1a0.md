## Question

41 yo F has buffalo bump. Has been on HRT for 10–15 yr after parital hysterectomy. Seen in rheumatology for + ANA. I want to check cortisol levels. Is it free and totoal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to order free or total cortisol — and which test is appropriate — for a 41-year-old woman on long-term estrogen-based HRT who presents with a dorsocervical fat pad ("buffalo hump"). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this clinical feature warrants screening for Cushing's syndrome. Then, I should verify how oral estrogen affects cortisol assays via cortisol-binding globulin (CBG). Next, I will decide which initial screening tests best reflect free biologically active cortisol and whether any are confounded by elevated CBG. After that, I need to ensure the sampling strategy is adequate given cortisol variability. Finally, I should outline confirmatory steps and when to refer if results are discordant or suspicion remains high [^111cMQQE] [^117EK3tV] [^114EPhue].

> Let me first confirm the indication to test. A "buffalo hump" is one of the classical cushingoid features; testing is appropriate particularly when such features are multiple, progressive, or unusual for age, which fits the Endocrine Society's indications for screening for endogenous Cushing's syndrome, so I should not dismiss this finding without biochemical evaluation [^111cMQQE] [^117EK3tV] [^114HhGYc].

> Now, I need to check how estrogen therapy affects cortisol measurements. Oral estrogens increase hepatic synthesis of CBG, which raises measured serum total cortisol without increasing the free (biologically active) fraction; therefore, relying on total serum cortisol can be misleading and generate false positives in women on oral estrogen therapy, which argues against using total cortisol–based thresholds for screening in this scenario [^111r3g3a] [^114NPj2V].

> Next, I should review which screening tests reflect free cortisol. The recommended initial tests are 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC), or the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST); wait, I initially thought the DST might bypass binding-protein issues because it interrogates HPA-axis feedback, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — its readout is a serum cortisol level that is typically total cortisol and thus can be artifactually high when CBG is elevated by oral estrogens, so in this patient I should prioritize UFC and/or LNSC because they measure free cortisol and are not affected by CBG elevations [^114EPhue] [^115H6qjN] [^114w2RAM].

> I should double-check the diagnostic performance and practicality. LNSC is simple, noninvasive, and has reported sensitivity and specificity above 90% for endogenous Cushing's when collected at late night; UFC reflects integrated free cortisol secretion over 24 hours and performs at least comparably to other first-line tests when measured by LC-MS/MS, which I should specify to minimize assay interference; this supports choosing either LNSC or LC-MS/MS-based UFC here rather than a serum total cortisol approach [^114w2RAM] [^111qTAih].

> Let me think about sampling strategy because cortisol secretion varies. I should confirm that results are reproducible by obtaining at least two measurements of LNSC and/or UFC on separate days, given significant day-to-day variability and intrapatient UFC variation approaching 40–50%, which can otherwise lead to misclassification if only a single sample is used [^1167XavQ] [^113ZfEHQ] [^117V9rMd].

> I need to ensure the logistics are correct. For LNSC, samples should be collected at habitual late-night bedtime (around 23:00–24:00) when free cortisol is physiologically nadir; for UFC, proper 24-hour urine collection with creatinine cross-check and LC-MS/MS assay improves accuracy; if the patient is a shift worker or has circadian disruption, I should reconsider timing or favor UFC to avoid false elevations in late-night sampling due to rhythm misalignment [^114w2RAM] [^114naA4m] [^115H6qjN].

> Next, I should review what to do with results. If an initial test is abnormal, I should confirm with a second, different first-line test, and if two different tests are concordantly positive, proceed to etiologic work-up; conversely, if two different tests are concordantly negative and clinical suspicion is low, further testing can be deferred; however, if suspicion remains high despite negative tests, I should refer to endocrinology for specialized evaluation, considering possibilities like cyclical Cushing's and repeating UFC or late-night salivary testing during symptomatic periods [^114EPhue] [^115qPvhJ] [^113ewEHM] [^111xuCgY] [^112F5DHq].

> In summary, wait, let me verify the core recommendation one more time: for a woman on oral estrogen HRT with a "buffalo hump", I should not screen with a serum total cortisol because CBG elevations will artifactually raise total levels; instead, I should order free cortisol–based screening — either two late-night salivary cortisol samples and/or two 24-hour urinary free cortisol collections (preferably with LC-MS/MS) — and interpret concordance before moving to confirmation and etiologic testing if positive [^111r3g3a] [^114EPhue] [^115H6qjN] [^111qTAih] [^114w2RAM].

---

For a 41-year-old woman on long-term HRT with a buffalo hump, **screen for Cushing's syndrome** using **late-night salivary cortisol** or **24-hour urinary free cortisol** as first-line tests, because HRT elevates CBG and falsely increases total serum cortisol [^111r3g3a] [^114w2RAM] [^111qTAih]. Total serum cortisol is **not recommended for initial screening** because of estrogen-related binding effects; if used, interpret with caution and consider measuring CBG or free cortisol (equilibrium dialysis or LC-MS/MS). Confirm abnormal results with a **different first-line test** or a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, and refer to endocrinology for further evaluation [^114EPhue] [^111xuCgY].

---

## Physiological basis of cortisol measurement

Cortisol circulates mostly bound to CBG and albumin, with only the free fraction biologically active; because **CBG increases with estrogen** (including HRT), total cortisol is artificially elevated, increasing false positives if total cortisol is used alone [^111r3g3a].

---

## Impact of hormone replacement therapy on cortisol measurements

HRT — especially oral estrogens — **raises CBG** and total cortisol without changing free cortisol; therefore, total cortisol can misclassify hypercortisolism in women on HRT [^111r3g3a]. This binding effect limits the reliability of total cortisol for screening in this setting.

---

## Recommended initial screening tests for Cushing's syndrome

The Endocrine Society and AAFP recommend one of the following **first-line tests** for suspected Cushing's syndrome [^115H6qjN] [^111qTAih]:

- **Late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC)**: Noninvasive, reflects free cortisol, and is unaffected by CBG; preferred in patients on HRT [^114w2RAM].
- **24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC)**: Measures free cortisol over 24 hours and is not influenced by CBG [^111qTAih].
- **1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST)**: Useful but can be confounded by altered dexamethasone metabolism or absorption; interpret cautiously in HRT users.

Given CBG elevation with HRT, **LNSC or UFC** are preferred for initial screening.

---

## Limitations of total serum cortisol measurement in patients on HRT

Total serum cortisol is **confounded by CBG** and can be falsely elevated in HRT users, reducing specificity and increasing false-positive results [^111r3g3a]. If total cortisol is used, measure CBG or calculate free cortisol (e.g. equilibrium dialysis or LC-MS/MS) to improve accuracy.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **CBG-aware testing** and recommend LNSC or UFC as first-line tests in patients on HRT. Abnormal results should be confirmed with a different first-line test or with a 1-mg DST [^114EPhue]. Persistent clinical suspicion despite negative tests warrants referral to endocrinology [^111xuCgY].

---

## Practical approach to cortisol testing in this patient

Given HRT use and clinical features, **the following approach is recommended**:

1. **Initial screening**. Perform LNSC (two separate samples) or UFC (two 24-hour collections) to assess free cortisol.
2. **Confirmation**. If abnormal, confirm with a different first-line test or a 1-mg DST.
3. **Interpretation**. Interpret results in the context of HRT and consider measuring CBG or free cortisol if total cortisol is used.
4. **Referral**. Refer to endocrinology for further evaluation and management if results are abnormal or clinical suspicion remains high.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Test** | **Recommended for initial screening in HRT patients?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Total serum cortisol | No | Confounded by elevated CBG due to HRT |
| Free cortisol (salivary or urinary) | Yes | Reflects biologically active cortisol; unaffected by CBG |
| 1-mg DST | Yes, with caution | Useful but may be confounded by altered dexamethasone metabolism |

---

In a 41-year-old woman on long-term HRT with a buffalo hump, **LNSC or UFC** are the preferred initial screening tests for Cushing's syndrome because they are not affected by estrogen-induced CBG elevation. Total serum cortisol is not recommended for initial screening in this context because of false-positive elevations; if used, interpret with caution and consider measuring CBG or free cortisol.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, the ES 2008 guidelines recommend confirming abnormal results from initial laboratory testing using a different test from the recommended initial tests.

The measurement of cortisol in saliva is a simple, reproducible, and reliable test to evaluate the normal and disordered control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. A variety of simple methods exist to obtain saliva samples without stress, making this a robust test applicable to many different experimental and clinical situations.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Measurement of an elevated late-night (2300 to 2400 h) salivary cortisol has a greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Late-night salivary cortisol measurements are also useful to monitor patients for remission and/or recurrence after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Because it is a surrogate for plasma free cortisol, the measurement of salivary cortisol may be useful during an ACTH stimulation test in patients with increased plasma binding protein concentrations due to increased estrogen, or decreased plasma binding protein concentrations during critical illness. Most reference laboratories now offer salivary cortisol testing.

### Screening tests for Cushing's syndrome: Urinary free cortisol role measured by LC-MS/MS [^111qTAih]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

As initial screening for Cushing's syndrome (CS), the Endocrine Society guidelines recommend one of the following: the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC), or urinary free cortisol (UFC) measurement. We examined the diagnostic performance of the above-mentioned tests in a series of patients.

We retrospectively analyzed 137 patients with clinical conditions suggestive of hypercortisolism: 38 with confirmed CS diagnosis and 99 without (termed non-CS). UFC was measured by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, whereas LNSC was measured by the radioimmunometric method and serum cortisol by a chemiluminescence immunoassay.

Comparing CS vs non-CS, a cutoff of 138 nmol/L after 1-mg DST revealed the best specificity (SP; 97%), whereas the 50-nmol/L cutoff confirmed the best sensitivity (SE; 100%). The SE and SP for LNSC greater than 14.46 nmol/L were 84% and 89%, respectively, whereas the SE and SP for UFC greater than 170 nmol per 24 hours were 97% and 91%. Overall, UFC revealed both a combined higher positive and a lower negative likelihood ratio among first-line tests (respectively 10.7 and 0.03).

Computing a receiver-operating curve contrast analysis to compare the power of each single test with that of the others, alone or combined (DST+LNSC, DST+UFC, and LNSC+UFC), or with that of all the tests together (DST+LNSC+UFC), the UFC assay was at least as good as all the other possible combinations.

In conclusion, measuring UFC by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry provides effective diagnostic performance in screening for Cushing's syndrome compared to other test combinations.

When interpreting the values of morning cortisol measurement, it has to be taken into account that several factors can affect the results. Cortisol production is affected by the sleep-awake cycle, with cortisol secretion reaching its peak just minutes before waking up. Thus, morning serum cortisol can appear falsely low in individuals with disrupted circadian rhythm (e.g. night shift workers, jet lag, and severe insomnia). In addition, serum cortisol concentrations can be elevated in patients with elevated cortisol-binding globulin, such as seen during pregnancy and in women on oral estrogens. By contrast, serum cortisol concentrations can be decreased in patients with low albumin and cortisol-binding globulin, as in hypoalbuminemic states (such as advanced cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition) and prolonged critical illness.

The interpretation of serum cortisol varies depending on the assays used. Available techniques for measuring serum cortisol listed from least to most accurate methods are immunoassays using polyclonal antibodies, immunoassays using more specific monoclonal antibody to cortisol, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For example, in a large study of patients undergoing a 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, baseline cortisol that excluded adrenal insufficiency varied between 336 nmol/L (12.2 μg/dL) and 506 nmol/L (18.3 μg/dL) when measured by three different immunoassays. Most prior studies utilized different forms of immunoassays, rather than mass spectrometry-based assays. Therefore, it is important to point out that, ideally, physicians should be aware of these variations when interpreting cortisol measurements.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in evaluating relative adrenal insufficiency, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend considering salivary cortisol determination. This is because serum free cortisol concentration can be influenced by the reduced serum levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin that are frequently seen in patients with cirrhosis.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: A systematic review [^114uoqHe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Three (5.2%) studies measured 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) in an attempt to correlate cortisol excretion rates with the intensity of fatigue. Although the 24-hour UFC reflects the total cortisol produced per day, it was initially conceived to investigate cortisol excess syndromes. Diminished levels could hypothetically imply subnormal adrenal function, despite a lack of evidence. One of these studies (33.3%) found no correlation between 24-hour UFC and energy status, whereas two studies (66.7%) showed reduced values in fatigued patients.

Thirteen studies (22.4%) estimated total cortisol release (AUC) by calculating the areas under the curves for whole-day salivary cortisol collection using three or more daily salivary cortisol levels over four or more days. Assessment of the total 24-hour cortisol release by this method would complement the SCR. The lack of the expected decrease throughout the day observed in some studies can be due to either a non-elevated morning serum cortisol (MSC) level or a full-day elevated cortisol. However, three daily levels of cortisol are probably too few for a minimally precise AUC; herein, findings are conflicting. AUC was elevated in two (15.4%) studies, normal in eight (61.5%), and reduced in another three (23.1%).

Twenty-two studies (37.9%) compared baseline MSC between controls and fatigued patients; traditionally, this is the initial cortisol assessment to investigate possible hypocortisolism. Basal MSC was not different between individuals in fourteen (63.6%) of these studies, and was significantly reduced in fatigued patients in the remaining studies.

### Serum free cortisol as an ancillary tool in the interpretation of the low-dose 1-μg ACTH test [^1151ZMP8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Serum free cortisol, rather than serum total cortisol (TC), determines glucocorticoid activity in vivo. However, how the considerable inter-subject variation in ambient serum free cortisol affects the outcome of dynamic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) assessment in noncritically ill subjects is unknown.

- **Design, patients and measurements**: We performed the low-dose 1-μg ACTH test in 75 subjects referred for HPA evaluation. Serum TC was determined by a chemiluminescence method, and serum free cortisol was measured by the same method following equilibrium dialysis. In a subset of these patients, salivary cortisol was also measured.

- **Results**: The mean fraction of free cortisol was 5.07 ± 4.08% (± SD; range 1.77–10.1%). Although no correlation was seen between TC and the fraction (%) of free serum cortisol, a positive correlation existed between baseline total and free cortisol (R = 0.539, P = 0.01), as well as between peak ACTH-stimulated total and free cortisol (R = 0.619; P = 0.01). There was no correlation between baseline salivary cortisol and serum free cortisol, and between peak ACTH-stimulated salivary and serum free cortisol. Using the lowest attained peak serum free cortisol in subjects whose TC response to ACTH was normal (≥ 500 nM), the minimal 'pass' level for normal serum free cortisol response to 1 μg ACTH was set at 25.0 nM. Five of the 19 subjects showing subnormal TC response to 1 μg ACTH had a normal serum free cortisol response.

- **Conclusions**: Discrepancies between the peak free and TC were noted mostly for subjects whose ACTH-stimulated TC peaked between 44.

### Screening for Cushing's syndrome: is it worthwhile [^117GKAwc]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare disease characterized by a collection of signs and symptoms commonly seen in the general population without elevated cortisol secretion. In recent years, more patients with CS have been identified earlier and with milder disease. Many of these patients are diagnosed during screening efforts conducted for specific complaints, such as weight gain, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, osteoporosis, elevated white blood cell counts, and more.

- **Methods**: In this review article, the most popular screening test performed in the studies cited was the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test.

- **Conclusions**: Cushing's syndrome is not frequent enough to support routine screening in patients with morbid obesity and type 2 DM. Moreover, only 1% of hypertensive patients have secondary hypertension due to CS. However, screening should be considered in young patients with resistant DM and/or hypertension. Among patients with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures, up to 5% were diagnosed with subclinical hypercortisolism; most of these had adrenal adenoma. Screening for CS is important in subjects with adrenal incidentaloma, and many studies show a high prevalence (~10%) of Cushing's or subclinical CS in these patients.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy.

- **Rationale**: Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs, and regional accessibility.

There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior. Dynamic testing options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency.

As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less results that are reliable in patients on a shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking.

### High variability in baseline urinary free cortisol values in patients with Cushing's disease [^113ZfEHQ]. Clinical endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The data can also be used to evaluate how many UFC measurements should be collected when evaluating Cushing's disease. In this study, a two-sample 24-hour UFC measurement was found to yield a reasonable estimate of intrapatient variation (95% CI: 44–58%). Narrower CIs, and therefore more precise estimates, were obtained when using three (95% CI: 49–59%) or four (95% CI: 48–56%) UFC measurements. However, practical considerations in clinical practice may prevent the routine collection of four 24-hour UFC samples because patients may find the task inconvenient. The results of this study therefore suggest that in this range of cortisol excess, taking the mean of two samples would provide sufficient information for use in everyday care.

No linear correlation was found in the present study between mUFC levels and the severity of features of hypercortisolism, including fasting glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, β-cell function, BMI, or systolic/diastolic blood pressure. This is perhaps surprising because it might be expected that higher UFC levels would correlate with disease severity and therefore with morbidity levels. Previous studies have shown that higher UFC levels in patients with Cushing's disease are associated with more severe cognitive impairment, the presence of major depression, and the risk of serious infection. It is, however, possible that disease severity is associated with duration rather than degree of hypercortisolism. Additionally, it may also be the case that a linear correlation could not be demonstrated because patients with mild degrees of cortisol excess.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^114HhGYc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Of the chief complaints, six were significantly different between patients with confirmed Cushing syndrome (CS) and those where CS was ruled out. Five were significantly more frequent in CS: osteoporosis (8% vs. 2%; p = 0.02), incidentaloma (17% vs. 8%; p = 0.01), metabolic syndrome (11% vs. 4%; p = 0.02), myopathy (10% vs. 2%; P < .001), and multiple symptoms (16% vs. 1%; P < .001). Obesity or weight gain was more common in those in whom CS was ruled out (30% of patients vs. 4% in CS; P < .001). Multiple symptoms were the most important aspect increasing probability for CS (odds ratio [OR] 18.0 [5.1–63.8]), while weight gain/obesity decreased probability for CS (OR 0.11 [0.04–0.30]).

- **The obesity phenotype**: Obesity and weight gain were the most frequent chief complaints to screen for CS (n = 89, thereof 85 CS ruled out, 4 CS) but also the presenting problem that made diagnosis of CS most unlikely. Obesity or weight gain was, in fact, the "only" chief complaint in these patients; they did not have another major clinical problem. In 70 of 89 patients, obesity was a lifelong problem (often since childhood). Seventeen of 89 patients reported a very recent weight gain (in the last year). In 2 patients, the onset was unclear/unknown. In patients in whom CS was ruled out, the majority suffered from lifelong obesity (69/83, 83%). Among the 4 patients with confirmed CS, acute weight gain within one year was present in the 3 patients with pituitary CS.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^117G3tLF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare condition that is often diagnosed late in the course of the disease, typically years after the initial onset of symptoms. Diagnosis and management can be challenging since CS is usually characterized and identified by multiple symptoms. Many of these symptoms, such as hypertension, diabetes, weight gain, or osteoporosis, are quite common among the general population. In contrast, others, such as purple striae, are more specific to CS. Patients may present oligosymptomatically both initially during the primary disease manifestation and especially at recurrence. The low incidence of CS and its clinical overlap with pseudo-Cushing states — such as metabolic syndrome or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — can delay definitive diagnosis and treatment, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.

Studies have been performed to identify patients with CS at earlier stages in cohorts with a relevant prevalence. In patients with diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of CS is low, ranging between 0% and 3%, depending on patient selection. According to a recent meta-analysis, the likelihood of hypercortisolism is higher in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes. Among patients with hypertension, the prevalence of CS is similarly low; however, screening can be recommended for young patients with resistant hypertension or concomitant diabetes. Screening approaches in patients with obesity are a matter of debate, as results differ significantly between studies. However, in general, screening for endogenous hypercortisolism is important in these settings.

### Septic shock and sepsis: A comparison of total and free plasma cortisol levels [^115LANvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Severe systemic infection leads to hypercortisolism. Reduced cortisol-binding proteins may accentuate the free cortisol elevations seen in systemic infection. Recently, low total cortisol increments after tetracosactrin have been associated with increased mortality and hemodynamic responsiveness to exogenous hydrocortisone in septic shock (SS), a phenomenon termed by some investigators as relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI).

- **Hypothesis**: Free plasma cortisol may correspond more closely to illness severity than total cortisol, comparing SS and sepsis (S).

- **Design**: This was a prospective study.

- **Setting**: This study took place in a tertiary teaching hospital.

- **Patients**: Patients had SS (n = 45) or S (n = 19) or were healthy controls (HCs; n = 10).

- **Aim**: The aim of the study was to compare total with free cortisol, measured directly and estimated by Coolens' method, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and albumin in patients with SS (with and without RAI) and S during acute illness, recovery, and convalescence.

- **Results**: Comparing SS, S, and HC subjects, free cortisol levels reflected illness severity more closely than total cortisol. Basal free cortisol levels were SS, 186 vs. S, 29 vs. HC, 13 nmol/liter, P < 0.001, compared with basal total cortisol, SS, 880 vs. S, 417 vs. HC, 352 nmol/liter, P < 0.001. Stimulated free cortisol increments varied greatly with illness category (SS, 192 vs. S, 115 vs. HC, 59 nmol/liter, P = 0.004), whereas total cortisol increments did not (SS, 474 vs. S, 576 vs. HC, 524 nmol/liter, P = 0.013).

### Plasma, salivary and urinary cortisol levels following physiological and stress doses of hydrocortisone in normal volunteers [^117Jec7Y]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Previous studies on plasma cortisol day curves have measured total cortisol, which includes cortisol bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and free (unbound) cortisol. Plasma free cortisol is technically difficult to measure and not widely available, but it can be calculated using a validated formula. A measure of free cortisol can also be estimated using saliva and urine samples.

While some studies have concluded that monitoring salivary cortisol does not add significantly to the evaluation of adequate glucocorticoid replacement therapy, another study found the correlation between paired plasma and salivary cortisol concentrations was far better. The use of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) has been advocated for monitoring the overall quality of glucocorticoid replacement. However, 24-hour UFC has limitations, as it does not account for fluctuations in cortisol concentrations throughout the day or the peaks and troughs following dosing. There are no data on cortisol day curves using spot urine measurements.

Patients with adrenal insufficiency require additional glucocorticoid doses during surgery or medical illness, but there is no universally accepted regimen for glucocorticoid supplementation therapy. Recommendations regarding glucocorticoid coverage during stress are largely based on expert opinion, and there are few published data on cortisol levels reached in the plasma, saliva, and urine following intravenous hydrocortisone given at "stress" doses.

The main aim of the study was to investigate whether noninvasive methods of measuring cortisol in the saliva or urine are practical for this purpose.

### Role of endogenous glucocorticoid metabolism in human acute pancreatitis [^117BMfcP]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

This study aimed to observe how levels of total cortisol, calculated free cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone change during the early course of human acute pancreatitis and to describe how these changes affect the development of pancreatic necrosis.

- **Design and patients**: In a total of 109 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis (74 with edematous pancreatitis, 35 with necrotizing pancreatitis), serial daily blood monitoring of total and free cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and corticosteroid-binding globulin was done after hospital admission, up to day 6 after the onset of pain. Thirty healthy individuals served as controls.

- **Measurements**: Corticosteroid-binding globulin and total cortisol were measured by immunoassays, and free cortisol was calculated according to Coolens et al. The adrenocorticotropic hormone was measured with an enzyme-linked immunoassay.

- **Results**: Initially, highly elevated levels of calculated free cortisol (median, 86.2 ng/mL; quartile ranges, 50.6–106.7 ng/mL) and total cortisol (41.2 µg/dL, 30.4–51.1 µg/dL) and depressed levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (0.2 pg/mL, 0.1–2.0 pg/mL) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (30.6 µg/mL, 24.1–35.5 µg/mL) were observed. Further, daily measurements revealed increasing adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, whereas cortisol levels decreased.

- **Conclusions**: Although an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels is suggested to increase corresponding cortisol levels, cortisol levels decreased during the development of necrotizing acute pancreatitis.

### Cushing's syndrome: important issues in diagnosis and management [^113qDmdP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of Cushing's syndrome are challenging problems in clinical endocrinology. We focus on critical questions addressing screening for Cushing's syndrome, differentiation of Cushing's subtypes, and treatment options.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid's MEDLINE (1996 through April 2006) was used to search the general literature. We also relied on previously published reviews and a recent monograph and cite a mix of primary articles and recent reviews.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although this article represents our opinion, it draws heavily on a recent consensus statement from experts in the field and a recent monograph on Cushing's syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: We concluded that: 1) measurement of late-night or bedtime salivary cortisol is a useful approach to screen for Cushing's syndrome; 2) measurement of suppressed plasma ACTH by immunometric assay is useful to differentiate ACTH-dependent and -independent Cushing's syndrome; 3) inferior petrosal sinus sampling for ACTH should be performed in patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism in whom a pituitary magnetic resonance imaging is normal or equivocal (in the absence of a pituitary ACTH gradient, prolactin levels should be measured to confirm the integrity of venous sampling); 4) computed tomography of the chest and abdomen and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy should be performed in patients with the occult ectopic ACTH syndrome; and 5) patients with Cushing's disease should be referred to a neurosurgeon with extensive experience operating on corticotroph microadenomas.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111CpFsb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **Results of the systematic reviews**: At the start of the guideline process, the working group formulated clinical questions regarding the evaluation of adrenal function and treatment of patients after long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid exposure. The clinical questions that formed the basis for the systematic reviews are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 (see section on Supplementary Material).

Eligible articles were required to present data on adult patients (≥ 18 years). Articles presenting data on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, based on biochemical testing, were included using the high-dose (250 μg) short ACTH (1–24) test (also referred to by brand names as Synacthen or cosyntropin test), since these tests are widely used in clinical practice. During this test, 250 μg of synthetic ACTH (ACTH (1–24), or another corticotropic agent) is administered intravenously. To determine adrenal response to synthetic ACTH, serum cortisol levels are measured 30 and 60 minutes after administration. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, peak cortisol levels < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on the assay, are indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Since the population under study was assessed for glucocorticoid insufficiency, the definition of a positive test was based on cut-off values provided in the individual articles. For clinical question I (incidence and predictors of recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency), the number of p

### Continuous free cortisol profiles-circadian rhythms in healthy men [^114naA4m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The pituitary-adrenal axis was historically considered a representative model for circadian rhythms. A recently developed portable collection device has provided the opportunity to evaluate free cortisol profiles using the microdialysis approach in individuals free to conduct their day-to-day activities in their own surroundings.

- **Methods**: Two separate experiments were conducted in healthy male volunteers. The total and subcutaneous (SC) free cortisol levels were measured at 10-minute intervals for a 24-hour period in one experiment, and the SC free cortisol levels were measured at 20-minute intervals for 72 consecutive hours in free-living individuals in the second experiment.

- **Results**: The characteristic circadian rhythm was evident in both serum total and SC free cortisol, with the lowest levels achieved and maintained in the hours surrounding sleep onset and the peak levels occurring in every individual around waking. In all free-living individuals, the circadian rhythm was consistent across the 72-hour period, despite a wide range of activities. All participants also showed increased cortisol after the consumption of lunch. The lowest levels during all 24-hour periods were observed during the hours after lights off, at the onset of sleep.

- **Conclusions**: To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report up to three consecutive 24-hour measurements of SC free cortisol in healthy individuals. We believe our study is a landmark study that paves the way for ambulatory monitoring of free cortisol profiles continuously for a period of 72 hours.

### The biochemical investigation of Cushing syndrome [^111n2MGz]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Cushing syndrome is an insidious illness that warrants an early diagnosis to avoid the effects of prolonged hypercortisolism. The variability in the clinical features of the disease and the occasional inconsistencies between different biochemical tests performed to identify it render the diagnosis challenging. In this paper, the author discusses the various biochemical tests that are useful for the diagnoses of Cushing syndrome and Cushing disease, with an emphasis on the respective sensitivities and specificities of these tests. The measurement of evening salivary cortisol and the combined low-dose dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test have improved overall sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of Cushing syndrome and Cushing disease.

### Cushing's syndrome: A practical approach to diagnosis and differential diagnoses [^112fUTm1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) and identification of the aetiology of hypercortisolism can be challenging. The Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines recommend one of the four tests for initial screening of CS, namely, urinary-free cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, overnight dexamethasone suppression test, or a longer low-dose dexamethasone suppression test for 48 hours. Confirmation and localisation of CS require additional biochemical and radiological tests. Radiological evaluation involves different imaging modalities, including MRI with or without different radio-nuclear imaging techniques. Invasive testing, such as bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling, may be necessary in some patients for accurate localisation of the cause of hypercortisolism.

This best practice review discusses a practical approach for the diagnostic evaluation of CS, with a brief discussion on differential diagnoses and cyclical CS, to enhance the skills of clinicians and laboratory personnel.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^116ZSgq9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare and serious disease, characterized by high mortality. Patients are often diagnosed late in the course of the disease. This work investigated whether defined patient populations should be screened outside the at-risk populations established in guidelines.

As part of the prospective German Cushing registry, we studied 377 patients with suspected CS. The chief complaint for CS referral was documented. Using urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, and the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, as well as long-term clinical observation, CS was confirmed in 93 patients and ruled out for the remaining 284.

- **Results**: Patients were referred for 18 key symptoms, of which 5 were more common in patients with CS than in those in whom CS was ruled out. These included osteoporosis (8% vs 2%; p = 0.02), adrenal incidentaloma (17% vs 8%; P = 0.01), metabolic syndrome (11% vs 4%; p = 0.02), myopathy (10% vs 2%; P < .001), and presence of multiple symptoms (16% vs 1%; P < .001). Obesity was more common in patients in whom CS was ruled out (30% vs 4%; P < .001), but recent weight gain was prominent in those with CS. A total of 68 of 93 patients with CS (73%) had typical chief complaints, as did 106 of 284 patients with ruled-out CS status (37%) according to the Endocrine Society practice guideline 2008.

- **Conclusion**: The 2008 Endocrine Society practice guideline for screening and diagnosis of CS defined at-risk populations that should undergo testing. These recommendations remain valid in 2022.

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning general principles, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend monitoring patients for comorbidities associated with cortisol excess. These include psychiatric disorders, diabetes, hypertension, hypokalemia, infections, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and poor physical fitness. These conditions should be managed appropriately.

### Real world evidence supports waking salivary cortisone as a screening test for adrenal insufficiency [^116TuntV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Worldwide, adults and children are at risk of adrenal insufficiency largely due to infectious diseases and adrenal suppression from the use of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids. Home waking salivary cortisone is an accurate screening test for adrenal insufficiency, has the potential to reduce costs, and patients prefer it to the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test. We carried out a service evaluation of home waking salivary cortisone in clinical care to identify implementation barriers.

- **Design, patients and measurements**: Service evaluation in a center where 212 patients referred for adrenal insufficiency had a waking salivary cortisone test. Problems encountered during testing were recorded, and patient feedback was collected via focus groups.

- **Results**: Among all patients providing a waking salivary cortisone sample, 55% had a normal test, 23% exhibited adrenal suppression, and 22% had an equivocal result requiring a clinical center ACTH stimulation test. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) for the time of the saliva sample was 07:40 (07:00–08:40). The median (IQR) days between collection and (i) delivery to the local laboratory was 1 (0.25–2) day, and (ii) reporting by the local laboratory was 13 (11–18) days. Patients considered the test "easy to do" and preferred it to the inpatient ACTH stimulation test. The principal challenge to clinical implementation was the delay in results reporting to clinicians due to local laboratory processing times.

In conclusion, this service evaluation provides real-world evidence that home waking salivary cortisone is an effective, practical screening test for adrenal insufficiency.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^1167XavQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

If Cushing syndrome (CS) is suspected in a patient and exogenous glucocorticoid use is excluded, it is recommended to start with one of the first-line screening tests. Recommended initial tests include:

- **Overnight 1-mg DST**
- **24-hour UFC**
- **Late-night salivary cortisol test (LNSC)**: The latter two tests should be performed at least twice because of significant day-to-day variations in cortisol production. The pooled diagnostic accuracy of the various tests is presented in Figure 2.

There is no specific order of screening; however, the choice of a specific test can be based on individual patient characteristics (see also caveats in Figure 2). A promising, relatively novel test to detect chronic hypercortisolism is the measurement of cortisol in scalp hair (see "New developments: potential of hair cortisol measurement as diagnostic tool").

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Due to the ease, convenience of testing, experience, and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of the HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy. The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (e.g. prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including the measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, overnight metyrapone test, and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes. Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of the HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency. Yet, even among those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low, due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes individuals to a more pronounced suppression of the HPA axis and subsequent impairment of adrenocortical function. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian effect of these drugs, particularly when administered systemically.

Long-acting glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even at physiologic daily dose equivalents, are more likely to cause suppression of the HPA axis, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. Recovery of the HPA axis is impossible with continuous administration of these drugs. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to facilitate HPA recovery, provided they are not administered at night. Administering them at nighttime can significantly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer necessary, it is recommended to switch to shorter-acting formulations, such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate, to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients using non-oral glucocorticoids, such as inhaled steroids, where there is concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, switching to short-acting oral glucocorticoids is appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone provide a wider variety of available doses and allow for better management.

### High variability in baseline urinary free cortisol values in patients with Cushing's disease [^117V9rMd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) sampling is commonly used to evaluate Cushing's syndrome. Because there are few data on UFC variability in patients with active Cushing's disease, we analyzed baseline UFC in a large patient cohort with moderate-to-severe Cushing's disease to assess whether variability correlates with hypercortisolism severity. These data will help clinicians establish the minimum number of UFC samples required to obtain reliable data.

- **Design**: Observational study (enrollment phase of Phase III study).

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 152) with persistent or de novo Cushing's disease and mean UFC (mUFC) ≥ 1.5×ULN (normal: 30–145 nmol/24 h) were included. Mean UFC level was calculated from four 24-hour urine samples collected over two weeks.

- **Results**: Over 600 24-hour UFC samples were analyzed. The mUFC levels of samples 1 and 2 and samples 3 and 4 were 1000 nmol/24 h (SD 1872) and 940 nmol/24 h (SD 2148), respectively; intrapatient coefficient of variation (CV) was 38% for mUFC. The intrapatient CV using all four samples was 52% (95% CI: 48–56). The intrapatient CV was 51% (95% CI: 44–58) for samples 1 and 2, 49% (95% CI: 43–56) for samples 3 and 4, and 54% (95% CI: 49–59) for samples 1, 2, and 3. Variability in mUFC increased as UFC levels increased. There were no correlations between UFC and clinical features of hypercortisolism.

- **Conclusions**: There is intrapatient variability of approximately 50% in 24-hour UFC measurements, which is relevant to targets set to estimate any treatment effect.

Analyses involving more than two 24-hour collection periods are recommended for more robust data interpretation.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111hsJH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is for these patients to continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012 [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone, and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock, and this rhythm is a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression, and insulin resistance.

A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations. However, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm, and patients still have increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-hour cortisol production rate, with hydrocortisone given twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning.

Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated, with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is that there is no established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that an understanding of the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose.

Using this approach, we have developed a thrice-daily, weight-related dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm…

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1149kve6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Studies assessing recovery of HPA axis function through measurement of morning cortisol or low-dose 1 µg ACTH (1–24) test were not formally included in the systematic review (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints"), but reported recovery incidence rates of 17% to 100% within a range of 4 days to 3 years. It is plausible that in studies reporting recovery at retesting already following a couple of days, initial cortisol levels may have represented adrenal suppression due to remaining circulating long-acting exogenous glucocorticoids rather than true adrenal insufficiency.

- **Clinical sub-question Ia**: Which clinical/biochemical parameters predict recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

	- Both studies included for clinical question I also assessed predictors of recovery of adrenal function. In the study by Baek et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher cortisol increments during the first ACTH (1–24) test than patients without recovery (219 vs. 99 nmol/L (10.3 vs. 6.7 μg/dL), OR 1.58 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95% CI 1.02–2.46) when adjusting for confounders, basal cortisol concentration, and basal ACTH levels. In the study by Leong et al, patients recovering adrenal function had higher ambulatory morning cortisol values in between retesting with ACTH (1–24) test than patients not recovering (286 vs. 186 nmol/L (7.9 vs 3.6 μg/dL), OR 1.02 per μg/dL increase in cortisol, 95% CI 1.01–1.04). There were no studies assessing clinical parameters predicting HPA axis recovery.

### What is the best approach to suspected cyclical Cushing syndrome? Strategies for managing Cushing's syndrome with variable laboratory data [^115UwS2F]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Cyclical Cushing's syndrome is a pattern of hypercortisolism where the biochemistry of cortisol production fluctuates rhythmically. This syndrome is often associated with fluctuating symptoms and signs and is now being increasingly recognized. The phenomenon is important because, if not recognized, it can lead to errors in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the syndrome and in the assessment of therapeutic outcomes. Techniques, criteria, protocols, and dynamic biochemical tools to detect cycling in patients with hypercortisolism are discussed, as are the strategies for diagnosing and managing this important subgroup of patients with hypercortisolism.

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^115RU5ou]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Cushing syndrome results from supraphysiological exposure to glucocorticoids and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis includes administration of corticosteroids (exogenous Cushing syndrome) or autonomous cortisol overproduction, whether or not ACTH-dependent (endogenous Cushing syndrome). An early diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is warranted; however, in clinical practice, it is very challenging partly because of resemblance with other common conditions (i.e. pseudo-Cushing syndrome).

Initial workup should start with excluding local and systemic corticosteroid use. First-line screening tests, including the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion, and late-night salivary cortisol measurement, should be performed to screen for endogenous Cushing syndrome. Scalp hair cortisol/cortisone analysis helps in the assessment of long-term glucocorticoid exposure as well as in the detection of transient periods of hypercortisolism as observed in cyclical Cushing syndrome. Interpretation of results can be difficult because of individual patient characteristics and hence requires awareness of test limitations.

Once endogenous Cushing syndrome is established, measurement of plasma ACTH concentrations differentiates between ACTH-dependent (80%-85%) or ACTH-independent (15%-20%) causes. Further assessment with different imaging modalities and dynamic biochemical testing, including bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling, helps further pinpoint the cause of Cushing's syndrome.

### Salivary cortisol can replace free serum cortisol measurements in patients with septic shock [^114JySDT]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

There is a renewed interest in adrenal function during severe sepsis. Most studies have used total serum cortisol levels; however, only free serum cortisol is biologically active. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of salivary cortisol levels as a surrogate for free serum cortisol levels during septic shock.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven patients with septic shock were studied to determine the correlation between total serum cortisol and salivary cortisol to free serum cortisol levels. Thirty-eight patients were included in the salivary to free serum cortisol correlation. Salivary cortisol level was tested by enzyme immunoassay. Serum total cortisol, free cortisol, and cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) levels were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, equilibrium analysis, and radioimmunoassay, respectively.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD age was 56.6 ± 18.5 years. Fifty-seven percent were women. APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score median was 26, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II median was 61, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment median was 13. The correlation between salivary and free serum cortisol levels was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63–0.89; P < .0001). The correlation between free serum cortisol and total serum cortisol levels was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78–0.92; P < .0001). The mean ± SD free serum cortisol level was 2.27 ± 1.64 μg/dL. The mean ± SD salivary cortisol level was 2.60 ± 2.69 μg/dL. The mean ± SD total serum cortisol level was 21.56 ± 8.71 μg/dL. The mean ± SD CBG level was 23.54 ± 8.33 mg/dL.

### Measurement of serum free cortisol shows discordant responsivity to stress and dynamic evaluation [^116Co2JD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Routinely available assays of adrenal function measure serum total cortisol (TC) and not the biologically active free cortisol (FC). However, there are few data on FC levels during surgical stress and in response to standard pharmacological tests.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to evaluate TC and FC levels in different states of physical stress.

- **Design and setting**: We conducted a prospective observational study in a university hospital.

- **Participants and main outcome measures**: We measured TC and FC levels in 64 patients: group A, 17 healthy controls without stress; group B, 23 medical patients with moderate stress; and group C, 24 surgical patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. Cortisol levels in group C were measured basally and at several time points thereafter and were compared with responsivity to a pharmacological dose of ACTH. FC was measured using equilibrium dialysis.

- **Results**: In group C patients after extubation, the relative increase above basal FC was higher than the increase in TC levels (399 ± 266 vs. 247 ± 132% of initial values, respectively; mean ± SD; P = 0.02) and then fell more markedly, FC levels falling to 67 ± 49% and TC levels to 79 ± 36% (P = 0.04). After ACTH stimulation, TC levels increased to 680 ± 168 nmol/liter, which was similar to the increase with major stress (811 ± 268 nmol/liter). In contrast, FC levels increased to 55 ± 16 nmol/liter after ACTH stimulation but significantly greater with surgical stress to 108 ± 56 nmol/liter (P < 0.001).

The more pronounced increase in FC seen during stress indicates differing responses in adrenal output when analyzed through free cortisol rather than total cortisol.

### Comparison of total cortisol, free cortisol, and surrogate markers of free cortisol in diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in patients with stable cirrhosis [^11431vtW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Measurements of serum levels of total cortisol can overestimate the prevalence of adrenal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis because these patients have low concentrations of corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin. We used measurements of serum total cortisol and serum free cortisol after the low-dose short Synacthen test (LDSST) to assess adrenal dysfunction.

We studied 79 patients with stable cirrhosis, defining adrenal dysfunction by peak concentrations of total cortisol ≤ 494 mmol/L and/or peak concentrations of free cortisol ≤ 33 nmol/L following the LDSST. Free cortisol index (FCI) scores were determined, and free cortisol levels were calculated using Coolens' equation. The Cox regression model was employed to assess the relationship between adrenal dysfunction and outcomes, such as death or liver transplant.

Based on total cortisol measurements, 34% of patients were found to have adrenal dysfunction, while based on free cortisol measurements, 29% were diagnosed with adrenal dysfunction. There was agreement between total cortisol and free cortisol levels in 22% of patients. In 13% of cases, adrenal dysfunction was diagnosed only on the basis of total cortisol, and in 6%, only on the basis of free cortisol (κ coefficient, 0.56; P < .01). Low concentrations of corticosteroid-binding globulin (21 vs 54 μg/mL, P < .01) led to an overestimation of adrenal dysfunction based on total cortisol measurements. Calculated free cortisol measurements consistently overestimated free cortisol concentrations, with variations as large as 87% for baseline values and up to 84% after.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualized for each patient, and the results should be interpreted within the clinical context with an understanding of the potential pitfalls of the test used. If the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high, an alternative test should be performed. Clinical vigilance is required, and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally, and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress doses of glucocorticoids during illness only.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^111grBCK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Referring to additional expert reviews, it should be noted that there are authors who advocate for a more expansive screening approach, for example, in patients with diabetes, stating that the prevalence of CS is underrated in this condition. Our data suggest that the prevalence might indeed be higher in these patient groups. Tabarin and Perez, however, argue against systematic screening approaches because of their limited benefit.

Viewed from another angle, approaches in the diagnosis of CS should be within a reasonable economical frame. As known from a US study, patients with CS have significantly higher health care costs, whereas costs decrease substantially after successful surgery. A Canadian cost-of-illness analysis showed similar results. To minimize health care–related costs, it would be beneficial to diagnose patients as early as possible. However, at the time of writing, it is unclear how to offer extended screening approaches that are reasonably economical.

- **Limitations and strengths**: This study has limitations; the most important is its monocentric design. In some health care systems, the referral for consultations might be more selective because of reimbursement policies, which can affect screening outcomes. Further prospective studies could be beneficial to validate our findings in other health care settings. Our data might be valid for the health care system in Germany but could differ considerably in other countries and health care systems. In addition, we cannot comment on racial disparities.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1154f1Ew]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

In specific circumstances concerning Cushing's syndrome, particularly in patients facing life-threatening complications, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend urgent treatment of hypercortisolism. This should occur within 24–48 hours for patients experiencing life-threatening complications of Cushing's syndrome, including cardiovascular, infectious, or thromboembolic complications, as well as acute psychosis.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1162vUxs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Clinical question III: What is the diagnostic accuracy of a morning cortisol value vs 250 μg ACTH (1–24) test in diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

Three studies were included.

- **Supplementary material**: The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S8. All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value vs a 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test.

- **Methodology**: In the studies of Sagar et al and Sbardella et al, ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay.

- **Results**:
	- In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) passed the ACTH (1–24) test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for ACTH (1–24) testing in included studies).
	- The results of the study by Sbardella et al showed that morning cortisol ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24) test, and morning cortisol ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported.
	- Debono et al found that a baseline serum cortisol > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (data retrieved after contacting the authors).

### Free cortisol and free 21-deoxycortisol in the clinical evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^112GZGTd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with classic CAH and controls have similar free morning cortisol concentrations. In the morning samples (T0), the median total cortisol concentration in patients with untreated classic CAH was 106 nmol/L, significantly lower than patients with NCCAH (249 nmol/L, P = .010) and controls (202 nmol/L, P = .016).

- **Steroid concentrations**: At T0 in patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), adrenal insufficiency but not CAH (AI), and controls (C).
	- (A) Morning (8:00–11:00) concentrations of total cortisol.
	- (B) Morning concentrations of free cortisol.
	- (C) Total 21DF concentrations.
	- (D) Free 21DF concentrations.
	- n.s. nonsignificant, ✱ p ≤ .05, ✱✱ p ≤ .01, ✱✱✱ p ≤ .001. † Excluded from statistical analysis.

Interestingly, the median free morning cortisol concentration in patients with untreated classic CAH (8.62 nmol/L) was not significantly different from patients with NCCAH (9.84 nmol/L, P = .313) and controls (6.94 nmol/L, P = .573). In contrast to the total cortisol concentrations, this suggested a comparable cortisol availability.

Patients with untreated classic CAH had a higher percentage of free cortisol (7.5%) than patients with NCCAH (5.5%, P = .016), patients with AI (2.1%), and controls (3.3%, P < 0.001). This indicated that patients with classic CAH had a higher free cortisol concentration than expected based on their total cortisol concentration.

### Diagnostic approach to Cushing disease [^111CgZ3Q]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

In Cushing disease, a pituitary corticotroph neoplasm causes secondary adrenal hypercortisolism. This condition is associated with known morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for an efficient and accurate diagnostic approach. An 11 p.m. salivary cortisol level is a modern, simple initial screening tool for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Confirmation with a 24-hour urinary free cortisol test and/or a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test may subsequently be performed.

Patients with repeatedly equivocal results should be reevaluated after several months or undergo a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test following low-dose dexamethasone suppression to help rule out pseudo-Cushing states. The presence of low morning serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels then distinguishes primary adrenal hypercortisolism from Cushing disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome. Patients with moderate ACTH levels can undergo CRH stimulation testing to clarify the underlying disease, as those with an ACTH-independent disorder have blunted subsequent ACTH levels.

Once ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia is detected, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pituitary gland can be performed to detect a pituitary neoplasm. Normal or equivocal MR imaging results revealing small pituitary lesions should be followed up with inferior petrosal sinus sampling, a highly specific measure for diagnosing Cushing disease in experienced hands. If necessary, body imaging may be used in turn to detect sources of ectopic ACTH.

### Plasma, salivary and urinary cortisol levels following physiological and stress doses of hydrocortisone in normal volunteers [^1157R9jn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

We confirm that a morning dose of hydrocortisone 20 mg is supraphysiological and excessive for routine maintenance. It results in very high free cortisol concentrations, which lead to increased urinary cortisol excretion. The measurement of plasma, salivary, or urinary cortisol at 2 hours after an oral dose provides a good indication of peak cortisol concentrations; however, further research is required to define optimal targets for salivary cortisol and urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio following true physiological hydrocortisone replacement before recommending these measures in clinical practice.

An intravenous bolus of hydrocortisone 50 mg achieved very high cortisol levels within 30 minutes of administration. Routine biochemical monitoring of stress glucocorticoid supplementation therapy is not recommended, but the measurement of trough levels at 5–6 hours may identify a minority of patients who require more frequent intravenous dosing.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^1143s4p8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

We identified 18 different chief complaints for which patients were transferred to the tertiary center. The three most common reasons were obesity/weight gain (n = 89, 24% of patients), adrenal or pituitary incidentaloma (n = 40, 11%), and hypertension (n = 40, 11%). The frequencies of the chief complaints are listed in Table 2. Half of the patients screened for Cushing syndrome (CS) belonged to groups that are not counted as the priority groups recommended by the 2008 guidelines. CS was diagnosed in 12% of those patients, compared to 39% among those who fall into the screening groups A to C as recommended by the 2008 guidelines.

- **Group A**: Consisted of patients who had unusual features for their age. These were, for example, osteoporosis and osteopenia, which were chief complaints in 12 patients, of whom 7 (58%) received a final diagnosis of CS. Hypertension, mostly of new onset, was found in the consultation recommendation notes of 40 patients, and CS was confirmed in 5 (13%).

- **Group B**: Patients had multiple and progressive features, particularly those that are more predictive of CS. Eighteen patients presented with multiple symptoms (defined as more than three typical symptoms for CS), and CS was diagnosed in 15 (83%). Myopathy was the chief complaint in 14 patients, and CS was confirmed in 9 (64%).

### Gender determines serum free cortisol: Higher levels in men [^113Y6jcQ]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Because only the free fraction of serum cortisol can readily access glucocorticoid receptors, we investigated whether or not a gender-related difference in serum free cortisol (FC) exists in the basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated state.

- **Methods**: Serum total cortisol (TC) and FC were measured in 323 subjects (175 men; 148 women). Additionally, the low-dose 1-μg ACTH test was performed in 56 subjects (30 women, 26 men). Subjects were healthy volunteers, recruited in a preventive medicine screening program and an outpatient clinic.

- **Results**: Overall, basal serum TC and FC levels were approximately 18% and 33% higher, respectively, in men than in women. Specifically, TC was 14.5 ± 0.33 μg/dL in men compared to 12.3 ± 0.33 μg/dL in women (p < 0.0001), while FC was 0.68 ± 0.02 μg/dL in men versus 0.51 ± 0.02 μg/dL in women (p < 0.0001). The higher FC in men relative to women was apparent across a wide age range (17 to 86 years) and persisted after adjustment for age and body mass index. The FC fraction (%FC, out of TC) was concordantly higher in men (5.4 ± 0.09% vs. 4.8 ± 0.3%; p = 0.046). FC was not related to the estimated menopausal status (women age below and above 47, 50, or 53 years). ACTH-stimulated FC levels were significantly higher in men compared to women, as reflected by the area under the response curve (49.4 ± 3.4 μg × min vs. 39.6 ± 2.2 μg × min; p = 0.0014).

- **Conclusion**: Gender is an unrecognized determinant of serum FC in humans. The possibility of lifelong exposure to the higher bioactive fraction of cortisol under basal conditions or daily stress involving ACTH stimulation should be further investigated in this context.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115huAMA]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically concerning the confirmation of recovery, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining morning serum cortisol testing if confirmation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery is desired. Recognize that the value of morning serum cortisol is a continuum, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.

### Cushing's syndrome: Rapid evidence review [^115H6qjN]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, more specifically with respect to initial laboratory testing, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following tests for screening for hypercortisolism:

- **24-hour urinary free cortisol**: This measurement evaluates the amount of cortisol excreted in the urine over a 24-hour period, providing crucial insight into cortisol production.

- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: This non-invasive test measures cortisol levels in saliva, often collected at home, to address the effects of circadian rhythm fluctuations.

- **1-mg dexamethasone suppression tests**: This involves administering 1 mg of dexamethasone orally and measuring the suppression of cortisol levels the following morning to assess adrenal function.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The Endocrine Society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^112dqvex]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The main finding of this study is that the 2008 Endocrine Society guideline recommendations are valid and identified roughly 73% of cases presenting with unusual features for age, multiple and progressive features, and incidentaloma in our prospective series covering 10 years between 2012 and 2021. On the other hand, other chief complaints than those mentioned earlier were present in 27% of patients with Cushing syndrome, which should be considered in clinical practice.

- **Implications for clinical practice**: In our experience, half the patients submitted for screening of Cushing syndrome in our specialized center did not belong to one of the recommended groups for screening. As Cushing syndrome is a severe disease when left untreated or diagnosed late — leading to increased mortality and morbidity — the sensitivity of screening should be conceptually high to avoid false-negative results. Although the frequency of Cushing syndrome was low in some categories of chief complaints, our data do not argue against screening in those instances.

Psychiatric disorders were a very uncommon reason for patient referrals for screening. This is interesting, as depression or other psychiatric disorders are very common in patients with Cushing syndrome, affecting up to 80% of patients. The prevalence of depression is high, but Cushing syndrome seems to be seldom suspected in this group. Future studies are needed to analyze the prevalence of Cushing syndrome in patients with psychiatric disorders. PCOS-like symptoms were a common reason for consultation. In a retrospective study, Brzana et al. showed a high prevalence of former treatment for suspected PCOS.

### High variability in baseline urinary free cortisol values in patients with Cushing's disease [^113Q6sKZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite shortcomings, urinary free cortisol (UFC) measurements are often used in medical practice to diagnose Cushing's disease, assess remission after pituitary surgery, evaluate the efficacy of medical treatments, and monitor for recurrence. The reliability and reproducibility of this test are crucial. The Endocrine Society recommends that at least two 24-hour UFC measurements should be conducted for diagnosing Cushing's syndrome. It is, however, currently unclear whether two 24-hour collections are sufficient to establish a reasonable estimate of the secretory activity of the underlying pituitary adenoma or whether more than two measurements are necessary. Furthermore, the level of intra-individual variability when using this test is unknown.

The aim of this study was to use the four baseline UFC measurements taken from each patient in the randomized, double-blind, Phase III study of pasireotide (NCT00434148) to quantify the intrapatient variability of UFC levels in patients with Cushing's disease. Additionally, the study aimed to determine whether a greater number of UFC measurements leads to greater accuracy of UFC measurement and more precise estimation of intrapatient variation, and whether UFC levels correlate with the severity of clinical features of hypercortisolism.

### Free cortisol and free 21-deoxycortisol in the clinical evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^116vKBQq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This study is the first to evaluate free cortisol and free 21-deoxycortisol (21DF) concentrations in patients with untreated classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), including both 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) and 11-hydroxylase deficiency (11OHD), as well as non-classical CAH (NCCAH), other forms of adrenal insufficiency (AI), and controls. The findings indicate that despite lower total cortisol concentrations, free cortisol concentrations were similar in untreated classic CAH patients and controls in an unstimulated state. This could explain the mild or absent symptoms of cortisol deficiency observed in some patients with classic 21OHD or 11OHD. Additionally, patients with classic 21OHD exhibited elevated concentrations of total and free 21DF, which was not observed in patients with AI and controls, thereby increasing glucocorticoid activity. After Synacthen administration, patients with classic CAH showed no increase in total cortisol concentrations and a minimal increase in free cortisol concentrations, whereas patients with classic 21OHD displayed increased free 21DF concentrations. This might explain the survival of these patients during stress without glucocorticoid treatment.

A method using LC-MS/MS was developed to measure free cortisol and free 21DF. The mean free cortisol percentage in controls was 3.7%, consistent with previous findings of 3.95%. The relative increase in free cortisol concentration (610%) after Synacthen was greater than the relative increase in total cortisol (198%), aligning with other studies. Therefore, evaluating free concentrations may provide more informative insights than total concentrations.

Glucocorticoids perform numerous functions and are particularly necessary during stress. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor glucocorticoid levels accurately.

### Salivary cortisone reflects cortisol exposure under physiological conditions and after hydrocortisone [^115dMkJn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we tested the use of salivary cortisol and cortisone as alternatives to serum cortisol. Salivary cortisol is often undetectable and contaminated by hydrocortisone, whereas salivary cortisone strongly reflects serum cortisol.

### Measurements of serum free cortisol in critically ill patients [^114NPj2V]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Because more than 90 percent of circulating cortisol in human serum is protein-bound, changes in the binding proteins can alter measured serum total cortisol concentrations without influencing free concentrations of this hormone. We investigated the effect of decreased amounts of cortisol-binding proteins on serum total and free cortisol concentrations during critical illness, when glucocorticoid secretion is maximally stimulated.

- **Methods**: Base-line serum total cortisol, cosyntropin-stimulated serum total cortisol, aldosterone, and free cortisol concentrations were measured in 66 critically ill patients and 33 healthy volunteers in groups that were similar with regard to sex and age. Of the 66 patients, 36 had hypoproteinemia (albumin concentration, 2.5 g per deciliter or less), and 30 had near-normal serum albumin concentrations (above 2.5 g per deciliter).

- **Results**: Base-line and cosyntropin-stimulated serum total cortisol concentrations were lower in the patients with hypoproteinemia than in those with near-normal serum albumin concentrations (P < 0.001). However, the mean (± SD) base-line serum free cortisol concentrations were similar in the two groups of patients (5.1 ± 4.1 and 5.2 ± 3.5 microg per deciliter [140.7 ± 113.1 and 143.5 ± 96.6 nmol per liter]) and were several times higher than the values in controls (0.6 ± 0.3 microg per deciliter [16.6 ± 8.3 nmol per liter], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Cosyntropin-stimulated serum total cortisol concentrations were subnormal (18.5 microg per deciliter [510.4 nmol per liter] or less) in 14 of the patients.

### Overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test and 24 h urine free cortisol-accuracy and pitfalls when screening for Cushing's syndrome [^116kxSES]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) is often delayed due to variable clinical features and its rarity. Simple and accurate screening tests are required to enhance screening for hypercortisolism. Both the overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and urinary free cortisol (UFC) demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CS. However, each test has its own distinctive features, making it preferable in specific clinical conditions. This review will discuss the pitfalls of each of these tests.
