## Question

CAT screening for COPD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the CAT can be used for COPD screening and how to approach "CAT screening for COPD". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terminology because CAT may be confused with actual screening tools. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about COPD screening in asymptomatic adults. Next, I will review why screening is or is not beneficial and whether there are context-specific exceptions. After that, I need to identify validated screening instruments and the required diagnostic confirmation. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, including where the CAT properly fits into care pathways, and ensure my conclusions align with high-quality evidence and guidelines [^111TqToy] [^113eVjqR].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate tools with different purposes. CAT stands for the COPD Assessment Test, a patient-reported measure used to quantify symptom burden and health status in people with established COPD; it is not a screening instrument for undiagnosed populations, whereas CAPTURE is a validated screening tool intended to identify individuals at risk who should proceed to confirmatory testing, typically including peak flow and then spirometry if positive; I almost thought CAT might be used for screening, but wait, let me verify — CAPTURE, not CAT, is the screening tool by design, and CAT is for assessment after diagnosis, which aligns with guideline frameworks that separate assessment from diagnostic case-finding [^114FgjLb] [^112FyEAf].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on screening asymptomatic adults. The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults with a D recommendation, concluding with moderate certainty that population screening confers no net benefit; this was established in 2016 and reaffirmed in 2022, so I need to be careful not to over-extend any questionnaire, including CAPTURE, to asymptomatic general populations outside of case-finding contexts [^113gDXhw] [^111TqToy] [^112RCC3U].

> I will now examine GOLD's position so I don't miss nuance. GOLD does not endorse population screening; instead, it endorses active case-finding in individuals with symptoms and/or risk factors, with diagnostic confirmation requiring post-bronchodilator spirometry showing an FEV1/FVC less than 0.70; hold on, I should verify the exact diagnostic requirement — yes, post-bronchodilator spirometry is required to establish the diagnosis [^113eVjqR] [^115AHYBD].

> Let me consider other professional society guidance to ensure consistency. The ACP/ACCP/ATS/ERS guideline explicitly recommends against using spirometry to screen asymptomatic individuals, reserving spirometry for those with respiratory symptoms suggestive of airflow obstruction; this aligns with the non-screening stance and reinforces that screening in asymptomatic adults should not be pursued [^111n1mZL] [^115HcBUH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without understanding the rationale. The central reasons against routine screening in asymptomatic adults are lack of demonstrated improvements in morbidity, mortality, or quality of life from screen-detected disease, and potential harms from false positives and unnecessary interventions; I should double-check that the evidence synthesis indeed found no outcome benefit — yes, that is precisely the USPSTF's conclusion [^111TqToy] [^112RCC3U].

> But wait, what if the context is different, such as in low- and middle-income countries with extreme underdiagnosis and high-risk exposures. I need to check that evidence: studies from Nepal, Peru, and Uganda show over 95% of identified COPD cases were previously undiagnosed, with nearly half having clinically significant disease; this suggests that targeted screening in high-prevalence, resource-limited settings may be justified if linked to diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, which differs from the USPSTF's asymptomatic US population context [^114wWUYp] [^115w2bUS].

> Next, I should review practical screening instruments where screening is contextually justified. CAPTURE uses five questions and peak flow and performs best in its intended configuration; COPD-SQ has been implemented in large community efforts in China with score thresholds to triage to spirometry; older questionnaires show reasonable sensitivity and moderate specificity, but I need to ensure any positive screen always flows to confirmatory post-bronchodilator spirometry before labeling COPD, which is a non-negotiable diagnostic step per guidelines [^114FgjLb] [^113VYEYi] [^112GCmd6] [^113eVjqR].

> I should confirm real-world implementation because screening alone is ineffective without downstream action. In a US primary care program, only 19% of patients with positive screens received any respiratory-related clinician action, underscoring that without accessible spirometry and care pathways, screening yields little impact; similarly, lung health check programs integrating spirometry illustrate case-finding opportunities but also reveal gaps in confirmatory testing and treatment uptake that must be addressed proactively [^116ZgT9e] [^114hCEG5].

> Let me synthesize the use-case by setting so the recommendations are precise. For asymptomatic adults in high-income settings like the US, do not screen; instead, pursue active case-finding in symptomatic or high-risk patients and confirm diagnosis with post-bronchodilator spirometry, whereas in LMICs or systems with profound underdiagnosis and high exposure burdens, targeted, programmatic screening linked to spirometry and treatment access can be reasonable; I need to ensure I distinguish screening from diagnosis and from symptom assessment throughout [^111TqToy] [^113gDXhw] [^115AHYBD] [^114wWUYp].

> Now, I should clarify exactly where CAT fits so there's no residual ambiguity. CAT should be used after a COPD diagnosis to quantify symptom burden and guide management and follow-up, not as an initial screening test in undiagnosed populations; I almost stated CAT could help screen high-risk smokers, but wait — that would misapply the tool and contradict guideline-concordant care pathways that reserve symptom assessment tools for established COPD [^112FyEAf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the take-home is crisp and reference-aligned. CAT is not a COPD screening test; do not screen asymptomatic adults for COPD in settings following USPSTF and ACP/ACCP/ATS/ERS guidance; use active case-finding for symptomatic or high-risk individuals with diagnostic confirmation by post-bronchodilator spirometry; consider targeted, pathway-linked screening strategies in LMICs with severe underdiagnosis and high exposures, and if screening is pursued, use validated tools like CAPTURE or COPD-SQ with obligatory confirmatory spirometry and treatment linkage; reassess symptom burden after diagnosis using CAT to inform ongoing management [^111TqToy] [^111n1mZL] [^113eVjqR] [^114FgjLb] [^113VYEYi] [^114wWUYp].

The CAT is a **validated, 8-item questionnaire** that quantifies COPD symptom burden and impact on daily life, with scores from 0 to 40. It is **not a diagnostic tool** and should not be used to screen asymptomatic individuals [^111TqToy]; diagnosis requires post-bronchodilator spirometry [^115HcBUH] (FEV₁/FVC < 0.70) [^113eVjqR]. The CAT is recommended for routine monitoring to guide treatment and assess response, but it does not replace spirometry or imaging [^113kCmXQ].

---

## Structure and scoring of the CAT

- **Items**: 8 (cough, sputum, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence, sleep, energy)
- **Scoring**: 0–5 per item; total 0–40
- **Interpretation**: Higher scores = greater impact

| **Score range** | **Impact level** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 0–10 | Low | Minimal impact |
| 11–20 | Medium | Moderate impact |
| 21–30 | High | Severe impact |
| 31–40 | Very high | Very severe impact |

---

## Clinical utility of the CAT

The CAT is a **practical tool** for routine clinical use, providing a standardized measure of symptom burden and health status. It is **quick and easy to administer** and helps clinicians:

- **Monitor symptoms**: Track changes over time [^113VuywN]
- **Guide treatment**: Inform therapy adjustments [^112FyEAf]
- **Assess response**: Evaluate interventions

---

## Limitations of the CAT

Despite its utility, the CAT has **important limitations**:

- **Not diagnostic**: Cannot confirm COPD; spirometry is required [^113eVjqR] [^115HcBUH]
- **Subjective**: Influenced by patient perception and comorbidities [^111ErqJW]
- **Not for asymptomatic screening**: Should not be used in asymptomatic adults [^113gDXhw] [^111TqToy]

---

## Comparison with other screening tools

The CAT is **one of several tools** for COPD assessment:

| **Criterion** | **CAT** | **Spirometry** | **Chest CT** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Purpose | Symptom assessment [^112FyEAf] | Diagnostic [^113eVjqR] | Imaging [^113kCmXQ] |
| Strengths | - Simple <br/> - Validated <br/> - Widely used [^112FyEAf] | - Objective <br/> - Gold standard [^115HcBUH] | Detailed lung structure [^113kCmXQ] |
| Limitations | - Not diagnostic <br/> - Subjective [^113eVjqR] | Requires equipment/training [^114SZhXd] | - Expensive <br/> - Radiation exposure [^114efsXe] |

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **emphasize the CAT's role** in monitoring and management. GOLD 2025 recommends using the CAT to assess symptom burden and guide therapy, whereas **USPSTF 2022** advises against screening asymptomatic adults for COPD [^111TqToy].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

The CAT can **improve outcomes** by enabling early detection of worsening symptoms and guiding targeted therapy adjustments. It also enhances patient engagement and supports self-management.

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

Effective use of the CAT requires **clinician training** in administration and interpretation, as well as integration into clinical workflows. Patient education is also essential to explain its purpose and importance.

---

The CAT is a **useful tool** for assessing symptom burden and guiding management in COPD, but it is not diagnostic [^113eVjqR] and should not be used to screen asymptomatic individuals [^111TqToy]. It complements spirometry and imaging in comprehensive care [^113kCmXQ].

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111TqToy]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible reduction of airflow in the lungs. Progression to severe disease can prevent participation in normal activities because of deterioration of lung function. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 6% of US adults had been diagnosed with COPD. Chronic lower respiratory disease, composed mainly of COPD, is the sixth leading cause of death in the US.

- **Objective**: To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update that focused on targeted key questions for benefits and harms of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults and treatment in screen-detected or screen-relevant adults.

- **Population**: Asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms.

- **Evidence assessment**: Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults has no net benefit.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults (D recommendation).

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining spirometry to establish a COPD diagnosis. This is done by eliciting a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70, confirming the presence of persistent airflow limitation.

In the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly concerning the management of acute exacerbations involving invasive ventilation, the 2016 BTS/ICS guidelines recommend considering the use of prognostic tools. These tools are intended to inform discussions on prognosis and the appropriateness of invasive ventilation. However, it is important to recognize that such tools are poorly predictive for use with individual patients.

### Unmet diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in low- and middle-income countries [^114wWUYp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most prevalent of the chronic respiratory diseases that, combined, are the third most common cause of death worldwide. COPD is associated with systematic disadvantage through the life course and respiratory exposures. The greatest burden of COPD, therefore, falls in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which account for 75% of the cases, 80% of the deaths, and considerable morbidity, premature mortality, and lost productivity.

There are many challenges to mitigating COPD in LMICs, notably underdiagnosis, absence of LMIC-relevant evidence and guidelines, access to affordable interventions, and heterogeneous implementation of evidence-based care. Changing this requires an investment in healthcare staff, services, and facilities. Better care for COPD in LMICs begins with improved access to diagnostics. We have recently reported on the discriminative accuracy of simple screening tools to identify people at high risk for COPD in three diverse LMIC sites in Nepal, Peru, and Uganda. The overall prevalence of COPD was 9.4%, and this varied by site. Forty-nine percent of the cases had clinically significant disease, and more than 95% were previously undiagnosed. Our findings contrast with recommendations from the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, which recently reiterated their statement that screening-detected cases of COPD are generally mild, for which intervention other than smoking cessation is not indicated. This is not true in LMIC settings.

After a diagnosis of COPD, the next consideration is implementation.

### Unmet need in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Middle East and Africa region: An expert panel consensus [^115vgobm]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a significant impact on healthcare systems and health-related quality of life. The increased prevalence of smoking is an important factor contributing to the high burden of COPD in the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Several other factors, including sedentary lifestyle, urbanization, second-hand smoke, air pollution, and occupational exposure, are also responsible for the upsurge of COPD in the MEA.

Frequent COPD exacerbations accelerate disease progression, progressively deteriorate lung function, and negatively affect quality of life. This consensus is based on a review of the published evidence, international and regional guidelines, and insights provided by the expert committee members from the MEA region.

Spirometry, though the gold standard for diagnosis, is often unavailable and/or underutilized, leading to underdiagnosis of COPD in primary care settings. Low adherence to treatment guidelines and delayed use of appropriate combination therapy, including triple therapy, are additional barriers in the management of COPD in the MEA. It is necessary to recognize COPD as a screenable condition and develop easy and simple screening tools to facilitate early diagnosis.

Knowledge of the disease symptomatology at the patient and physician levels and adherence to international or regional guidelines are important to create awareness about the harmful effects of smoking and to develop national guidelines to focus on the prevention of COPD. The implementation of vaccination programs and pulmonary rehabilitation are equally valuable for managing patients with COPD.

### Meeting unmet needs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis and treatment in low- and middle-income countries [^115w2bUS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

COPD underdiagnosis is a global challenge, with higher rates in LMICs both at the population level and in clinical practice. In a population-based COPD screening study in Nigeria, more than 99% of persons identified to have COPD were previously undiagnosed. The PUMA (Prevalence Study and Regular Practice, Diagnosis and Treatment, among General Practitioners in Populations at Risk of COPD in Latin America) study, a primary care screening study in four Latin American countries, revealed a 77% rate of COPD underdiagnosis. Inadequate knowledge about COPD diagnosis and treatment among doctors, low community literacy about COPD, and an absence of local management strategies or guidelines in LMICs likely contribute to high rates of underdiagnosis. In India, about 1% of the population had ever heard of COPD, and most had a poor understanding of the disease.

Besides, respiratory symptoms, particularly cough and poor exercise tolerance, are often considered part of normal aging in some LMICs, and care is usually not sought. Notably, older adults in African movies are often depicted as persons with cough.

In this issue of the journal, Florman and colleagues provide underpinning data that highlight the magnitude of the problem of COPD underdiagnosis and undertreatment in LMICs. By describing unmet therapeutic opportunities among 1,000 persons with COPD identified through the screening of randomly selected population-based samples in three LMICs (Nepal, Peru, and Uganda), they show how ubiquitous the problem is.

### Assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111ErqJW]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is important to establish an accurate diagnosis, assist in making therapeutic decisions, measure outcomes for clinical and research purposes, and determine prognosis. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans are useful in patients who present with airflow limitation and clinical features suggestive of COPD but in whom other diagnoses are being considered. In such cases, a chest CT may indicate another diagnosis.

The amount and distribution of emphysema can identify outcomes from lung volume reduction surgery, and chest CT scans are mandatory in the assessment of patients for this surgery. Quantitative parameters from chest CT scans have been used to define the longitudinal progression of the disease.

Assessment of patients with COPD for both clinical and research purposes should incorporate a variety of different outcomes. There are outcome measures that have been successfully incorporated into large clinical trials, and the design and outcomes of these trials can be used to plan future clinical investigations in COPD.

There is little direct evidence about the management of COVID-19 in people with COPD. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion of COVID-19 in patients with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, and should test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients should continue taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, as there is no evidence that COPD medications should be changed during this COVID-19 pandemic.

### Low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer: How strong is the evidence [^116ouSvs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended low-dose computed tomographic (CT) screening for high-risk and former smokers with a B recommendation, indicating a level of certainty that it offered a moderate to substantial net benefit. Under the Affordable Care Act, the USPSTF recommendation requires commercial insurers to fully cover low-dose CT. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is now considering whether to also offer coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.

Although the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose CT, implementation of national screening may be premature. The magnitude of benefit from routine screening is uncertain; estimates are based on data from a single study and simulation models commissioned by the USPSTF.

- **Potential harms**: These could affect a large population and include false-positive results, anxiety, radiation exposure, diagnostic workups, and the resulting complications. It is unclear if routine screening would result in net benefit or net harm.

The NLST may not be generalizable to a national screening program for the Medicare age group because 73% of NLST participants were younger than 65 years. Moreover, screening outside of trial conditions is less likely to be restricted to high-risk smokers and qualified imaging centers with responsible referral protocols. Until better data are available for older adults who are screened in ordinary (non-trial) community settings, CMS should postpone coverage of low-dose CT screening for Medicare beneficiaries.

### Diagnosis and management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society [^111n1mZL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This guideline is an official statement of the American College of Physicians (ACP), American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS). It represents an update of the 2007 ACP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is intended for clinicians who manage patients with COPD. This guideline addresses the value of history and physical examination for predicting airflow obstruction, the value of spirometry for screening or diagnosis of COPD, and COPD management strategies, specifically evaluating various inhaled therapies such as anticholinergics, long-acting β-agonists, and corticosteroids, as well as pulmonary rehabilitation programs and supplemental oxygen therapy.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a targeted literature update from March 2007 to December 2009 to evaluate the evidence and update the 2007 ACP clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of stable COPD.

	- **Recommendation 1**: ACP, ACCP, ATS, and ERS recommend that spirometry should be obtained to diagnose airflow obstruction in patients with respiratory symptoms (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Spirometry should not be used to screen for airflow obstruction in individuals without respiratory symptoms (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Screening for lung cancer: 2023 guideline update from the American Cancer Society [^113FrFr9]. CA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in relation to indications for screening using low-dose CT, the ACS 2024 guidelines recommend providing evidence-based smoking cessation counseling and offering interventions to smokers before initiating lung cancer screening. It is important to engage individuals in a shared decision-making discussion about the benefits, limitations, and harms of lung cancer screening. Screening should be discontinued in individuals with comorbidities that substantially limit life expectancy.

### Issues in pulmonary function testing for the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Bo2iE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review article is to provide an up-to-date summary of the evidence for, or against the use of lung function tests as screening and diagnostic tools for airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to consider the relevant issues in context.

COPD is characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation with only partial reversibility on lung function testing. However, screening on a population basis or of an enriched 'at-risk' subset, such as chronic smokers, is not supported by findings from previous epidemiological studies, screening trials, or in currently published clinical management guidelines by professional societies and review bodies. The definition of airflow obstruction and the classification of disease severity of COPD also differ slightly between guidelines and statements from different professional societies.

Given the experience from previous screening trials and the controversial classification of airflow obstruction by severity, it is impossible to have accurate screening results for COPD based on lung function tests alone. Clinical respiratory symptoms should be taken into consideration for the diagnosis and management of COPD, as well as in any screening trial or program that is to be attempted or implemented.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition and epidemiology [^111mjBjC]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continues to cause a heavy health and economic burden in the United States and around the world. Some well-known risk factors for COPD include smoking, occupational exposures, air pollution, airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma, and certain genetic variations. However, many questions remain, such as why less than 20% of smokers develop substantial airway obstruction.

There are several different definitions of COPD, and these definitions depend on accurate diagnosis. Small differences in the definition can have large effects on the estimates of COPD in the population. In addition, newer measures, such as functional status or exercise capability, have emerged as important in determining the prognosis of COPD patients. Evidence continues to emerge that COPD represents several different disease processes, with potentially different interventions required.

In most parts of the world, COPD prevalence and mortality are still increasing and will probably continue to rise in response to increases in smoking, particularly among women and adolescents. Resources aimed at smoking cessation and prevention, COPD education, early detection, and better treatment will be of most benefit in our continuing efforts against this important cause of morbidity and mortality.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a population study [^111jiXC2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, our data show that COPD is very common among adults in China. In particular, early COPD is prevalent among people aged 50–59 years, those with severe respiratory symptoms, and those with a family history of bronchial asthma and COPD. The use of screening questionnaires in combination with pulmonary function tests should be considered a COPD screening strategy that can be implemented at the primary level in China, with the goal of preventing and early detecting the disease and reducing its incidence, disability, and mortality, thus making it a public health priority.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: What is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient [^1122Przq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms overlapping those of other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but more than 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and monitoring the progression of the disease.

Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; thus, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program aimed at reducing COPD risk and delaying or limiting the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations can also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD.

With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, the implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: A pictorial review [^114eZciL]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The expected increase in thoracic, tailored rule-out CT examinations will urge the general radiologist to gain confidence in detecting and reporting alternative diagnoses on regular thoracic CT or CTA examinations requested in the setting of acute chest pain. Familiarity with some of the aortic, coronary, pericardial, and pulmonary diagnoses, and the sometimes subtle imaging findings, will help to suggest alternative diagnoses, thereby avoiding diagnostic delay.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A population study [^116NPoPL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a heterogeneous pulmonary condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms, is caused by persistent airflow obstruction due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, associated with high morbidity, disability, and mortality. Currently, as there is no internationally accepted definition of early COPD and no relevant information, data must be extrapolated from known patients with mild to moderate COPD. A large proportion consists of patients with grade I and grade II severity as per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria, with mild symptoms, which should be considered the early stages of COPD.

Growth in COPD continues due to the rapidly increasing smoking rates in developing countries in addition to the aging population in developed countries. Prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment of COPD is a worldwide concern. At the time of writing, data on COPD are ambiguous, and so have not resulted in the widespread implementation of similar screening for COPD in most health economies, including China. In order to fill this gap, the Shenzhen Qianhai Shekou Free Trade Zone Hospital launched a public health project titled "Screening and Early Diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" on March 27, 2022. On November 15, 2022, Professor Chen Rongchang led the launch of the "Happy Breathing" China COPD Standardized Graded Diagnosis and Treatment Promotion Project in Shenzhen, which is based on the Nanshan District Medical Group Respiratory Disease Prevention and Treatment Regional Disciplinary.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A population study [^113Qjo3w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition leading to further morbidity and significant mortality, there is still limited data on screening for COPD. This study aimed to establish an early COPD screening system for the community and hospitals in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen City to improve the rate of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with COPD.

- **Methods**: We identified individuals at high risk of COPD using a questionnaire survey and analyzed the relevant influencing factors in the early stages of COPD in high-risk groups.

- **Results**: We collected a total of 5,000 COPD screening questionnaires, and 449 patients were diagnosed with COPD through pulmonary function examination. The prevalence of COPD among individuals aged 20 and above in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen City was estimated to be 8.98%, based on a sample size of 5,000. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria, the severity classification was as follows: GOLD I accounted for 34.74%; GOLD II for 37.64%; GOLD III for 16.04%; and GOLD IV for 11.58%. Common features of early COPD identified were: (1) patients were primarily males, comprising 68.0%; (2) COPD was common in people aged 50–59 years, comprising 31%; (3) 96.0% of patients often had severe respiratory symptoms and frequent coughs even when not having a cold; (4) 57.2% experienced shortness of breath when walking quickly on level ground or climbing gentle slopes.

### The clinical impact of high resolution computed tomography in patients with respiratory disease [^114oRizd]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography is widely used to investigate patients with suspected diffuse lung disease. Numerous studies have assessed the diagnostic performance of this investigation, but the diagnostic and therapeutic impacts have received little attention. The diagnostic and therapeutic impacts of high-resolution computed tomography in routine clinical practice were evaluated prospectively. All 507 referrals for high-resolution computed tomography over 12 months in two centers were included. Requesting clinicians completed questionnaires before and after the investigation, detailing clinical indications, working diagnoses, confidence level in each diagnosis, and planned investigations and treatments.

Three hundred and fifty-four studies on 347 patients had complete data and were available for analysis. Following high-resolution computed tomography, a new leading diagnosis (the diagnosis with the highest confidence level) emerged in 204 (58%) studies; in 166 (47%) studies, the new leading diagnosis was not in the original differential diagnosis. Mean confidence in the leading diagnosis increased from 6.7 to 8.5 out of 10 (p < 0.001). The invasiveness of planned investigations increased in 23 (7%) studies and decreased in 124 (35%) studies. The treatment plan was modified after 319 (90%) studies.

Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography alters the leading diagnosis, increases diagnostic confidence, and frequently changes investigation and management plans.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112HQBsk]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the GOLD 2025 guidelines emphasize the need to recognize several key aspects:

- **Characterization of COPD**: COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, sputum production, and exacerbations due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

- **Gene-environment interactions**: COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over an individual's lifetime, potentially damaging the lungs and/or altering their normal development and aging processes.

- **Environmental exposures**: The main environmental exposures leading to COPD include tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution. Other environmental and host factors, such as abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging, can also contribute.

- **Genetic risk factors**: The most relevant, although rare, genetic risk factor for COPD identified at the time of writing is mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. A number of other genetic variants have been associated with reduced lung function and an increased risk of COPD, but their individual effect sizes are small.

### New horizons in early stage COPD: Improving knowledge, detection and treatment [^112gRrHX]. Respiratory medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Early stage COPD carries a significant healthcare burden that is currently underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. Furthermore, patients at this stage can rapidly decline to advanced disease, especially if they continue to smoke. The natural history of the disease in early stages remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that we are able to reduce lung function decline and exacerbations and improve quality of life in early stage COPD, mainly through smoking cessation. However, new evidence from randomized clinical trials also suggests an impact of pharmacotherapy on clinical outcomes in early disease. Guidelines need to be updated to reflect this greater understanding of early stage disease, and trials need to be conducted to definitively show the benefits of intensive treatment so that we can meet the large, unmet clinical needs of this important patient group.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment [^116mGrfY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Radiographic findings in pneumonia generally fall into three categories: 1) focal non-segmental or lobar pneumonia, 2) multifocal bronchopneumonia, and 3) focal or diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In patients who clinically improve, ATS/IDSA guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up chest imaging. However, in cases where clinical presentation is atypical despite radiographic evidence of pneumonia, repeat CXR is advised to rule out alternative diagnoses. Besides, repeat CXR can show progression of disease, but more importantly, may reveal fluid collections (rarely abscess, more commonly pleural effusions), which could represent lack of source control, like empyema requiring drainage (Fig. 2). Radiographic resolution can lag days to weeks beyond clinical improvement. In patients under 50 and those with mild-to-moderate pneumonia, radiographic infiltrates typically resolve within four weeks. Conversely, resolution may take up to 10 weeks in older patients, those with multiple comorbidities and COPD, or severe pneumonia. Slow radiographic resolution alone is not an indicator of treatment failure.

- **Point-of-care LUS**: Point-of-care LUS can also be beneficial as it is more sensitive than CXR for identifying pleural effusions and can identify fluid characteristics that suggest the presence of an empyema. While LUS avoids the cost and radiation of CT, it requires technical expertise and is less effective for assessing pathology deep to the lung pleura.

- **Repeat imaging for non-resolving pneumonia**: For non-resolving pneumonia or clinical deterioration, repeat imaging — especially chest CT scan — is strongly recommended.

### The role of chest computed tomography in the evaluation and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113fwknU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to compile recent data on the clinical associations of computed tomography (CT) scan findings in the literature and potential avenues for implementation into clinical practice.

Recent findings indicate that airways dysanapsis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary vascular metrics have all been associated with poor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes when controlled for clinically relevant covariables. This includes the risk of mortality in the case of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Other authors suggest that CT scans may provide insight into both lung parenchymal damage and other clinically important comorbidities in COPD.

In summary, CT scan findings in COPD relate to clinical outcomes. There is a continued need to develop processes to best implement the results of these studies into clinical practice.

### Screening for lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114efsXe]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for non-small cell lung cancer, specifically in relation to screening indications and the use of low-dose CT, the ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for asymptomatic individuals aged 55–77 years. This applies to those with a history of smoking at least 30 pack-years, who are either current smokers or have quit within the past 15 years.

### The guideline approach to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: how effective [^113PuaLq]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed to assist health care decisions in specific clinical circumstances. They initially emerged to improve the quality of care by reducing unexplained practice variation, controlling health care costs, fostering evidence-based decision-making, and accelerating the application of new advances in medical science to everyday practice. Unfortunately, multiple studies demonstrate the incomplete and varied effectiveness of clinical practice guidelines in altering clinician behavior and improving patient outcomes. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have concentrated on improving the methods for guideline development, diffusion, dissemination, and implementation.

Despite evidence of limited effectiveness, more than 40 clinical practice guidelines related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been published since 1985. The present article reviews those guidelines, provides evidence for their effectiveness, and discusses approaches to improve their implementation.

### Diagnosis and treatment outcomes from prebronchodilator spirometry performed alongside lung cancer screening in a lung health check programme [^114hCEG5]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide health problem that causes significant morbidity and mortality and shares the common risk factor of smoking with lung cancer. It is widely recognized that COPD is underdiagnosed, but screening for the disease in asymptomatic adults is not recommended by either the United Kingdom National Screening Committee or the United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF). In comparison, the most recent Global Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines advocate active case finding in individuals with symptoms and/or risk factors, alongside aggressive identification and management of coexisting comorbidities.

In the United Kingdom, several programs have offered low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer as part of a lung health check (LHC), whereby a number of interventions (screening, prebronchodilator spirometry, smoking cessation) are offered as a bundle to improve lung health. Studies have reported between 10% and 20% of screening attendees having symptomatic undiagnosed airflow obstruction (AO) detected by these programmes. However, there is limited evidence of subsequent downstream events, such as the proportion of individuals who undergo postbronchodilator spirometry as a formal diagnostic test for COPD. Only one study has reported treatment outcomes in this context, with 11% of individuals commencing new pharmacotherapy and 2% entering a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Here, we present the downstream clinical assessment and management as a result of spirometry offered as part of an LHC in the Yor.

### The changing definition and perception of COPD [^113fLp8N]. Respiratory Care (2022). Low credibility.

COPD remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The impact of smoking and air pollution remains significant as causative factors. The traditional classification of COPD includes the overlap of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. More recently, the COPDGene definition includes the terms possible, probable, and definite COPD. These are supported by findings from exposures, symptoms, spirometry, and radiologic imaging. This new approach can lead to earlier diagnosis and modification of risk factors, earlier therapeutic intervention, and improved treatments of established disease.

### Improving selection criteria for lung cancer screening. The potential role of emphysema [^111EVyxu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Lung cancer (LC) screening using low-dose chest computed tomography is now recommended in several guidelines using the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) entry criteria (age, 55–74; ≥ 30 pack-years; tobacco cessation within the previous 15 years for former smokers). Concerns exist about their lack of sensitivity.

This study evaluates the performance of NLST criteria in two different LC screening studies from Europe and the United States, exploring the effect of using emphysema as a complementary criterion. Participants from the Pamplona International Early Lung Action Detection Program (P-IELCAP; n = 3,061) and the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS; n = 3,638) were considered. LC cumulative frequencies, incidence densities, and annual detection rates were calculated in three hypothetical cohorts: those who met NLST criteria alone, those with computed tomography-detected emphysema, and those who met NLST criteria and/or had emphysema.

Thirty-six percent and 59% of P-IELCAP and PLuSS participants, respectively, met NLST criteria. Among these, higher LC incidence densities and detection rates were observed. However, applying NLST criteria to our original cohorts would miss as many as 39% of all LC cases. Annual screening of subjects meeting either NLST criteria or having emphysema detected most cancers (88% and 95% of incident LC of P-IELCAP and PLuSS, respectively) despite reducing the number of screened participants by as much as 52%.

In conclusion, LC screening based solely on NLST criteria could miss a significant portion of cases.

### Spirometry for the diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114SZhXd]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Spirometric testing is one of the oldest clinical tests still in use today. It is a straightforward test where the patient maximally exhales from total lung capacity. The key measurements are the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) and the maximum exhaled volume, known as vital capacity (VC). The utility of spirometric testing, however, depends heavily on the quality of the equipment, patient cooperation, and the skill of the technician performing the test. Therefore, spirometry should be considered a medical test and not merely a vital sign that can be performed by minimally trained personnel.

In obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characteristic changes in spirometry include a reduction in the FEV(1) relative to the vital capacity (FEV₁/VC ratio). This measurement can diagnose the presence and severity of airway obstruction, guide therapies, and predict outcomes. However, using spirometry to screen for obstructive lung disease can be problematic, and the effect of screening on outcomes has yet to be demonstrated.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^117K6p5y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study examines the use of CT-pulmonary angiography and questions whether finding an alternative diagnosis justifies its increased utilization. The emphasis is placed on evaluating the necessity and effectiveness of CT-pulmonary angiography in the context of improving diagnostic outcomes. The statistical analysis, data collection, and design aspects were collaborative efforts among the researchers. The manuscript highlights the roles of each participant in the study, from study design and data collection to statistical evaluation and manuscript development.

The analysis indicates that while CT-pulmonary angiography is a valuable tool for diagnosing certain conditions, its overuse should be cautiously monitored. This careful evaluation of diagnostic processes ensures that the risks associated with radiation exposure and resource allocation are minimized. The study underscores the importance of a judicious approach in the application of advanced diagnostic technologies within clinical settings.

### Validation of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening questionnaire for population surveys [^112GCmd6]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The Confronting Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Survey in North America and Europe, conducted during 1999–2000, aimed to identify international differences in the clinical management of COPD and the patients' perspectives on their disease. Our aim was to validate the screening questionnaire used in this study in a sample of patients presenting at a respiratory clinic. Interviews were conducted at an outpatient clinic of the London Chest Hospital. Of the 136 patients contacted, 25 refused or were unable to participate. Questionnaire data were validated by comparison with medical records and spirometry in 104 patients. Overall, the questionnaire correctly identified 86.5% of patients with a diagnosis of COPD, with a chance-corrected agreement (kappa = 0.66, SE 0.098), indicating good agreement between the questionnaire and the medical records. The questionnaire had a high sensitivity (92.0%) and specificity (72.4%) with respect to the diagnosis of COPD. The screening questionnaire used in the Confronting COPD Survey appears to be a valid screening tool to differentiate COPD from other respiratory diseases.

### Addressing the use of the CAPTURE (a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening tool) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment decisions [^114FgjLb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

It is important to emphasize the difference between this study and the recently published studies of the CAPTURE tool in a U.S. primary care population and in community populations in three lower-resourced countries (Peru, Uganda, and Nepal). Both of those studies assessed the operating characteristics of CAPTURE for identifying new diagnoses of clinically significant COPD, as this screening tool was originally designed to do. Sensitivity estimates reported by Li and colleagues are based on individuals who already have a confirmed diagnosis of COPD, so sensitivity comparisons across the three studies are not appropriate. Similar to community-based screening studies, Li and colleagues confirm that using CAPTURE as designed with five questions and peak flow results in the best sensitivity and specificity for all of these populations.

Li and colleagues' definition of symptom burden and exacerbation risk requiring daily maintenance COPD pharmacotherapy is different from that used in previous CAPTURE COPD screening studies, which defined clinically significant COPD in those with FEV1 percent predicted < 60% and/or an exacerbation history. Li and colleagues' assessment of symptom burden is more concordant with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD recommendations for immediate treatment. Although Li and colleagues seem to be arguing for using these symptom classifications to designate patients ineligible for treatment in resource-poor settings, which is an entirely different goal altogether.

### Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111GpoC4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on the best-validated evidence and pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages the implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Diagnosis and management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117WoSk1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 1**: In patients with respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea, spirometry should be performed to diagnose airflow obstruction. Spirometry should not be used to screen for airflow obstruction in asymptomatic individuals (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: Treatment for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be reserved for patients who have respiratory symptoms and an FEV1 less than 60% predicted, as documented by spirometry (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: Clinicians should prescribe one of the following maintenance monotherapies for symptomatic patients with COPD and an FEV1 less than 60% predicted: long-acting inhaled beta-agonists, long-acting inhaled anticholinergics, or inhaled corticosteroids (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: Clinicians may consider combination inhaled therapies for symptomatic patients with COPD and an FEV1 less than 60% predicted (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 5**: Clinicians should prescribe oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and resting hypoxemia (Pao2 ≤ 55 mm Hg) (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 6**: Clinicians should consider prescribing pulmonary rehabilitation in symptomatic individuals with COPD who have an FEV1 less than 50% predicted (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Emphysema - The review of radiological presentation and its clinical impact in the LDCT screening era [^1125GPh5]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Emphysema is one of three main lung pathologies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, along with chronic bronchitis and small airway obstruction. The diagnosis is based on the detection of low attenuation areas in lung tissue on chest computed tomography, either visual by a radiologist or automatic by the applied computed tomography software.

Results of studies on the association between emphysema and lung cancer incidence are mixed. Many studies have demonstrated that chronic lung diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are associated with lung cancer morbidity. There is also evidence that emphysema can be related to a worse prognosis in patients with detected lung cancer.

In this review article, we aim to summarize knowledge about emphysema detection and evaluation on computed tomography, both quantitative and qualitative. We also summarize data on the correlation between emphysema and lung cancer, as well as its potential use in selecting patients who would most benefit from lung cancer screening.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^1154poU5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Chest imaging can be essential in the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19. Published reports at the time of writing have focused mainly on standard chest X-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT). Abnormalities are very often present on CXR images of COVID-19 patients; consolidations and ground-glass opacities have been reported in 47% and 33%, respectively. Not all patients with COVID-19 have abnormalities on chest CT images. Patchy ground-glass opacities, typically in bilateral and peripheral locations, and consolidations have been most commonly described. In light of the high sensitivity of an abnormal scan, CT has even been suggested as a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19.

Challenges with access to CT and, at times, even simple CXR may preclude the usefulness of these imaging techniques in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Lung ultrasound (LUS) is increasingly recognized as a chest imaging tool with a strong potential to guide the management of critically ill patients and may represent a useful tool in patients with COVID-19.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched until May 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", "radiography", "chest radiography", "CT", "chest CT", "ultrasound", "LUS", and "lung ultrasonography". Several studies were found but none reporting data from LMICs.

For the diagnosis of pneumonia from causes other than COVID-19, LUS has been found to be superior to standard CXR, and it approaches chest CT in terms of diagnostic performance.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines. These guidelines aim to improve the quality of care patients receive by fostering evidence-based decision-making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice.

Of the COPD guidelines developed, those from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, have published their methods for evidence evaluation. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, aiming to provide the basis for local care pathways.

The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation. This requires an appreciation of the issues that impede the translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care.

A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function and the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD.

### Chest CT signs in pulmonary disease: A pictorial review [^112ygy8A]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

CT scanning of the chest is one of the most important imaging modalities available to a pulmonologist. The advent of high-resolution CT scanning of the chest has led to its increasing use. Although chest radiographs are still useful as an initial test, their utility is limited in the diagnosis of lung diseases that depend on higher resolution images, such as interstitial lung diseases and pulmonary vascular diseases. Several metaphoric chest CT scan signs have been described, linking abnormal imaging patterns to lung diseases. Some of these are specific to a disease, whereas others help narrow the differential diagnosis. Recognizing these imaging patterns and CT scan signs is thus vitally important. In the present article, we describe a comprehensive list of the commonly encountered metaphoric chest CT scan signs and their clinical relevance.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A population study [^113VYEYi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Materials and methods**:

	- **Screening participants**: We randomly selected six out of the 79 social health centers in Shenzhen Nanshan District Medical Group for the study. There were regular scheduled consultations as well as unscheduled free consultations and talks. We distributed 5,000 copies of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Screening Questionnaire (COPD-SQ) to permanent residents aged 20 years and above in Nanshan District of Shenzhen City through WeChat QR code scanning and on-site form-filling. In accordance with the principle of informed consent for clinical research, we obtained written consent from all participants. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the hospital before the implementation of the project (Ethics approval number: 2022–107 (Shen)-01 K).

	- **COPD-SQ design and identification of high-risk individuals with COPD**: We developed the COPD Screening Questionnaire based on the criteria recommended by the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD Disease (2021 Revised Edition) and the Guidelines for Primary Level Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD Disease (2018). The questionnaire includes observation indicators such as age, smoking index, body mass index (BMI), respiratory symptoms (such as cough and dyspnea), and family history of respiratory disease. These indicators were selected based on the criteria of high-risk groups of COPD as defined in the Guidelines for Primary Level Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD Disease (2018). Those with COPD-SQ scores ≥ 16 were considered at high risk.

### Patient factors influencing respiratory-related clinician actions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening [^116ZgT9e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify patient-related factors that may explain the increased likelihood of receiving a respiratory-related clinician action in patients identified to be at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a U.S.-based pragmatic study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening.

- **Methods**: This post hoc analysis (conducted in 2014–2015) of the Screening, Evaluating, and Assessing Rate Changes of Diagnosing Respiratory Conditions in Primary Care 1 (SEARCH1) study (conducted in 2010–2011), used the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Population Screener questionnaire in 112 primary care practices. Anyone with a previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis was excluded. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess patient factors associated with the likelihood of receiving a respiratory-related clinician action following positive screening.

- **Results**: Overall, 994 of 6,497 (15%) screened positive and were considered at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, only 187 of the 994 patients (19%) who screened positive received a respiratory-related clinician action. The chances of receiving a respiratory-related clinician action were significantly increased in patients who visited their physician with a respiratory issue (p < 0.05) or had already been prescribed a respiratory medication (p < 0.05). Most (81%) patients who screened positive or had a respiratory-related clinician action had one or more comorbidity, including cardiovascular disease (68%), diabetes (30%), and depression/anxiety.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. The 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QJDKT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Approximately 30% of patients with SARS or MERS had persistent lung abnormalities and abnormal radiology that were consistent with fibrotic lung disease after their acute illness. There are not yet long-term studies on the follow-up of patients with COVID-19, nor recommendations for monitoring these patients, thus the follow-up of patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 is still based on expert opinion and consensus. The intensity of the monitoring obviously depends on the severity of the COVID-19 episode.

Patients who developed mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual protocols used for patients with COPD. Patients who developed moderate COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure, should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan should be considered at 6 months to 1 year. Complications occurring during or after the COVID-19 episode should also be monitored.

Patients with COPD are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and multimorbid survivors frequently have required prolonged ICU stays. Until we have evidence from prospective studies, survivors of severe COVID-19 with COPD should be considered at a high risk of developing a "critical illness" or a "chronic critical illness", a severe heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the subsequent complications associated with COVID-19.

An official American Thoracic Society/Japanese Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline [^115uTgz6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations regarding key aspects related to the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) were recently published. We now provide additional recommendations regarding four specific questions related to the diagnosis of LAM and management of pneumothoraces in patients with LAM.

- **Methods**: Systematic reviews were performed and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. For each intervention, the panel considered its confidence in the estimated effects, the balance of desirable (i.e. benefits) and undesirable (i.e. harms and burdens) consequences, patient values and preferences, cost, and feasibility. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, written, and graded using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

- **Results**: For women who have cystic changes on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest characteristic of LAM, but who have no additional confirmatory features of LAM (i.e. clinical, radiologic, or serologic), the guideline panel made conditional recommendations against making a clinical diagnosis of LAM on the basis of the high-resolution computed tomography findings alone and for considering transbronchial lung biopsy as a diagnostic tool. The guideline panel also made conditional recommendations for offering pleurodesis after an initial pneumothorax rather than postponing the procedure until the first recurrence and against pleurodesis being used as a reason to exclude patients from lung transplantation.

### Screening for lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111FPE4F]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer has become a standard of care in the United States in recent years, largely due to the results of the National Lung Screening Trial. The benefits and harms of low-dose chest CT screening differ in both frequency and magnitude. Translating a favorable balance of benefits and harms into practice can be challenging. Here, we update the evidence base for the benefits, harms, and implementation of low radiation dose chest CT screening. We use the updated evidence base to provide recommendations where evidence exists and statements based on experience and expert consensus where it does not.

- **Methods**: Approved panelists developed key questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format to address the benefits and harms of low-dose CT screening, as well as key areas of program implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists from relevant retrievals were searched, and additional papers were included. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Important clinical questions were addressed based on the evidence from the systematic literature review. Graded recommendations and ungraded statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

A broad spectrum of pulmonary conditions demonstrates imaging features that mimic those of COVID-19 and are difficult to differentiate from it. Awareness of these conditions, careful radiologic analysis, and attention to the clinical data are required to prevent an erroneous diagnosis that could potentially adversely impact management and patients' outcomes. A correct diagnosis of these conditions may prevent unnecessary hospitalization and reduce strict quarantine measures for all suspected patients, which places significant pressure on healthcare providers and medical infrastructure.

### Screening and early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a population study [^116jagQ8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease leading to further morbidity and significant mortality, there is still limited data on screening for COPD. The purpose of this study was to establish an early COPD screening system for the community and hospitals in Nanshan District in Shenzhen City, to improve the rate of early diagnosis and treatment of patients with COPD.

- **Methods**: We identified individuals at high risk of COPD using a questionnaire survey and analyzed the relevant influencing factors in the early stages of COPD in high-risk groups.

- **Results**: We collected a total of 5,000 COPD screening questionnaires, and a total of 449 patients were diagnosed with COPD by pulmonary function examination. The prevalence of COPD in people aged 20 and above in Nanshan District of Shenzhen City was estimated to be 8.98%, with a base of 5000. The severity classification as per the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria was as follows: GOLD I accounted for 34.74%; GOLD II accounted for 37.64%; GOLD III accounted for 16.04%; and GOLD IV accounted for 11.58%.

Common features of early COPD that we identified were: (1) patients were mainly males, accounting for 68.0%; (2) COPD was common among people aged 50–59 years, comprising 31%; (3) 96.0% of patients often had severe respiratory symptoms and had frequent coughs when they did not have a cold; (4) 57.2% of patients experienced shortness of breath when walking quickly on level ground or climbing gentle slopes.

### Definition, epidemiology and natural history of COPD [^117MrZE5]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fifth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world, representing a substantial economic and social burden. Patients experience progressive deterioration up to end-stage COPD, characterized by very severe airflow limitation, severely limited and declining performance status with chronic respiratory failure, advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and severe systemic manifestations or complications. COPD is frequently underdiagnosed and under-treated. Today, COPD develops earlier in life and is less gender-specific. Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for COPD, followed by occupation and air pollution. Severe deficiency in alpha(1)-antitrypsin is rare; however, several phenotypes are associated with an elevated risk for COPD in the presence of risk factor exposure.

Any patient presenting with cough, sputum production, or dyspnea should be assessed by standardized spirometry. Continued exposure to noxious agents promotes a more rapid decline in lung function and increases the risk for repeated exacerbations, eventually leading to end-stage disease. Without significant efforts in prevention, there will be an increasing proportion of end-stage patients who can live longer through long-term oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation, but with elevated suffering and substantial costs. Smoking prevention and smoking cessation are the most important epidemiological measures to counteract chronic obstructive pulmonary disease epidemics.

### Monitoring of patients with COPD: A review of current guidelines' recommendations [^113VuywN]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The goals for the management of COPD are to delay the progression of the disease and alleviate its manifestations. Following up on patients' physical and mental condition is part of best practice management when monitoring routines yield information that contributes to achieving management goals. However, recommendations on monitoring procedures may differ between guidelines and may not be based on scientific evidence. The aim of this article is to review the guideline recommendations on monitoring routines for COPD.

- **Methods**: Clinical practice guidelines on the management of COPD were identified through a Medline search, an Internet search, and expanded by experts in the respiratory field. Guidelines on the management of COPD were analyzed for recommended monitoring routines and recommended frequency of monitoring.

- **Results**: Eighteen clinical practice guidelines on the management of COPD were analyzed. The follow-up of lung function indices was the most frequently recommended monitoring routine. Additionally, monitoring of symptoms, exercise tolerance, comorbidity, and smoking habits were recommended regularly. However, none of the guidelines recommended monitoring routines based on evidence. Only one guideline provides a different set of monitoring parameters for advanced COPD compared to mild and moderate COPD.

- **Conclusion**: Some monitoring routines, particularly the follow-up of lung function indices, were frequently recommended. However, evidence to support the guideline recommendations for the monitoring of patients with COPD is missing.

**Key points**: Chest CT is the gold standard imaging modality for COVID-19 pneumonia; in some situations, chest X-ray or ultrasound may be an effective alternative. Chest imaging is not recommended for routine screening of COVID-19 in a resource-abundant environment. Chest imaging is useful for assessing complications, disease progression, and prognostication of COVID-19. Proposed chest CT classification systems are useful for stratifying cases suspected of COVID-19.

### Strategies for screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112cmA5u]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is easily detected in its preclinical phase using office spirometry. Successful smoking cessation prevents further disease progression in most patients. Spirometry measures the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC), which is the most sensitive and specific test for detecting airflow limitation. Primary care practitioners see the majority of adult smokers, but few currently have spirometers or regularly order spirometry for their smoker patients. Improvements in spirometry software have made it much easier to obtain good quality spirometry test sessions, thereby reducing the misclassification rate. Respiratory therapists and pulmonary function technologists can help primary care practitioners select effective office spirometers for identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and teach staff how to use spirometers correctly.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend assessing the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of the disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events — such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death — in the initial evaluation to guide therapy.

### Chest X-rays in COPD screening: Are they worthwhile [^115WJnAo]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The BTS/NICE COPD guideline recommends a chest X-ray at initial COPD evaluation; this is a grade D recommendation based on expert opinion. We have investigated which pathologies other than COPD are detected by chest X-ray and how they alter management. Dundee smokers aged 40 or over and receiving bronchodilators are assessed for COPD by their practice nurse and offered a chest X-ray if there is no record of a chest X-ray within the previous three years. We retrospectively analysed the chest X-ray reports and case records of these patients.

The chest X-ray report was structured with seven specific questions, most importantly "Are there any features of other disease likely to be causing dyspnoea?" and "Are there any features to suggest lung cancer?" Management of patients with chest X-ray findings suggesting other disease causing dyspnoea or lung cancer was assessed by questionnaire and case record study. Five hundred forty-six consecutive chest X-ray reports were analysed. Fourteen percent of all chest X-rays detected potentially treatable dyspnoea-causing disease; where management following receipt of X-ray reports was audited, 84% were thought to help. Eleven lung cancers were detected; three had stage 1 disease. Considerable benign and malignant pathology is detected by chest X-ray performed at initial COPD assessment. Clinical management is changed in the majority with a potentially treatable abnormality. This evidence suggests that the NICE guideline to perform chest X-ray at initial COPD evaluation should be elevated from a grade D to grade C recommendation.

Imaging

A chest X-ray cannot confirm a diagnosis of COPD; however, radiological changes associated with COPD may include signs of lung hyperinflation, such as a flattened diaphragm and increased retrosternal air space, lung hyperlucency, and rapid tapering of the vascular markings. On the other hand, a chest X-ray can help exclude alternative diagnoses and establish the presence of significant comorbidities, such as concomitant pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, pleural diseases, kyphoscoliosis, and cardiomegaly.

CT of the chest can provide information of potential clinical relevance, including:

- **Presence, severity, and distribution of emphysema**: This has implications for potential surgical or endoscopic lung volume reduction and is associated with faster FEV1 decline, higher mortality, and increased risk of lung cancer.
- **Bronchiectasis visibility on CT**: About 30% of COPD patients have bronchiectasis visible on CT, which is associated with increased exacerbation frequency and mortality.
- **Lung cancer screening**: Most COPD patients fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria for lung cancer screening in the general population, so they should be offered a similar strategy.
- **Quantification of airway abnormalities**: Although these methods are less well standardized than those used for emphysema quantification, they offer valuable insights.
- **COPD comorbidities visible on CT**: A CT offers information about COPD comorbidities, including coronary artery calcifications, pulmonary artery enlargement, bone density, and muscle mass, some of which are associated with all-cause mortality independently of the severity of airflow obstruction.

Thus, GOLD 2023 recommends chest CT for COPD patients.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document, which has incorporated some of the extensive knowledge about COPD accumulated over recent years.

Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure proper evaluation of the severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include an assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate the level of symptoms and the risk of future exacerbations. This evaluation process categorizes patients with COPD into four categories — A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD aligns with this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations.

- **Identification and treatment of comorbidities**: Must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities.
- **New section on exacerbations**: The revised document also contains a section dedicated to exacerbations of COPD.

The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant stakeholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines.

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112RCC3U]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

About 14% of US adults aged 40 to 79 years have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Persons with severe COPD are often unable to participate in normal physical activity due to deterioration of lung function.

- **Objective**: To update the 2008 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults (those who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms) improves health outcomes. The USPSTF assessed the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools, including prescreening questionnaires and spirometry; whether screening for COPD improves the delivery and uptake of targeted preventive services, such as smoking cessation or relevant immunizations; and the possible harms of screening for and treatment of mild to moderate COPD.

- **Findings**: Similar to 2008, the USPSTF did not find evidence that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons improves health-related quality of life, morbidity, or mortality. The USPSTF determined that early detection of COPD, before the development of symptoms, does not alter the course of the disease or improve patient outcomes. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic persons has no net benefit.

- **Conclusions and recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults (D recommendation).

### Baseline characteristics of participants in the randomized national lung screening trial [^113mfuhU]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). High credibility.

Of the total of 53,456 participants, 26,733 were randomly assigned to chest radiograph screening, and 26,723 were randomly assigned to computerized tomography. The distribution of sex and age by study arm is detailed. A total of 31,533 (59%) of participants were men, and 39,234 (73%) were younger than 65 years. The mean age of the entire cohort was 61.4 years (standard deviation = 5.0 years), and the median age was 60 years (interquartile range = 57–65 years). Because randomization was stratified by sex and 5-year age group, the participant numbers are virtually identical within these categories across study arms.

- **Demographic factors and baseline smoking status of participants in the National Lung Screening Trial by screening arm**: The distribution of race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, marital status, educational status, and body mass index (BMI) by study arm was consistent across both groups. Most individuals (48,549 or 91%) in the cohort were white, 2,378 (4.4%) were black, and 935 (1.7%) were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Only 3,252 (6%) did not have a high school degree, and 16,839 (approximately 32%) had at least a college degree. A total of 15,017 (28%) of the NLST subjects were obese according to Centers for Disease Control criteria (i.e. BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²).

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by a progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services, and society, and this burden is likely to increase in the future. Therefore, it is important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible.

In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are several barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including:

- **The sheer weight of guidelines**: This can be overwhelming across all therapeutic areas.
- **A focus on scientific knowledge rather than clinical practice**
- **Lack of trust in the recommendations**
- **Practical considerations**: These include time, resources, and budget constraints.
- **Failure to include the perspective of patients**

The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice, and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice.
