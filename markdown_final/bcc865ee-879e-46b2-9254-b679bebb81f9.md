## Question

Can appendicitis be treated as an outpatient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether appendicitis can be treated as an outpatient and, if so, under what conditions it is safe and appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing nonoperative (antibiotic) management from operative management. Then, I should verify patient selection criteria for outpatient nonoperative care. Next, I will review the safety outcomes from high-quality trials, especially the CODA data. After that, I should examine the evidence for outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy. Finally, I will consider special populations, risk modifiers, follow-up logistics, and how guidelines synthesize this into shared decision-making recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the core distinction because conflating these leads to confusion. Nonoperative management means antibiotics-first care with close follow-up and the possibility of later appendectomy, whereas operative management refers to laparoscopic or open appendectomy; importantly, both pathways can, in selected patients, be delivered on an outpatient basis, so "outpatient" is not synonymous with "nonoperative", and I need to keep these axes separate as I evaluate evidence and recommendations [^114dQwA1] [^111MDN5S].

> I will now examine nonoperative outpatient management in adults. Wait, let me verify the pivotal data: the CODA randomized trial allowed ED discharge within 24 hours for antibiotic-assigned participants who met prespecified stability criteria; the secondary analysis showed that 46% were discharged within 24 hours and had a serious adverse event rate under 1 per 100 through 7 days, which was no higher than in those hospitalized, supporting the safety of selected outpatient antibiotic care in adults [^116rKu7A] [^114dQwA1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm the selection criteria used in CODA because external validity hinges on them. Outpatient discharge required hemodynamic stability, afebrile status, ability to tolerate oral intake and medications, pain controlled with oral analgesics, confirmed follow-up within a few days, and agreement of both clinician and patient; critically, participants had imaging-confirmed appendicitis without diffuse peritonitis, severe sepsis, immunocompromise, pregnancy, or IBD, and 5% progressed or opted for appendectomy within 24 hours, underscoring the need for careful screening and a low threshold to escalate care [^114dQwA1] [^116r8SQp].

> Next, I should review operative outpatient management. Let me consider the randomized data: an ERAS-based outpatient appendectomy RCT showed dramatically shorter length of stay with PACU-to-home discharge and no increase in readmissions, with about a $500 per-patient cost reduction. This aligns with prospective and retrospective series demonstrating high outpatient success, low morbidity, and low readmission when strict discharge criteria are applied, and with contemporary guideline statements suggesting outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is feasible where an ambulatory pathway exists [^111MDN5S] [^113gpPRb] [^116Gy3HY] [^115DDeeQ].

> But wait, what about children and adolescents? I should double-check pediatric data before extrapolating adult evidence. Pediatric cohorts and QI initiatives report that carefully selected children can be discharged with oral antibiotics and close follow-up with low early failure rates, though most pediatric literature remains limited by design and follow-up; in parallel, NSQIP-P analyses show that same-day discharge after appendectomy is feasible with low morbidity, suggesting both pathways can be safe in pediatrics when protocols and supports are in place [^111hMaZ7] [^11586w8M] [^1145Xxxb].

> I need to ensure I flag high-risk features that temper enthusiasm for outpatient nonoperative care. The presence of an appendicolith increases the risk of nonresponse and early appendectomy; fever above 38°C and larger appendiceal diameter (for example, ≥ 15 mm) are associated with higher primary nonresponse, and very elevated CRP in the first 24–48 hours may signal treatment failure; in older adults, observational data associate nonoperative management with higher risks of adverse events and complications, so immediate operation may be preferred in that cohort, and I should communicate these trade-offs explicitly during shared decision-making [^111yvhm3] [^116e2hqN] [^115hQBdd].

> Let me consider operational logistics because safe outpatient care depends on them. For nonoperative management, many programs give an initial IV dose in the ED or observation unit, then transition to oral therapy to complete a 7–10 day total course, coupled with clear return precautions and reassessment within 24–48 hours. Early unplanned ED visits occur in a minority but are manageable, and sites with higher outpatient use did not have higher appendectomy rates, supporting feasibility when protocols are mature [^114zMamm] [^113A1iNj] [^112RBS6C].

> I should confirm the economic and workforce implications to balance clinical and systems considerations. Outpatient appendectomy reduces length of stay and yields meaningful cost savings in multiple series, and outpatient antibiotic care typically avoids room-and-board charges; these gains accrue when selection, ERAS, and follow-up infrastructure are reliable, but they can be offset by early failures if criteria are too lax or follow-up is uncertain [^111MDN5S] [^112U8UXE] [^114NkhFw].

> Hold on, I should verify where guidelines land so I don't overstate. Major guidelines issue conditional recommendations emphasizing that both operative and nonoperative strategies are acceptable for uncomplicated appendicitis, with patient values and local resources driving the choice. They note uncertainty in the evidence base and stress shared decision-making, and some specifically suggest that outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is reasonable where ambulatory pathways exist, while also reminding clinicians that complicated disease generally warrants operative management and that outpatient nonoperative care should be reserved for carefully selected patients with assured follow-up [^111yvhm3] [^1124akNB] [^115DDeeQ] [^116Gy3HY].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize. Yes, appendicitis can be treated as an outpatient in selected patients, but the pathway differs: for nonoperative care, use strict stability and imaging criteria, provide ED-based IV-to-oral antibiotic transition with 24–48 hour reassessment, and counsel on recurrence risk. For operative care, employ ERAS protocols with PACU discharge criteria, reliable analgesia, and early follow-up. Across both, exclude peritonitis, sepsis, unreliable follow-up, and high-risk features such as marked leukocytosis, large-diameter appendix, or appendicolith, and tailor decisions to patient preferences and local capacity, consistent with conditional guideline recommendations and CODA-era evidence [^116rKu7A] [^111MDN5S] [^113bv16S] [^115DDeeQ].

---

Outpatient management of appendicitis is feasible and safe for **carefully selected patients with uncomplicated disease** who meet strict stability criteria and have reliable follow-up [^114dQwA1]. Antibiotic-first therapy is noninferior to surgery in many adults, with about 70% avoiding surgery at 1 year, though recurrence is common and appendicolith increases failure risk [^111egjPi] [^111yvhm3]. Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is also safe and cost-effective in selected patients using ERAS protocols, with low readmission and complication rates [^111MDN5S] [^113gpPRb]. Patient selection, clear return precautions, and close follow-up are essential; **outpatient care is not appropriate for complicated appendicitis, high-risk patients, or those without reliable follow-up** [^114dQwA1] [^116r8SQp].

---

## Evidence supporting outpatient management

### Non-operative management (antibiotics-first)

- **CODA trial**: Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis; ~46% of antibiotic-treated patients were discharged within 24 hours without increased serious adverse events or appendectomy rates [^114dQwA1] [^113A1iNj].
- **APPAC II**: Oral antibiotics alone were noninferior to IV-to-oral therapy, enabling outpatient management in many patients [^111abgt8].
- **Recurrence**: About 27% undergo appendectomy within 1 year; 70% avoid surgery at 1 year, but recurrence risk persists over time [^113crKch] [^111egjPi] [^117K3j2T].

---

### Operative management (laparoscopic appendectomy)

Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is safe and feasible in selected patients using **ERAS protocols**, with low readmission and complication rates [^111MDN5S] [^113gpPRb]. Cost-effectiveness is substantial, with outpatient appendectomy yielding **significant cost savings** and reduced length of stay [^111MDN5S] [^1125faSP].

---

## Patient selection criteria

| **Attribute** | **Non-operative management** | **Operative management** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical stability | Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, controlled pain, tolerating oral intake | Same, with adequate pain control and ability to ambulate |
| Imaging findings | Uncomplicated appendicitis without abscess, perforation, or phlegmon | Same, with no intraoperative complications |
| Comorbidities | Minimal or well-controlled | Minimal or well-controlled |
| Social support | Reliable follow-up, transportation, and adherence | Same, with home support for postoperative care |
| Contraindications | Appendicolith, immunocompromise, pregnancy, unreliable follow-up | Complicated appendicitis, severe comorbidities, lack of support |

---

## Risks and benefits

### Benefits

Benefits include reduced **length of stay** with faster recovery and return to daily activities, and **lower costs** due to reduced hospitalization and resource use [^114NkhFw]. Patient satisfaction is high when appropriate selection and follow-up are ensured [^113A1iNj].

---

### Risks

Risks include **recurrence** — with approximately 27% requiring appendectomy within 1 year — and the potential for delayed intervention if symptoms progress or complications develop. Readmission is uncommon but possible, with early follow-up mitigating risk [^113crKch] [^113A1iNj] [^115KNDjc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **SAGES**: Conditional recommendation for outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis with shared decision-making and close follow-up [^notfound].
- **WSES**: Suggests outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy in selected patients with established ambulatory pathways [^115DDeeQ].
- **EAST**: Insufficient evidence for routine outpatient non-operative management; use clinical judgment [^notfound].

---

## Practical considerations for implementation

- **Clear protocols**: Define selection, discharge, and follow-up criteria [^115KNDjc].
- **Patient education**: Explain symptoms, medications, and when to seek care [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Ensure timely reassessment to detect failure early [^117Q4Mzw].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate surgery, ED, and primary care [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Outpatient management is appropriate for **carefully selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis**, reliable follow-up, and access to care. Non-operative management avoids surgery in many but carries recurrence risk; outpatient appendectomy is safe and cost-effective when ERAS protocols are used. Not appropriate for complicated appendicitis, high-risk patients, or those without reliable follow-up.

Q.4.5: Is outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy safe and feasible for patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis?

In the USA, outpatient LA protocols are currently applied at multiple institutions with the aim to reduce the length of stay and decrease overall health care costs for AA. Results from these experiences demonstrate that outpatient LA can be performed with a high rate of success, low morbidity, and low readmission rate in the case of non-perforated AA. In the study by Frazee et al. 484 patients with uncomplicated AA were managed as outpatients. Only seven patients (1.2%) were readmitted after outpatient management for transient fever, nausea/vomiting, migraine headache, urinary tract infection, partial small bowel obstruction, and deep venous thrombosis. There were no mortalities or reoperations. Including the readmissions, overall success with outpatient management was 85%. The recent RCT by Trejo-Avila et al. stated that ERAS implementation for appendectomy is associated with a significantly shorter LOS, allowing for the ambulatory management of patients with uncomplicated AA. The authors concluded that ambulatory LA is safe and feasible with similar rates of morbidity and readmissions compared with conventional care.

Statement 4.5 Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is feasible and safe without any difference in morbidity and readmission rates. It is associated with potential benefits of earlier recovery after surgery and lower hospital and social costs. Recommendation 4.5 We suggest the adoption of outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis, provided that an ambulatory pathway with well-defined ERAS protocols and patient information/consent are locally established [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Q.4.6: Is laparoscopic appendectomy indicated over open appendectomy in specific patient groups?

LA is a safe and effective method to treat AA in specific settings such as the elderly and the obese. LA can be recommended for patients with complicated AA even with higher risk categories. In the retrospective cohort study by Werkgartner et al. investigating the benefits of LA in patients with high peri- and postoperative risk factors (ASA 3 and 4), LA was associated with slightly longer operative times and shorter hospital stay. Overall complications, graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, were slightly more frequent in patients after LA, whereas severe complications occurred more frequently in patients after OA. For high-risk patients, LA has proven to be safe and feasible and was also associated with decreased rates of mortality, postoperative morbidity, and shorter hospitalization.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^1129h1Hb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Appendicitis decision criteria and additional considerations include that these recommendations may not apply equally to all adult and pediatric patients, nonoperative management may be less successful in immunocompromised patients who are unable to mount a normal immune response, and patients with poor access to medical care may benefit from definitive operative management at the time of presentation; for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), nonoperative management may be preferred in the setting of an equivocal diagnosis of appendicitis or significant cecal inflammation, the failure rate of nonoperative treatment in patients with recurrent appendicitis is unclear, there is some evidence that patients with a fecalith are at higher risk of recurrence than those without, and for patients with significant medical comorbidities or hostile abdomens, the risks and benefits of operative management must be assessed on a case-by-case basis; finally, the panel did not evaluate the literature regarding appendicitis during pregnancy as this is addressed in another SAGES Guideline.

### Outpatient management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis after laparoscopic appendectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^113gpPRb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To confirm the safety and efficacy of outpatient management of laparoscopic appendectomy, with an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, in adult patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is feasible and secure in selected patients in observational studies. The benefits include reduced length of stay (LOS) and postoperative complications. This is the first randomized controlled trial of outpatient management following ERAS protocol.

Methods

Patients admitted from the emergency department with acute appendicitis were randomized into one of two groups: standard care within the hospital (HG) or the outpatient group (OG). An ERAS protocol was followed for both groups. Patients in the HG were admitted to the surgical ward. Patients in the OG were referred to the day-surgery unit. The primary endpoint was the length of stay.

Results

Ninety-seven patients were included: 49 in the OG and 48 in the HG. LOS was significantly shorter in the OG (mean 8.82 h) than in the HG (mean 43.53 h), p < 0.001. There was no difference in readmission rates (p = 0.320); we observed only one readmission in the OG. No further emergency consultations or complications were observed. The cost saving was $516.52/patient as a result of the intervention.

Conclusion

Outpatient management of appendectomy is safe and feasible procedure in selected patients. This approach could become the standard of care for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, showing fewer complications, lower LOS and cost.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: a non-inferiority study [^114EVbTm]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis was safe in our cohort of patients with short in-hospital stay, low morbidity, and recurrence rate similarly to the results obtained in large, randomized trials. Half of the patients were given out-hospital treatment with similar 30-day appendectomy rate when compared to inNOM patients. The results of our research were comparable to those reported by the CODA trial collaborative group, confirming that outpatient NOM is a valid option allowing a substantial reduction of unnecessary hospitalization and resources saving in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The meta-analysis published by Podda and coll showed that in-hospital NOM of uncomplicated acute appendicitis resulted in a pooled mean length of stay of 2.9 days with a mean cost of $ 2,509.

A small proportion of outNOM patients required an early unplanned emergency department visit and subsequent appendectomy, as previously reported by the CODA trial. In our series, the vast majority of appendectomies were performed within one day after first discharge. A possible interpretation of this early failure might be the patient's negative beliefs towards the out-hospital NOM success. The CODA trial showed a lower non-response rate in patients with positive beliefs when compared to patients with negative beliefs. Obviously, outNOM patients have to accept the risk of possible disease recurrence and hospital readmission. Despite outNOM patients required more frequently an unplanned ED visit, the cumulative length of stay remained significantly lower in the OutNOM group when compared to the InNOM group.

The preoperative detection of appendicolith and free fluid are considered relative contraindications to NOM in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. In our study, the majority of patients with pre-operative detections of free fluid and appendicolith were treated with upfront surgery according to the international guidelines. A smaller proportion of these patients were proposed and accepted NOM. Interestingly, only 8.2% of patients with free fluid and 5.6% of patients with appendicolith underwent appendectomy within 30 days. At the multiple regression analysis, the presence of appendicolith and free fluid was not correlated with a higher 30-day appendectomy rate.

InNOM patients were older and had longer duration of symptoms, larger appendix diameter and higher proportion of appendicolith and free fluid. However, after adjusting for these variables, the 30-day appendectomy rate remained similar between the two groups.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^112ognUK]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. However, guidance as to specific management does not exist.

METHODS

PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

RESULTS

Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified. The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in persons 5 to 50 years of age. In most trials, imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess, phlegmon, or tumor. Antibiotics regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days. Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on parenteral agents to same-day hospital or ED discharge of stable patients with outpatient oral antibiotics. Minimum time allowed before response was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours. Although pain was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy, analgesic regimens were poorly described. Trials differed in use of other response indicators, that is, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and reimaging. Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated. Initial response rates were generally greater than 90% and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours, with no related severe sepsis or deaths. In most studies, appendectomy was recommended for recurrence; however, in several, patients had antibiotic retreatment with success.

CONCLUSION

While further investigation of conservative treatment is ongoing, patients considering this approach should be advised and managed according to study methods and related guidelines to promote informed shared decision-making and optimize their chance of similar outcomes as described in published trials. Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation, employ best-practice pain control and antibiotic selection, better define cancer risk, and explore longer time thresholds for response, minimized diet restriction and hospital stays, and antibiotic re-treatment will further our understanding of the potential effectiveness of conservative management.

### Time is money: quantifying savings in outpatient appendectomy [^1125faSP]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed on a fast-track, short-stay, or outpatient basis with high success rates, low morbidity, low readmission rates, and shorter length of hospital stay. Cost savings from outpatient appendectomy have not been well described. We hypothesize that outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with cost savings.

Methods

We performed an original retrospective cohort analysis of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy between June 2013 and April 2017 at our academic medical center before and after implementation of an outpatient protocol which began on January 1, 2016. We assessed appendicitis grade, length of stay (LOS), cost, net revenue, and profit margin.

Results

After protocol implementation, the percentage of patients discharged from the the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) increased from 3.7% to 29.7% (χ² p < 0.001). The proportion of inpatient admissions and admissions to observation decreased by 5.7% and 20.3%, respectively. On average, PACU-to-home patients had a total hospital cost of $4734 compared with $5781 in patients admitted to observation, for an estimated savings of $1047 per patient (p < 0.001). Comparing the time periods, the mean LOS decreased for all groups (p < 0.001). Appendicitis grade was higher in those who required inpatient admission, but could not distinguish which patients required an observation bed.

Discussion

Outpatient appendectomy saves approximately $1000 per patient. Adoption of an outpatient appendectomy pathway is likely to be gradual, but will result in incremental improvement in resource utilization immediately. Grade does not predict which patients should be observed. Considering established safety, our data support widespread implementation of this protocol.

### Management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis as day case surgery: can outcomes of a prospective study Be reproduced in real life? [^113NEqXP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The feasibility of day case surgery (DCS) appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis (UCAA) was evaluated by the prospective AppendAmbu (Feasibility of Outpatient Appendectomy for Acute Appendicitis) study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01839435). The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-life feasibility of DCS for UCAA.

Study Design

This single-center, retrospective, non-interventional study was conducted after the AppendAmbu study and included UCAA only. The primary end point was DCS success rate (ie length of stay < 12 hours) in the intention-to-treat population (all patients with UCAA) and in the per-protocol population (population with UCAA and no preoperative and intraoperative exclusion criteria). The secondary end points were to determine the DCS quality criteria to evaluate and compare the morbidity and mortality of DCS and conventional hospitalization for UCAA (Clavien, Comprehensive Complication Index) and to externally validate the St Antoine criteria for the selection of patients for DCS.

Results

From January 2016 to September 2017, two hundred and ninety-six patients underwent operations for acute appendicitis. The proportion of patients with successful DCS management was 27% in the intention-to-treat population and 95% in the per-protocol population. The unplanned consultation rate was 15%, the unplanned hospitalization rate was 4%, and the unplanned reoperation rate was 0%. The postoperative morbidity of patients managed by DCS was not different from that of patients managed in conventional hospitalization. The DCS success rate was 0%, with a St Antoine score of 0, and 80% of patients had a St Antoine score of 5 (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Day case surgery constitutes progress in surgery as a result of enhanced recovery programs. It avoids unnecessary prolonged hospitalization.

### Non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children, why not? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1145Xxxb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis is a common abdominal emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. Laparoscopic appendectomy (Operative Management, OM) has become the standard of care for uncomplicated appendicitis in adults and children. However, recent evidence, including a study by the CODA Collaborative, has explored non-operative management (NOM) using antibiotics as an alternative. This study showed that NOM allowed over 70% of adult patients to avoid surgery, many of whom were treated on an outpatient basis, resuming daily activities sooner. Conversely, NOM was associated with a higher rate of emergency visits and hospitalizations within 90 days.

Although more than 95% of patients with appendicitis currently undergo surgery, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a re-evaluation of antibiotics for managing appendicitis. NOM presents potential benefits, such as avoiding surgical risks, reduced recovery time, and outpatient management. Despite these advantages, the efficacy and safety of NOM in children remain debated. Most evidence for NOM in pediatrics is derived from adult studies, which limits its direct applicability. Additionally, small sample sizes and heterogeneity in design among trials have hampered definitive conclusions.

A recent meta-analysis by Kessler et al. evaluated NOM for uncomplicated appendicitis in children but faced methodological limitations and inconclusive findings. Reported recurrence rates within one year range from 15 to 41%, yet many children remain recurrence-free long-term. To address these gaps, this meta-analysis focuses exclusively on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy, hospital stay duration, quality of life (QoL), and complications of NOM versus OM in pediatric patients.

### Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy: is It Time to end the discussion? [^115YYZFB]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic appendectomy is typically associated with inpatient hospitalization averaging between 1 and 2 days. In July 2010, a prospective protocol for outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy was adopted at our institution. Patients were dismissed from the post-anesthesia recovery room or day surgery if they met certain predefined criteria. Patients admitted to a hospital room as either full admission or observation status were considered failures of outpatient management.

Study Design

An IRB-approved, retrospective review of a prospective database was performed on all patients having laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis from July 2010 through December 2014. Study exclusions included age younger than 17 years, pregnancy, interval appendectomy, and gangrenous or perforated appendicitis. Patient demographics, success with outpatient management, morbidity, and readmissions were analyzed.

Results

Five hundred and sixty-three patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis during this time frame. There were 281 men and 282 women, with a mean age of 35.5 years. Four hundred and eighty-four patients (86%) were managed as outpatients. Seventy-nine patients were admitted for pre-existing conditions (32 patients), postoperative morbidity (10 patients), physician discretion (6 patients), or lack of transportation or support at home (31 patients). Thirty-eight patients (6.7%) experienced postoperative morbidity. Seven patients (1.2%) were readmitted after outpatient management for transient fever, nausea/vomiting, migraine headache, urinary tract infection, partial small bowel obstruction, and deep venous thrombosis. There were no mortalities or reoperations. Including the readmissions, overall success with outpatient management was 85%.

Conclusions

Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed with a high rate of success, low morbidity, and low readmission rate. This protocol has withstood the test of time. Widespread adoption has the potential for substantial health care savings.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: a non-inferiority study [^111nKZSz]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-operative management (NOM) of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is a well-established alternative to upfront surgery. The administration of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually performed in hospital, and only one study described outpatient NOM. The aim of this multicentre retrospective non-inferiority study was to evaluate both safety and non-inferiority of outpatient compared to inpatient NOM in uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Methods

The study included 668 consecutive patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients were treated according to the surgeon's preference: 364 upfront appendectomy, 157 inpatient NOM (inNOM), and 147 outpatient NOM (outNOM). The primary endpoint was the 30-day appendectomy rate, with a non-inferiority limit of 5%. Secondary endpoints were negative appendectomy rate, 30-day unplanned emergency department (ED) visits, and length of stay.

Results

30-day appendectomies were 16 (10.9%) in the outNOM group and 23 (14.6%) in the inNOM group (p = 0.327). OutNOM was non-inferior to inNOM with a risk difference of — 3.80% 97.5% CI (− 12.57; 4.97). No difference was found between inNOM and outNOM groups for the number of complicated appendicitis (3 vs. 5) and negative appendectomy (1 vs. 0). Twenty-six (17.7%) outNOM patients required an unplanned ED visit after a median of 1 (1–4) days. In the outNOM group, the mean cumulative in-hospital stay was 0.89 (1.94) days compared with 3.94 (2.17) days in the inNOM group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Outpatient NOM was non-inferior to inpatient NOM with regard to the 30-day appendectomy rate, while a shorter hospital stay was found in the outNOM group. Further, studies are required to confirm these findings.

### A prospective treatment protocol for outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis [^112kSZqM]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many laparoscopic procedures are currently performed on an outpatient basis. Laparoscopic appendectomy, however, continues to require postoperative hospitalization at most institutions. A treatment protocol for outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy was developed to determine if this could be successfully performed without increasing postoperative complications. We hypothesized that adopting an outpatient protocol for laparoscopic appendectomy will significantly increase the rate of outpatient management for uncomplicated appendicitis, without an increase in morbidity or mortality.

Study Design

We initiated a prospective outpatient protocol for laparoscopic appendectomy in July 2010 at our institution. All patients having laparoscopic appendectomy from July 2010 to March 2011 were included as protocol patients and were retrospectively reviewed. A separate group of patients having laparoscopic appendectomy from January to September 2009 were analyzed as historical controls. These 2 groups were compared for demographics, preoperative comorbidities, outpatient management, and postoperative morbidity by chi-square analysis, with a 0.95 confidence level for statistical significance.

Results

A total of 116 protocol patients were compared with 119 historical control patients. There were no significant differences in patient demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and pathologic findings between protocol patients and historical controls. Ninety-nine protocol patients (85.3%) had procedures as outpatients compared with 42 historical control patients (35.3%; p < 0.05). Postoperative morbidity occurred in 6 protocol patients (5.2%) and 10 historical controls (8.4%; p = NS). There were no readmissions or mortalities in the protocol group.

Conclusions

An outpatient protocol for laparoscopic appendectomy significantly increased the rate of outpatient management with no increase in morbidity or mortality. This practice has now become standard of care at our institution.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^115TMznS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer 8 key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or nonoperative management, and specific technical and post-operative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were then presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

Results

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), either suction and lavage or suction alone, no routine drain placement, treatment with short-term antibiotics postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated nonoperatively undergoing interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to current controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

### Lower abdominal pain [^115UKSfw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Although most frequently presenting with lower abdominal pain, appendicitis, colitis, and diverticulitis can cause pain throughout the abdomen and can cause peritoneal and retroperitoneal symptoms. Evaluation and management of lower intestinal disease requires a nuanced approach by the emergency physician, sometimes requiring computed tomography, ultrasonography, MRI, layered imaging, shared decision making, serial examination, and/or close follow-up. Once a presumed or confirmed diagnosis is made, appropriate treatment is initiated, and may include surgery, antibiotics, and/or steroids. Appendicitis patients should be admitted. Diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease can frequently be managed on an outpatient basis, but may require admission and surgical consultation.

While there are guidelines for deciding on surgical or non-surgical treatment of acute appendicitis, there is no present consensus on medical indications to prefer conventional over ambulatory procedures for acute appendicitis, although ambulatory procedures have been shown to decrease post-operative morbidities. In France, only 1.3% of appendectomy procedures in 2015 were performed in ambulatory settings. Most surgeons see conventional hospitalization as the standard and look for patients eligible for AS. By contrast, we consider all patients eligible for AS by default, unless they (i) have severe comorbidities which require monitoring, (ii) cannot be operated before 5 pm and cannot be postponed to the next day, (iii) do not meet ambulatory discharge criteria, and/or (iv) have severe infections or complications.

Lefrançois et al. created a score to select patients for AS based on 5 preoperative criteria (BMI < 28 kg/m², preoperative CRP levels < 30 mg/dL, preoperative WBC counts < 15,000/mm³, diameters of the appendix ≤ 10 mm, and no radiological signs of perforation). In our series, we found that patients with greater CRP levels, greater appendix diameters, perforation signs as well as older patients were less likely to have AS, but found no differences regarding BMI or WBC counts. Frazee et al. and Cash et al. also demonstrated that, in patients eligible for same-day discharge, pre-existing comorbidities as well as older age were factors that prompted conventional surgery. Scott et al. underlined that the decision to discharge younger, healthier patients from the recovery room is often based on the subjective appreciation of operating surgeons rather than objective medical criteria. If so, then the practice of routine conventional hospitalization after appendectomy should be questioned.

### Nonoperative management of noncomplicated appendicitis… [^1127iNPg]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

In combination with other existing randomized clinical trials and concordant with recent consensus guidelines, 18 these data indicate that nonoperative management is a viable treatment option in most cases and imply that surgery is overused. Patients undergoing nonoperative management experienced statistically significant, albeit small, differences in length of hospital stay compared with patients who underwent appendectomy. Patients who underwent open appendectomy were hospitalized for slightly longer than those treated laparoscopically. We found extensive regional variation in rates of nonoperative management by MSA but no statistically significant difference between urban vs rural areas.

In 69 of the 314 MSAs, all cases of uncomplicated appendicitis were managed with appendectomy, whereas the maximum rate of nonoperative management was 20. 4% in 1 MSA. Supporting such a possibility is the finding that 25 of 69 patients undergoing appendicitis-related readmission in the nonoperative management group did not require additional operations or procedures. Despite these potential explanations, differences in readmission rates persisted after CEM and multivariate analysis, suggesting that our findings reflect a true clinical difference. These findings differ from those of prior randomized clinical trials and may indicate that nonoperative management results in worse short-term health when generalized to a broader population. Although rates of nonoperative management varied across metropolitan areas, broad regional differences were less pronounced.

Patients living in the Northeast and South were slightly more likely to undergo nonoperative management compared with those living in the North Central and Western regions. No difference in rates of nonoperative management occurred between urban and rural areas. Previous studies have suggested that patients in rural areas may undergo less surgery than those in urban regions with abundant health care resources40; however, our data do not support a similar regional pattern for appendicitis care.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^114NkhFw]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In the current study, the safety of outpatient management compared with hospitalization may be related to differences in antibiotic delivery and adherence and timing of surgical care being insufficiently important to often result in SAEs. Patients discharged within 24 hours may have been at lower risk for complications because they were selected based on physician judgment and stability criteria. Hospitalization itself may have been associated with greater opportunity for interventions leading to SAEs, some of which may have been avoided with outpatient care.

Compared with routine hospitalization, to the extent that outpatient management can be done among qualifying patients, our findings support that such management would not result in greater risk of SAEs or appendectomy and hence could be more convenient and less costly. Although outpatient surgery is possible, almost all patients undergoing appendectomy are currently hospitalized. Compared with inpatient care, outpatient antibiotic management was associated with 1 day less of missed work for participants. Furthermore, outpatients uncommonly had to return for unscheduled care visits or require hospitalization during the following 7 days, with these visits occurring no more frequently than among those who were initially admitted for hospital care. A US health sector perspective cost-effectiveness studyfound that antibiotic treatment with ED discharge was associated with less cost than hospital admission, amounting to more than $1000 per case and varying with length of stay. Differences in patient charges would be expected to be substantially greater, particularly if comparing those associated with outpatient antibiotic treatment and inpatient appendectomy.

Broader application of outpatient nonoperative management is suggested by similarity of characteristics between participants managed in the outpatient and inpatients settings and associated unadjusted and adjusted outcomes. In addition, overall appendectomy rates were not higher among high-enrolling CODA sites treating more than 75% of antibiotic-treated participants as outpatients compared with sites where this occurred less frequently. The site that most frequently practiced outpatient management (99 of 111 participants [89.2%]) was both the highest-enrolling CODA site and the location for the pilot study of this innovation; this finding could reflect higher use associated with greater physician experience and comfort with this approach. We found differences in the rate of outpatient management by racial identity that appeared site related; broader uptake of this care could help eliminate these disparities. Future studies should evaluate the extent to which outpatient management, including all-oral antibiotic treatment, can be used for nonoperative treatment, including in children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117K3j2T]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Appendicitis management — uncomplicated versus complicated cases involves differing strategies, with multicenter trials such as the Appendicitis acuta (APPAC) trial reporting antibiotic only treatment to be safe and effective in adults with first episode uncomplicated appendicitis and similar, albeit more limited, data in children; while approximately 90% of patients in these studies were able to avoid initial surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis, recurrence was estimated to be roughly 20–30% at 5-year follow-up, so it is commonly suggested that treatment options should be presented to the patient, allowing for shared decision-making. Patients with complicated appendicitis are often treated based on clinical presentation, with some trialed on antibiotic treatment while others undergo immediate surgical intervention; if treated nonoperatively, many surgeons recommend interval appendectomy, but approaches vary and are not universally agreed upon. Operative approach and post-operative management also vary, with questions persisting regarding timing of operation, drain placement during surgery for complicated appendicitis, suction versus suction and lavage for perforated appendicitis, and the duration of postoperative antibiotics; because treatment can be drastically different between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis, selecting the optimal imaging modality to differentiate between them is critical.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^114Gmyhd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our findings cannot be generalized to all patients with appendicitis. CODA trial enrollment criteria needed to be met, and ED discharge was predicated on patient stability and reliability for follow-up. In addition, these results only apply to those who can be discharged within 24 hours. Five percent of participants randomized to the antibiotic group progressed or changed their treatment preference and underwent appendectomy before 24 hours of observation. The potential for early worsening highlights the importance of serial evaluation before ED discharge is considered.

Limitations

This study has limitations. First, although our adjusted analysis did not find outpatient management to be associated with an increased appendectomy risk, unaccounted factors may have differentiated patients discharged early from the hospitalized group. A similar adjusted analysis of SAEs could not be performed because of their rarity. These findings, however, support the safety of clinician selection across a broad range of patients. Second, this was not a randomized trial in which participants who qualified for outpatient care were assigned to early discharge or inpatient care, so we did not directly assess comparative effectiveness. Third, we recognize that there may be different perspectives on the time threshold to define outpatient management and hospitalization. Our definitions, discharge within or after 24 hours of presentation, are commonly used and are based on when participants received at least their first antibiotic dose and on CMS criteria. Thus, these definitions can be generalized and have cost implications in the US. We also found similar results for participants discharged within 12 hours.

### Time is money: quantifying savings in outpatient appendectomy [^112zPUW8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

After institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis (level III evidence) of data from the University of Kentucky healthcare discharge database, Hospital Finance, and medical records of patients admitted for the time period of June 1, 2013 to April 30, 2017. We included subjects 15 years or older with the admission diagnosis of "appendicitis". Elective appendectomies, open cases, non-resective operations, and those involving intestinal resection more than the appendix were excluded.

Individual medical records were analyzed to determine whether patients went home from the PACU or were admitted to an observation or inpatient bed. For patients not discharged directly from the PACU, the indication for observation or inpatient admission was determined. Patients were categorized as inpatient admission, observation admission, or PACU-to-home. Patients were divided into two time periods, before and after the outpatient appendectomy protocol was implemented on January 1, 2016. Outpatient protocol was not restricted by age. Patients were admitted to the emergency department (ED) observation area and taken to the operating room on an emergency basis. The criteria for identifying patients eligible for outpatient appendectomy include laparoscopic procedure, could tolerate liquids in PACU without vomiting, did not require prolonged intravenous antibiotics, and had adequate pain control. The process for the outpatient appendectomy protocol was defined by a discharge order for the patient to leave directly from the PACU without any diet order, no planned observation bed, and no plan for interval examination by the team. PACU discharge was based on standard PACU criteria for other outpatient general surgery (eg, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair). Faculty and residents were encouraged to use this protocol based on their clinical judgment. One concern about the use of outpatient appendectomy is short-term readmission rates. Short-term readmission was defined as within 3 days of discharge, which was based on the mean length of stay for inpatients, found to be slightly above 3 days.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study support that outpatient antibiotic management is safe for selected adults with acute appendicitis. It appears that most patients who choose antibiotics can avoid hospitalization without incurring increased risk of serious complications or appendectomy. Outpatient management should be included in shared decision-making discussions of patient preferences for outcomes associated with nonoperative and operative care.

Appendicitis is a common diagnosis in children being evaluated in the emergency department. After diagnosis, standard treatment has been surgical appendectomy; however, in recent years there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the possibility of nonoperative management in both children and adults. This review will present the current state of the pediatric literature that suggests patients may be successfully treated with antibiotics alone (ie, without surgery), but that a proportion of these patients will have recurrent appendicitis. Given that the literature regarding the option of antibiotic-only management compared with surgery is not yet definitive, there are many factors for providers to discuss with families and patients when considering treatment for acute appendicitis.

Development of an outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy protocol will be associated with significant cost savings in eligible patients. The exact amount of total cost savings from implementing this protocol will depend on the percentage of patients who are clinically appropriate to be discharged home, surgeon comfort, organizational efficiency, and appendicitis grade. Profit margin will ultimately depend on total cost savings and payer mix.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^111egjPi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Almost all past studiesthat compared antibiotics and appendectomy required hospitalization for patients treated nonoperatively. In 2017, Talan et alreported on a pilot randomized clinical trial of nonoperative vs operative treatment in which antibiotic-assigned adult participants could be discharged from the ED based on stability criteria similar to those of the CODA trial and after a minimum of 6 hours of observation. Participants had a next-day follow-up visit. In that trial, 14 of 15 antibiotic-treated participants (93.3%) received outpatient management; none required appendectomy during the next 30 days. The CODA trial neither specified a minimum observation period nor required next-day follow-up. However, participants usually had been treated for many hours before their diagnosis was established and antibiotics were given; on discharge, participants were closely followed up. In 2021, Sippola et alreported a trial of adults randomized to receive oral moxifloxacin for 7 days or intravenous ertapenem for 2 days and then oral levofloxacin and metronidazole for 5 days; 70.2% of the all-oral group and 73.8% of the intravenous-to-oral group did not undergo appendectomy at 1 year, although all-oral treatment was not shown to be noninferior. Participants were evaluated in the hospital twice daily, with the minimal observation of 20 to 24 hours before discharge. To our knowledge, no studies of outpatient management in children with appendicitis have been published.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^116PXNab]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Definitions

We defined outpatient management as occurring if the patient was discharged within 24 hours of ED registration (typically from the ED but occasionally from other care areas) and defined hospitalization as a stay longer than 24 hours. The 24-hour threshold was based on the time by which participants had imaging performed, diagnosis confirmed, and antibiotic doses administered such that they could be considered for outpatient care, prior outpatient management study definitions, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) criteria. The CMS stipulates that outpatient observation services generally do not exceed 24 hours, and the 2-midnight rule qualifies more than 24 hours of hospital care as inpatient admission. In addition to cost implications, care beyond 24 hours would require an overnight stay that would be inconsistent with outpatient care. Because of variation in availability of observation and hospital beds and physician discretion, some antibiotic-treated participants had ED discharge after 24 hours. We previously reported that 365 of 776 antibiotic-randomized participants (47.0%) had ED discharge at any time after ED registration; 30 participants (3.8%) had ED discharge after 24 hours. For this analysis and the reasons mentioned in this section, participants with ED discharge after 24 hours were considered to have been hospitalized.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was safety as determined by SAE incidence. An SAE was defined as death, a life-threatening event, significant treatment-related disability or incapacity, or non–appendicitis-related hospitalization. The incidence of SAEs was primarily examined among outpatient-treated participants but was also compared with that of hospitalized participants, along with other outcomes. Other outcomes included the following: (1) appendectomies, (2) later hospitalization and ED and urgent care visits, (3) missed workdays, (4) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program events,(5) patient-reported treatment dissatisfaction, and (6) EQ-5D score. The primary outcome interval was 0 to 7 days based on the assumption that antibiotic failure would affect early clinical response. We also evaluated outcomes through 30 days, as well as appendectomies through 2 years, among subgroups with ED discharge between 0 and 12 hours and greater than 12 and 24 hours, and among those with an appendicolith. The EQ-5D scores were only assessed at 30 days. The instrumental support score was determined by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for the outcomes of having someone to take the patient to a physician, run errands, and help with daily chores and if confined to bed.

### Trends and levels of the global, regional, and national burden of appendicitis between 1990 and 2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^113m8yci]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Although the geographical and temporal trends in appendicitis burden in our study generally follow the socioeconomic status of a country, a few notable exceptions exist. Our analysis shows that Andean Latin America, composed of three countries (Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru), has one of the highest incidence and mortality rates across all GBD regions; however, this region also had the biggest success in reducing the disease burden (ie, the DALY rate) during the study period. The DALY rate similarly decreased in south Asia. Further epidemiological research in these regions would help shed light on the role of underlying risk factors and clinical practice in the heterogeneity of the disease burden.

Despite the similar spatial pattern, the incidence rates estimated in our study were generally higher than those previously reported. The difference in the magnitude could be explained partly by the efforts we made to ensure that inpatient data sources were standardised and corrected to account for patients who did not require an inpatient admission lasting at least 24 h. Several studies have found that, in high-income countries, a considerable proportion of patients are diagnosed and treated in outpatient and same-day hospital settings. In the USA, for instance, about 20–37% of paediatric laparoscopic appendicectomies were found to be done in outpatient care and patients were discharged on the same day. Likewise, in the UK, 45% of adult patients with acute appendicitis were treated and discharged from outpatient care on the same day. A similar pattern was observed in our claims data sources, which distinguished inpatient claims (lasting at least 24 h and having a room and board claim) from outpatient claims (which included same-day care from clinics and hospital services); in our sources, 56% of total appendicitis cases were captured in the outpatient claims file only (data not shown). As outpatient treatments and procedures are becoming more common to treat non-perforated appendicitis, especially in high-income countries, it is important to take into consideration outpatient cases to accurately estimate the total disease burden.

### Non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children: can patients Be discharged from the emergency department? [^111hMaZ7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children is a safe alternative to laparoscopic appendectomy. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of nonoperative outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis in pediatric patients.

Methods

A standardized pathway for non-operative outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children (NOMA-C) was implemented in a university pediatric surgery practice starting October 2021. Those who met criteria would be considered for discharge from the emergency department (ED) with oral antibiotics and close followup over the following year. A quality improvement project started concurrently to monitor patients for recurrent symptoms of appendicitis.

Results

A total of 121 patients were diagnosed with acute appendicitis during the study period (October 2021 to April 2023). Forty-five children (38%) met criteria for the NOMA-C protocol, and 11 patients/families chose appendectomy. Of the 34 patients who pursued nonoperative management, 14 patients were admitted to the hospital and 20 patients were discharged from the ED. Total time in the ED/hospital was significantly shorter for patients discharged from the ED (7 hours versus 23 hours; p < 0.001). At one year follow up only 4 (12%) had undergone appendectomy. There were no adverse events for patients who underwent nonoperative management.

Conclusion

A protocol offering non-operative management of appendicitis with an option for outpatient management was feasible and safe. Outpatient management was associated with shorter ED/hospital stays than those admitted. Future studies should evaluate whether this protocol can be adopted by EDs without pediatric surgery services to avoid the need for transfer.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^112RBS6C]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Figure 2.
Cumulative Incidence of Appendectomy Through 30 Days in the Antibiotic Group by Emergency Department (ED) Discharge Within 24 Hours or Later

The proportion of participants discharged within 24 hours at each of the 25 investigative sites varied from 0.0% to 89.2% (median, 21.7%; IQR, 3.4%-57.9%). Figure 3 shows the association of appendectomy rate among all antibiotic-treated participants (inpatients and outpatients) during 7 days with the proportion receiving outpatient management at each site with more than 10 participants randomized to receive antibiotics.

Overall Appendectomy Rate Through 7 Days and Proportion of Participants Randomized to Receive Antibiotics Who Were Discharged From the Emergency Department Within 24 Hours by Investigative Site

Patient-related and other outcomes were also evaluated at 7 days (Table 2). Patients in both the outpatient and inpatient settings had low rates of treatment dissatisfaction. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program events occurred in 1.8 (95% CI, 0.8–3.9) per 100 outpatients and 5.6 (95% CI, 3.5–8.5) per 100 hospitalized participants. Later unplanned outpatient (ED or urgent care) visits occurred in 3.8% (95% CI, 2.0%-6.5%) of those with outpatient management vs 1.1% (95% CI, 0.3%-2.9%) who were hospitalized; hospitalization after the index visit care occurred in 9.4% (95% CI, 6.4%-13.1%) of outpatients vs 5.7% (95% CI, 3.5%-8.7%) of those who were hospitalized. Compared with those who were hospitalized, outpatients missed fewer workdays (2.6 days; 95% CI, 2.3–2.9 days) vs (3.8 days; 95% CI, 3.4–4.3 days). The EQ-5D-scores at 30 days were similarly high.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^114dQwA1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

In the Comparison of Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial, which found antibiotics to be noninferior, approximately half of participants randomized to receive antibiotics had outpatient management with hospital discharge within 24 hours. If outpatient management is safe, it could increase convenience and decrease health care use and costs.

Objective

To assess the use and safety of outpatient management of acute appendicitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study, which is a secondary analysis of the CODA trial, included 776 adults with imaging-confirmed appendicitis who received antibiotics at 25 US hospitals from May 1, 2016, to February 28, 2020.

Exposures

Participants randomized to antibiotics (intravenous then oral) could be discharged from the emergency department based on clinician judgment and prespecified criteria (hemodynamically stable, afebrile, oral intake tolerated, pain controlled, and follow-up confirmed). Outpatient management and hospitalization were defined as discharge within or after 24 hours, respectively.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes compared among patients receiving outpatient vs inpatient care included serious adverse events (SAEs), appendectomies, health care encounters, satisfaction, missed workdays at 7 days, and EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) score at 30 days. In addition, appendectomy incidence among outpatients and inpatients, unadjusted and adjusted for illness severity, was compared.

Results

Among 776 antibiotic-randomized participants, 42 (5.4%) underwent appendectomy within 24 hours and 8 (1.0%) did not receive their first antibiotic dose within 24 hours, leaving 726 (93.6%) comprising the study population (median age, 36 years; range, 18–86 years; 462 [63.6%] male; 437 [60.2%] White). Of these participants, 335 (46.1%; site range, 0–89.2%) were discharged within 24 hours, and 391 (53.9%) were discharged after 24 hours. Over 7 days, SAEs occurred in 0.9 (95% CI, 0.2–2.6) per 100 outpatients and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.4–2.9) per 100 inpatients; in the appendicolith subgroup, SAEs occurred in 2.3 (95% CI, 0.3–8.2) per 100 outpatients vs 2.8 (95% CI, 0.6–7.9) per 100 inpatients. During this period, appendectomy occurred in 9.9% (95% CI, 6.9%-13.7%) of outpatients and 14.1% (95% CI, 10.8%-18.0%) of inpatients; adjusted analysis demonstrated a similar difference in incidence (-4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.7 to 0.6). At 30 days, appendectomies occurred in 12.6% (95% CI, 9.1%-16.7%) of outpatients and 19.0% (95% CI, 15.1%-23.4%) of inpatients. Outpatients missed fewer workdays (2.6 days; 95% CI, 2.3–2.9 days) than did inpatients (3.8 days; 95% CI, 3.4–4.3 days) and had similar frequency of return health care visits and high satisfaction and EQ-5D scores.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings support that outpatient antibiotic management is safe for selected adults with acute appendicitis, with no greater risk of complications or appendectomy than hospital care, and should be included in shared decision-making discussions of patient preferences for outcomes associated with nonoperative and operative care.

### Time is money: quantifying savings in outpatient appendectomy [^111q8ZV8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Outpatient appendectomy has now been clearly established as safe and effective, with complication rates, readmission rates, and satisfaction equivocal to those patients kept in observation. We were successful in implementing an outpatient appendectomy protocol that increased the percentage of patients discharged from the PACU. Implementation of an outpatient appendectomy protocol was not successful in facilitating discharge home of all eligible patients. By comparing the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, we are able to show gradual adoption of this protocol. The most important difference between the two time periods is a significant increase in patients who were sent home from the PACU. One reason that this protocol is expected to yield a slow adoption rate is that individual surgeons varied in the rate at which they embraced outpatient appendectomy. During data analysis, we found numerous patients admitted to observation in the postimplementation period who seemed to be appropriate to be discharged home, but who were treated by surgeons who had not yet chosen to adopt to the protocol. Conversely, there were also surgeons who were discharging patients home from the PACU even before formal implementation of the protocol. Evidence suggests that more than half of new perioperative protocols meet barriers to initiation, including logistical issues, time constraints, and opposition from colleagues. A greater comfort level with outpatient appendectomy developed among our providers over time. Implementing outpatient appendectomy protocol requires a culture change and effects are likely to appear gradually.

Appendicitis severity can be graded using numerous methods. We sought to determine whether appendicitis grading would determine which patients could be discharged home from the PACU. The AAST grading system has been the most extensively studied, and we have shown AAST grade correlates with cost and operative duration. Data shown here indicate that patients with high-grade appendicitis are more likely to require an inpatient bed. High-grade appendicitis is characterized clinically by abdominal tenderness, mass, and peritonitis, and operatively by perforation, phlegmon, or generalized peritonitis. It is therefore not surprising that patients with high-grade appendicitis more often require inpatient admission. However, 80% of patients in our study had clinical or operative grade I or II appendicitis. Within these low grades, we could not discriminate who required an observation bed based on grading. This lack of discrimination leads us to conclude that in the majority of patients, the decision to discharge home from the PACU is more dependent on the surgeon than the patient.

### Current practice patterns in the treatment of perforated appendicitis in children [^111FPp85]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of perforated appendicitis in children often involves a combination of surgical and medical therapy. The aim of this study was to document the degree of consensus in the current management of perforated appendicitis in children.

Study Design

A survey was sent to all practicing pediatric surgeons in North America in April 2000 who were members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association for 1999–2000. Survey questions pertained to preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative practice patterns, particularly those issues related to use of antibiotic therapy.

Results

Among eligible surgeons, 80.2% completed the survey. Although more than 80% of respondents practiced in an academic setting, only 17% of surgeons used a formal clinical practice guideline to direct care. Responses varied substantially in the duration of postoperative antibiotic therapy, the use of intravenous or oral agents or both, and the duration of hospitalization. A considerable number of patients are receiving a portion of their intravenous antibiotic therapy as outpatients.

Conclusions

There is little apparent consensus in the many aspects of perioperative and postoperative care of perforated appendicitis in children across North America. Only a fraction of surgeons currently uses a formal clinical practice guideline for treatment of perforated appendicitis, although increased pressures to develop more cost-effective therapeutic strategies can encourage development of additional guidelines. Definitive evidence to inform development of such guidelines and enhance consensus is lacking. Further studies are needed across institutions to better inform clinical decisions in light of a changing practice environment and treatment alternatives.

### Diagnostic accuracy using low-dose versus standard radiation dose CT in suspected acute appendicitis: prospective cohort study [^114ScyMp]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, which reflects routine clinical practice in acute-care surgery, low- and standard-dose abdominal CT were equally accurate in both diagnosing acute appendicitis and in differentiating between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis, corroborating existing evidence. In addition, the median radiation dose associated with low-dose CT was lower than that used in standard-dose imaging. Increasing evidence for the safety, efficacy, feasibility, and cost benefits, of non-operative management of CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis are gradually transitioning to clinical practice. Correspondingly, and concurrently with the changing treatment paradigms, the present findings of low-dose CT having similar accuracy with a markedly lower radiation dose should further encourage active implementation of low-dose modalities in acute appendicitis imaging, regardless of whether CT is used as first-line imaging or after, for example, an inconclusive ultrasound examination.

The recent APPAC II trialcompared oral antibiotic monotherapy with intravenous followed by oral antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis with low-dose CT as the protocol diagnostic imaging for patients with a BMI below 30 kg/m². In that trial, 207 (70.2 per cent) of the 295 patients treated with oral antibiotics only did not undergo appendicectomy within the first year, corroborating earlier results on the feasibility of antibiotic treatment of CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Together with earlier promising results on the outpatient management of acute appendicitis, the findings of the APPAC II trial encourage further pursuit of the possibilities for outpatient management in the future. With the challenges and burden imposed on the healthcare system by the COVID-19 pandemic, these findings highlight the importance of accurate preinterventional assessment of the severity of appendicitis. Accuracy in differentiating between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis will enable both assessment of all treatment alternatives available to the patient, and possibly also the option to avoid admission to hospital altogether for some patients. The present results further support the findings of the APPAC IIand OPTICAPtrials that this preintervention assessment can be carried out in actual clinical practice using low-dose CT without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

### Impact of an outpatient appendectomy protocol on clinical outcomes and cost: a case-control study [^112U8UXE]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although elective outpatient surgery is commonplace, surgeons remain hesitant to discharge patients the same day after emergent surgery. We created a formal protocol to select patients for early discharge after laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis, and we assessed its safety and potential cost savings.

Study Design

We matched patients who were discharged early from the recovery room with similar patients from a control group on the basis of age ± 3 years, presence or absence of a comorbidity, laparoscopic procedure, and nonperforated appendicitis; we compared them to assess the impact of early discharge on morbidity, return visits to the emergency room, and total cost incurred by our institution.

Results

During the first year of our protocol, 72 of 161 (45%) patients who presented with acute appendicitis and underwent appendectomy were discharged early, with a median post-operative length of stay of 4.7 hours. When compared with matched controls, patients discharged early had similar complication rates (4.3% early group vs 7.1%, p = 0.72) and number of postoperative visits to the emergency room (11.4% vs 11.4%, p = 0.8), but had a reduced median length of stay (4.7 vs 16.2 hours, p < 0.001) and an average reduction in cost of $323.46 per patient.

Conclusions

Adoption of a protocol to select patients for early discharge after laparoscopic appendectomy resulted in a 45% reduction in the need for in-hospital beds, with no negative impact on return visits to the emergency room or number of complications. This translates to an approximate savings of $323 per patient when compared with standard care.

### Appendectomy versus non-operative treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children: study protocol for a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^115LFoNU]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Follow-up

All participants will be seen in the outpatient clinic at 6 weeks following discharge and again at 3 months and 1 year following randomisation for collection of secondary outcome data. Details of any unscheduled healthcare visits specific to the previous episode of appendicitis will be recorded contemporaneously if at the same institution, or will be inquired about at the 3-month and 1-year follow-up appointments. If families are unable to attend for follow-up then consultation by telemedicine facility or telephone will be undertaken.

We will obtain permission from these families to hold their personal contact details in a secure registry and to contact them in the future to determine in a longer follow-up study if they have had complications that may be attributed to treatment (including recurrence of appendicitis).

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^112tcaCH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The Comparison of Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial was the largest reported randomized clinical trial comparing antibiotic treatment and appendectomy for patients with imaging-confirmed appendicitis. The CODA trial found antibiotics to be noninferior to appendectomy for a 30-day general health measure, the EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) score. In addition, several secondary outcomes were compared, including serious adverse events (SAEs), health care encounters, and missed work; the subsequent appendectomy rate was reported among antibiotic-assigned participants. The CODA trial included patients with appendicolith, and SAE and appendectomy rates were greater in this subgroup.

One distinctive feature of the CODA trial was that an antibiotic-assigned participant who met stability criteria could be discharged from the emergency department (ED) with oral antibiotics after initial receipt of parenteral antibiotics. Outpatient antibiotic management has been described, to our knowledge, in only 1 small trial. Because nearly half of the participants randomized to receive antibiotics were discharged from the ED rather than admitted to hospital, the CODA trial allows an opportunity to better characterize this management approach.

In 2020, after publication of initial CODA trial results, the American College of Surgeons issued guidelines stating that high-quality evidence indicates that most patients can be treated with antibiotics rather than appendectomy. Outpatient management, if safe and effective, potentially affords greater patient convenience and reduced health care use and costs. Alternatively, if outpatient management is associated with clinical worsening related to oral antibiotic nonadherence and delayed surgical interventions, with more visits, complications, and appendectomies, then initial hospitalization may be the preferred strategy for antibiotic delivery and close observation. Therefore, we conducted a cohort study that analyzed participants randomized to receive antibiotics in the CODA trial to assess the use and safety of outpatient management across the spectrum of patients, illness presentations, and investigative sites.

### Time is money: quantifying savings in outpatient appendectomy [^1115GaRA]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Laparoscopic appendectomy is the most common treatment of appendicitis. Recent evidence suggests laparoscopic appendectomies can be performed on a fast-track, short-stay, or even outpatient basis. This approach was described a decade ago and has been used in adults and children. This outpatient appendectomy protocol provides high success rates, low morbidity, low readmission rates, and shorter length of hospital stay.

Financial benefits of outpatient protocol have not been established as definitively as clinical outcomes. In one study, a fast-track protocol for laparoscopic appendectomy reduced hospital costs; however, the average length of stay for fast-track patients was still longer than 1 day, so this study did not fully represent the true effect of outpatient appendectomy. In a similar study in children with appendicitis treated on a fast-track protocol, the average savings was approximately $350 compared with children who stayed overnight. In another study, total hospital charges were reduced by around $900 in patients successfully managed on a fast-track protocol designed for appendicitis, but costs were not reported. In a study from Canada showing true outpatient appendectomy where patients were discharged from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), cost savings were $323.46 per patient. Cost savings in adult patients undergoing outpatient appendectomy have not been well reported in the USA.

Length of stay is an important determinant of hospital costs, and therefore an important potential financial opportunity. For example, in patients with acute cholecystitis, costs increase incrementally for each additional hospital day. We hypothesize that an outpatient appendectomy protocol where patients go home from the PACU will result in cost savings.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^114zMamm]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. However, guidance as to specific management does not exist.

Methods

PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Results

Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified. The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in persons 5 to 50 years of age. In most trials, imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess, phlegmon, or tumor. Antibiotics regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days. Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on parenteral agents to same-day hospital or ED discharge of stable patients with outpatient oral antibiotics. Minimum time allowed before response was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours. Although pain was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy, analgesic regimens were poorly described. Trials differed in use of other response indicators, that is, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and reimaging. Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated. Initial response rates were generally greater than 90% and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours, with no related severe sepsis or deaths. In most studies, appendectomy was recommended for recurrence; however, in several, patients had antibiotic retreatment with success.

Conclusion

While further investigation of conservative treatment is ongoing, patients considering this approach should be advised and managed according to study methods and related guidelines to promote informed shared decision-making and optimize their chance of similar outcomes as described in published trials. Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation, employ best-practice pain control and antibiotic selection, better define cancer risk, and explore longer time thresholds for response, minimized diet restriction and hospital stays, and antibiotic re-treatment will further our understanding of the potential effectiveness of conservative management.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is an update of a 2000 clinical policy on the evaluation and management of patients presenting with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain.1 A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1)Can clinical findings be used to guide decision making in the risk stratification of patients with possible appendicitis? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute appendicitis who are undergoing a computed tomography scan, what is the role of contrast? (3) In children with suspected acute appendicitis who undergo diagnostic imaging, what are the roles of computed tomography and ultrasound in diagnosing acute appendicitis?Evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy should be the standard of care for uncomplicated appendicitis [^115dLorB]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 2012, a protocol for routine outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis was published reflecting high success, low morbidity, and significant cost savings. Despite this, national data reflect that the majority of laparoscopic appendectomies are performed with overnight admission. This study updates our experience with outpatient appendectomy since our initial report, confirming the efficacy of this approach.

Methods

In July 2010, a prospective protocol for outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy was adopted at our institution. Patients were dismissed from the postanesthesia recovery room or day surgery if they met predefined criteria for dismissal. Patients admitted to a hospital room as either full admission or observation status were considered failures of outpatient management. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis from July 2010 through December 2012 was performed to analyze success of outpatient management, postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as readmission rates.

Results

Three hundred forty-five patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis during this time frame. There were 166 men and 179 women, with a mean age of 35 years. Three hundred five patients were managed as outpatients, with a success rate of 88%. Forty patients (12%) were admitted for preexisting comorbidities (15 patients), postoperative morbidity (6 patients), or lack of transportation or home support (19 patients). Twenty-three patients (6.6%) experienced postoperative morbidity. There were no mortalities. Four patients (1%) were readmitted for transient fever, nausea/vomiting, partial small bowel obstruction, and deep venous thrombosis.

Conclusion

Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed with a high rate of success, a low morbidity, and a low readmission rate. This study reaffirms our original pilot study and should serve as the basis for a change in the standard of care for appendicitis.

### Outpatient appendectomy in an emergency outpatient surgery unit 24 h a day: an intention-to-treat analysis of 194 patients [^112zyMRK]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of patients operated on for uncomplicated acute appendicitis (UAA) in our 24-h emergency outpatient surgery unit.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study with intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. From 12/2013 to 03/2015, all consecutive patients admitted for acute appendicitis (AA) were prospectively screened. A computed tomography or abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of AA. Eligibility criteria for outpatient appendectomy were: UAA, no comorbidity, no physical or mental condition preventing participation in the study, absence of pregnancy, age older than 15 years, an accompanying adult person available for the hospital discharge and place of residence within 1 h of our hospital. In the case of intraoperative complication (abscess, local or general peritonitis) or complication of general anesthesia, patients were excluded from the outpatient pathway. The primary endpoint was the feasibility of outpatient appendectomy among all consecutive patients admitted for UAA.

Results

Of the 194 screened patients, 150 (77%) presented an UAA and 102 (68%) were eligible for an outpatient procedure. Thirteen eligible patients (13%) were excluded from the outpatient circuit (7 intraoperative and 6 postoperative contraindications). Outpatient appendectomy was performed in 89 patients, representing 59% (89/150) of the ITT population and 87% (89/102) of the eligible patients. The median length of hospital stay was 13 h. Postoperative complications were observed in six patients (6%).

Conclusions

This study reports a safe and feasible management of UAA. Our organization allows a short hospitalization for postoperative recovery without using conventional surgery beds and enables discharge throughout the night.

### Surgical and nonsurgical treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis in older adults… [^115hQBdd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 24 320 older adults, immediate operation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality compared with nonoperative management. When delayed operation was performed, the procedure was associated with higher in-hospital mortality and higher rates of complications. Meaning These findings suggest that immediate operation might be the preferred treatment strategy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in older adults. Treatment options for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in the general population have found support for both nonoperative and operative treatment. 1, 2 However, recent literature suggests that operative management for acute appendicitis may be superior in certain cohorts. 3, 4 An often underappreciated effect of treatment with antibiotics alone is the increased relative risks of complications with adverse health care events, abscess formation requiring drainage procedures, and reactions to antibiotics requiring a health care encounter.

1 Thus, the generalizability to all populations of the noninferiority of nonoperative management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis may be unreliable. We used a composite infectious complication and cardiopulmonary complications to highlight important outcomes. These outcome variables reflect outcomes that occurred at any point during hospitalization. Other outcome variables included hospital length of stay and total hospital charges. A total of 2195 patients with frailty were also discharged to a skilled nursing facility after their hospital stay, compared with 1135 patients without frailty. Patients who underwent immediate appendectomy also had a shorter median length of stay, although rates of complications and total hospital charges were comparable with those who received NOM.

Treatment of appendicitis with antibiotics alone in the general population is associated with longer LOS, 5. 36 times increased relative risk of requiring a drainage procedure,
21. 36 times increased relative risk of a reaction to antibiotics, 4. 62 times increased relative risk of additional hospitalization, and
2. 07 times increased relative risk of emergency department visit compared with surgical management. 1 Although we are unable to capture these events in our current study, it is probable that these increased health care encounters in an older adult population with frailty are associated with the higher in-hospital mortality seen in this study. This possibility warrants further investigation.

### Global attitudes in the management of acute appendicitis during COVID-19 pandemic: ACIE appy study [^113crKch]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Also to be taken into consideration is the finding that there might have been a reduction in the number of patients admitted to emergency departments during the pandemic; according to the present survey, 13.3 per cent of centres had fewer than five patients with appendicitis referred per month before versus 39.3 per cent during the pandemic. Moreover, there may have been a trend towards more advanced presentation (34.2 per cent stated that this was the case, whereas 39.3 per cent were unsure). These factors might also play a role in the decision‐making between open and MIS appendicectomy.

NOM with antibiotics represents a promising strategy to reduce resource consumption and avoid unnecessary surgery during the outbreak. The present survey shows that NOM with antibiotics was used routinely in over 50 per cent of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis by only 8.9 per cent of respondents before the pandemic, but currently by 23.7 per cent. Antibiotic management of uncomplicated appendicitis remains uncommon worldwide, but RCTshave recently demonstrated that this strategy is safe, with no increased risk of appendiceal perforation and sepsis, and no reported deaths. Although the relapse rate is not negligible, with 27 per cent of patients undergoing appendicectomy within 1 year, these data may be acceptable in the context of an overall strategy during the COVID‐19 outbreak.

Furthermore, a NOM strategy may be implemented as outpatient treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis, with discharge directly from the emergency department after initiation of antibiotic treatment and control of symptoms. In the present survey, the percentage of respondents reporting that their institution treated uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics at home and followed up at the outpatient clinic in almost all patients (76–100 per cent) increased from 5.2 per cent before to 9.8 per cent during the pandemic.

A therapeutic strategy based on the shortest possible stay in hospital is highly relevant during the COVID‐19 crisis, as it can reduce the risk of infection and overload of hospitals already stretched by the effects of the outbreak. Safe and effective strategies that allow outpatient antibiotic management of imaging‐confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis are feasible only if established pathways exist to separate patients suspected of having COVID‐19, those who are infected and those who are not. Furthermore, careful evaluation of the clinical presentation and assessment of CT images, and a minimum period of observation in hospital of 6–10 h may be necessary.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^111yvhm3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to current understanding, appendicitis can be divided by severity into two different disease entities, uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis, enabling different treatments. The long-standing belief that all instances of appendicitis invariably lead to perforation unless patients are operated on, appears to be applicable only to complicated acute appendicitis and the majority of instances of appendicitis are uncomplicated. Contemporary studies show that uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be safely and efficiently managed with antibioticsand also in an outpatient setting. However, there is still a lack of established and consistent criteria for distinguishing between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. Consequently, the objective findings minimizing non-responsiveness to initial antibiotics and therefore facilitating safe outpatient management for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis are yet to be defined.

The presence of an appendicolith has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics, and is therefore often considered as a feature of complicated appendicitis. Furthermore, in a secondary analysis of the APPAC II trial assessing the potential preintervention findings associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics, an appendiceal diameter ≥ 15 mm and a body temperature > 38°C were associated with non-responsiveness to antibioticsand added as further exclusion criteria in the ongoing APPAC IV double-blind RCT, comparing oral moxifloxacin and placebo for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in an outpatient setting. Besides successful initial treatment, the long-term risk of possible recurrent appendicitis is a key component of optimizing non-operative management and patient satisfaction. The longest follow-up to date is from the APPAC trial, reporting an appendectomy rate of 39.1% at 5 years after initial antibiotics based on the study protocol of appendectomy for all patients with suspected appendicitis recurrence. These results were recently corroborated by consistent 3-year findings of the APPAC II trial, with appendectomy rates of 36.6% after oral antibiotics only and 34.8% after intravenous followed by oral antibiotics. No preintervention prognostic factors for recurrent appendicitis have yet been identified.

### Antibiotics-first versus surgery for appendicitis: a US pilot randomized controlled trial allowing outpatient antibiotic management [^117Q4Mzw]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Randomized trials suggest that nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics-first is safe. No trial has evaluated outpatient treatment and no US randomized trial has been conducted, to our knowledge. This pilot study assessed feasibility of a multicenter US study comparing antibiotics-first, including outpatient management, with appendectomy.

Methods

Patients aged 5 years or older with uncomplicated appendicitis at 1 US hospital were randomized to appendectomy or intravenous ertapenem greater than or equal to 48 hours and oral cefdinir and metronidazole. Stable antibiotics-first-treated participants older than 13 years could be discharged after greater than or equal to 6-hour emergency department (ED) observation with next-day follow-up. Outcomes included 1-month major complication rate (primary) and hospital duration, pain, disability, quality of life, and hospital charges, and antibiotics-first appendectomy rate.

Results

Of 48 eligible patients, 30 (62.5%) consented, of whom 16 (53.3%) were randomized to antibiotics-first and 14 (46.7%) to appendectomy. Median age was 33 years (range 9 to 73 years), median WBC count was 15,000/μL (range 6,200 to 23,100/μL), and median computed tomography appendiceal diameter was 10 mm (range 7 to 18 mm). Of 15 antibiotic-treated adults, 14 (93.3%) were discharged from the ED and all had symptom resolution. At 1 month, major complications occurred in 2 appendectomy participants (14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8% to 42.8%) and 1 antibiotics-first participant (6.3%; 95% CI 0.2% to 30.2%). Antibiotics-first participants had less total hospital time than appendectomy participants, 16.2 versus 42.1 hours, respectively. Antibiotics-first-treated participants had less pain and disability. During median 12-month follow-up, 2 of 15 antibiotics-first-treated participants (13.3%; 95% CI 3.7% to 37.9%) developed appendicitis and 1 was treated successfully with antibiotics; 1 had appendectomy. No more major complications occurred in either group.

Conclusion

A multicenter US trial comparing antibiotics-first to appendectomy, including outpatient management, is feasible to evaluate efficacy and safety.

### Efficacy of non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: initial experience in a resource-limited setting [^115P5eua]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis causes over 11% of emergency visits. While appendectomy remains the gold standard, antibiotic therapy has emerged as a lower-risk, cost-effective alternative for select cases. This approach has gained attention not only in well-resourced healthcare systems but also in low- and middle-income countries, such as Panama, where access to surgical care may be limited by economic, logistical, social and healthcare-specific deficiencies. In our centre, non-operative management (NOM) of uncomplicated appendicitis has recently been included in our local guidelines. We aim to report our initial experience with this approach.

Introduction

Appendicitis is a widespread surgical emergency, often occurring in the second and third decades of life. Timely treatment is crucial to prevent severe and potentially life-threatening complications. Appendicitis has long been treated with open appendicectomy, usually in a hospital setting. In recent decades, a growing number of countries have begun adopting laparoscopic appendicectomy. Laparoscopic appendicectomy can be done safely and effectively in an outpatient or day-surgery setting and is associated with a shorter recovery time and a lower risk of postoperative complications. Non-operative management of appendicitis with antibiotic therapy alone has also received attention, although appendicectomy remains the dominant form of treatment for appendicitis worldwide.

To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with appendicitis, early and accurate diagnosis and timely treatment delivery are key. A large proportion of the world's population, however, does not have access to any quality health care, let alone surgical care, posing a considerable clinical and economic burden that could otherwise be prevented. In countries with scarce resources, deciding which health concerns to prioritise for maximum impact is of paramount importance. Reducing mortality from infections that pose a substantial threat to public health (such as tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria) has been a longstanding priority. This emphasis has started to shift in recent years to target non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Some argue that global efforts to address the rising burden of NCDs have overlooked certain surgically treated conditions, including appendicitis and especially in low-income and middle-income countries, despite these diseases probably constituting a substantial proportion of the total disease burden.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: a non-inferiority study [^115E2SWg]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of the present study showed that outNOM was non-inferior to inNOM in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The 30-day appendectomy rate was similar in the two groups, while outNOM patients had shorter cumulative median hospital stay. In both NOM groups, the rate of patients operated for complicated acute appendicitis was below 4% and negative appendectomy rate was below 1%. At 30-day follow-up, a small proportion of patients required an unplanned emergency department visit for persistent or worsening symptoms.

In our series, about half of the patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis were given upfront appendectomy according to surgeon's preference. The majority of surgeons still consider NOM an ineffective treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis, even in the four participating hospitals. This is well reflected by two recent large international surveys reporting that NOM is the preferred treatment for only 14% of respondents. When compared to patients receiving NOM, patients who underwent upfront appendectomy had higher WBC count and AIR score, more frequent detection of appendicolith and free fluid at ultrasound/CT scan. All these variables might be considered as indicators of a more probable diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The presence of appendicolith is one of the stronger predictors of NOM failure which has an expected incidence up to 20% at 30 days. Other known factors related to NOM failure are female gender and a larger appendix diameter.

### Should ambulatory appendectomy become the standard treatment for acute appendicitis? [^115cGD8T]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency surgery worldwide, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% for men and 6.7% for women. Despite the promotion of antibiotic therapy as a non-invasive alternative, laparoscopic appendectomy remains the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. It is a common surgery, performed mostly in young healthy patients, with standardized management, operating time under 1 h, low morbidity, and low average length of hospital stay, all of which render it safe to perform in ambulatory settings. Over the past decades, appendectomy has been increasingly performed as 'short stay' (< 24 h hospital stay) or 'ambulatory' (no overnight hospital stay) procedures, with satisfactory outcomes and low complication rates. Yet, conventional hospitalization (with overnight stay) remains the routine procedure for acute appendicitis.

There is no present consensus on the selection of patients with acute appendicitis for ambulatory surgery (AS). Recently, Lefrançois et al. proposed a new score, which classifies patients into 6 risk levels, to select patients for ambulatory appendectomy without compromising outcomes. In their series, only 20% were discharged on the same day of surgery. The percentage of appendectomy procedures performed in ambulatory settings reported in the literature varies greatly (20–88%), likely due to inconsistent definitions of AS and to different criteria for enrollment of ambulatory patients.

For over 5 years, the authors have been performing ambulatory surgery for increasingly complex procedures, including colectomy, and have implemented a standardized care protocol for appendectomy following the guidelines of AS for common elective procedures. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate a consecutive series of appendectomies, complicated and uncomplicated, performed at our center and compare characteristics and outcomes of patients operated in ambulatory vs. conventional settings. The secondary goal was to investigate factors associated with unexpected re-consultations and re-hospitalizations, and thereby improve patient selection for ambulatory appendectomy.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: a non-inferiority study [^111abgt8]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of acute appendicitis is a very debated topic with increasing interest worldwide. Since the description by Andersson, a conservative approach with antibiotic therapy has been re-proposed for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Several randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that conservative treatment is a safe alternative to appendectomy in uncomplicated acute appendicitis with similar short-term outcomes. In particular, antibiotics were proved non-inferior to appendectomy with similar success proportion at a 30-day follow-up and lower morbidity rate. Existing trials proposed conservative management as in-hospital treatment coupling medical observation and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. The non-response to non-operative management (NOM) has been reported to be 8.5%, and hospitalization would ensure patient safety with continuous re-evaluation, allowing prompt urgent appendectomy in case of failure of conservative treatment.

The APPAC II study demonstrated the non-inferiority of oral in-hospital antibiotics compared with intravenous route, opening new frontiers with the possibility of outpatient treatment. The first experience of outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis has been described in a recent subgroup analysis of patients randomized and included in the CODA Trial. Patients received a first dose of intravenous antibiotics in the emergency department, and then, they were discharged home within 24 h from the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. To the best of our knowledge, no other data are available in literature about completely outpatient non-operative management.

We hypothesized that the 30-day appendectomy rate among patients treated nonoperatively who were managed as outpatients would be non-inferior to that of those who were hospitalized. The aim of the study was to evaluate the non-inferiority and the safety of outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

### SAGES guidelines update to laparoscopy in the era of COVID-19 [^115jmF4v]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients requiring cholecystectomy or appendectomy may present with concomitant COVID infection in both the inpatient and outpatient scenarios. It is unclear whether these patients benefit more from operative or nonoperative management in the setting of active COVID infection. These guidelines seek to address urgent and elective clinical scenarios.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to address these questions. These results were then presented to an interdisciplinary panel that formulated recommendations based on the best available evidence or utilized expert opinion when the evidence base was lacking.

Results

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of (1) either operative or nonoperative management of COVID-positive patients with appendicitis or cholecystitis and (2) delaying operations by more than six weeks in patients who test positive for COVID in the elective setting.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance regarding the management of surgical patients with concomitant COVID infection. This guideline also identifies important areas where future research should focus to strengthen the evidence base.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: a non-inferiority study [^111Mtpay]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a multicentre retrospective observational study, including consecutive patients of any age treated for acute appendicitis at four Italian hospitals starting from January 2020. All these four hospitals share an updated treatment protocol for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis according to existing international guidelines. Diagnostic work-up was performed with clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and clinical scores (Alvarado and AIR score), followed by imaging confirmation of the diagnosis in all patients (US or CT scan according to the treating surgeon/emergency physician preference). The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was defined by the presence of any suggestive symptom confirmed by laboratory tests and coupled with either radiological confirmation or acute inflammatory response (AIR) score > 4. Exclusion criteria were negative imaging, AIR score < 5, and pre-operative diagnosis of complicated acute appendicitis defined as the presence of peritoneal abscess, perforation, peritonitis, severe sepsis, or shock.

According to the international guidelines on treatment of acute appendicitis, patients with a pre-operative diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis underwent three different treatments based on the surgeon's preference: upfront appendectomy, inpatient NOM (inNOM), and outpatient NOM (outNOM). Patients were grouped by an intention to treat principle. Patients discharged home within 12 h from the arrival in the emergency department were grouped in the outNOM group and received only oral antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanate or ciprofloxacin) according to the international guidelines; inNOM patients were given intravenous antibiotics during hospitalization followed by oral antibiotics at home.

In all patients demographics, signs and symptoms of appendicitis, AIR and Alvarado scores, and imaging findings were collected in a dedicated database. Follow-up was carried out by phone calls and searching for possible readmissions in any Italian hospitals. Unplanned emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations were recorded.

The primary endpoint of the study was the 30-day appendectomy rate. Secondary endpoints were negative appendectomy rate, unplanned medical evaluation within 30 days, cumulative in-hospital stay, and long-term appendectomy rate.

### Outpatient non-operative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: a non-inferiority study [^111CsvD7]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of outNOM patients were discharged with 6 day only oral amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy. The efficacy of non-operative management in our study was consistent with the results of CODA trial whose patients were given a combination of intravenous and oral antibiotics. Recently, the real need for antibiotic therapy in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis have been questioned by two randomized trials showing a similar non-response rate comparing NOM with or without antibiotics.

This is a multicentre retrospective cohort study with a possible selection bias as main limitation. The patients' allocation towards upfront surgery or NOM groups was guided by surgeon's preference, reflecting the real clinical practice. In this complex scenario, it should also be taken into consideration, the effect of pandemic in changing the surgeon's attitude to operative treatment of acute appendicitis. Patients who were given outNOM had a significantly lower pre-operative detection of both appendicolith and intraperitoneal fluid, suggesting some objective criteria to address the out-hospital management. The large number of patients treated in a short-time period in four high-volume hospitals might be considered a strength of the present study as well as the nationwide long-term follow-up.

In conclusion, the present study shows that outpatient NOM is a non-inferior treatment when compared to inpatient NOM with regard to the 30-day appendectomy rate. Moreover, a shorter cumulative hospital stay was found in the outNOM group. Further large, randomized studies are needed to confirm the role of out-hospital NOM in uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^116rKu7A]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is outpatient management with hospital discharge within 24 hours safe among adults receiving antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis?

Findings

In this cohort study, which is a secondary analysis of the Comparison of Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy trial, that included 726 participants randomized to receive antibiotics, 46% who were judged to meet stability criteria and were discharged within 24 hours had less than 1 serious adverse event per 100 participants through 7 days. Along with subsequent appendectomies, serious adverse events occurred no more frequently in these patients than among hospitalized patients.

Meaning

These findings support that outpatient antibiotic management is safe for selected adults with acute appendicitis and should be included in shared decision-making discussions of patient preferences for outcomes associated with nonoperative and operative care.

Patients receiving outNOM were younger (p < 0.001), had early onset of symptoms (p < 0.001) and lower comorbidity rate (p < 0.008). There was no significant difference between inNOM and outNOM groups for fever, white blood cells count, C-reactive protein level, and both Alvarado and AIR scores. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that age, presence of appendicolith, detection of intraperitoneal free fluid, and CT scan confirmed diagnosis were significantly associated with inNOM (Table 2). One pregnant patient was treated with InNOM and one with OutNOM: they were at first trimester pregnancy and conservative treatment was shared by surgeon and obstetrician team. Treatment was successful in both cases.

### Outpatient interval appendectomy after perforated appendicitis [^113u8y18]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Interval appendectomy may be advisable after successful nonoperative treatment of perforated appendicitis. To reduce the perceived morbidity of interval appendectomy, we sought to determine if the operation could be done on an outpatient basis. This study is focused on patient comfort and safety after laparoscopic interval appendectomy (LIA).

Methods

This is a retrospective review of the clinical course and length of stay of 24 children who had LIA during a 4-year period.

Results

Of the 24 patients, 12 were discharged on the evening of surgery without incident. Nine additional patients were observed for the first postoperative night-2 for short episodes of temperature elevation, 3 for pain treated within the first 4 hours of recovery and requiring no further treatment, and 4 because the idea of outpatient appendectomy had yet to become popular. None of these patients was febrile overnight, none required narcotic or parenteral analgesics after leaving the recovery room, and all accepted feedings without nausea or vomiting. It is likely that all 9 of these patients could have been discharged on the day of operation. Three other patients stayed in the hospital for treatment of pain, low-grade fever, or slow resumption of feeding.

Conclusion

Of 24 patients, 21(88%) were or could have been discharged on the day of operation. When interval appendectomy is indicated, LIA can be performed safely as an outpatient surgical procedure in most children.

### Impact of outpatient management following appendectomy for acute appendicitis: an ACS NSQIP-P analysis [^11586w8M]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In 2012, a same-day discharge protocol following appendectomy for acute appendicitis was initiated. Our objective was to determine the success of the protocol by reviewing the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) outcomes following protocol development.

Methods

The 2015 NSQIP-P Participant Use Data File was queried to identify patients with acute appendicitis who underwent appendectomy. Outcomes were compared to institutional outcomes.

Results

There were 154 institutional patients and 4973 from NSQIP-P centers. Institutional rate of outpatient management was higher compared to NSQIP-P (84% vs 48%, p < 0.0001). Surgical length of stay was shorter compared to national rates (0.3 ± 0.7 vs 1.1 ± 1.9days, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of superficial (1.9% vs 1.0%, p = 0.2), deep (0.6% vs 0.1%, p = 0.17) or organ/space surgical site infections (1.3% vs 0.7%, p = 0.31). The incidences of other complications (1.3% vs 0.6%, p = 0.26) and 30-day readmissions (3.2% vs 2.6%, p = 0.61) were similar.

Conclusion

Outpatient management following appendectomy in children is possible with low morbidity and readmission rates. Comparison with other NSQIP-Pediatric centers suggests an opportunity to generalize this practice with considerable savings to the health care system.

The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hot gallbladders are now initially managed conservatively with antibiotics and/or percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage when needed, avoiding any role for early lap chole. Patients with suspected gangrene or gall bladder perforation are selectively and carefully considered for laparoscopic approach. Given the already high chances of conversion to open procedures and increased risks of longer operative times and possibility of iatrogenic injuries, a limited right subcostal incision is being preferred, provided necessary skills and experience in hepatobiliary and pancreatic (HPB) surgery is available by the attending/consultant surgeon.

Acute small bowel obstruction is managed with nonoperative management (NOM) and gastrografin which has been proven to reduce the operative rate in partial acute small bowel obstruction without signs of peritonitis of strangulation. Small bowel operations, such as adhesiolysis of strangulating and completely obstructing bands or small bowel (SB) resections, can be easily performed via a limited midline infra-umbilical laparotomy with sharp incision of the median raphe, with adhesiolysis carried out with sharp scissors/scalpel and resection/anastomosis completed with staplers and sutures as appropriate and the mesentery controlled with Kelly clamps and heavy ties.

Colorectal surgery represents a significant proportion of emergency surgery and perioperative practice recommendations on how to safely scrub, and the use of protective measures/equipment have been described elsewhere. The management of appendicitis should be simplified. Preoperative imaging will be implemented in all patients with right iliac fossa (RIF) and lower abdominal pain to be absolutely sure about the diagnosis and avoiding diagnostic laparoscopies and negative appendicectomies as much as possible.

Patients with imaging-proven inflamed appendix should be distinguished in nonperforated appendicitis who would be better managed with initial NOM +/− antibiotics and discharged home with oral medications if tolerating oral diet when appropriate. Outpatient management of uncomplicated appendicitis with serial, once a day, telephone (or any remote web-based — smartphone-driven) follow-up is advisable and has already been proven to be safe and effective even before this COVID-19 epidemic. Dedicated telephone contact lines may be established for the patients managed as outpatients to reach the out-of-hours acute care surgery service and on-call surgical team, on a 24/7 basis. This will avoid overcrowding the hospital wards and clinics.

Q.2.3: What is the best non-operative management of patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis?

The implementation of treatment and follow-up protocols based on outpatient antibiotic management and new evidence indicating safety and feasibility of same-day laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated AA may result in optimization of the resource used by reducing inpatient admissions and hospital costs for both NOM and surgical treatment in the future. Although the pilot trial by Talan et al. assessed the feasibility of antibiotics-first strategy including outpatient management (intravenous ertapenem greater than or equal to 48 h and oral cefdinir and metronidazole), the majority of RCTs published to date included 48 h minimum of inpatient administration of intravenous antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics for a total length of 7–10 days.

The empiric antibiotic regimens for non-critically ill patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections as advised by the 2017 WSES guidelines are the following: Amoxicillin/clavulanate 1.2–2.2 g 6-hourly or ceftriazone 2 g 24-hourly + metronidazole 500 mg 6-hourly or cefotaxime 2 g 8-hourly + metronidazole 500 mg 6-hourly.

In patients with beta-lactam allergy: Ciprofloxacin 400 mg 8-hourly + metronidazole 500 mg 6-hourly or moxifloxacin 400 24-hourly. In patients at risk for infection with community-acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriacea: Ertapenem 1 g 24-hourly or tigecycline 100 mg initial dose, then 50 mg 12-hourly.

Currently, the APPAC II trial is running, with the aim to assess the safety and feasibility of per-oral antibiotic monotherapy compared with intravenous antibiotic therapy continued by per oral antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated AA. Early results of the APPAC II are expected to be published in 2020.

The results of the RCT by Park et al. challenged the need for antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated AA and reported promising results regarding possible spontaneous resolution of uncomplicated AA with supportive care only. Analysis of the primary outcome measure indicated that treatment failure rates in patients presenting with CT-confirmed uncomplicated AA were similar among those receiving supportive care with either a non-antibiotic regimen or a 4-day course of antibiotics, with no difference in the rates of perforated AA between the two groups reported. Whether recovery from uncomplicated AA is the result of antibiotic therapy or natural clinical remission, and so whether antibiotics are superior to simple supportive care remains to be established.

### Prognostic factors associated with primary non-responsiveness to antibiotics and appendicitis recurrence for CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis: secondary analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^116e2hqN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis assessing primary non-responsiveness to initial antibiotics in CT-diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis, patients with an appendiceal diameter ≥ 15 mm or a body temperature > 38°C on admission were found to have an increased risk of primary antibiotic non-responsiveness. In addition, immediate postintervention findings of CRP ≥ 100 mg/l and leucocyte count ≥ 9 × 10⁹/l during the first 6–30 h after admission were also found to be associated with primary antibiotic non-responsiveness. CRP at a cut-off of ≥ 100 mg/l at 6–30 h after initiation of antibiotics yielded a negative predictive value of 99%; thus, for CRP < 100 mg/l there is a 99% probability of successful primary antibiotic treatment. There were no prognostic factors for appendicitis recurrence.

Oral antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis enable possible outpatient management, resulting in substantial cost savings and benefits in the use of hospital resources. In the large CODA trial, outpatient management of appendicitis was already proven safe, despite the inclusion of patients with a more complicated course of acute appendicitis, as approximately half of the participants (46.1%) randomized to receive antibiotics in the CODA trial underwent outpatient management with hospital discharge within 24 h without an increased rate of complications compared with those patients admitted to the hospital. Safe outpatient management highlights the need for accurate patient selection and the importance of choosing the optimal primary treatment. Identifying patients at higher risk of appendectomy after antibiotic treatment could be valuable for guiding treatment decisions. The finding of CRP ≥ 100 mg/l during the first 6–30 h after admission having a negative predictive value of 99% can be considered an accurate objective measure when evaluating the effectiveness of treatment shortly after initiation of antibiotics. Considering the variability of patient symptom resolution, such an objective measure would be helpful to aid clinicians in the assessment of the effectiveness of an initiated treatment when there is ambiguity, with the potential to decrease the number of unnecessary appendectomies due to uncertainty related to the initiated non-operative approach.

### Nonoperative vs operative management of uncomplicated acute… [^116pcgm3]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Nonoperative management with antibiotics may be an alternative option to appendectomy in adult patients presenting with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, noting the possibility of longer hospital stays and potentially higher rates of recurrent appendicitis. Importance Appendectomy remains the standard of care for uncomplicated acute appendicitis despite several randomized clinical trials pointing to the safety and efficacy of nonoperative management of this disease. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials may contribute to the body of evidence and help surgeons select which patients may benefit from surgical and nonsurgical treatment. However, in the nonoperative management group, length of stay was significantly longer, and a median cumulative incidence of 18% of recurrent appendicitis was observed.

Conclusions and Relevance These results point to the general safety and efficacy of nonoperative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. However, this strategy may be associated with an increase in duration of hospital stay and a higher rate of recurrent appendicitis. This meta-analysis may help inform decision-making in nonoperative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. At this time, a nonoperative approach for uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotic treatment is regarded as a safe alternative in select patients. 8–12. We performed a meta-analysis to address the question as to whether antibiotic therapy in adult patients with uncomplicated appendicitis is comparable with surgical treatment. We performed a systematic review with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate the outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical approaches. showing a decreased incidence of acute appendicitis by 40% following the outbreak.

23 Similarly, an observational study in Italy showed a significant drop in hospital admission for acute appendicitis and a reduction in the incidence of noncomplicated appendicitis and appendectomy rate. In summary, nonoperative management with antibiotics may be an alternative strategy for the treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. Although we did not find significantly different proportions of treatment success and major complications for either treatment approach, we noticed a trend toward greater success of treatment for nonoperative management when considering longer follow-up periods. This advantage must be considered within the context of recurrent risk of appendicitis with nonoperative management found in this study. In addition, operative management was associated with significantly shorter length of stay compared with antibiotic-only treatment.

Practicing surgeons can use these summary data to guide patients presenting with acute uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Outpatient management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis after laparoscopic appendectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^111h3FcM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Another possible limitation of the study is that the COVID-19 pandemic occurred during the patient recruitment period, which spanned 2020–2021. During the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the rate of complicated appendicitis. In addition, a PCR test was added to the protocol, which could increase the hours of stay. However, outpatient management during the pandemic allowed a greater availability of hospital beds to care for patients with medical conditions. Thus, outpatient appendectomy allows better optimization of resources.

In our study design, we decided to calculate a sample size with a high number of follow-up losses. The reason for increasing the sample was to avoid bias due to the low power of the study at the end of data entry. In the sample calculation, a minimum number of 92 patients was obtained to reach the power of the study. To these 92 patients, it was decided to add 30% more patients (28 patients) to avoid bias due to loss of patients. A total of 120 patients were calculated, including estimated losses. At the end of the study, there were 97 patients and 23 actual losses (compared to the previous estimated 28 lost patients). A total of 97 patients exceed the minimum requirements for study potential (which was a minimum of 92 patients).

Our results agree with those reported in most studies. We can conclude that in our experience it is possible to start an ERAS protocol and an outpatient appendectomy program with an experienced team. Although several studies had shown, before ours, a reduction in LOS in patients selected for outpatient treatment, it had not been possible to draw solid recommendations due to the significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the different studies. Along the same lines, the international guidelines could not give strong recommendations due to the lack of scientific evidence from randomized clinical trials. This is the first RCT on the subject. We have shown that ambulatory appendectomy with the ERAS protocol is safe in selected patients, due to the improvement in terms of quality of care, clinical and economic benefits.

Data collection

The anthropomorphic, radiologic characteristics and blood samples were collected in the emergency department. Quantitative data were obtained from the blood results and from the appendicular diameter. Categorical data were obtained from radiological features. The postoperative complications were evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo and Comprehensive Complication Index scores. The day and time of admission to the surgical unit and time of discharge were collected as a time variable. Follow-up after discharge, consultations to the emergency department and its reason were assessed. Outpatient follow-up was carried out up to 6 months. The cost analysis study was also conducted.

Data on each patient were collected in a standard form by the research coordinator ensuring the anonymity of the patients. Data were monitored and included in a database using Access© Microsoft 2013, and the statistical study was performed with Stata® inc. 16 version.

Interventions

Protocol-specified antibiotics consisted of a minimum of a once-daily intravenous regimen (eg, ertapenem or ceftriaxone and high-dose metronidazole) or scheduled doses with coverage for 24 hours followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10-day total course. Clinical teams selected antibiotics based on guideline recommendations for intra-abdominal infections from the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Discharge criteria, including from the ED, were specified in the study protocol as follows: (1) the patient was stable and had stable and near-normal vital signs; (2) the patient was afebrile; (3) the patient's symptoms were controlled with oral analgesics; (4) the patient could tolerate oral fluids and medications; (5) the patient and clinician agreed that discharge was acceptable; and (6) a timely outpatient follow-up visit was confirmed. Interpretation of these criteria and the decision for outpatient management was at the discretion of the patient's treating physicians. Participants could be cared for solely in the ED or subsequently in an observation unit or hospital based on physician discretion and availability of these care sites. Appendectomy was recommended for participants who developed diffuse peritonitis and/or severe sepsis or septic shock at any time or who experienced worsening symptoms after 48 hours of antibiotic use. However, these criteria were not required for appendectomy to be performed, and the treating clinician and participant ultimately decided on an appendectomy.

Discussion

The CODA trial is the largest comparative study of antibiotics vs appendectomy for treatment of appendicitis to date, and it also provides the largest body of data on the experience of patients treated with antibiotics in the outpatient setting. In this trial, outpatient management among selected adult patients who met stability criteria was associated with rare SAEs (< 1 event per 100 participants through 7 days), which occurred no more frequently than in hospitalized patients. Outpatient management appeared to be safe across a wide range of participants, including among those with an appendicolith and those judged able to be discharged within 12 hours of ED arrival.

Use of outpatient management varied greatly among investigative sites, from never to nearly 90% of nonoperatively treated participants. Those treated with antibiotics as outpatients did not have a greater frequency of appendectomy during 7 days than those hospitalized (9.9% vs 14.1%; during 30 days, 12.6% vs 19.0%). The difference in 7-day appendectomy incidence was similar when the analysis was adjusted for illness severity factors (between-group difference, −4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, −8.7 to 0.6). Trial sites that used outpatient management for most antibiotic-treated participants were not observed to have greater overall appendectomy rates than sites that used it less frequently. Less than 5% of outpatient-treated participants returned for unplanned outpatient care, and more than 90% avoided hospitalization through 7 days. Patient-related outcomes (7-day satisfaction rates and 30-day EQ-5D scores) were similarly high, and outpatients missed less work than inpatients.

Methods

Design

The CODA trial was a 25–US site, pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized clinical trial among patients 18 years or older with acute appendicitis to determine whether antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy. Trial details have been previously published. The CODA trial protocol was approved by institutional review boards at all 25 participating sites. All participants provided written informed consent.

In this cohort study of participants randomized to receive antibiotics, we conducted the following secondary analyses: (1) description of outpatient management use by site; (2) comparison of characteristics, safety, and patient-related outcomes of participants receiving outpatient and hospital care; (3) comparison of outpatient- and inpatient-treated participant subsequent appendectomy rates, including adjustment for differences in measured baseline illness severity characteristics; and (4) description of overall appendectomy rates by proportion of antibiotic-assigned participants treated as outpatients at each site. This study is reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Study Population

From May 1, 2016, to February 28, 2020, a total of 1552 adults with clinically suspected and imaging-confirmed localized appendicitis were randomized to antibiotic treatment or appendectomy (n = 776 each). Patients with diffuse peritonitis, severe sepsis or septic shock, an immunocompromising condition, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, and imaging-identified large phlegmon or abscess, free air, or mass were excluded. Participants with imaging-identified appendicolith were analyzed as a prespecified subgroup. Participants who underwent appendectomy or did not receive their first antibiotic dose within 24 hours of ED registration were not candidates for ED discharge and were not included in this analysis.

### Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy: feasible in a public county hospital? [^114DdqHy]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy is being used increasingly as a treatment option for acute, uncomplicated appendicitis. This was a prospective validation study in a large, urban, public safety-net hospital. From 2014 to 2016, all patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute, uncomplicated appendicitis were enrolled in a prospective observational trial. Standard baseline perioperative practice (control group) was documented for 1 year. An outpatient appendectomy protocol was then introduced. Inclusion criteria required intraoperative confirmation of uncomplicated appendicitis and strict discharge criteria, including physician assessment before discharge. Data collection then continued for 1 year (outpatient group). The outcomes measures examined included complications, length of stay, nursing transitions, emergency department visits, readmissions, and patient satisfaction. The study enrolled 351 patients (178 control, 173 outpatient). Of the 173 candidates for outpatient appendectomy, 113 went home. Reasons for admission included surgeon discretion due to intraoperative findings/medical comorbidities and lack of transportation home. The outpatient group had shorter operative time (69 vs 83 minutes; p < 0.001), longer time in recovery (242 vs 141 minutes; p < 0.001), fewer nursing transitions (4 vs 5; p < 0.001), and shorter postoperative length of stay (9 vs 19 hours; p < 0.001). There was no difference in complications, emergency department visits, or readmissions. In the outpatient group, none of the patients sent home from recovery had postoperative complications or required readmission. Satisfaction surveys revealed no change in satisfaction with either protocol. Outpatient appendectomy is safe in a public hospital and results in shorter hospital length of stay and decreased healthcare costs. Strict criteria for discharge are important to identify patients who should be admitted for observation.
