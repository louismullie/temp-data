## Question

A writer sent a four-page synopsis of an idea for a new television series to a Hollywood producer. He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?

Answer Choices:
A. The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.
B. The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
C. The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.
D. There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which answer choice best predicts how a court would rule on whether a contract existed between a writer and a Hollywood producer, given the writer submitted a synopsis, discussed compensation, and the producer's assistant said "we always pay for a writer's work", followed by the producer later using similar material. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there was mutual assent sufficient for an express contract. Then, I should verify whether the parties' conduct supports an implied-in-fact contract. Next, I will examine whether consideration was present and adequately specified. After that, I need to check for indefiniteness in essential terms that would defeat contract formation. Finally, I will weigh the most likely outcome and select the best-supported option, while noting any nuances that could change the result in a different jurisdiction or with different facts.

> Let me first confirm the core legal issue: contract formation requires offer, acceptance, and consideration, and the terms must be sufficiently definite so that a court can enforce them. If any of these elements is missing, there is no enforceable agreement, so I need to scrutinize each element against the facts presented.

> I will now examine whether there was an express contract. The writer's submission of a synopsis in response to an industry call for ideas, coupled with the assistant's statement that "we always pay for a writer's work", could be construed as an offer and acceptance, but wait, let me verify the specificity of terms. The synopsis itself does not specify price, timing, or scope of rights, and the assistant's statement sounds like a general policy rather than a concrete commitment to pay this writer for this work, so mutual assent to definite terms is shaky here, making an express contract less likely on these facts alone.

> Next, I should review whether an implied-in-fact contract arises from the parties' conduct. Implied-in-fact contracts are inferred from actions showing an agreement to exchange value, even without explicit words. Here, the writer submitted a synopsis expecting compensation, and the assistant's statement that the company "always pays for a writer's work" suggests a customary practice of payment, which a court could interpret as an implied promise to pay for the submitted material if used, so an implied-in-fact contract is plausible and often recognized in entertainment industry contexts where submissions are solicited and compensation is customary.

> Hold on, I should verify consideration. The writer's provision of the creative synopsis constitutes consideration, and the producer's implied promise to pay if the material is used provides bargained-for exchange, so consideration is present even if the exact amount was not specified at the time, which supports enforceability under an implied-in-fact theory rather than treating the submission as a gift.

> I need to check for indefiniteness. While the exact dollar amount and some terms were not specified, courts can sometimes supply reasonable terms or refer to industry custom, and here the custom of paying writers and the inference that payment would be reasonable in the circumstances may be enough to avoid a finding of fatal indefiniteness, though this is jurisdiction-dependent and could be argued either way, so I should be cautious not to overstate certainty.

> Let me consider the alternatives. Option C suggests no consideration and treats the synopsis as a gift, but that overlooks the writer's expectation of compensation and the company's stated practice of paying writers, so that seems too dismissive of the bargained-for exchange. Option D argues too many terms are missing, but in implied-in-fact cases courts can sometimes imply reasonable terms from conduct and custom, so indefinite is not always fatal, especially when the core exchange is clear.

> Putting this together, the most defensible answer is that the court will likely find an implied-in-fact contract based on the parties' conduct and the industry custom of paying for writer submissions, even if there was no fully express agreement on all terms, so the correct choice is B.

---

The most likely ruling is **B. The court will rule that there was an implied-in-fact contract** between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested. The writer's submission of the synopsis in response to the producer's solicitation, the discussion of compensation, and the assistant's assurance that "we always pay for a writer's work" collectively demonstrate mutual assent and an expectation of payment, even if no express contract was signed. Courts recognize implied-in-fact contracts in the entertainment industry when parties act in a way that shows agreement to pay for submitted ideas, especially when the recipient later uses the material [^notfound].

## Analysis of the legal issues

### Formation of an implied-in-fact contract

An implied-in-fact contract arises from the conduct of the parties, demonstrating mutual assent and an intent to be bound, even without explicit written or verbal agreement. The key elements are:

- **Mutual assent**: The parties' conduct must show agreement on essential terms.
- **Intent to contract**: Both parties must intend to enter into a binding agreement.
- **Consideration**: Each party must provide something of value.

In this case, the following facts support an implied-in-fact contract:

- **Solicitation and submission**: The producer solicited ideas, and the writer submitted a synopsis in response, indicating a mutual understanding that the submission was for potential use by the producer.
- **Discussion of compensation**: The writer explicitly mentioned his expectation of compensation, and the assistant responded, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work", suggesting an agreement to pay if the idea is used.
- **Subsequent use**: The producer later developed a series with plot and characters nearly identical to the synopsis, indicating acceptance and use of the writer's idea.

---

### Application to the facts

Applying these principles, the court will likely find that the parties' conduct manifested a mutual understanding that the writer would be compensated if his idea was used. The assistant's statement that "we always pay for a writer's work" further reinforces the expectation of payment. The producer's subsequent use of the synopsis provides strong evidence of acceptance and use of the writer's idea, supporting the existence of an implied-in-fact contract [^notfound].

---

### Rejection of alternative arguments

- **Express contract (Option A)**: There was no explicit agreement on all essential terms, such as specific compensation or detailed contractual terms, so an express contract is unlikely to be found.
- **Gift (Option C)**: The writer's expectation of compensation and the assistant's assurance that writers are paid negate the notion that the synopsis was a gift.
- **Indefiniteness (Option D)**: While some terms were not explicitly stated, the essential terms — compensation for use of the idea — were sufficiently indicated by the parties' conduct and statements, making the agreement enforceable despite some indefiniteness [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and likely ruling

Given the solicitation, the discussion of compensation, the assurance of payment, and the subsequent use of the synopsis, the court will likely rule that there was an implied-in-fact contract between the writer and the producer. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. The court will rule that there was an implied-in-fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested**.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^57ca7b2b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Experts can and often will be deposed—A discovery alternative to deposition testimony is the expert’s written report, which typically is shared between the parties before trial; however, some states do not require disclosure of the identity of the expert or even disclosure of the report. In criminal cases, discovery of expert opinion usually is accomplished by pretrial interview with the expert witness or by an expert witness’ written report. It is helpful when expert witnesses are willing to be available and to discuss their opinions with both sides in advance of their testimony, and it is not advisable that physicians engage in the practice of having attorneys write their reports; if that does occur, physician experts should read that statement carefully to verify agreement with it.

### NICE DKA guidelines are not just a discretionary or optional advice in the United Kingdom [^3b722992]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent court cases have ruled that national guidelines are important and relevant in determining the legal standards of healthcare. Such cases further illustrate that the courts are determining that NICE guidelines are likely to be accorded a greater weight, as NICE is developed with the highest levels of evidence and are strongly supported by government policy. While there is an argument that there should not be a legal expectation for healthcare professionals to rigidly follow and adhere to guidelines as this could diminish clinical judgment, clinicians should still be acutely aware that they can be open to legal challenge if they choose not to adhere to national guidance because they simply disagree with the recommendations in the guideline without strong evidence backing such a decision.

### The current approach of the courts [^fc117b99]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The approach of the courts when considering proprietary ('ownership') interests in human bodily material has been pragmatic and piecemeal. The general principle was initially that such material is not legally 'property' that can be 'owned', but courts have recognised many exceptions. In determining disputes between individuals in particular cases, they have stated principles that are often inconsistent with those stated in other cases with different facts. Later judges have been constrained by these decisions, especially when made at appellate level. They can distinguish the facts of one case from another to achieve a different outcome, but they cannot state new principles to be applied more widely to promote consistency. This requires the will of Parliament and legislation to introduce new principles. Experience to date suggests that such legislation will need to be wide-ranging and complex, with different principles for different circumstances. There will not be one area of law that answers all the issues that arise.

The use of genetic information to design and guide therapies creates novel patent issues. Gene patents have been integral to the introduction of new biologics, but their role in diagnostic testing is controversial. Genotype-phenotype associations are at the heart of personalized medicine. The intellectual property rules by which these biological relationships are governed have profound implications for the growth of this field. Several cases currently before the courts may add reason and clarity to the law in this area.

Restrictive covenants (RCs) are clauses placed into employment agreements across various industries, and they are frequently used in health care-specifically within physician contracts. Given the most recent guidance and rule determined by the Federal Trade Commission in April 2024, the relevancy of RCs in health care has come under even more scrutiny in the latter half of 2024. This review will focus on the history of RC law and review the value of these clauses from the perspectives of the employer, practicing physician, and patient. We also provide the stakeholder responses to both the ban and the subsequent blockage of enforcement by a Texas federal court in August of 2024.

The traditional, highly valued, clinical freedom of doctors is under threat with the development of evidence-based protocols. Contact with the pharmaceutical industry provides doctors with education and resource but at what cost? Government has failed to match the industry in this arena. Conflicts of interest arise when the balance between the information provided by these two bodies is uneven. Authorities' desire for impartial prescribing is not matched by their willingness to support the training and working practices which would deliver it.

### Risk creation, loss of chance, and legal liability [^46377064]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

One can now only speculate as to the future of the law regarding risk creation and loss of chance. Freed from the moorings of the traditional rules in medical malpractice cases, courts are adopting a variety of approaches to this problem in a manner that approaches the idiosyncratic--the law is whatever it happens to be on any given day, in any given jurisdiction. Regrettably, until such time as uniform guiding principles are established, it appears that the laws governing the interaction between risk, causation, and liability will remain in a state of flux.

### Courting the expert: a clash of culture? [^0a2f2041]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the utility of expert opinion in legal proceedings and the deployment of expert witnesses in adversarial litigation. The use of expert witnesses to assist courts in making just and fair conclusions may be contrasted with the partisan interests of those who call them. An adversarial system is a bad method of scientific enquiry and undermines the court's capacity to reach the 'right' answer. As a consequence, courts may reach the wrong conclusion based on bad science. The role of the expert as a witness places strain on an expert to provide certainty, where in fact there may be none. Recent reforms in the civil courts have changed little and the problem is even more acute in criminal trials. The expert can rely solely on the integrity of his or her own opinion, tempered with a little humility. However, when filtered through the rhetoric and advocacy of a court arena, even this may be compromised.

### Cracking the code: a scoping review to unite disciplines in tackling legal issues in health artificial intelligence [^abad8246]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Overall, the most frequently discussed legal issue was a concern to ensure the efficiency of regulation—for instance, the worry that unclear, overzealous or inconsistent regulation will make compliance difficult or impede innovation. Concerns over regulatory efficiency accounted for 17% of legal issues discussions, and this issue ranked first for authors in each of medicine and law. After this issue, authors in medicine most often discussed privacy, followed by safety/quality, while legal authors more often discussed liability, followed by privacy.

The most frequently discussed solutions to legal issues were new legislation (28%) and voluntary improvements (ie, non-legal measures; 26%), with calls to reform existing laws comprising 14% of solutions discussions. Authors in medicine and law again dominated these discussions (figure 5). Authors in medicine were most likely to discuss voluntary improvements (33%), followed by new legislation (23%). They also discussed other non-legal instruments for promoting responsible health AI adoption (eg, mandatory training and professional guidelines) more frequently than legal writers. Legal authors more often discussed new legislation (such as dedicated AI legislation; 34%), followed by reform of existing law (for instance, to strengthen privacy protections; 22%).

Figure 5 
Disciplinary distribution of references to solutions to legal issues with health artificial intelligence (AI) (2012–2021). Writers in medicine and law produced the most discussions (by far) of possible solutions to legal problems with health AI. However, they proposed different solutions. Legal writers were most likely to propose new legislation, followed by reform of existing law. Writers in medicine were most likely to discuss calls (by industry, clinicians or others) for voluntarily improving standards, followed by new legislation. Writers in medicine were also more likely to call for mandatory training as a response to legal problems.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^f5de278b]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations related to external assessments of interests—Open Payments reports of a single instance of in-kind food and beverage of <$100 or aggregate food and beverage from a company of <$500 should not generally be labeled as an RWI or COI. Open Payments reports of significant payments to an individual that are not self-reported during the organizational vetting process should trigger an assessment of this discrepancy, and a formal process should be established for such assessment and, if necessary, management. AHA or American Stroke Association staff will review the Open Payments database for any disclosures applicable to committee members during formation of the writing committee and every 6 months thereafter through publication. The ACC, AHA, and similar professional organizations should work with external regulatory bodies to establish, as a matter of law, that <$100 in value for any 1 reported RWI and <$500 in value for RWIs with any 1 company would not constitute a COI.

### Medicines adaptive pathways to patients: why, when, and how to engage? [^ff23b66a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Preliminary evidence adaptive pathways moment

As more evidence about the product is accruing, the MAPPs interactions are expected to intensify. Once initial clinical data become available, all of the questions listed in Table 1 become relevant. Importantly, does the promise of truly addressing the unmet need still hold? Are stakeholders still committed to dedicate the necessary resources to continue the process? Is there institutional support?

At this juncture, the key deliverable from the process will be a mutually acceptable iterative development plan. An “iterative development plan” is a development plan initiated by the developer, which integrates the feedback from the stakeholders and outlines the development of the medicine during its lifespan, including the phase after initial authorization and P&R; it supports an adaptive pathway approach from beginning to end. As described above, it is envisaged that development planning discussions likely begin as interactions without committments 11 and progress to more formal interactions such as, e.g. parallel consultation procedure with EMA and HTABs.

The development plan should clarify what evidence package must be available before product launch. The initial evidence package would support the regulatory authorization (i.e. provide evidence of a positive benefit–risk profile according to current scientific standards) but at the same time support HTA and enable the initial P&R negotiations and design of suitable managed entry agreements (MEAs; or alternative P&R approaches) across the different healthcare systems.

The development plan should also lay out what data and information will have to be provided after the initial marketing authorization and reimbursement decisions. It would be expected to consider many aspects of product development and evidence generation such as biomarkers, surrogate and composite endpoints, subpopulations, CMC issues, adaptive trial design, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and key milestones to review postauthorization evidence requirements. It should be clarified whether there is adequate infrastructure available for postlaunch monitoring of the product (e.g. existing disease registries) or whether new infrastructure needs to be put in place.

At this stage, payers, and perhaps other stakeholders, will likely wish to start considering issues of appropriate product utilization and workable strategies for payers with clearly defined decision points in case the product underperforms (Table 1 and below).

Given that clinical development from the preliminary evidence adaptive pathways moment up to initial authorization may take several years, unexpected findings or environmental changes may necessitate one or more reassessment moments or loops (Figure 2).

### The continuing saga of patents and non-invasive prenatal testing [^52554720]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Medium credibility.

In litigation relating to the Australian patent corresponding to those considered in the US Myriad case, the only claim that was challenged was a DNA sequence claim. The High Court of Australia unanimously invalidated that claim in the Myriad patent, and held that isolated DNA sequences are not patentable subject‐matter. 51 The High Court noted that satisfaction of the manner of manufacture test requires that something is “made,” and that this “must be something brought about by human action.” 52 The court held that the substance of the claims in the Myriad patent was the information embodied in the arrangements of nucleotides, and this information was not made by human action, but was instead discerned. 24

While there have been some significant method‐related Australian cases, until recently, none considered the specific issues raised in the US case of Mayo about the patentability of methods applying a law of nature. Beach J of the Australian Federal Court considered methods of this nature in Meat and Livestock Australia v Cargill (Cargill). 53 The patent in issue included a series of method claims for identifying bovine traits from nucleic acid samples using single nucleotide polymorphisms for managing, selecting, breeding, and cloning cattle. His Honour rejected arguments that the claims involved simply the practical application of a naturally occurring phenomenon to a particular use, and the patent was not invalidated on this basis. 54 Beach J found that the test in Mayo was “too sweeping for [him] to work out whether [he was] acting consistently or inconsistently with its spirit” when determining what it takes to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent‐eligible application 55

Although the Cargill decision delivered by Beach J is likely to be appealed, it is notable that he is the judge who has also been allocated the Sequenom v Ariosa trial. That litigation will present Australian courts with an opportunity to consider the patent‐eligibility of method claims in the context of NIPT. Even so, it is likely to take several years before there is a definitive ruling as to the patentability of methods of diagnosis in Australia, assuming that the parties pursue court proceedings and appeals with the same passion as they have done in the United States.

### The practicalities of providing expert evidence for the court [^d11d91ae]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of the expert witness is clear in the eyes of the court but that understanding is less consistent for the medical professionals who may be called on in this capacity. The fundamental key is the clinician's purpose in using their experience, knowledge and training as they provide the court with an unbiased assessment of the clinical issues that have arisen in the case. Using the Australian context, this article provides guidance for clinicians who are asked to provide the court with their expertise through written and spoken representations, drawing upon experience and the use of the "Expert Witness Code of Conduct".

### Vested interests in addiction research and policy. the challenge corporate lobbying poses to reducing society's alcohol problems: insights from UK evidence on minimum unit pricing [^511bfd2e]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This work confirms that transnational alcohol producers and the large supermarkets have access to policy actors in the United Kingdom at all levels of government and throughout the policy process, including to opposition parties. A Public Health Commission (PHC) established by the Conservative Party in opposition during the 2007–10 study period formed the basis of the Public Health Responsibility Deal which became central to the subsequent UK government's public health policy. This institutionalizes the role of industry actors in UK public health policy in an unprecedented way, enhancing capacity to shape policy formulation and to deflect or delay policies that are contrary to these vested interests.

Such developments call for a deeper understanding of corporate strategy and tactics to investigate further how this access is used to influence policy, and to assist the development of better protection against the harms caused to society by alcohol. The tobacco industry is well established as a pioneer of corporate political strategies, and much is now known about their activities through court mandated disclosure of internal industry documents in the United States. The tobacco and alcohol industries are also not dissimilar, in that both are involved in the legal production, distribution and retail of a drug which is toxic, addictive and causes high levels of death and disease (each being responsible for approximately 5–6% of the total global burden of disease). They also have histories of working together to avert policy measures with capacity to address this situation (for example on pricing and promotions) and patterns of co-ownership continue to exist,.

### Computer-aided detection as evidence in the courtroom: potential implications of an appellate court's ruling [^0c616f2b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of computer-aided detection (CAD) in radiology has been studied for different organ systems. As with any new technology, its impact on determinations of standards of clinical practice is an evolving one that is often defined by its acceptability not only in medical forums but also as defined by courts of law.

Conclusion

We discuss the first known appellate legal decision regarding the acceptability of CAD as it relates to the clinical practice of mammography.

### How to write an abstract that will be accepted for presentation at a national meeting [^1da476f7]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Preparation, submission, and presentation of an abstract are important facets of the research process, which benefit the investigator/author in several ways. Writing an abstract consists primarily of answering the questions, "Why did you start?" "What did you do?" "What did you find?" and "What does it mean?" A few practical steps in preparing to write the abstract can facilitate the process. This article discusses those steps and offers suggestions for writing each of an abstract's components (title, author list, introduction, methods, results, and conclusions); considers the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating a table or figure into the abstract; offers several general writing tips; and provides annotated examples of well-prepared abstracts: one from an original study, one from a method/device evaluation, and one from a case report.

### Drugs against rare diseases: are the regulatory standards higher? [^49cef474]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a draft Guidance for Industry for Rare Diseases: Common Issues in Drug Development (referred to as "Rare Diseases Guidance"). In our opinion, the FDA should consider: (a) explicitly acknowledging the standards are higher for rare diseases for the reasons presented in this article; and (b) illustrating innovative development pathways that may be acceptable for rare diseases, including case studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^331ccbf6]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans—opinion-based recommendation process and voting checklist emphasize considering current practice, transparent cost rationale, and defined voting steps. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) notes clinicians “justifiably fear that not doing something that is done on a widespread basis will lead to litigation,” and “The consequences of not providing a service that is neither widely available nor widely used are less serious than the consequences of not providing a treatment accepted by the medical profession and thus expected by patients.” The page highlights that discussions rely on mutual communication and that the patient’s “expectation of treatment” must be tempered by physician guidance, and directs to “Justify, why a more costly device, drug, or procedure is being recommended over a less costly one whenever such an opinion-based recommendation is made.” Process-wise, “Work group members write the rationales for opinion based recommendations on the first day of the final work group meeting” and vote on the second day; “If the work group cannot adopt a rationale after three votes, the rationale and the opinion-based recommendation will be withdrawn,” with a statement that the group “can neither recommend for or against” included in the guideline. Members may reconsider during discussion, and “any member of the work group can make a motion to withdraw that recommendation.” The “CHECKLIST FOR VOTING ON OPINION-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS” asks, “Does the recommendation affect a substantial number of patients or address treatment (or diagnosis) of a condition that causes death and/or considerable suffering?” and whether serious harms are addressed and “why the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms.”

### A turning point for conflicts of interest: the controversy over the national academy of sciences' first conflicts of interest disclosure policy [^0aa861a6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Conflicts of interest policies have become a part of the fabric of the conduct of biomedical research, yet such concerns are relatively recent history. Until the 1960s, concerns about conflicts of interest were confined to scientists who served as government advisors and contractors. However, in the 1970s, as a range of environmental and consumer safety issues gained public attention, the conclusions of researchers frequently came under attack because of concerns about experts' financial ties to private industry. These debates typically focused on evaluating potential carcinogens in the environment. In response, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) developed its first conflict of interest policy, requiring committee members to disclose any "potential sources of bias" that "others might deem prejudicial." Scientists universally opposed the policy, however, for a range of reasons--while some argued that all experienced and knowledgeable experts were inherently conflicted, others were offended at the suggestion that any expert could be biased. Despite the controversy, the disclosure policy remained in place and became a model for subsequent professional and institutional policies in the biomedical sciences. However, although disclosure policies have become standard at academic medical centers and for publications in scientific journals, clinical researchers have continued to debate the content of these policies and the need for additional protections beyond disclosure. In the absence of a definitive standard, this historical case study can substantially inform ongoing discussion on conflicts of interest in clinical research.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^ef0ee76b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Compensation for expert testimony—Appropriate compensation is described as being commensurate with the expertise, time, and effort required for preparing and providing responsible testimony, and written expert witness agreements often include a fee schedule for depositions and in-court testimony, a cancellation policy, out-of-pocket expenses (eg, travel costs, car rental, hotel, food, parking, etc), research, printing, postage and express packages, preparation time, the retaining counsel’s fee payment responsibility, and interest for overdue accounts. Guidance notes that asking for excessive compensation may be considered unethical and states it is unethical to charge unreasonable rates or to exaggerate the time required to prepare expert testimony, and that it is also unethical for remuneration to be contingent on the outcome of the case. Common factors in valuing expert testimony include the amount earned if the pediatrician, pediatric medical subspecialist, or pediatric surgical specialist saw patients in the office or performed surgery that day, the difficulty in preparing the case, and the dearth of appropriate experts in a specific field.

### Restoring invisible and abandoned trials: a call for people to publish the findings [^c3f306e8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Although by definition no journal publication exists for “unpublished trials,” clinical study reports for industry funded trials often do exist for these unpublished trials, but they have been traditionally treated as secret.However, litigation and new freedom of information rules in Europe have helped many clinical study reports to emerge in the public domain, thereby making the restorative authorship possible. In addition, some drug companies have recently pledged to release their reports.Not all of the clinical study reports and other materials we have obtained are complete. However, many contain sufficient detail to form a comprehensive understanding of the trials and would enable someone to produce a journal length manuscript for publication.

We believe it is important to publish unpublished and other abandoned studies, even though they will at best represent a brief synopsis of all the publicly available data. This is because we live in a research and practice environment based on publications, and unpublished trials remain largely invisible. There is still no PubMed-like indexing system for unpublished clinical study reports. Moreover, most researchers will not have the time to sift through hundreds or thousands of pages to understand what occurred in a single clinical trial. We therefore need a shorthand representation, and the best we know of is journal publication.

To avoid a continuation of journal papers with selective reporting, we propose that trial publications adhere to reporting standards that ensure accountability. With a compression factor in some cases well above 1000:1 (table 2), summarising a clinical study report into a journal length manuscript inevitably requires value judgments about which information to include. These decisions should be transparent so that any bias can be identified and discussed. Responsible restorative authorship requires those publishing articles to also make the underlying trial data available simultaneously as an electronic appendix. In addition, there should be public access to an auditable record that documents which parts of the clinical study report (page numbers and paragraphs) were incorporated into the new publication, to help make restorative authors’ value judgments about what to include in the summary explicit and transparent.

### How should we address the inevitable harms from non-negligent variant reclassification in predictive genetic testing? [^152286d2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CURRENT LEGAL RECOURSE

These potential harms could lead those injured or with lost opportunities due to variant misclassification to consider legal actions. However, the legal and ethical landscape around laboratories' duties in regard to variant classification is nascent and still developing. As of the end of 2016, no cases regarding a “potential duty to revisit genetic test results” had been filed in court (Marchant & Lindor,).

Indeed, current law does not legally require laboratories to update patients when a variant is reclassified although several groups have argued an ethical duty for labs to do so (Bombard et al.; Roberts & Foulkes,, 4, 28–29). It is also worth noting that the results from the laboratory are often mediated through another entity, such as a researcher or clinician, unless the lab has a direct‐to‐consumer model (McGuire et al.). There has been discussion of the legal and ethical role of researchers and clinicians in variant reinterpretation as well (Stevens et al.).

While the legal system has a well‐tested method of adjudicating claims against providers, namely malpractice lawsuits, this recourse would not automatically extend to the labs. If an individual were to bring a suit against a laboratory for harm caused by a variant re‐interpretation, it would likely fall under a general negligence claim and they would have to prove four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Even in cases where there may have been a mistake made by the laboratory, these cases will be difficult to prove. For example, in the much‐discussed recent case Quest v. Williams, the plaintiffs alleged lab negligence during variant classification. In this case, the laboratory was sued by a mother after her young child died. She alleged that the laboratory erred when it classified a variant as a VUS and, if it had properly categorized the variant as pathogenic, her son's treatment would have been altered, possibly preventing his death. However, a US District Court recently ruled against the plaintiffs at an early stage of the legal case, the summary judgment stage. This result may send “a message to future plaintiffs' lawyers that a case dealing with cutting‐edge medical issues, such as genetic variant classification, is going to be expensive and difficult to win” (Ray,).

### Regulating direct-to-consumer genetic tests: what is all the fuss about? [^f5b9aa92]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The number of genetic tests available direct-to-consumer has burgeoned over the last few years, prompting numerous calls for tighter regulation of these services. However, there is a lack of consensus about the most appropriate and achievable level of regulation, particularly given the global nature of the market. By consideration of potential for direct and indirect harms caused by genetic susceptibility or genomic profiling tests, in this study we offer an overarching framework that we believe to be feasible for the regulation of direct-to-consumer genetic tests and likely to be relevant to other forms of predictive testing. We suggest that just five key requirements would adequately protect the consumer: a proportionate set of consent procedures; formal laboratory accreditation; evidence of a valid gene-disease association; appropriately qualified staff to interpret the test result; and consumer protection legislation to prevent false or misleading claims.

### When does physician use of AI increase liability? [^a316f47a]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are also limitations in the degree to which the study modeled the procedural elements of a real jury trial. For example, jurors would likely be presented with expert testimony concerning the use of AI precision medicine. Of course, jurors would normally hear expert testimony from each side: one expert that favored taking AI advice and one that disfavored it. Future work could assess whether there is any systematic effect of dueling expert testimony in these cases (e.g. perhaps laypeople generally tend to defer to pro-AI experts) and whether other procedural aspects of a trial complicate the more basic model of lay judgment discovered and presented here.

### Pharmaceutical governance system for costly drugs through human rights due diligence [^671f534d]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Patients with rare diseasesface many barriers to accessing highly priced “orphan” drugs—medicines developed specifically to treat rare or so-called orphan diseases—which are often the only treatment available.For example, onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma), a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare and often fatal disorder, was approved for funding by the United Kingdom’s NHS in 2021 at £1.79m per dose.Other healthcare systems may be unable or unwilling to cover the drug with such a price tag.

High prices stem from multiple factors and can create insurmountable barriers to access and strain healthcare budgets. Internationally, they lead to inequity in who receives treatment for which disorders. During the covid-19 pandemic, inequitable access to vaccines and medicines, partly driven by high prices, prompted calls from commentators, health policy experts, and advocacy groups for a new social contract between the pharmaceutical industry and governments.These calls reflect the failure of the current system to meet societal expectations that companies will deliver innovative, affordable products while respecting governance rules that facilitate economic development and leave room for corporate profit.

We argue here that a new social contract is required that is grounded in international human rights law and which specifies obligations and responsibilities of governments and corporations. This article, part of a BMJ Collection on equitable access to costly new drugs, considers how a “human rights due diligence” framework could provide a conceptual foundation for aligning pharmaceutical governance with these standards. Such a publicly accountable way to promote compliance with international human rights could stimulate governments and pharmaceutical companies to take greater responsibility for improving access to drugs.

The framework should complement—not replace—existing efforts to reform intellectual property systems, such as compulsory licensing (allowing governments to authorise use of a patented invention without the patent holder’s consent); Bolar provisions (permitting early preparation of generic drugs before patent expiry); parallel importation (enabling import of patented products sold more cheaply elsewhere); the TRIPS waiver proposal (which seeks to suspend intellectual property protections for tools related to covid-19); and initiatives including the Medicines Patent Pool (a platform backed by the United Nations (UN) for voluntary patent sharing to enable generic production) that promote broader access.The framework should set targets based on human rights, define measurable access goals, and incorporate mechanisms for monitoring and accountability.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^976bbfe2]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Expert testimony peer review—organizational recommendation—states that organizations should establish a practical mechanism for conducting single-specialty or multispecialty prospective peer review of proposed expert medical testimony in civil and criminal litigation, noting that judges are responsible for determining whether the underlying reasoning or methodology of the expert testimony is scientifically valid and can be applied properly to the facts at issue but do not have the necessary knowledge to make such a determination independently; therefore, professional associations and independent review organizations need an effective method, because any damage or injustice from inappropriate testimony is not likely to be remediated and a posttrial determination will not further the cause of justice, whereas a prospective peer review tailored to the case and, when complex scientific questions require multiple experts, a multidisciplinary review would achieve greater sophistication, accountability, and efficiency in the trial process.

The origins of the use of expert witnesses to assist courts in helping understand the required conduct in determining the standard of care provides a basis for recognizing the consultant role sought in judicial proceedings. Both rules of evidence and court decisions have evolved in a manner that encourages the introduction of expert testimony while conditioning its use to avoid unfair bias. Trial court judges decide on permitting such testimony, while legal counsel is responsible for helping juries determine its importance and reliability. Certain types of restrictions and adverse consequences for misstatements exist but are subordinated to the trial process in most circumstances, a process that varies among different jurisdictions.

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^7263b3e8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Differences between clinical and forensic evaluations—Clinical evaluation aims to “relieve suffering” within a “doctor–patient” relationship serving “the patient,” with “fiduciary duty to patient; duty to patient’s best interests; patient’s welfare is primary,” to “help heal the patient,” where “confidentiality usually applies,” focusing to “establish diagnosis and treatment plan,” with “treatment rendered,” using “self-report; occasionally outside information; some collateral records,” accepting that “therapeutic bias occurs; desire for patient to get better; willingness to advocate for patient,” and producing “establish therapeutic relationship; improve well-being of patient”; in contrast, forensic evaluation aims to “answer a legal question” within an “evaluator–evaluee” relationship serving “the court, attorney, or other retaining agency,” with “fiduciary duty to court, attorney, or other retaining agency,” to “by report or testimony, inform and teach the retaining agency and fact finder, i.e., judge or jury,” where “privilege may apply,” to “conduct objective evaluation; diagnosis may be nonessential,” with “no treatment rendered, although it may be recommended,” using “extensive collection of data including serial interviews, information from additional historians, review of records and documents,” maintaining “purposeful lack of bias; attempt to be neutral and objective; no investment in outcome,” and producing “answer the referral question in the form of a verbal or written report; deposition; and/or testimony.”

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^b949db01]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Legal and ethical standards of testimony—Under Daubert, the judge is tasked as the gatekeeper for determining whether expert testimony is both relevant and reliable, and the Daubert court offered 4 guidelines a judge may, but need not, use in assessing the reliability of testimony: whether the expert’s theory or technique can be (or has been) tested (aka, “falsifiability”); whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review or publication; the known or potential error rate of the theory; and whether there is general acceptance in the relevant scientific community. Although Daubert has superseded Frye in most jurisdictions, some jurisdictions still use the Frye standard, and under the Daubert standard, trial judges are to focus on the reasoning or scientific validity of the methodology, not the conclusion generated. The importance of standards is underscored by the fact that appellate courts can only consider an “abuse-of-discretion” standard in reviewing a trial judge’s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony (ie, defers to the trial judge’s rulings unless overtly erroneous). Attorneys may request experts to state that their testimony is being given “within a reasonable degree of medical certainty,” but this rubric is not universally defined and has been interpreted differently by different courts and also is not a standard required in all jurisdictions; expert witnesses are not advocates for the side that retains them but rather are advocates for their unbiased opinion, which is derived from facts and evidence-based medicine.

### Does NICE apply the rule of rescue in its approach to highly specialised technologies? [^d1a6c426]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The rule of rescue is an amorphous concept that can be defined and used in a variety of ways. In claiming to reject the rule, NICE adopts a particularly narrow interpretation that is, in practical terms, incompatible with its role as a national priority setter. However, this rejection is in tension with an approach to appraising HSTs that might reasonably be considered to reflect the substance of the rule, as it is commonly understood. As such, while NICE’s claim that it ‘cannot apply’ the rule of rescue should not be considered wrong, it also cannot be considered entirely right.

That is not to suggest that in its design and conduct of the HST programme, NICE has sought to adopt the rule of rescue. That is, in Kantian terms, it is not argued that in facilitating access to these technologies NICE acts for the sake of the rule.Rather, it is suggested that these actions are in accordance with the rule, while perhaps being motivated by a more complex set of normative considerations. This is an important distinction because the moral basis for the rule of rescue itself appears, at best, questionable.In contrast, it is perfectly possible that the reasons that lead NICE to act in accordance with the rule provide a morally sound basis for decision-making.

NICE, however, is not explicit about these reasons. In describing its approach to HSTs, NICE refers to the ‘particular circumstances of these very rare conditions’, specifically ‘the vulnerability of very small patient groups with limited treatment options, the nature and extent of the evidence and the challenge for manufacturers in making a reasonable return on their research and development investment’.The programme’s focus on conditions that are ‘chronic and severely disabling’ suggests that weight is also given to the severity of clinical need.But while NICE draws attention to these considerations, it is not explicit about the role they play in its approach to HSTs. It is therefore left to us to speculate as to why NICE considers these technologies worthy of such significant prioritisation compared with the many other technologies that it appraises.

### United States: law and policy concerning transfer of genomic data to third countries [^878accbe]. Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Compatible processing/adequacy

Neither the Common Rule nor HIPAA uses the concept of “compatible processing” to capture an assessment of data protection regimes in other countries as a condition to the transfer of data. Any such assessment would be carried out as part of a general risk assessment and risk mitigation strategy, as described above, or as a step required for an IRB, data access committee (DAC), or privacy board determination regarding the adequacy of provisions to protect subject privacy, as described below.

“Adequacy” is important in determining whether personal data can flow from the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland to the US without special safeguards. (Switzerland has similar standards, and other countries outside the EU may use EU protections as a benchmark.) The current EU-US Privacy Shield Framework is the subject of an affirmative adequacy decision by the European Commission dated July 12, 2016. The adequacy decision references a ruling by the European Court of Justice that an adequate level of protection does not necessitate protections that are identical to those guaranteed in the EU legal order. It must, however, ensure a level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms that is “essentially equivalent” to the EU level and proves effective in practice (European Commission). The Privacy Shield Framework, which is administered by the US Department of Commerce, sets up a self-certification process under which eligible organizations publicly commit to comply with notice, data integrity and purpose limitation, choice, security, access, recourse, enforcement and liability, and accountability for onward transfer principles. The process is voluntary, but once an organization makes these commitments, they become enforceable against the organization by the FTC (note that the FTC does not have jurisdiction over most non-profit organizations).

The Privacy Shield Framework undergoes annual reviews, and there are signs of trouble in connection with the upcoming review. These include a resolution from the European Parliament taking the view that the current arrangement does not provide an adequate level of protection and calling for its suspension on September 1, 2018 unless full compliance is achieved, and a case that may bring scrutiny from the European Court of Justice, which struck down the prior Safe Harbor Framework (Lomas).

### All models are wrong and yours are useless: making clinical prediction models impactful for patients [^8938f457]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mapping the path to usefulness

I know what you are thinking: “It takes time! Method development is trailblazing new ideas, the clinic will eventually catch up.” Yes, it will take time. But if “it takes time” is the only answer you have on how your model will be useful for patients, then it will take even longer.

Can we expect models to be useful immediately after publication? Probably not. But we can expect model developers to have a roadmap to the clinical usefulness of their model. For drug discovery, there is a well-known sequence of steps to follow, and for medical software there are equally clear rules, but they are in my experience much less well-known.

Many validations of your model, like clinical trials, can be done without regulatory approval. But establishing line of sight to the clinic early and planning a path through regulation will be crucial if you really want your model to be used on patients. Which regulation to follow will depend on your location. For example, in Europe it is CE marking, in the UK it is UKCA approval, in the US it is FDA approval, and other parts of the world have similar schemes. Regulators always seem scary, but in fact they want to help and the best advice is to reach out to them as early as possible.

It is a big task and needs to be broken down into more easily digestible chunks. Start outlining the road to implementation while you are still designing your clinical prediction tool: is it even theoretically possible that your model will help a patient? Is there a clear decision point your model is addressing with data that are clinically relevant? Continue solidifying your plan while writing a paper about your model: What exactly needs to happen for doctors to use your tool? What validations are needed? If you introduce a new data modality, how would this fit into existing infrastructure? And if the main use of your model is not for patients, but maybe hypothesis generation or testing a new modelling idea, then here is the place to state it clearly.

Including a section on implementation into the discussion of every translational paper would be the simplest and in my view most impactful step to improve current scientific practices. It will make your papers stronger and prepare you for your conversations with regulators.

Writing an implementation plan can only be a first step - actions are needed, not words - but spending more time thinking about implementation and regulation would make academic researchers much more proactive partners in improving clinical standards, and that would be a major step forward.

### Distinguishing product and practice regulation in personalized medicine [^4a92f18f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Protecting the public from faulty targeting of medicines, while preserving the crucial distinction between product and practice regulation, may require innovative regulatory approaches and close, ongoing involvement by the medical profession. This article explores four problem areas: validation of clinical claims for tests used in targeting therapies; developing and implementing appropriate restrictions on off-label use; promoting consistent concepts of clinical utility for use in various regulatory, reimbursement, and judicial contexts; and communication of clear information to guide clinicians in appropriate use of targeted therapeutic products. The article suggests an approach for addressing these problems by sharing regulatory activities between the Food and Drug Administration and a newly-created clinical standards board formed within the medical and scientific communities.

### Expanded access and right to try requests: the community oncologist's experience [^59ee9c82]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

In light of this knowledge gap, some fundamentals of the programs are reviewed herein. For both pathways, the drug manufacturer must be a willing partner in the process to allow access to investigational drugs. Neither program compels the manufacturer to provide the drug. No data are available on the number of requests that manufacturers receive or the time it takes for them to respond: there is no public reporting for either of these metrics, for either program. However, Caplan et alprovide some insight into the experience of an advisory committee convened to provide recommendations on EA for the manufacturer Janssen's (then unapproved) oncology drug daratumumab. During a 19-month period, 324 individual patient requests for unapproved daratumumab were received globally; 144 of these were screened out based on eligibility criteria (eg, the patient had a primary diagnosis or comorbidities that had not been studied with the drug, and therefore, the benefit and/or risk to the patient was unfavorable or unknown; the patient had not exhausted all available approved therapies; the patient was eligible to participate in a clinical trial; etc). Of the remaining 180 requests that were reviewed by the committee, 165 were approved.Thus, in this example, approximately half of the EA requests received by the manufacturer were approved. Why would a manufacturer choose not to provide investigational drug to fulfill an EA or Right To Try request? One concern may be the possibility of legal liability. Right To Try legislation provides broad liability protection for manufacturers (and prescribers, barring gross negligence or misconduct) who provide investigational drug to patients.EA provides no such protection, although there have been no reported cases of legal action taken against manufacturers related to provision of unapproved drugs via EA.A second concern may be the possibility that the clinical development program will be jeopardized. Right To Try legislation mandates that clinical outcomes may not adversely affect FDA review or approval of the investigational drug (unless critical to safety or requested by the manufacturer).Although this is not explicitly stated in EA guidance, a review conducted by FDA of 10,939 EA requests over a 10-year period found just two instances where a drug development program was placed on clinical hold because of adverse events that occurred under EA (in both cases, holds were eventually lifted).A manufacturer may also be reluctant to fulfill EA or Right To Try requests because there may be a limited supply of the drug, which they wish to conserve for clinical trial purposes. Finally, there is an administrative burden associated with supporting the requests.

### Has FDA abandoned its efforts to make fake-cigar cigarettes comply with federal tobacco control laws that apply to cigarettes but not cigars? [^4dfb9214]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

In the USA, legal definitions of cigarettes and cigars are critical to tobacco control policy because federal, state and local laws typically tax and regulate cigarettes more strictly than cigars. In 2016, near the end of the Obama Administration, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent warning letters to four filtered 'little cigar' manufacturers stating that their so-called 'cigars' were cigarettes and, therefore, subject to more stringent public health restrictions. Documents produced in response to a Freedom of Information Act request show that without explanation or public notice FDA has abandoned its prior determination that the manufacturers' 'little cigars' were actually cigarettes and, consequently, were violating the ban on flavoured cigarettes in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA). The documents also present the manufacturers' arguments against FDA's original position. However, those industry arguments are inconsistent with the research, other evidence and legal analysis indicating that filtered 'little cigars' meet the legal definition of cigarettes under the TCA and other similar federal, state and local definitions. To protect the public health, FDA must renew its efforts to ensure that these filtered 'little cigars' do not continue to evade compliance with the many important restrictions and requirements that apply to cigarettes but not cigars. Other government regulatory and tax-collection agencies with similar definitions need to follow suit.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^57a70dd4]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Communication in foodborne outbreak response—trade associations can reach large numbers of food facilities and arrange for conference calls and other communications as needed, and establishing working relationships with food manufacturing facilities in an agency’s jurisdiction can help smooth the investigation and control process in an outbreak associated with those facilities. Outbreaks are teachable moments for the food industry and for the responsible public agencies, and when the news media carries stories about an outbreak, communication within the industry is lively, often with misinformation; food-safety and public health agencies need to dispel misconceptions before they lead to other problems, explain their response to the outbreak and restore public faith in the future safety of the implicated product, and learn from the food industry about information that could aid in prevention and investigation of future outbreaks. Food-safety and public health agencies also can collaborate with industry on long-term development of training materials for members and can speak at industry meetings to clarify the prevention message, and many food facilities and manufacturers have written emergency plans and recall procedures already in place that regulatory officials might want to review in advance of any actual event.

### Accelerating evidence gathering and approval of precision medicine therapies: the FDA takes aim at rare mutations [^3c9dab1b]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug labeling and prescribers’ duties to patients

To offset the lower evidentiary standard, the FDA draft guidance calls for detailed labeling information to accompany drugs, including information about the level of evidence supporting rare molecular indications. Stakeholders, such as prescribers and payers, traditionally work on the assumption that indications, including molecular indications, are based on clinical trial data. The FDA guidance calls for labels to include a transparent description of the (limited) evidentiary basis for rare molecular indications. While commendable, this shift will demand greater scientific literacy and accountability on the part of health professionals prescribing the drug.

Because so few medicines have been approved specifically to treat rare diseases,there is a significant amount of off-label use in rare diseases. This status quo puts significant responsibility on clinicians. Off-label use might be the standard of care for many patients who are in dire need of new drugs to manage their rare condition. However, off-label prescribing may expose physicians to legal claims of medical malpractice if informed consent is insufficient or if sound medical judgment, based on the available evidence,was not properly exercised. Furthermore, it is possible that the new Guidance would require that patients be tested for the relevant biomarkers, a practice that is not routinely carried out with off-label prescribing.

The Guidance could help to ensure that some (as opposed to no) evidence is generated in clinical trials for rare mutations. In addition, this approach could help inform prescriber and patient shared decision-making in selecting a therapy. One caveat, however, is that prescribers will need to explain complex labels, that drugs are “indicated,” but that this indication is supported only by limited evidence.

### The FCTC's evidence-based policies remain a key to ending the tobacco epidemic [^82db2e11]. Tobacco Control (2013). Low credibility.

In addition, many of the new proposed ‘endgame’ strategies take a different approach than the strategies that have been successfully implemented. Prior strategies have been well accepted because they focused on protecting youth, more effectively informing consumers, changing economic incentives to promote healthy behaviour and restricting the tobacco industry's ability to appeal to youth and mislead adults. None sought to restrict sales to adults or to restrict the behaviour of adults. If it was important to first gain the support for the strategies called for by the Framework Convention, it will be even more important to pay close attention to public attitudes and social norms with policies that directly impact the behaviour of adults.

The most important lesson for the ‘endgame’ discussion is that what has most often been the missing ingredient for effective tobacco control efforts isn't innovative ideas or effective policies, it is a lack of political will at the highest levels of government. If tobacco control efforts are to move to a point where a true ‘endgame’ is possible, nothing is more important than creating and sustaining the political will to tackle the tobacco epidemic and doing everything possible to fully and aggressively implement the policies that have already been proven to work.

Key messages

Implementation of proven tobacco control measures, such as higher taxes, smoke-free air laws, strong, graphic warnings, powerful mass media campaigns and prohibitions on tobacco industry marketing have been responsible for dramatic reductions in tobacco use and extraordinary changes in social norms, but very few countries have fully implemented these measures and no country has yet to implement them so completely that they have achieved all that they are likely to achieve.
While it is critical for tobacco control to innovate and to test out new ways to reduce tobacco use, it is also essential that these new efforts not divert attention or resources away from fully implementing the measures that have been shown to work, especially in the many low and middle income countries that have neither implemented the FCTC effectively nor built support for the type of strong action called for by some of the endgame proposals.

The report notes that not all RWIs constitute a COI, that there is a reasonable consensus that RWI should be collected for the 12 months before such activities, and that to what degree a particular relevant RWI might constitute a COI remains unclear and the AHA and the ACC should consider providing more specific guidance for when an RWI becomes a COI; it also states that the ACC and AHA should educate their members and promote compliance with the applicable policies and should have oversight bodies and personnel in place to independently and objectively assess, manage, and oversee the integrity of any endeavor in accordance with applicable laws, industry standards, and best practices.

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^23702ba0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Child and adolescent forensic evaluations—standards of proof and medical certainty—outline multiple levels of certainty, where the least exacting is “reasonable suspicion,” civil cases hinge on “preponderance of the evidence” that can be “51% certain,” psychiatric evidence may require “clear and convincing proof,” and criminal cases require “beyond a reasonable doubt”; physicians are often asked for opinions with “a reasonable degree of medical certainty,” which has been proposed as equivalent to what a physician uses when making a diagnosis and starting treatment, implying that the degree of certainty would depend on the clinical situation.

### How US law will evaluate artificial intelligence for COVID-19 [^a8c969a0]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Numerous proposals, prototypes, and models have emerged for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to predict individual risk related to covid-19. In the United States, for instance, the Department of Veterans Affairs uses individualised risk scores to allocate medical resources to people with covid-19,and prisons have sought to detect symptoms by processing inmates’ phone calls.Further tools, such as vulnerability predictions for individualsand voice based detection of infection,are on the horizon. But use of AI for such purposes has given rise to questions about legality.

When a state or federal government seeks to use AI models to predict an individual’s risk of covid-19, the key legal questions will ultimately turn on how effective the models are and how much they burden legal interests. We focus on two of the most salient legal concerns under US law: privacy and discrimination. Challenges on privacy or discrimination grounds might appear in a variety of contexts, including challenges to regulatory decisions, tort actions, or lawsuits under health privacy laws. We argue that the basic need to balance benefits against burdens runs through all of these legal regimes. Governments implementing risk scoring tools must show that their tools produce valid, reliable predictions and burden individuals’ civil liberties no more than necessary. In evaluating the legality of public health use of algorithms, courts will likely also probe how the output of these tools is used to shape policies and programs. But showing that a model performs well and does not exceedingly burden privacy and other interests are essential preconditions for lawful deployment.

### From the editors' desk: decisions, decisions [^d7b953b2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Meanwhile, clinical investigators (including many JGIM readers) are engaged in a different sort of decision-making: where to submit the results of completed research. At JGIM, we’re concerned about demands on authors’ time and have taken steps to ease the submission process. Instructions for authors are brief and (we hope) unambiguous. In contrast to many other journals, authors are requested to submit their manuscripts as a single Word document, inclusive of figures and tables. There is no cumbersome data entry process. And, on initial submission, we will accept references in any numbered format—no need to spend additional time finding the right EndNote reference style.

Another way we save authors’ time is by promptly returning manuscripts thought unlikely to weather the editorial process. JGIM currently returns approximately 40% of original research submissions without external peer review. We do not do so lightly. In most cases, a co-Editor and/or Associate Editor and at least one other member of the editorial team review each manuscript. The most common reason for “reject without review” is lack of fit with the journal’s scope, although we sometimes reject for lack of topicality, overlap with other recently published content, or major problems with clarity. We believe that prompt rejection gives authors an opportunity to submit their work to a more suitable venue without wasting their time.

Despite efforts at process improvement here and at other journals, the road from study completion to publication is often slow and precarious. One reason is that authors whose work is not accepted at one journal have to start the process all over again at the next. We are pleased to announce a new partnership between JGIM and the Annals of Internal Medicine that eliminates some of the redundancies. The Annals and JGIM have negotiated an arrangement such that authors who submit manuscripts to Annals can request at the time of submission that Annals send the manuscript directly to JGIM if after external review Annals decides not to publish it. This will greatly decrease the hassle factor for authors in resubmitting to JGIM after review at Annals and will allow JGIM to streamline our decision-making process for the submission. We are excited about this new venture and welcome your comments on this and other ways we can make JGIM more responsive to your needs.

Improving the quality of expert testimony—Various branches of organized medicine and some state medical licensure boards have implemented programs to help curb unreliable medical expert testimony, and there are multiple strategies for regulating expert witness testimony. Historically, witness immunity has shielded experts from legal reprisal based on their testimony, but some legal authorities have sought a distinction between expert witnesses and fact witnesses, postulating that because experts testify voluntarily and receive significant compensation, general witness immunity should not apply to them.

Low-level COIs also include intellectual interest that only tangentially relate to the topic under discussion, and an intellectual COI graded as low-level signals that a potential moderate-level COI was flagged and reviewed by the DOI-COI Review and Management Panel members to determine whether the interest was considered of low concern.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^36b224bd]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Control of source in foodborne outbreaks—decision to remove food and recall execution are outlined: if the descriptive epidemiology suggests an association between the disease and the suspected food, then removing food from the market might be warranted, even in the absence of confirmed laboratory findings. Fully document the information that led to the decision (whether to remove or not remove food) and the process used to make the decision. Once a decision is made to remove food from the market, the goal is to remove it as quickly and efficiently as possible, and foods with short shelf lives generally are consumed or discarded within 5–10 days while foods with longer shelf lives most likely will still be around; try to prevent additional exposure by ensuring suspected food is not eaten. To improve the effectiveness of recall measures and industry response, agencies can implement the following: Develop a list of control measures to implement immediately when an outbreak-related or illness-related recall has been identified; Identify industry needs, and develop guidance for interacting with public health or agriculture officials investigating an outbreak. Provide retailers and manufacturers with 24/7 contact numbers and e-mails for regulators at the local, state, and federal levels, including FDA and USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service; Develop guidance for communicating with the news media. Develop guidelines for mitigating impact of the recall, such as providing refunds for returned product. Develop templates, message maps, or community information sheets for common foodborne agents for use during an outbreak. Regulators responsible for retail food facilities need a means to immediately notify all food facilities in their jurisdiction through e-mail, blast fax, or phone calls of a recall; identifying subcategories of facilities is highly recommended so notices can be targeted to specific facilities, and this process should include food-bank donation centers and other sites that might have received food donations. If any distributors or retailers refuse to remove the food, issuance of a public health warning and order to require action might be necessary, and the agency/jurisdiction should monitor to ensure the recall is effective in stopping illnesses and food is completely removed.

### The charlie gard case: British and American approaches to court resolution of disputes over medical decisions [^19154366]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Precedent in the United Kingdom

After a thorough review of legal precedent, including the ruling of the United Kingdom’s Supreme Court in Airedale NHS Trust v. James and the ruling in the House of Lords in Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland,Mr Justice Francis highlighted the directives from the United Kingdom’s Supreme Court in the James case that ‘decision makers must look at [the patient’s] welfare in the widest sense, not just medical, but social and psychological, they must consider the nature of the medical treatment in questions, what it involves and its prospects for success; they must consider what the outcomes of that treatment for the patient is likely to be; and they must try and put themselves in the place of the individual patient.’

Here the British courts, as Christopher Stone notes in a commentary on legal precedent in the United Kingdom, ‘build on, modify or ‘fine tune’’ the common law to accommodate for small but significant variations in the material facts of successive cases. In doing so, both the clarity and precedent of the law adjusts to new situations while providing consistency and guidance for future conflicts.For British courts, the precedent on family–physician conflict over treatment decisions generally tends to support the decision of the physician.

American courts, in contrast, almost always favor the ‘autonomy’ claims of the patient or family. Such an emphasis shifts the court’s focus from the ‘best interests’ of the incompetent patient to the putative claims of patient (or family) to ‘autonomy’ to determine what medical treatment the now non-competent patient would, if competent, choose. Vast, indeed, is the area for speculation or the opportunity for flights of fantasy by a process untethered by a concern for the best interests of the patient.

### The charlie gard case: British and American approaches to court resolution of disputes over medical decisions [^7800b09b]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Court system in the United States

The United States has no centralized decision making body to resolve family–physician conflicts over medical treatment. Their guidance is the domain of the legislature and courts of 50 various states, each of which may set its own standards. The wide range of views in the United States include those of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in In re Saikewicz that decisions on the withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment are of such moment they cannot be entrusted to families or doctors.Rather, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled such decisions are ‘our responsibility and that of the lower courts.’ Then in a criticism of the New Jersey Supreme Court’s ruling in the famous Karen Ann Quinlan case—which left the decision on whether to remove the life-sustaining ventilator to Karen Ann’s parents, subject to confirmation by an ethics committee—the Supreme Judicial Court ruled ‘such decisions are not to be entrusted to any other group proposing to represent the morality and conscience of our society, no matter how highly motivated or impressively constituted.’

The New York Court of Appeals—that state’s court of final jurisdiction—went even further in an opinion in the In re Storar, a case concerning the medical treatment of a never competent patient in a state mental institution who, at age 80 years, was diagnosed with bladder cancer.Owing to the cancer, John Storar lost a unit of blood every 8–15 days. His mother, who had visited him every day since his admission to the state facility in 1942, asked the physicians to cease the pain-causing blood transfusions. A trial court judge agreed. The New York Court of Appeals reversed that judgment. In doing so, it characterized as ‘judicial fantasy’ the Supreme Judicial Court’s putative determination of what the never competent patient would have wanted. New York’s highest court ruled that a life-sustaining medical intervention could not be removed from anyone absent ‘clear and convincing’ evidence—from the patient when competent—that such was his will.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^7b808609]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Montgomery and McCulloch ruling

The RMM guidelines do not address the legal challenge encapsulated in judgment in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015]. The medical professional must take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment—but also any suitable alternative or variant treatments.

The question of “who decides” which alternative treatments are suitable was recently considered in Bilal & Anor v St George’s University Hospital Trust [2023] and McCulloch and others v Forth Valley Health Board [2023]. Both the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court held, respectively, that this decision is a matter of “ professional skill and judgment to which the professional practice (Hunter v Hanley/Bolam) test should be applied. ” Further, the Court in Bilal emphasised the importance of the specific medical speciality when determining alternative treatments. These judgements mean that the option of treatment with valproate must be discussed with everyone who presents with responsive seizure types, particularly if it is likely to be the most efficacious treatment for them.

The law is clear on the role of clinicians on such matters. It is not satisfactory to simply present the patient with technical information “ which she cannot reasonably be expected to grasp, let alone by routinely demanding her signature on a consent form ” (Montgomery [2015] UKSC 11 at 90).

Yet regulatory body information leaflets for patients do not outline the risks of stopping valproate estimated as a 30–40% chance of recurrence or worsening of seizures. Neither do they explain the risks of “user independent” contraception, nor the risks and benefits of the alternative treatments. Thus, the MHRA valproate regulations do not meet requirements for patient decision-making in line with the Montgomery ruling regarding disclosure of ‘material risks’.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee—Moderate-level conflicts of interest most frequently represent an intellectual interest that is clinically relevant to the guideline topic; such previously formed conclusions may leave a clinical guideline vulnerable to cognitive biases and may result in indirect financial benefit related to career advancement. Cognitive biases of particular concern include confirmation bias and authority bias, and the committee states it is appropriate and necessary to document and assess intellectual interests. Moderate-level COIs may also signify the potential for an individual or entity to create professional advantages or financial profit based on an association with the development of a clinical guideline rather than its specific conclusions.

### Genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer [^0f7b6712]. ASBrS (2019). High credibility.

Multi-gene panel testing—scope, efficiency, and variant detection—genetic testing has expanded in scope and availability since 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. increased the testing options, with increased competition helping to lower the cost. Improvements in technology, like next-generation sequencing, have made testing for more than one gene at a time a reality, which can improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of testing. While BRCA1 and BRCA2 remain the most likely genes to be mutated in a family with high breast and ovarian cancer risk, panel testing can allow for more comprehensive coverage of less common syndromes that can also confer hereditary cancer risk. Numerous recent studies have shown that panel testing can significantly increase the rate of detection of pathogenic variants, with the most frequently identified pathogenic variants outside BRCA1 and BRCA2 being in PALB2, CHEK2, and ATM.

### Healthcare workers' informal uses of mobile phones and other mobile devices to support their work: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^be5d67b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Ensuring appropriate information management

Where healthcare workers use their personal phones, are they able to communicate with and exchange information about patients while still protecting patient confidentiality and data security ? For instance, do they know how to anonymise and store patient information safely?
When healthcare workers use their personal phones to gather and store information, this can take information out of formal health system records and cause problems, for instance, for continuity of care. Where healthcare workers use their personal phones, do they have easy ways of ensuring that information is made available to others who may need it? For instance, when discussing patient referrals, stock‐outs, or staffing schedules on their personal phones, can they easily add this information to formal records?
Patients may prefer to contact healthcare workers on their personal phones because they want to keep sensitive information out of the formal system. Do healthcare workers have the skills they need to decide which information they should add to formal records and which they can safely omit? Also, are there better ways of protecting sensitive information within the formal system?

Separating work life and personal life

Healthcare workers who use their personal phones for work purposes may struggle to separate their work life and personal life. Where healthcare workers use their personal phones, are there clear rules and expectations that protect their free time? For instance, are they expected to answer work calls when they come home? If they do so, will they be compensated for their time? If they offer clinical advice in their free time, do they have the same legal responsibilities and protection as they do at work?
Healthcare workers who use their personal phones for work purposes may be distracted by personal calls and social media use. On the other hand, workplaces that expect staff to use their personal phones for work purposes may need to accept some level of personal use. Are there clear but reasonable rules and expectations regarding healthcare workers’ use of their phones for personal use while at work ?

Covering healthcare workers’ personal costs

Healthcare workers who use their personal phones for work purposes also have personal costs. This can include costs for the phone itself as well as for data, airtime and electricity. Are all healthcare workers receiving sufficient compensation for these costs? Healthcare workers in different settings are likely to have different views about how they would like to be compensated. Explore whether money, free airtime and/or data is most useful to them. Consider collaborating with telecommunication companies to provide phone credits to healthcare workers as part of corporate social responsibility.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^800dbd34]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

CIFOR foodborne outbreak response—control measures should be implemented concurrently with investigations, and when an outbreak is identified, immediate response is critical. Waiting for laboratory results, confirmed medical diagnosis, or results of all investigations is not necessary before initial control measures are implemented, and nonspecific control measures can be implemented immediately to prevent further transmission of disease. Sending at least two investigators to a food establishment implicated in an outbreak is best; one investigator can make certain that food about to be served is safe and the second investigator conducts the investigation. Outbreaks originating from local retail food establishments, local problems at chain retail food establishments, or homes can be controlled through local food-regulatory authority actions, whereas outbreaks originating from commercial processors/producers or multiple sites at chain retail food establishments typically require state and federal agency intervention. Communication is critical in determining what control measures to implement and when to change an intervention’s focus; early sharing of information from epidemiologists to environmental investigators and frequent communication from environmental investigators with epidemiologists and laboratorians is critical, and information gathered in the environmental investigation also can lead epidemiologists to identify contributing factors and environmental antecedents.

### The charlie gard case: British and American approaches to court resolution of disputes over medical decisions [^65a0adbf]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Differences between British and American approaches

Owing to differences in their health-care systems, inclination to litigiousness, and a greater sense of a common community, fewer disputes are brought to the courts in the United Kingdom than in the United States. When cases do make their way to court, the British courts view issues not from the perspective of patient or family ‘autonomy,’ but the ‘best interests’ of the patient.

Another major difference in the systems is payment for litigation. The ‘contingency fee’ approach used in civil cases in the United States allows individuals who believe they were unjustifiably injured in the medical context to seek legal assistance for one-third of any future payment for the claim. There are no immediate ‘out of pocket’ costs for initiating a law suit. Seeking a legal remedy for a perceived injury in the United Kingdom is a more expensive proposition. Significant ‘out of pocket’ costs are a disincentive to seeking a court remedy for a complaint though means-tested legal aid is available to families in these cases.

Finally, the unitary court structure in the United Kingdom promotes a greater consistency in judicial rulings than is found in the United States. In the United Kingdom once a higher court promulgates a way to proceed and established a standard to be followed, lower courts tend to conform. In the United States, the multiplicity of jurisdictions established under the Constitution precludes such a unified legal system.

When the President of the Federal Constitutional Court, Andreas Voßkuhle, said at the beginning of the public hearing in April 2019 that the case was not about giving a moral judgment on suicide, many were surprised at first—since, generally, assisted suicide is considered a moral issue. But this comment points to the core position of the Constitutional Court: The highest court of a constitutional state cannot judge on morals. Rather, it is confined to ruling on the legality of measures, most importantly on whether a law or other interventions by the state, in this case §217 of the German Criminal Code, breach the constitution or not. With this differentiation the court points out a clear separation of personal ethical conviction and state intervention.

The judgment is based on the following argument: In a pluralistic society, different ideas of a good life and a good death exist. It does not fall under the auspices of a human rights-based state to pass judgment on these ideas. Every person is allowed to conduct their life autonomously—and also end it on his or her own will. This view is derived from human dignity and each person’s right of self-determination, the fundamental principles enshrined in the German constitution. Furthermore, the state may not prohibit the assistance towards suicide as it significantly impedes such a plan. However, this is what § 217 of the German Criminal Code did and is therefore not compatible with human dignity and human rights and, hence, void. The Federal Constitutional Court also noted that nobody may be forced to assist in suicide.

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^350e2e44]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Judicial system operations and licensure—evaluators should have an understanding of the system and its interface with child welfare, educational, medical, and mental health care systems, and when traveling to another state should review that state’s professional licensure laws, because each state has its own rules and regulations and temporary licensure may be necessary.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^f2f5b216]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee—key terms for DOI and conflicts of interest define disclosure of interests as a signed declaration of financial and intellectual interests related to health care, and conflict of interest as any declared interest that may affect or be perceived to affect objectivity and independence; a participant is any person involved in development of a clinical guideline or in supporting evidence review; a household member includes a partner with whom the participant has lived for ≥1 y in the same home or a dependent/related person with whom the participant has lived for ≥1 y in the same home; the reporting time frame is 3 y back from the current year; types of interests include active (ongoing), inactive (terminated within the previous 3 y), financial (any payments or financial value from holdings), and intellectual (attachment to academic ideas/activities or a specific viewpoint); factors affecting seriousness include clinical relevance (same disease/condition and ≥1 of: same cascade of care, same intervention, competing intervention, competing intellectual property) and high-risk entity (entity with a vested interest defined as direct financial profit) in clinical decision making.

### Ethical concerns about federal approval of risky pediatric studies [^0159bf04]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The US Federal Code limits research with healthy children to no more than a minimal risk of harm; it restricts research with children who have some disorder or condition to no more than a minor increase over minimal risk, unless potential harms are offset by potential benefits to them, as in therapeutic studies. Higher risk studies require "407 approval," named after the relevant section of the code describing requirements. Rarely used until recently, 407 approval requirements include Institutional Review Board approval and authorization by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services after consultation with a panel of experts; a period for public comment; and assurances that there are adequate permission, consent, and assent. This 407-approval mechanism contains both procedural and interpretative ambiguities, which raise ethical concerns about 1) the expertise represented on advisory panels, 2) the scope of the information offered to the public for comment and its potential conflicts with investigators' intellectual property or commercial interests, 3) whether any upper level of risk exists, and 4) how it conforms with other policies such as the best interest of the child standard in the law or in medical decision making.

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^0e6c58ef]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the variables tested, those likely associated with limited dose–response information (“AA,” “Fast Track,” and “Highest dose proposed”) showed associations favoring “Disagreement,” (Figure 1, P < 0.1), while those associated with compelling scientific evidence (“Biomarkers in dose rationale”) were associated with “Agreement.” Pharmacodynamic biomarkers, which indicate the biological activity of the product without necessarily drawing conclusions about efficacy,were hypothesized to facilitate the dose determination reducing regulatory uncertainties. Our findings qualitatively support this hypothesis, though disagreements persisted in cases where safety concerns led to further adjustments (e.g. asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)‐rywn). The effect of dose range information on regulatory decisions was not straightforward. At the dose‐finding workshop hosted by the European Medicines Agency, it was emphasized that dose selection in drug development is “rarely scientifically sound,” and the importance of designing dose‐ranging studies with at least a 10‐fold dose range was highlighted.The connotation of testing a wide range of doses can differ between the early and late phases of drug development. Regarding drug approval reviews, however, our study showed that investigating more than a 10‐fold dose range in clinical development alone does not guarantee FDA concurrence. Instead, testing doses higher than the proposed dose was associated with favorable agreement outcomes (Table 5). While this finding should not discourage the assessment of broader dose/exposure–response ranges, it underscores the critical need to fully characterize dose–response relationships, particularly at higher doses, to support the optimal dose and secure FDA agreement. The association between “Highest dose proposed” and “Disagreement” remained robust even after accounting for dose/exposure‐related safety considerations, suggesting that uncertainties about not having tested high doses and opportunities for further optimization likely influence decisions. “Multiple dose levels were tested in pivotal study” and “Proposed dose was higher than the marketed dose in foreign country(ies)” were associated with higher probabilities of receiving downward dose modifications (Table 5). For “Multiple dose levels tested in pivotal studies,” the incorporation of multiple arms in phase III pivotal trials was driven by FDA requests made at earlier stages, such as during end‐of‐phase II meetings in many cases (e.g. baricitinib, lofexidine, and atogepant). This observation highlights the proactive role of regulatory guidance in shaping dose‐related decisions during drug development and early disagreements that may persist until approval. Interestingly, products with these two traits (“Multiple dose levels tested in pivotal studies” and “Proposed dose higher than the marketed dose in foreign countries”) frequently underwent adding or replacing the proposed dose with a foreign‐marketed dose (data not shown). This preference reflects a tendency to prioritize the known risks of foreign‐marketed doses over the less‐certain risks of higher, less‐tested doses, likely influenced by ambiguity aversion, a common dynamic in regulatory decision making.

### Proposing minimum requirements for announcing clinical trial results during the COVID-19 pandemic [^4a92e5cd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Recently, results from at least six major randomized clinical trials studying management of COVID-19 have been announced via press release. Given the unique nature of the pandemic, results of such trials often have immediate and worldwide relevance. Yet, while press releases serve the important purpose of disseminating top-level results quickly, they are inherently limited in scope, and rarely include sufficient data to inform practice. Herein, we propose a minimum set of trial characteristics and results to be released simultaneously with clinical trial announcements. This practice will ensure data related to the management of COVID-19 can be used to appropriately impact care, while responding to the needs of diverse stakeholders in the scientific and publishing communities, as well as the public at large.
