## Question

When is it safe to use both anticoagulant and antiplatelet pistols craniotomy for hemangioblastoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when it is safe to use both anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy after craniotomy for hemangioblastoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline hemorrhagic risk of hemangioblastoma surgery. Then, I should verify the added bleeding risk of dual antithrombotic therapy in neurosurgery. Next, I will review evidence on timing of anticoagulation after craniotomy and whether any subgroup or procedure-specific data inform risk. After that, I need to check whether any guideline or high-quality evidence directly addresses this exact scenario. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and contingency plans, and explicitly state what we do not know and how that limits certainty.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk context. Hemangioblastomas are highly vascular posterior fossa tumors with a well-described propensity for intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage, which elevates baseline bleeding risk compared with many other elective cranial procedures. This intrinsic fragility argues for a conservative stance on adding antithrombotic therapy unless the indication is compelling and the timing is carefully chosen [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the incremental risk of dual therapy. Combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy produces additive hemostatic impairment and increases major bleeding risk in multiple settings; in neurosurgery, even single-agent antithrombotics can worsen hemorrhagic outcomes, so dual therapy compounds that hazard, particularly in the early postoperative window when surgical hemostasis is tenuous [^f647b996] [^a9650853].

> I need to check the timing data for post-craniotomy anticoagulation. A recent institutional case series found that early therapeutic anticoagulation within 48 hours of cranial surgery markedly increased catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage, with risk declining as initiation was delayed; specifically, initiation within 48 hours carried an OR of 8.9 for catastrophic ICH, and intra-axial surgery further amplified risk, which is directly relevant to posterior fossa hemangioblastoma resections [^5a0c0f3d]. Hold on, I should verify whether concurrent antiplatelet use modified this risk; the study reported concurrent antiplatelet medication was not independently associated with catastrophic ICH, but that does not establish safety of deliberate dual therapy and should not be overinterpreted [^5a0c0f3d].

> Next, I should review broader neurosurgical timing guidance. A systematic review and meta-analysis of post-craniotomy anticoagulation suggests that starting anticoagulation before 48 hours is associated with higher odds of ICH, whereas starting at or beyond 48 hours appears safer, particularly in extra-axial procedures; however, the overall evidence quality is low and hemangioblastoma-specific data are absent, so extrapolation must be cautious [^184a937c]. Let me consider whether any high-credibility guidelines speak to this exact scenario; I do not find guidelines that directly endorse dual anticoagulant plus antiplatelet therapy after craniotomy for vascular tumors, reinforcing the absence of supportive evidence [^notfound].

> I will now examine indirect evidence on antiplatelet continuation alone. In elective craniotomy for brain tumors, continuation of aspirin did not increase hemorrhagic complications in a large retrospective cohort, though this does not address the added risk of layering anticoagulation on top of antiplatelet therapy; thus, it cannot be used to justify dual therapy in this setting [^1c5d15c8]. But wait, what if the indication for antiplatelet therapy is a coronary stent? Even then, the neurosurgical literature supports minimizing interruption where possible, yet still does not provide evidence for simultaneous anticoagulation in the early postoperative period after craniotomy [^1c5d15c8].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. If dual therapy is absolutely necessary for compelling indications such as mechanical heart valve, recent venous thromboembolism, or high-risk atrial fibrillation, I would avoid initiation within 48 hours and, whenever feasible, delay to postoperative day 5–7 after obtaining a stable postoperative MRI documenting no unexpected hematoma, using mechanical prophylaxis in the interim; if dual therapy must be started earlier due to thrombotic urgency, I would favor starting the anticoagulant first at 48–72 hours while holding the antiplatelet agent, then adding the antiplatelet drug only after 5–7 days and only if imaging is reassuring, with close neurologic monitoring and a low threshold for repeat imaging [^5a0c0f3d] [^184a937c]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with general craniotomy VTE prophylaxis principles; yes, early mechanical prophylaxis and delayed pharmacologic prophylaxis are standard, which supports delaying anticoagulation when bleeding risk is high [^06ff756f].

> I should double-check reversal and rescue strategies in case bleeding occurs. For warfarin, rapid reversal with PCC and vitamin K is established; for dabigatran, idarucizumab provides immediate reversal; for factor Xa inhibitors, andexanet alfa is available in many centers, though data are strongest in non-neurosurgical populations; for antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion may be considered selectively, but evidence in intracerebral hemorrhage is mixed and PATCH suggested harm in spontaneous ICH, so I would reserve transfusion for active, life-threatening bleeding with careful multidisciplinary judgment [^172ede17] [^41731678] [^195c4b10].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and state the uncertainty clearly. There is no direct evidence establishing the safety of combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy after craniotomy for hemangioblastoma, and available neurosurgical data indicate that early anticoagulation increases hemorrhagic risk, particularly within 48 hours and in intra-axial procedures. Therefore, dual therapy should generally be avoided in the early postoperative period unless the thrombotic indication is compelling and unavoidable, in which case a staged, delayed, and image-guided approach with close monitoring is the most defensible strategy [^5a0c0f3d] [^184a937c].

---

It is **generally unsafe** to use both anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy after craniotomy for hemangioblastoma because of the high risk of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage [^5a0c0f3d]. If dual therapy is absolutely necessary, it should be delayed until at least 7–10 days after surgery, only after a postoperative MRI confirms no hemorrhage, and with close neurologic and imaging surveillance. Dual therapy is **not recommended** in the early postoperative period (within 48 hours) due to the high risk of catastrophic hemorrhage [^5a0c0f3d].

## Risks associated with combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy

Combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy **significantly increases the risk of bleeding** by independently impairing coagulation and platelet aggregation, leading to additive effects [^f647b996]. In neurosurgery, this translates into a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage, which can be catastrophic [^5a0c0f3d].

---

## Evidence from neurosurgical literature

Several studies and reviews highlight the **increased risk of hemorrhagic complications** when anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies are combined in the perioperative period:

- A systematic review and meta-analysis on anticoagulation therapy following intracranial surgery reported an intracranial hemorrhage rate of 7.96% within 30 days of initiating anticoagulation, with higher risks when anticoagulation was started within 48 hours postoperatively [^184a937c].
- A recent institutional case series found that early therapeutic anticoagulation (≤ 7 days postoperatively) was associated with a 9.9% incidence of catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage, particularly when initiated within 48 hours of surgery [^5a0c0f3d].
- The risk of hemorrhagic complications is further amplified when antiplatelet agents are combined with anticoagulants, as both independently contribute to bleeding risk [^f647b996].

---

## Specific considerations for hemangioblastoma

Hemangioblastomas are highly vascular tumors with a **significant risk of intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage**. This inherent vascularity, coupled with the extensive surgical manipulation required, further increases the risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, the threshold for initiating anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy postoperatively should be significantly higher in these patients.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus recommend **individualized risk assessment** when considering anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period. The decision to initiate or resume these therapies should balance the risk of thromboembolic events against the risk of hemorrhagic complications [^d2aff5c8] [^eb336d03]. For patients undergoing craniotomy for hemangioblastoma, the following recommendations are generally advised:

- **Avoidance of dual therapy**: Combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should generally be avoided in the immediate postoperative period (within 48 hours) due to the high risk of catastrophic hemorrhage [^5a0c0f3d].
- **Delayed initiation**: If dual therapy is absolutely necessary, it should be delayed until at least 7–10 days postoperatively, and only after obtaining a postoperative MRI confirming the absence of hemorrhage.
- **Close monitoring**: Patients receiving dual therapy should be closely monitored neurologically, with regular imaging studies to detect any signs of hemorrhage early.
- **Individualized assessment**: The decision to initiate dual therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's thromboembolic risk, surgical factors, and overall clinical condition [^d2aff5c8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Immediate postoperative period (≤ 48 hours) | Avoid combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy |
| Early postoperative period (3–7 days) | Generally avoid dual therapy unless absolutely necessary |
| Late postoperative period (≥ 7–10 days) | Consider dual therapy only if absolutely necessary, after MRI confirmation of no hemorrhage, and with close monitoring |
| Ongoing management | Regular neurological assessments and imaging studies |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In summary, it is **generally unsafe** to use both anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy immediately after craniotomy for hemangioblastoma due to the high risk of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage. If dual therapy is deemed absolutely necessary, it should be delayed until at least 7–10 days postoperatively, only after confirming the absence of hemorrhage on MRI, and with close neurological and imaging surveillance. The decision should be individualized, balancing thromboembolic risk against hemorrhagic complications.

In our study, the intracerebral hemorrhage as an indication for surgery was the only factor negatively influencing the risk of postoperative hemorrhage (OR = 2.82 [1.06–7.53], p 0.04).

This finding underscores the importance of individualized patient assessments and suggests that blanket discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy may not be adequate. The decision to continue or interrupt the antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy should be tailored, considering the type of surgery and the patient's overall health status. Indeed, A systematic interruption of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs or a resumption long after surgery may be unnecessary or even harmful to the patient. Moreover, it may not influence the risk of hemorrhagic events, which could occur regardless of the intake of these drugs. However, our findings showing a non-significant trends in hemorrhagic complications, should be always weighed up on the limitations of the study. Due to the limited sample size, we were unable to stratify results between anticoagulant and antiplatelet groups. Indeed, both types of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, but anticoagulants typically pose a higher risk of major bleeding events compared to antiplatelet drugs. This could represent a potential reason for non-significant trends in hemorrhagic complications, in addition to the patients’ heterogeneity.

### The risks, timing and safety of anticoagulation therapy following intracranial surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^184a937c]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The timing, safety, and efficacy of prophylactic anticoagulation following craniotomy are well established in the literature. However, anticoagulation therapy (ACT) remains a controversial topic, and the literature on the subject is extremely scarce, preventing robust conclusions about its risks and safety. Our study aims to identify the risks and the best time to start ACT following intracranial surgery. A systematic review was conducted using Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases. The primary outcome was intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Secondary outcomes were mortality and surgical reintervention. Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio 2024.09.0+375. Sensitivity analysis was performed using subgroup analysis, and leave-one-out test. The risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Of 800 potential articles, seven met our inclusion criteria, encompassing a total of 304 patients. The mean age was 56 years and 46% of the patients were male. The main reasons for intracranial surgery were intracranial tumor (48%) and vascular surgery (18%). Intra-axial surgery and starting ACT before the first 48 h were factors associated with higher odds of ICH. The mean interval between the start of ACT and surgery was 5 days, and the mean time from initiation of ACT to ICH was 6.8 days. The ICH rate due to ACT use was 7.96% (95% CI 1.90%-16.86%) between 0 and 30 days after surgery, 11.61% (95% CI 0.98%-29.09%) between 0 and 10 days, and 9.15% (95% CI 3.03%-17.47%) between 10 and 30 days. The mortality rate due to ICH secondary to ACT was 0.70% (95% CI 0.00%-3.22%). The surgical reintervention rate due to ICH secondary to ACT was 1.06% (95% CI 0.00%-5.36%). Our results suggest that the risk of ICH and mortality due to early ACT (<10 days) following intracranial surgery might be overestimated, and this management could be a viable strategy, especially if started 48 h after surgery and in patients who have undergone extra-axial surgery. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the various limitations that may impact these observations, and controlled prospective studies are needed to provide more robust conclusions. Clinical trial number: Not applicable.

Suggestions for future research

Despite its limitations, this study provides useful insight into the prevalence, timing, and risk factors of postoperative VTE and ICH after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors. The results of the current study demonstrate that there is still room for improvement, especially with regard to the prevention of PE after hospitalization. The distinct critical time periods for both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events suggest a potentially safe and effective role for continuing prophylactic anticoagulation post-discharge in high-risk patients. Additionally, the typical patient at risk for developing a VTE during hospitalization is not the same as the typical patient at risk for developing a VTE post-discharge. This is crucial for tailoring post-discharge management to the risk profile of the individual patient and suggests an important direction for future research. Therefore, future research should study the effects of timing of thromboprophylactic therapy, screening for asymptomatic events, and the effects of patient education on the occurrence of VTE and/or ICH. Additionally, future studies should construct prediction models for DVT, PE, and ICH and examine the effectiveness of tailoring postoperative thromboprophylaxis to the individual risk profile of patients undergoing craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors.

### Concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy: indications, controversies and practical advice [^f647b996]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

The use of combination antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is commonly encountered in clinical practice and is often a source of clinical controversy in regards to the efficacy versus the safety of this regimen. The benefit of combination therapy relates to the probable additive effect of suppressing both platelet and coagulation factor activities. The risk of dual therapy is the potential for increased hemorrhagic events which may outweigh the clinical benefit. This review will focus on the clinical evidence that has demonstrated greater efficacy with combination therapy over either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone. Clinicians should consider the importance of documentation of combination therapy use in their patients in an effort to target those patients with the greatest benefit, and to avoid unnecessary complications.

### Venous thromboembolism and intracranial hemorrhage after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors: a national surgical quality improvement program analysis [^0ef0ff28]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines recommend that prophylactic use of low-molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin should be considered in all cancer patients undergoing major surgery. In patients undergoing operations for brain tumors, however, the benefits of anticoagulation should be carefully balanced against the risk of ICH. Although most guidelines support the use of pharmacological prophylaxis in patients with brain tumors, proper timing of prophylaxis remains controversial and the use of anticoagulation often depends on the surgeon’s preference. Recommendations vary between administration throughout hospitalization, up to 7–10 days after surgery, until the patient is mobile, or timing based on the individual risk profile. A lack of scientific evidence is primarily the cause of this variation in recommendations. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumors have been performed [,–]. These analyses have compared different VTE prophylaxis modalities, as well as their safety and cost effectiveness, but they do not thoroughly investigate the efficacy of prophylaxis over time to determine a recommended duration. Only one clinical trial studied the effect of continued prophylaxis up to 12 months after surgery. No significant association was found between prolonged prophylaxis and the rate of both VTE and ICH; however, the trial was stopped early because of expiration of study medication, and the control group received placebo instead of short-term prophylaxis. Many patients may not need or benefit from continuing thromboprophylactic therapy beyond discharge. Algattas et al. reviewed the safety and effectiveness of thromboprophylactic strategies and indicated that different regimens may have different efficacies depending on the patient’s VTE risk profile. This highlights the importance of using the appropriate risk profile for optimizing postoperative management.

Since the NSQIP data does not contain information on thromboprophylactic strategies, the current study provides limited insight into the efficacy or safety of prophylactic anticoagulation and insufficient evidence to change the current clinical practice of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing operations for primary malignant brain tumors. Therefore, we concur with the current guidelines that recommend pharmaceutic prophylaxis (low-molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin) in combination with mechanical prophylaxis (anti-embolism stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression devices) postoperatively until the end of hospitalization or until the patient is mobile. Absolute contra-indications for these include recent ICH or another active major bleeding [–,,,,].

### Long-term antithrombotic therapy and risk of intracranial haemorrhage from cerebral cavernous malformations: a population-based cohort study, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^21d8b779]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Table 1 
Baseline characteristics of adults in the prospective population-based cohort study, stratified by use of antithrombotic therapy

We followed up the 300 adults with a CCM who were alive at initial presentation for the primary outcome of intracranial haemorrhage or focal neurological deficit definitely related to CCM until Mar 7, 2019, for a mean duration of 11·6 years (SD 5·0) until first outcome or censoring (total 3634 person-years of 3843 potential person-years, for an overall median completeness of 95%, IQR 94–99).All intracranial haemorrhages were intracerebral. The mean duration of antithrombotic therapy use during follow-up was 7·4 years (SD 5·4). One patient using antiplatelet therapy since CCM diagnosis developed the primary outcome while still taking antiplatelet therapy (one [2%] of 61 antithrombotic therapy users during 706 person-years of follow-up), which was less frequent than in patients not using antithrombotic therapy (29 [12%] of 239 during 2208 person-years of follow-up; log-rank p=0·011; figure 1). After confirming the proportional hazards assumption (appendix p 4) and adjusting for age, type of presentation, and CCM location, use of antithrombotic therapy was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome (adjusted HR 0·12, 95% CI 0·02–0·88; p=0·037; table 2). Post-hoc sensitivity analyses revealed similar, but non-significant associations between antithrombotic therapy and the primary outcome when antithrombotic therapy was a time-dependent covariate (adjusted HR 0·30, 95% CI 0·04–2·32; p=0·25), when the cohort was restricted to brainstem CCMs (adjusted HR 0·16, 0·02–1·28; p=0·084; appendix p 5), when the cohort was restricted to patients presenting with intracranial haemorrhage (adjusted HR 0·41, 0·05–3·21; p=0·40; appendix p 6), when the cohort was restricted to the 29 patients who started antithrombotic therapy after first presentation (unadjusted HR 0·04, 95% CI 0·00–4·87; p=0·189; appendix p 7), when the cohort was restricted to the 228 patients without a brainstem CCM or intracranial haemorrhage at presentation (unadjusted HR 0·033, 0·00–34·94, p=0·34), and when analysing the potential competing risks of death and CCM treatment as outcomes (adjusted HR 0·59, 0·33–1·03; p=0·061; appendix p 8). We were unable to do sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome according to the type of antithrombotic therapy because no patients using anticoagulant therapy had the primary outcome. In analyses of the secondary outcome of intracranial haemorrhage alone (in which one patient, who had not used antithrombotic therapy before developing a focal neurological deficit [primary outcome], used antithrombotic therapy afterwards and was analysed accordingly for the secondary outcome), there was no significant association between antithrombotic therapy use and a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage (one [2%] of 62 patients during 726 person-years of follow-up vs 18 [8%] of 238 during 2342 person-years of follow-up; log-rank p=0·070; appendix p 8–9).

### Sellar and parasellar tumor removal without discontinuing antithrombotic therapy [^d168cacc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Object

Treatment with dual antiplatelet agents associated with coronary stenting procedures and long-term anticoagulant therapy is increasingly common, but the treatment carries risks during surgical procedures. Evidence-based recommendations have proposed discontinuation of antithrombotic treatment or introduction of bridging therapy in some procedures less invasive and with lower risk of bleeding. However, neurosurgical procedures without discontinuation of antithrombotic treatment and perioperative management have received little investigation.

Methods

Between October 2008 and January 2014, 15 consecutive patients (11 males and 4 females; age range 51-75 years [mean 68.2 years]), with sellar and parasellar tumors were treated through the transsphenoidal approach without discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy. Clinical data were compared with another 15 patients, who underwent transsphenoidal surgeries without preoperative antithrombotic therapy.

Results

Gross-total removal of the tumor or total aspiration of the content of Rathke's cleft cyst was achieved in 13 patients, and subtotal removal was achieved in 1 patient with a small remnant in the cavernous sinus. No difference was found in intraoperative bleeding between the antithrombotic agent group and the control group (mean 255 ml vs 215 ml, Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.547), and no patient required transfusion. No difference was found in operation time between the antithrombotic agent group and the control group (167.8 minutes vs 150.0 minutes, Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.262). All patients were discharged on postoperative Day 12 without neurological deficits.

Conclusions

The present study suggests that discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy may be unnecessary before the typical transsphenoidal surgery. Large randomized clinical trials at multiple centers are needed to confirm these findings.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^4f518e0b]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Post-procedure resumption of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy—timing and risk categorization are described as variable, ranging from 24 hours to 72 hours for warfarin and 24-48 hours for all the remaining drugs. For warfarin, despite recommendations to avoid the bridging, low molecular heparin may be started after the surgery after 24 hours for low bleed risk and 48-72 hours for high bleed risk procedures. For interventional techniques, similar patterns are utilized using minor surgery as low-risk and major surgery as moderate or intermediate and high-risk.

Characteristics of Studies Included

Quantitative Synthesis and

Of the 316 records identified in the systematic review, 15 were selected as potentially relevant studies, of which 9 met our inclusion criteria in the meta‐analysis. A total of 2709 patients were included in the meta‐analysis. Of these, 2321 (85.6%) did not use antithrombotic therapy, and 388 (14.4%) used antithrombotic therapy. Patients who did not use antithrombotic therapy experienced 399 intracranial hemorrhages during 29 920 person‐years. On the other hand, 14 patients had intracranial hemorrhages among those who used antithrombotic therapy during 2714 person‐years. A meta‐analysis was done to compare the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. A statistically significant difference was found in terms of age (mean difference, 16.19 [95% CI, 13.45–18.93]; P <0.001), male sex (OR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.35–2.22]; P <0.01), ischemic heart disease (OR, 21.48 [95% CI, 11.08–41.65]; P <0.01), transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke (OR, 22.79 [95% CI, 11.9–43.63]; P <0.01), atrial fibrillation (OR, 11.24 [95% CI, 4.74–26.62]; P <0.01), and hypertension (OR, 9.01 [95% CI, 6.05–13.4]; P <0.01) (Figure S1).

Regarding specific circumstances for epistaxis, more specifically with respect to patients on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, AAO-HNS 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate first-line treatments before transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications in patients using these medications, in the absence of life-threatening bleeding.

Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article.

Literature Search

This study was prepared in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines.A systematic search was performed on August 22, 2023, using the PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Web of Science, and Scopus databases from inception to present. The following Boolean search terms: aspirin OR ' acetylsalicylic acid OR ASA OR antiplatelet OR anti‐platelet agents OR platelet aggregation inhibitors OR antithrombotic agents OR thrombosis prevention OR anticoagulant agents OR blood thinners OR anticoagulant OR antithrombotic) AND (cerebral cavernous malformation OR CCM OR cavernoma OR cerebral cavernous angioma) were used to identify the most relevant studies describing antithrombotics and CCMs. Only publications on human subjects and those published or professionally translated to the English language were included.

Because of the study design, no institutional review board approval or patients' informed consents were obtained.

Study Selection Process

After completion of the search in 3 databases, the results were screened against title and abstract by 2 reviewers according to prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Points of disagreement were resolved by consultation with a third author until consensus among the 3 authors was reached. Full texts were then screened to determine suitability for final inclusion. References of all included studies were searched to identify any additional studies that may have been missed during initial screening for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were studies published in English between the dates of inception of each database and August 2023 and studies comparing patients using antithrombotic medications (antiplatelets or anticoagulants) to those who are not. Cadaveric, animal, in vitro studies, case reports and case series consisting of <10 patients were excluded.

Data Extraction

The variables extracted from each study included sample size, age, sex, study design, period of inclusion, comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke, hypertension), atrial fibrillation, family history of CCM, presentation with intracranial hemorrhage, multiple CCM, brainstem CCM location, and intracranial hemorrhage during follow‐up and person‐years follow‐up.

Patients were prescribed an antithrombotic before the diagnosis of CCM due to other indications (cardiovascular, hematological, etc) with the exception of the study by Zuurbier et al,where 29 patients were started on antithrombotic upon CCM diagnosis. Our primary end points were patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhage and those who had intracranial hemorrhage during follow‐up.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^a841cfd0]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Restart following surgical intervention of tICrH

tICrH also frequently requires emergent surgical intervention. These patients are already at elevated risk of hematoma expansion as well as subsequent thromboembolic complications.The decision to perform neurosurgical interventions may further alter the subsequent risk profile of recurrent hemorrhage for anticoagulated tICrH. With regard to pre-injury treatment, anticoagulation increases the risks of surgical intervention. In the near term, pre-injury anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment was not associated with acute, postoperative hemorrhage in a retrospective study of 143 neurosurgical (craniotomy and craniectomy) patients.VKA relative to DOAC, antiplatelets or controls has been associated with greater reversal agent use, hematoma expansion and mortality, but unrelated to the need for surgical intervention.Another study demonstrated that DOAC treatment pre-injury was associated with greater likelihood of neurosurgical intervention.However, a larger study of chronic SDH evacuation demonstrated that cases on preoperative anticoagulation therapy were more likely to experience major hemorrhage during follow-up (OR=1.93, p=0.014), and the time to occurrence of either hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications was shorter.

With regard to reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy, the use of DOAC therapy or heparin has been recommended over VKA,based on evidence of lower risk of ICrH in non-bleeding populations. There is a real scarcity of evidence for any relationship between surgical treatment for tICrH and the decision to restart anticoagulation. Here as well, selection bias is an obvious concern with any retrospective, observational research into the question of restart. This may partly explain associations found between reinitiation and reduced risk of hemorrhage in unadjusted analyses.In cases with elevated risk of thromboembolic events, reinitiation as early as 3 days postinjury has also been suggested.However, the overall strategy for how to manage anticoagulant-associated ICrH after surgery is unclear.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^c19aedc3]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy—initial and follow-up head CT considerations—The use of anticoagulant therapy further complicates recommendations for brain imaging. For this group of patients, the incidence of intracranial bleeding is likely higher, and a more liberal use of early initial brain CT scanning is warranted. While many patients will have no injury, it is impossible to differentiate between patients with and without an intracranial injury without head CT imaging. The recommendations for follow up imaging of patients on anticoagulant therapy are even less evidence based, and no published prospective, randomized controlled trials address this issue. Several factors, including the presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on the initial CT, the type of pre-injury anticoagulant/antiplatelet agent used, and degree of drug-induced coagulopathy, are important elements to consider when making the decision to perform repeat head CT in this cohort of patients.

### Successful management of post-tumor resection middle cerebral artery thrombosis with stent-assisted angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy: case report [^14ef6ff1]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

To describe successful endoluminal revascularization of an acute M1 occlusion 4 days after craniotomy and tumor resection.

Clinical Presentation

A 16-year-old right-handed girl presented with a 1-month history of daily headaches. The neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography demonstrated a mass consistent with an epidermoid tumor compressing the left upper pons, left cerebral peduncle, and mesial left temporal lobe.

Intervention

A combination of low-dose antiplatelet agents administered intra-arterially and stent-assisted angioplasty was used. Successful endoluminal revascularization was achieved. Acute complications such as intracranial stent-thrombosis and/or intracranial hemorrhage were successfully avoided.

Conclusion

In the acute postoperative period, most current chemical thrombolytic protocols are contraindicated because of the prohibitive risk of iatrogenic intracranial hemorrhage. With an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the currently available antiplatelet drugs, combined chemical and mechanical thrombolysis may be used in the acute postoperative setting for endoluminal recanalization.

### Clinical outcomes and hemorrhagic or thromboembolic risks in decompressive craniectomy for patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy [^57a5f079]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is an emergency surgical procedure indicated for the immediate reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP) in acute conditions such as major head trauma with brain swelling or contusions, acute subdural hematoma, and intraparenchymal or subarachnoid bleeding.

However, less is known about the specific risks associated with the prior use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. In fact, it remains unclear whether the use of these medications should definitively discourage the procedure due to the potentially high rates of re-bleeding and mortality. The impact of preoperative administration of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications on outcomes and complications in patients undergoing DC is not well understood, and few studies focused on this topic. These drugs are widely used among the elderly for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but data about the perioperative neurosurgical management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy are limited.

Scores such as CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED are used to estimate the risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, thereby guiding therapeutic decisions. These scores have proven to be effective in predicting complication risks during the perioperative period of non-cardiac surgeries ; however, their role and application in the neurosurgical field remain unexplored.

Indeed, neurosurgical patients face a high risk of thromboembolic events like deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. This risk is due to multiple factors, including immobility during and after surgery, use of vasopressors, dehydration, motor deficits, and a hypercoagulable state caused by trauma, malignant tumors or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Moreover, if they are already taking anticoagulants or antiplatelets drugs, we could expect this risk is even higher.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential influence of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs on outcomes and hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy. Our hypothesis is that these drugs do not influence the risk of haemorrhagic events but may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. Additionally, the study will analyze predictive factors such as platelet count, INR values, CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores and patient performance status. We will compare our data with the few findings on this topic in the literature showing no influence of antiplatelets or anticoagulants on the risk for hemorrhagic events. About the management of these drugs and the thromboembolic risk in patients undergoing DC, no published clinical studies are available.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^18623160]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Guideline definitions for recommendation strength: Strong recommendation—anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation—anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent or is unobtainable; clinicians would be prudent to follow but should remain alert to new information and patient preferences. Weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence)—anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms but quality of evidence is weak; clinicians would be prudent to follow but should remain alert to new information and patient preferences. Weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms)—evidence shows benefit and harm of similar magnitude across options; clinicians should consider options in decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^26ee8a6a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Prospective randomized trials

There are several, large clinical trials in preparation or underway which seek to answer questions about restart of anticoagulation treatment following various models of ICrH (see table 1). Most of these trials are focused on answering the question of whether anticoagulation is safe to resume after various types of spontaneous hemorrhage, by comparing anticoagulation with more conservative approaches at varying intervals. These trials and several more investigating antiplatelet therapies have been organized under the Collaboration Of Controlled Randomised trials of Oral Antithrombotic drugs after intraCranial Haemorrhage. The eligibility criteria, intervention arms, time windows after hemorrhage for enrollment, follow-up periods and outcome measures all vary considerably (table 1). However, the primary outcome measure in each instance is a rate based on some composite of secondary clinical events. All studies of spontaneous ICrH employ a usual care or antiplatelet control group.

Table 1 
Ongoing and pending clinical trials of anticoagulation restart after intracranial hemorrhage

One trial (table 1) addresses the question of anticoagulation effectiveness in a mixture of sICrH and tICrH cases (traumatic SDH-only) and one is focused solely on addressing the timing of anticoagulation restart in tICrH (RESTART-tICrH). None specifically exclude neurosurgical intervention.

### Venous thromboembolism and intracranial hemorrhage after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors: a national surgical quality improvement program analysis [^752b002e]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors. In addition to known surgical risk factors, such as venous stasis from perioperative immobility, endothelial injury, and inflammation from the operation itself, cancer is a recognized risk factor for VTE development. Among all cancer types, high-grade gliomas have been shown to result in second highest lifetime risk for cancer-related VTE, one of the highest risks of perioperative VTE and, when comparing craniotomy for any brain tumor to craniotomy for non-neoplastic disease, rates of postoperative VTE have been reported to be twice as high. VTE has been reported as one of the most frequent major complications after craniotomy for brain tumors with incidences up to 21% in the first 3 months after surgery.

Previous studies have identified older age, male sex, Hispanic ethnicity, history of craniotomy, history of VTE, congestive heart failure, coagulopathy, seizures, increased stay on the intensive care unit, prolonged hospital stay, medium bed size, residual tumor tissue, and absence of thromboprophylactic therapy as predictors of VTE after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors [,,,–]. Most of these studies have been small, single-center studies, and none of these studies have identified predictors or performed time-to-event analyses separated for VTE type (DVT vs. PE) and the clinical setting (hospitalized vs. post-discharge patients).

Most patients undergoing surgery for brain tumors receive pharmaceutic prophylaxis in combination with mechanical prophylaxis in the perioperative setting. However, anticoagulation increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is one of the most frequent and feared complications in patients undergoing operations for brain tumors. The increased risk of ICH makes the use of prophylactic anticoagulation an issue of great debate and careful balance in this patient population. Although the incidence of ICH is lower compared to VTE events, their outcomes can be at least as detrimental. Only few predictors associated with ICH have been identified including history of craniotomy, use of bevacizumab, and therapeutic anticoagulation for a VTE [,–]. Adequate assessment of the perioperative risk of both VTE and ICH among this patient population, as well as accurately predicting the typical time to a thrombotic or hemorrhagic event, is meaningful in tailoring postoperative management to the risk profile of the individual patient.

Methods—objectives of the ASIPP guideline: The objectives are to synthesize available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of continuing or discontinuing antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in the perioperative period, describe adverse events of anticoagulant therapy and bleeding complications, and provide evidence-based consensus recommendations for perioperative management in patients undergoing interventional techniques and receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy. The guidelines are designed to prevent thromboembolic risk, estimate bleeding risk, determine timing of anticoagulant cessation, and assess whether to use bridging anticoagulation.

### The impact of perioperative aspirin utilization on postoperative hemorrhagic complications in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a single-center retrospective analysis [^9a29664c]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a reversible neurological condition characterized by gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment, primarily affecting older adults. Its symptoms often overlap with those of neurodegenerative disorders, leading to frequent misdiagnosis. (Hakim-Adams triad—classically described by Salomon Hakim and R. D. Adams in 1965). The pathophysiology of iNPH involves complex cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, where impaired CSF absorption leads to ventricular enlargement without a corresponding increase in CSF pressure. The primary diagnosis still relies on the lumbar tap test, while treatment predominantly involves the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt systems implantations, and risk analysis for surgery decision is essential. Additionally, a smaller subset of patients undergoes endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) procedures.

With aging, the prevalence of diseases requiring antiplatelet therapy, such as cardiovascular diseases, increases. Consequently, many iNPH patients undergoing VP shunt surgery are on anticoagulant therapy, primarily aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA). Current clinical practices often recommend stopping ASA about 5–7 days before elective surgeries to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, this approach is not without risks, particularly thromboembolic events in patients with high cardiovascular risks. Several studies have highlighted the significant thromboembolic risks, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, associated with discontinuing aspirin therapy in high-risk patients.

Recent studies have shown conflicted results regarding the continuation of ASA in neurosurgery. One study demonstrated that aspirin increases the risk of subdural hematoma postoperatively in VP shunt patients in iNBH. Conversely, another study found no significant differences between continuing and discontinuing aspirin in patients undergoing elective craniotomy for brain tumors. Given the lack of consensus and robust data to universally support either perioperative use or discontinuation of anticoagulants, the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes raises essential questions about the necessity of stopping ASA.

Therefore, the continuation or discontinuation of ASA in the perioperative period remains debatable in iNPH. While its use is essential for preventing major cardiovascular events, it is also considered to increase the risk of postoperative hemorrhagic complications. The literature needs decisive studies that determine the impact of ASA on postoperative hemorrhagic complications in iNPH patients undergoing VP shunt surgery. This study aims to bridge this gap by providing empirical evidence on the safety and outcomes of ASA continuation versus discontinuation, potentially influencing clinical decisions and revising perioperative management protocols. Our findings are intended to contribute to a nuanced understanding of managing perioperative antiplatelet therapy, offering evidence that may inform safer clinical practices and influence existing guidelines on ASA management in neurosurgical procedures.

### Emergency reversal of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies in neurosurgical patients [^41731678]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a common problem encountered by neurosurgeons. Patient outcomes are influenced by hematoma size, growth, location, and the timing of evacuation, when indicated. Patients may have abnormal coagulation due to pharmacological anticoagulation or coagulopathy due to underlying systemic disease or blood transfusions. Strategies to reestablish the integrity of the clotting cascade and platelet function assume a familiarity with these processes. As patients are increasingly treated with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, it is essential that the physicians who care for patients with ICH understand these pathways and recognize how they can be manipulated to restore hemostasis.

Of the 180 records identified in the systematic review, we selected eight potentially relevant studies, of which four met our inclusion criteria in our meta-analysis (table 2). Studies were exclusively single-centre, hospital-based, non-randomised cohort studies at moderate to high risk of bias (appendix p 10).,We included these four studies, unpublished data from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA),and the SAIVMs cohort study in a meta-analysis of 1342 patients: 1089 [81%] did not use antithrombotic therapy (152 intracranial haemorrhages occurred during 6214 person-years), 46 [3%] used anticoagulant therapy (one intracranial haemorrhage occurred during 260 person-years), and 207 [15%] used antiplatelet therapy alone (seven intracranial haemorrhages during 1221 person-years; table 3). Baseline imbalances in this larger overall dataset were similar to SAIVMs: patients who used antithrombotic therapy were older, less often women (104 [41%] of 253 vs 603 [55%] of 1089; p<0·0001), and presented less often with intracranial haemorrhage (36 [14%] of 253 vs 316 [29%] 1089; p<0·0001) than patients who did not use antithrombotic therapy. Antithrombotic therapy use was associated with a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage (all of which were intracerebral) from a CCM (eight [3%] of 253 vs 152 [14%] of 1089, IRR 0·25, 95% CI 0·13–0·51; p<0·0001) with no inconsistency between studies (I 2 =0%; figure 2). Of the eight patients using antithrombotic therapy, who had an intracranial haemorrhage during follow-up, one (13%) used anticoagulation and seven (88%) used antiplatelet therapy. In post-hoc sensitivity analyses, we compared patients taking antiplatelet therapy alone with patients not taking antithrombotic therapy (IRR 0·30, 95% CI 0·15–0·62; p=0·0010) and patients taking anticoagulant therapy with patients not taking antithrombotic therapy (IRR 0·53, 0·19–1·52; p=0·24; appendix p 11). Antithrombotic therapy remained associated with a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluding the unpublished Mayo Clinic cohort (IRR 0·16, 0·06–0·42; p=0·00020).

Conclusion

This is the largest study that evaluates 90-day POEs following an elective tumor removal in the pediatric population. POEs are surgically driven; medical ones have little impact in this population. This study strongly suggests that all patients who undergo a craniotomy for tumor removal should be assessed for risk and any measures to mitigate those risks should be undertaken.

Perioperative antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy guidelines—methodology and consensus process are specified as follows: Documents accompanying the guidelines summarize supporting evidence and tie it to recommendations, and IOM standards are used to rate the strength of each recommendation, with NEATS schemes utilized as modified by the ASIPP panel. Recommendations are intended to be specific and unambiguous. The guidelines underwent external peer review by Pain Physician and were posted on ASIPP’s website and newsletter for comments from stakeholders, scientific and clinical experts, organizations, patients, and representation of the public. Update policy states the anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy guidelines will be updated in a window of 5 years by 2028. Consensus development used a modified Delphi technique, with panelists without a primary conflict of interest voting via online survey, and inclusion in the final guidelines required at least 80% agreement among eligible panel members without primary conflict of interest.

### Clinical outcomes and hemorrhagic or thromboembolic risks in decompressive craniectomy for patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy [^0ad41ea3]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that pretreatment with antithrombotic or anticoagulant medication does not necessarily increases the risk of postoperative hemorrhagic events in DC patients. However, the type of surgery and the patient's baseline characteristics play crucial roles in assessing this risk, highlighting the importance of individualized patient assessments. While there is an initial association between antithrombotic therapy and an increased risk of postoperative thromboembolic events, further analysis suggests that surgery-related factors, such as undergoing the procedure due to ischemic stroke, contribute more significantly to this risk. Optimizing perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy is essential to mitigate these risks, with strategies like bridging anticoagulation offering potential solutions. Scores like CHAD2DS2-VASc could be helpful to stratify the patient risk.

### Antithrombotic medication management in GI bleeding (...) [^34c40527]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • Platelet transfusions appear to increase mortality in patients with GI bleeding who are taking antiplatelet agents. • Patients should continue taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular protection in GI bleeding because stopping aspirin does not improve bleeding outcomes and may increase mortality. • Prothrombin complex concentrates do not appear beneficial for GI bleeding related to direct oral anticoagulants but may be beneficial for patients taking warfarin. Antiplatelet Medications When patients who take antiplatelet medications have GI bleeding, platelet transfusions may be harmful. In a small cohort study, patients receiving platelet transfusions had an increased risk of death over patients who did not receive platelet transfusions, with no difference in further bleeding or thrombotic events.

ASPIRIN When patients taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular protection present with GI bleeding, stopping aspirin is not helpful, and it may increase cardiovascular risk. Because aspirin causes permanent platelet inhibition that lasts for at least three days after stoppage, stopping aspirin is unlikely to reduce bleeding. In one small retrospective study, continued bleeding and mortality were similar whether aspirin was stopped or not. If aspirin is stopped for bleeding concerns, restarting aspirin shortly after surgery reduces cardiovascular and gastrointestinal mortality without increasing recurrent bleeding. Because of the little to no benefit of aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention, stopping aspirin in these patients is recommended with any gastrointestinal bleeding. 12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel, evidence is less clear.

From studies of endoscopy for patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, stopping the P2Y 12 inhibitor does not appear to reduce bleeding. Although up to 6% of patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy will have stent thrombosis if the P2Y 12 inhibitor is stopped for 10 days, the risk of stent thrombosis with a stoppage of up to four days appears minimal. Direct Oral Anticoagulants When patients have GI bleeding while taking direct oral anticoagulant medications, prothrombin complex concentrates may not be effective. Evidence is limited to small studies with patients who had GI bleeding while taking dabigatran, where prothrombin complex concentrates did not improve outcomes over conservative care. Fresh frozen plasma appears to be less effective than prothrombin complex concentrates, with possibly higher mortality. Vitamin K is not effective in GI bleeding because the change in international normalized ratio after vitamin K takes at least 24 hours.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^a9650853]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Restoring platelet function

The use of antiplatelet agents has been shown to increase bleeding risks after surgery and trauma and to increase the risk of spontaneous and post-traumatic intracranial bleeding.However, assessing this risk is dependent on actual platelet function. Platelet counts alone demonstrate limited correlation with bleeding risk. The indications for providing agents to restore platelet function in the setting of bleeding risk are controversial.For ASA-induced platelet dysfunction, intravenous desmopressin has been shown to restore activity, though little clinical outcome data are available.The indications for the use of platelet transfusion to reverse the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel and ASA have not been established and clinical data are variable.The half-life of clopidogrel is 6 hours, and thus therapeutic levels should be fairly low after 3–4 half-lives. Transfusion of platelets has been shown to reduce the antiplatelet effect, though the dosing and timing remain unclear.An ongoing multicenter study is currently underway to investigate the utility of platelet transfusion in cerebral hemorrhage, but no results have been published.Currently, to determine if platelet transfusion is indicated, an assessment of platelet function should be undertaken.

Assessing platelet function

Assessing platelet function and its contribution to bleeding risk in elective and emergent settings remains challenging, particularly with the use of aspirin or clopidogrel. Platelet activity comprises 80% of overall clot strength and the remaining 20% is determined by fibrin. As such, overall clot strength is probably best assessed using a whole blood assay rather than serum-based testing of platelet function alone. Moreover, little correlation exists between platelet count and clot strength. Patients can have normal platelet counts with markedly impaired platelet function in conditions such as von Willebrand factor deficiency and uremia. Individual tests are discussed in the sections below and summarized in table 1.

Table 1 
Basic characteristics and interpretation of commonly used assays to assess platelet function

Bleeding time: Although there are many tests to assess platelet function, there is no test that is readily clinically available, prospectively validated, and reliable to guide transfusion strategy or assess risk of bleeding. The bleeding time is one of the oldest tests which aimed to assess platelet function. This test involves incising the skin and blotting the hemorrhage to determine time to clot formation and arrest of bleeding. However, test results are obfuscated by differences in the amount of pressure applied. Furthermore, since the test involves making an incision, it cannot be repeated serially.

Three other studies focus on the immediate postacute period in patients with tICrH. Divito et al retrospectively analyzed 112 patients with tICrH, skewing severe with 29% requiring neurosurgical intervention. Median restart interval was 8 days (range 1–31) (see figure 6).These patients had 88 thromboembolic events: 32 pulmonary emboli (PEs), 44 deep venous thromboses (DVTs), 4 MIs and 2 left ventricular thrombi. To a large extent, the events in Divito drove restart decisions as opposed to starting with a priori secondary prevention in mind, and the population skewed severe with 42% having a Glasgow Coma Score <9.However, the bleeding risk seen is informative. There were no deaths directly attributable to anticoagulation. One patient developed a chronic subdural hygroma that required surgery 2 weeks later, and one patient died of a hemothorax, but the patient was also in septic shock and the family declined further intervention.Byrnes et al used a similar retrospective model in which the thromboembolic event drove anticoagulation, analyzing 42 patients with tICrH who developed DVT, PE or blunt cerebrovascular injury, 26 of which were anticoagulated.Mean start interval was 11.9 days with a broad range with nearly half restarted between 1 and 2 weeks. Byrnes et al did not report on thromboembolic events after initiation of anticoagulation and found only one case of hematoma expansion, 1–2 mm in an intraparenchymal hemorrhage 6 days after restart that did not affect clinical course. Pandya et al studied 97 patients with tICrH, dividing them into SDH and all other tICrH and correlating start of either anticoagulants 36%, antiplatelets (53%) or both (11%).Start of therapy was 8.8±9.7 days. None of the ‘other’ tICrH group had hematoma expansion. Five of the SDH (9.1%) had clinically significant expansion; however, only one of these was on an anticoagulant and one on both antiplatelet and anticoagulant (the others were on only antiplatelet therapy). Finally, there is an analysis that suggests a more aggressive approach to restarting.Hawryluk et al extracted data from 63 case reports and series on 492 anticoagulated patients with central nervous system hemorrhage finding a rebleeding rate of 8% and a thromboembolic event rate of 6%.Temporal mapping (see figure 7) showed most rebleeding events occurred before 72 hours, while most thromboembolic events occurred from 3 days to 1 week, suggesting 3 days would be the ideal restart interval.There are several limitations. The analysis is from the warfarin era, only 6.5% of the cases were traumatic, and it is confounded by heterogeneous case report/series reporting bias.

Results

We collected 59 patients showing postoperative CVST after supratentorial or infratentorial craniotomies. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data regarding the entire population are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 54.3 ± 17.0 years, with a slight prevalence of females (34; 58%). Regarding risk factors, 36 patients (61%) had arterial hypertension, 8 (14%) diabetes, and about a quarter (14; 24%) smoke habits.

Coagulation lab tests and platelets count revealed on average normal values. In the preoperative period, 8 patients (14%) were under antiplatelet medications, and 7 (12%) under anticoagulants. The first category usually withdraws the medications on average 7 days before surgery, whereas the second stopped the anticoagulants at least 3–4 days before surgery until having a renormalization of the lab tests the day before surgery and is subjected to a preoperative prophylactic regimen of low molecular weight heparin.

Most of patients developing a post-surgical CVST underwent craniotomy for meningiomas removal (14; 23.7%) and cerebello-pontine angle schwannomas (10; 16.9%); less often for metastasis (8; 13.6%), traumatic hematomas (7; 11.9%), vascular malformations (6; 10.2%), gliomas (5; 8.5%), and inflammatory conditions (4; 6.8%). Just over half of the patients underwent a supratentorial craniotomy (34; 57.6%), while a trans-sphenoidal approach and a neck surgery were observed in single cases (1.7% respectively). The remaining cases of CVST were reported after infratentorial craniotomies. In particular: 16 patients (27.1%) underwent a surgical procedure on the cerebellar-pontine angle, 6 patients (10.2%) a suboccipital midline craniotomy, and 1 a far-lateral approach for a brainstem lesion.

### Effect of perioperative aspirin use on hemorrhagic complications in elective craniotomy for brain tumors: results of a single-center, retrospective cohort study [^1c5d15c8]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In daily practice, neurosurgeons face increasing numbers of patients using aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA). While many of these patients discontinue ASA 7-10 days prior to elective intracranial surgery, there are limited data to support whether or not perioperative ASA use heightens the risk of hemorrhagic complications. In this study the authors retrospectively evaluated the safety of perioperative ASA use in patients undergoing craniotomy for brain tumors in the largest elective cranial surgery cohort reported to date.

Methods

The authors retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 1291 patients who underwent elective intracranial tumor surgery by a single surgeon from 2007 to 2017. The patients were divided into three groups based on their perioperative ASA status: 1) group 1, no ASA; 2) group 2, stopped ASA (low cardiovascular risk); and 3) group 3, continued ASA (high cardiovascular risk). Data collected included demographic information, perioperative ASA status, tumor characteristics, extent of resection (EOR), operative blood loss, any hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, and any other complications.

Results

A total of 1291 patients underwent 1346 operations. The no-ASA group included 1068 patients (1112 operations), the stopped-ASA group had 104 patients (108 operations), and the continued-ASA group had 119 patients (126 operations). The no-ASA patients were significantly younger (mean age 53.3 years) than those in the stopped- and continued-ASA groups (mean 64.8 and 64.0 years, respectively; p < 0.001). Sex distribution was similar across all groups (p = 0.272). Tumor locations and pathologies were also similar across the groups, except for deep tumors and schwannomas that were relatively less frequent in the continued-ASA group. There were no differences in the EOR between groups. Operative blood loss was not significantly different between the stopped- (186 ml) and continued- (220 ml) ASA groups (p = 0.183). Most importantly, neither hemorrhagic (0.6%, 0.9%, and 0.8%, respectively; p = 0.921) nor thromboembolic (1.3%, 1.9%, and 0.8%; p = 0.779) complication rates were significantly different between the groups, respectively. In addition, the multivariate model revealed no statistically significant predictor of hemorrhagic complications, whereas male sex (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-20.5, p = 0.005) and deep-extraaxial-benign ("skull base") tumors (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.3-9.7, p = 0.011) were found to be independent predictors of thromboembolic complications.

Conclusions

In this cohort, perioperative ASA use was not associated with the increased rate of hemorrhagic complications following intracranial tumor surgery. In patients at high cardiovascular risk, ASA can safely be continued during elective brain tumor surgery to prevent potential life-threatening thromboembolic complications. Randomized clinical trials with larger sample sizes are warranted to achieve a greater statistical power.

### Use of antithrombotic agents in patients with intracerebral cavernous malformations [^75cbe83a]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

The goal of this study was to determine the risk of using antithrombotic agents in patients with established intracerebral cavernous malformations (ICMs).

Methods

From a previously described cohort of 292 patients with radiographically defined ICMs, 40 required an antithrombotic after the ICM was diagnosed. Patients underwent follow-up to determine the incidence of hemorrhage.

Results

The mean age of these 40 patients was 62.4 years; there were 21 male and 19 female patients. Five (12.5%) of the 40 patients initially presented with hemorrhage and 4 (10%) had multiple ICMs. Of these patients, 32 were placed on an antiplatelet agent alone, 6 on an anticoagulant alone, and 2 were placed on both. In patients necessitating any antithrombotic agent, 1 patient developed a prospective hemorrhage over the 258 person-years of follow-up (prospective hemorrhage rate 0.41% per person-year).

Conclusions

Antithrombotics likely do not precipitate hemorrhage in patients with known ICMs. However, caution should be exercised in the use of antithrombotics in patients with ICMs at high risk for hemorrhage. The risks and benefits of antithrombotics in each situation should be carefully weighed against the natural history of ICM.

### Application of recombinant activated factor VII during surgery for a giant skull base hemangiopericytoma to achieve safe hemostasis. case report [^2b855eeb]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

The authors report on a 64-year-old woman with a huge recurrent skull base hemangiopericytoma, in whom they encountered severe difficulty in attaining intraoperative hemostasis. Standard surgical hemostatic methods and the administration of fresh-frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates failed to stop diffuse bleeding from an inoperable tumor remnant. At a critical point during the operation, the intravenous administration of recombinant activated factor VII, combined with mechanical compression, finally led to satisfactory hemostasis. The rationale for using recombinant activated factor VII in situations of uncontrolled bleeding during neurosurgical procedures is discussed, along with the literature in which the use of recombinant activated factor VII as a maneuver of last resort is reported for hemostasis in other surgical fields.

### Influence of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug use on outcomes after chronic subdural hematoma drainage [^195c4b10]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There are significant variations in perioperative management of antithrombotics in patients with CSDH treated in the UK and Ireland. This may reflect an individualized approach to risk assessment, but may also result from the lack of robust evidence to guide practice. An approach favoring early surgery and early post-operative recommencement on antithrombotics may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusive complications without increasing the risk of CSDH recurrence.

Previous systematic reviews, and a meta-analysishave yielded inconsistent conclusions regarding the risk of CSDH recurrence after an operation in patients on an antithrombotic medication at CSDH diagnosis. These inconsistencies may stem from the differing study design of CSDH studies., In our secondary analysis of this large cohort, we found no discernible difference in recurrence risk among those on previous antithrombotic drugs. A longer washout period of antiplatelet before an operation did not provide observable benefits. This may be because the full recovery of platelet function takes around 4 days and 10 days after cessation of aspirin and clopidogrel, respectively,which is longer than the interval to surgery in most patients in this study. Our data indicate that modest increase in the washout period does not confer an advantage in terms of reducing post-operative bleed recurrence. In the absence of strong evidence for delayed surgery for patients on antiplatelet drugs, early surgery may be appropriate to minimize time in hospital and time without antiplatelet drugs.

Platelet transfusion may aid in preventing or reducing bleeding from subdural veins during surgery that later presents as recurrent CSDH, although the actual mechanism of CSDH recurrence after surgery is not known. We found no compelling benefit for the use of platelet transfusion in patients on pre-operative antiplatelet medications. Although there is no clinical trial examining the effect of platelet transfusion in CSDH patients, a recent randomized trial on the use of platelet transfusion in spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy (PATCH) found worse functional outcome and serious adverse effects in patients receiving platelet transfusion.This finding may not be directly applicable to CSDH patients given that the pathophysiology of the two conditions are different. In our data, patients receiving a platelet transfusion had a shorter time between stopping antiplatelet drug and surgery. The longer time to surgery in the no-platelet group may have had the effect of allowing native platelet function to further recover, explaining the lack of observed benefit of a platelet transfusion in terms of symptomatic CSDH recurrence. Evidence for the use of platelet transfusion needs to be clarified by understanding the pathological processes in CSDH as well as further large observational studies.

### Venous thromboembolism and intracranial hemorrhage after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors: a national surgical quality improvement program analysis [^7470c017]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Risk factors identified for VTE after craniotomy for gliomas are older age, history of craniotomy, history of VTE, coagulopathy, seizures, increased stay on the intensive care unit, prolonged hospital stay, residual tumor tissue, and absence of thromboprophylactic therapy [,,,–]. Missios et al. stratified for VTE type demonstrating different risk profiles for postoperative DVT and PE. Male gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and medium bed size were predictive for PE, whereas chronic heart failure was predictive for DVT. Other predictors of postoperative VTE identified in the broader group of brain tumor patients were higher BMI, hypertension, functional dependence, lower Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, motor deficits, ventilator dependence, steroid usage, preoperative sepsis, longer operative times, and higher World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grade.

Prophylactic anticoagulation is a commonly used strategy to prevent VTE but should be carefully balanced against the risk of ICH. In previous studies, the rates of ICH following craniotomy for brain tumors is cited as 1.0–4.0% with a follow-up ranging between the initial hospital stay and long-term survival after surgery [,–,,–]. However, definitions for major ICH varied between volumetric measurement of the hematoma, presence of symptoms, decrease in hemoglobin, or need for surgical evacuation of hematoma.

Mantia et al. assessed the cumulative incidence of ICH over time after craniotomy for glioma. However, no time-to-event analysis was provided for the direct postoperative period due to a low sample size. Neither did this study stratify for the clinical setting of the patient. Risk factors associated with ICH were history of craniotomy, use of bevacizumab, and therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE [,–]. The association between thromboprophylactic anticoagulation and ICH remains to be elucidated.

### Management of surgical patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents [^6b573978]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Temporary interruption of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during surgical procedures exposes patients to thrombotic risk. Continuation of these agents, however, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Managing anticoagulation can be a particular challenge in the emergency setting.

Methods

A literature review of published articles sourced using the keywords heparin, warfarin, perioperative, antiplatelet, aspirin and surgery was undertaken. A management plan for all likely situations was developed.

Results and Conclusion

Based on an individual assessment of risk factors for arterial or venous thromboembolism and the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is possible to form an anticoagulant and antiplatelet management plan likely to achieve a low incidence of bleeding and thrombosis. A multidisciplinary approach is desirable.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^a7d7fbb0]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

For decades, aspirin and warfarin have been the predominant antiplatelet and anticoagulant alternatives. Beginning with the introduction of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel in 2002, several more potent oral antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant agents have been approved for use. The increase in the number of therapeutic agents and the population at risk requires that surgeons have an understanding of the risks and benefits of reversing these agents in various settings and an understanding of the most appropriate methods for doing so. In part one of this practice management overview (in the prior issue of the journal), warfarin and the urgent reversal of warfarin-induced coagulopathy were reviewed and an overview of the newer direct oral anticoagulant agents was provided. Part two, contained herein, addresses the management of antiplatelet agents in the surgical setting, followed by general recommendations for the management of anticoagulated patients in the perioperative setting.

### Clinical outcomes and hemorrhagic or thromboembolic risks in decompressive craniectomy for patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy [^8dc5a892]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic-anticoagulant therapy and thromboembolic events

On the other hand, data showed 15.3% of strokes and 3.5% of acute myocardial infarction, which are higher and statistically significant (p < 0.001) in the AAPT group (27.7% vs 9.3% and 10.6% vs 0.0%). Therefore, ischemic complications are more frequent than hemorrhagic ones in general population, and the risk is particularly higher in the AAPT group. However, in multivariate analysis, this data is not confirmed, and the only factor that increases the risk is stroke as a cause of intervention. Indeed, if we evaluate the mean CHAD2DS2-VASc score, it is noted that for the AAPT group, it is 4.0 (vs 1.0 in the NT population), which represents a moderate risk for thromboembolic events. Therefore, in patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy for stroke, a careful assessment of thromboembolic risk factors should be performed, including the evaluation of the CHAD2DS2-VASc score, and early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy should be considered in moderate/high risk categories.

If it has been observed that the hemorrhagic risk does not seem to be increased by the use of these drugs, our data show that patients who used them before surgery have a moderate risk for thromboembolic events (see Fig. 1). For this reason, in these patients, discontinuation may not always be necessary, but at least an early resumption after surgery would be highly recommended.

### Perioperative management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in elective neurosurgery patients: a narrative review [^99344126]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications are widely prescribed to the general population for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes in a wide range of diseases, mainly of cardiovascular interest, spanning from acute events such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), strokes, and thromboembolic disorders to chronic conditions like atrial fibrillation (AF) and peripheral vascular diseases. The management of such therapies is expected to escalate over time due to the aging population, which has a growing need for these medications, and the rising demand for surgical procedures. The management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets still represents a tough challenge for clinicians in elective neurosurgical procedures, where the balance between preventing thromboembolic events and an increased bleeding risk plays a crucial role in all phases of the perioperative setting. Managing antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in elective neurosurgery is complex and requires a tailored and multidisciplinary approach. Careful assessment of patient factors, surgery type, and potential risks and benefits is essential. POC testing can be valuable in optimizing therapy management and bleeding risk assessment. This narrative review for clinicians aims to provide an updated overview of the management of these drugs in the perioperative setting of elective neurosurgical procedures. We explored coagulation abnormalities commonly found in neurosurgical patients, the pharmacological profile of each class of drugs, the appropriate management according to the type of procedure (brain or spinal), and the available diagnostic tests, focusing on the application of point-of-care (POC) coagulation testing.

### Antiplatelet medications and risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with metastatic brain tumors [^11bda324]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The incidence of any ICH among patients with brain tumors is high but does not seem to be influenced by the administration of anticoagulants. Similar data on the safety of aspirin in patients with brain metastases are lacking. In this matched cohort study of nearly 400 patients with blinded radiology review of ICH, the administration of antiplatelet therapy was not associated with an increase in the incidence, size, or severity of ICH in the setting of brain metastases.

A small but definitive risk for ICH has been identified with the use of antiplatelet agents for the prevention and treatment of ischemic disease.A meta-analysis of >300 000 patients over 8 years estimated an ICH risk of 0.2 per 1000 patient-years.Aspirin use has been associated with larger ICH volume and worse outcomes.There is a paucity of data on the effect that antiplatelet agents have on bleeding in patients with cancer, specifically intracranial malignancy. In a series of patients with cancer and ICH over 7 years, 10% of the 208 patients received antiplatelet agents at the time of the bleed.In the current study, we did not detect a significant increase in the risk of ICH among patients with brain tumors who received aspirin, although this study was underpowered to detect the very small absolute differences described in cohorts of patients without cancer. Based on the point estimates of major ICH observed in the current cohort study, a study on a population scale would be required to conclude that there are not small differences in risk; however, such an analysis would be constrained by ICH assessment limitations, such as the inability to perform a central blinded radiologic review.

### Venous thromboembolism and intracranial hemorrhage after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors: a national surgical quality improvement program analysis [^c69c70ae]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, the current study is the first large multicenter assessment including a descriptive time-to-event analysis for both VTE and ICH within 30 days after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors. Additionally, it is the first study that uses the NSQIP database to identify predictors of ICH after brain tumor resection. By addressing thrombotic outcomes as well as hemorrhagic outcomes, this study provides a meaningful direction for future research on thromboprophylactic treatment strategies. Lastly, the large sample size allows a stratification of both the descriptive and inferential analysis, demonstrating differences in risk profile and incidence over time based on VTE type (DVT vs. PE) and clinical setting (hospitalized vs. post-discharge patients).

Limitations

Complication rates found in the current study can be conservative estimates if events were not reported back to the hospitals. VTEs were only coded as events if they were diagnosed and treated, thereby missing asymptomatic and undetected VTEs. The database additionally lacks several demographic variables identified in other studies as predictors. Tumor specific information (histology, size, location, residual tumor volume) and complication specific information (location and classification of DVT, PE, and ICH) was not available. However, both VTE and ICH were defined in the NSQIP database as complications requiring medical and surgical treatment, respectively, resulting in selection of the most clinically relevant events. Perhaps most importantly, no data is available regarding anticoagulation status and non-pharmaceutical prophylactic methods. Therefore, this study offers limited insight in the efficacy of different thromboprophylactic treatment strategies and their association with the occurrence of ICH. Selection bias can be introduced since institutions can selectively contribute patients to the NSQIP registry. There was a lower number of events due to separate analyses based on VTE type and clinical setting; however, our study was not underpowered for most outcome measures according to rule of 10 events per variable in the multivariable analysis. Lastly, VTE and ICH events after the 30-day time period established in NSQIP are not accounted for in this study, although studies have demonstrated that the risk of VTE events remains non-negligible beyond 30 days postoperatively with incidences up to 26% in the first 12 months postoperatively. Despite these limitations, this study provides useful insight into the rates, timing, and predictors of DVT, PE, and ICH after craniotomy for primary malignant brain tumors. Due to the multicenter nature of the NSQIP dataset, the results of this study may be more representative of typical management at all hospitals, including but not limited to tertiary care academic centers.

### Clinical practice for antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in neurosurgery: data from an Italian survey and summary of current recommendations-part I, antiplatelet therapy [^d99f9ac2]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of antiplatelet medication is widespread as reducing risk of death, myocardial infarction, and occlusive stroke. Currently, the management of neurosurgical patients receiving this type of therapy continues to be a problem of special importance. In this paper, we present the results of an Italian survey focused on the management neurosurgical patient under antiplatelet therapy and, for any item of the investigation, the relative advices coming from literature. This survey was conducted including 129 neurosurgery units in Italy. The present paper was designed by following each question posed in the survey by a brief discussion on literature data. There is a considerable lack of consensus regarding management of antiplatelet therapy in neurosurgery, with critical impact on patient's treatment. What is clearly evident from the present survey is the considerable variability in neurosurgical care for antiplatelet patients; it is reasonable to assume that this scenario reflects the paucity of evidence regarding this issue.

### Perioperative continuation or ultra-early resumption of antithrombotics in elective neurosurgical cranial procedures [^0ba8ad74]. Neurosurgical Focus (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Discontinuation of antithrombotics (AT) prior to elective cranial procedures is common practice, despite the higher risk of thromboembolic complications in these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the risks and benefits of a new perioperative management protocol of continuation or ultra-early AT resumption in elective cranial procedures.

Methods

This study was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients undergoing elective cranial surgery with (AT group) and without (control group) AT. For extraaxial or shunt surgeries, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was continued perioperatively. For intraaxial pathologies, ASA was discontinued 2 days before surgery and resumed on postoperative day 3. All other AT were discontinued according to their pharmacokinetics, and resumed on postoperative day 3 after unremarkable postoperative imaging. Additionally, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of patients with AT who underwent surgery before implementation of this new AT management protocol (historical AT group). Primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications within 3 months after surgery.

Results

Outcomes of 312 patients were analyzed (83 [27%] in the AT group, 106 [34%] in the control group, and 123 [39%] in the historical AT group). For all 3 patient groups, the most common type of surgery was craniotomy for intraaxial tumors (14 [17%] in the AT group, 28 [26%] in the control group, and 60 [49%] in the historical AT group). The most commonly used AT were ASA (38 [46%] in the AT group and 78 [63%] in the historical AT group), followed by non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (32 [39%] in the AT group and 18 [15%] in the historical AT group). The total perioperative discontinuation time in the AT group was significantly shorter than in the historical AT group (median of 4 vs 16 days; p < 0.001). The rate of hemorrhagic complications was 4% (95% CI 1-10) (n = 3/83) in the AT group, 6% (95% CI 2-12) (n = 6/106) in the control group, and 7% (95% CI 3-13) (n = 9/123) in the historical AT group (p = 0.5). The rate of thromboembolic complications was 5% (95% CI 1-12) (n = 4/82) in the AT group, 8% (95% CI 3-15) (n = 8/104) in the control group, and 7% (95% CI 3-13) (n = 8/120) in the historical AT group (p = 0.7).

Conclusions

The presented perioperative management protocol of continuation or ultra-early resumption of AT in elective cranial procedures does not seem to increase the hemorrhagic risk. Moreover, it appears to potentially protect patients from thromboembolic complications.

### Risk assessment of early therapeutic anticoagulation following cranial surgery: an institutional case series [^5a0c0f3d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Postoperative thrombotic complications represent a unique challenge in cranial neurosurgery as primary treatment involves therapeutic anticoagulation. The decision to initiate therapy and its timing is nuanced, as surgeons must balance the risk of catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). With limited existing evidence to guide management, current practice patterns are subjective and inconsistent. The authors assessed their experience with early therapeutic anticoagulation (≤ 7 days postoperatively) initiation for thrombotic complications in neurosurgical patients undergoing cranial surgery to better understand the risks of catastrophic ICH.

Methods

Adult patients treated with early therapeutic anticoagulation following cranial surgery were considered. Anticoagulation indications were restricted to thrombotic or thromboembolic complications. Records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, surgical details, and anticoagulation therapy start. The primary outcome was the incidence of catastrophic ICH, defined as ICH resulting in reoperation or death within 30 days of anticoagulation initiation. As a secondary outcome, post-anticoagulation cranial imaging was reviewed for new or worsening acute blood products. Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare cohorts. Cumulative outcome analyses were performed for primary and secondary outcomes according to anticoagulation start time.

Results

Seventy-one patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Anticoagulation commenced on mean postoperative day (POD) 4.3 (SD 2.2). Catastrophic ICH was observed in 7 patients (9.9%) and was associated with earlier anticoagulation initiation (p = 0.02). Of patients with catastrophic ICH, 6 (85.7%) had intra-axial exploration during their index surgery. Patients with intra-axial exploration were more likely to experience a catastrophic ICH postoperatively compared to those with extra-axial exploration alone (OR 8.5, p = 0.04). Of the 58 patients with postoperative imaging, 15 (25.9%) experienced new or worsening blood products. Catastrophic ICH was 9 times more likely with anticoagulation initiation within 48 hours of surgery (OR 8.9, p = 0.01). The cumulative catastrophic ICH risk decreased with delay in initiation of anticoagulation, from 21.1% on POD 2 to 9.9% on POD 7. Concurrent antiplatelet medication was not associated with either outcome measure.

Conclusions

The incidence of catastrophic ICH was significantly increased when anticoagulation was initiated within 48 hours of cranial surgery. Patients undergoing intra-axial exploration during their index surgery were at higher risk of a catastrophic ICH.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^15e0e6ef]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

An increasing number of potent antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications are being used for the long-term management of cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular conditions. Management of these medications in the perioperative and peri-injury settings can be challenging for surgeons, mandating an understanding of these agents and the risks and benefits of various management strategies. In this two part review, agents commonly encountered by surgeons in the perioperative and peri-injury settings are discussed and management strategies for patients on long-term antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy reviewed. In part one, we review warfarin and the new direct oral anticoagulants. In part two, we review antiplatelet agents and assessment of platelet function and the perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy.

Therefore, based on currently available evidence, in the 2019 updated international clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE in cancer patients, the use of heparin commenced postoperatively for the prevention of VTE in patients with cancer and undergoing neurosurgery is recommended; primary pharmacological prophylaxis is not recommended for patients with brain tumors not undergoing neurosurgery. This is consistent with the clinical guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis where no pharmacological prophylaxis is recommended for outpatients with brain tumors. The European Society of Anesthesiology recommends for patients undergoing craniotomy with a high risk of VTE including malignancy, the initiation of mechanical thromboprophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression preoperatively in addition to heparin postoperatively as soon as the bleeding risk is decreased; the thromboprophylaxis is recommended to be continued until discharge.

In the case of a VTE event, more-recently-updated guidelines for treating VTE in cancer patients already include the data from randomized controlled studies comparing heparin and direct oral anticoagulants, with the general consensus that anticoagulation should be established with low molecular weight heparin. Anticoagulation should be given for 6 months. Thereafter an individual evaluation should be carried out for each patient including the risk–benefit ratio and tumor activity. Limited data regarding anticoagulation in patients with primary brain tumors leads to uncertainty with regard to which therapy is best for each patient. Current guidelines give support in the treatment of VTE in cancer patients but rarely offer recommendations, especially for brain tumor patients. The American Society of Clinical Oncology states in its recently-published guidelines that in patients with primary brain tumors and VTE, anticoagulation should be offered, but uncertainty remains regarding the choice of agent and patients most likely to benefit. Furthermore, limited safety data is available for the use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with primary brain tumors.

In 2019, the international clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE in cancer patients recommended anticoagulation for established VTE in patients with primary brain tumors with LMWH or direct oral anticoagulants (grade 2B).

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^cf983169]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Repeat head CT in anticoagulant/antiplatelet users—data for platelet inhibitors alone (aspirin, clopidogrel) are contradictory; in a prospective observational study of 265 patients with ICH on initial head CT, both aspirin and clopidogrel were independent predictors of mortality and neurosurgical intervention, and clopidogrel had higher odds of worse outcomes compared with aspirin; thus, it is prudent to have a liberal policy of repeat head CT imaging for patients who have an initial positive head CT scan, and in patients with a negative initial head CT scan and no other reason for hospital admission, a second head CT scan in 4-8 hours is prudent, whereas if admitted for other reasons with serial mental status assessment, repeat head CT imaging may not be necessary; overall, the available evidence suggests that patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents with a normal INR and platelet count may not require repeat CT after a normal initial head CT scan, while those with supratherapeutic INR or thrombocytopenia may benefit from repeat CT.

### Influence of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug use on outcomes after chronic subdural hematoma drainage [^bc9e4609]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition in the older population. The use of antithrombotic drugs, either antiplatelets or anticoagulants, has increased in the past decade.Approximately 40% of patients with CSDH are taking an antithrombotic drug at the time of presentation. A large, population-based case-control study has demonstrated an association between increasing antithrombotic drug use and increasing incidence of CSDH.Perioperative management of antithrombotic drugs is therefore an important aspect for these patients.

Uncertainties remain over the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy owing to limited robust data on this patient group. The therapeutic effect of commonly used vitamin K antagonists can be rapidly reversed. The same is not true of some direct oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs) nor of antiplatelet medication. A recent national guideline provides recommendations for perioperative management of anticoagulation and -platelet therapy, but management requires assessment of individualized bleeding risks.The optimal timing of recommencing either anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs is not known.Inconsistent conclusions were reached in several systematic reviews that evaluated hematoma recurrence risk in CSDH patients on antithrombotic drugs after surgical drainage. Importantly, few studies have investigated the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with CSDH. These uncertainties make clinical decision about antithrombotic drugs difficult.

We aimed to describe current UK practice in management of antithrombotic drugs perioperatively in patients with CSDH with the intent of informing future practice. We investigate the influence of antithrombotic drugs, including antiplatelets and -coagulants, on the risk of recurrence, thromboembolic events, and on unfavorable functional outcome.

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^40a43111]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Management

There are several uncertainties in the management of AICH. These uncertainties include the lack of evidence and limited guidelines for using biological products and pharmacologic agents, and accurate, quick, and meaningful laboratory testing to evaluate the hemostatic system. Moreover, individual variation in response to therapy and the difficulty in assessing ongoing bleeding make it even more challenging to manage this clinical problem. One should also note that the mere correction of a laboratory parameter (that is, an ex vivo test) might not correlate with reversal of coagulopathy in vivo as often demonstrated by the expansion of AICH even after such correction. Given the emergent nature of AICH and their unpredictability, randomized clinical trials or even large cohort studies in this population are unlikely and recommendations regarding treatment strategies will continue to be based on case series and anecdotal experience.

### Clinical outcomes and hemorrhagic or thromboembolic risks in decompressive craniectomy for patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy [^a8b3634e]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evaluation of the risk associated with a previous therapy with antithrombotic/anticoagulant therapy in the context of decompressive craniectomy presents a complex interplay of potential benefits and risks. This study analyzed the influence of this therapy on postoperative hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, alongside the overall patient outcomes at one and six months.

Our findings suggest that a systematic discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy before decompressive craniectomy may not be necessary in all patients, and early resumption should be strongly considered to mitigate thromboembolic risk.

Antithrombotic therapy and postoperative hemorrhagic events

Surgeons are usually very concerned about the risk of hemorrhagic complications during and after surgery in patients taking anticoagulant or antithrombotic medications. The complexity of this issue is demonstrated by the absence of univocal data. On one hand, our data and recent evidence suggest that the use of these drugs was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative hemorrhagic events in patients undergoing DC; on the other hand data by Schuss et al. showed that antiplatelet therapy significantly increased this risk.

In the present study, while a numerical increase in hemorrhagic complications was observed in the antithrombotic group (20.0% vs. 11.3%), this did not reach statistical significance. The confidence interval suggests that a larger cohort may be needed to fully determine whether a clinically meaningful difference exists.

Neither at the univariate nor multivariate analysis, statistically significant difference was found in postoperative bleeding incidence.

Indeed, a systematic review by Angelini et al. showed no significant increase in rebleeding incidents among patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies compared to those not on such treatments​.

Han et al. reported that preoperative antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic complications in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) undergoing DC. Therefore, antiplatelet therapy should not delay time of surgical intervention.

Song et al. conducted a study with similar findings, emphasizing that preoperative antiplatelet therapy did not have a statistically significant increase in rebleeding after treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage.

On the other hand, Schuss et al. found that antiplatelet therapy significantly increased the risk of postoperative bleeding complications in stroke patients undergoing DC, but not intravenous thrombolytic therapy. They hypothesized ASA might influence pharmacokinetics and might enable possible drug interactions.

Appendix Table 2—reports of bleeding complications and epidural hematoma after discontinuation of antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy during interventional procedures—includes spinal cord stimulation cases detailing hemorrhagic events with warfarin and clopidogrel. In one case, warfarin management involved that “warfarin was stopped prior to surgery and changed to low molecular weight heparin for 9 days,” with “INR was 0.95 and spinal cord stimulator leads were positioned successfully at C1-C5 level in the epidural space,” after which “An MRI showed a large epidural hematoma” and “Following this, he underwent hemi-laminectomy at T2-T6,” with the conclusion that “This case report shows bridging therapy has not helped.” In a separate case involving “Clopidogrel (Plavix),” “This is a case report in a 49-year-old male patient for placement of spinal cord stimulation trial leads for chest pain. Leads were attempted to be placed at L1-L2 with Tuohy needle under live fluoroscopic guidance contacting the L2 lamina with loss of resistance technique to the air,” followed by “Subarachnoid puncture was noted with clear fluid flowing freely from the Tuohy needle. The needle was withdrawn into the epidural space and a spinal lead advanced to mid C7,” and subsequently “His CT scan of the head showed a large subdural hematoma. Neurosurgical consultation was carried out and the patient underwent emergency craniotomy,” with later history that “on the postoperative day 3 patient recalled falling at home one day prior to the spinal cord stimulator implant, striking his head without loss of consciousness,” and conclusions emphasizing “there is need for careful follow-up of patients with a known post dural tear” and that “Failure to identify uncommon adverse events in patients with complicated spinal cord stimulator implantation may lead to permanent injury.”

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^7f676cfe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical equipoise in treatment timing after tICrH, and therefore uncertainty in best course of action, is distributed within the range of current guidelines. Restarting oral anticoagulants after most cases tICrH appears to be supported by broad clinical consensus, but clinical equipoise still exists for the timing, although most clinicians and experts surveyed state they prefer to restart in the first month after injury. The demonstrated existence of competing risks for hemorrhage and thrombosis suggests that there is an optimal timing that can be identified within the time windows offered by current consensus. It is also likely that this timing varies by individual cases’ presentation and risk factors. Many of the observational studies described in this review excluded cases with contraindications for anticoagulation such as hematoma expansion on follow-up imaging. Ongoing and planned clinical trials will shed more light on these important clinical questions. The results of these clinical trials offer unique insights, based on the differences in sample criteria and timing of interventions offered.

Prehospital provider assessment of the use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications in older adults with head trauma is important. These patients are at increased risk for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and therefore field triage guidelines recommend transporting these patients to centers capable of rapid evaluation and treatment. Our objective was to evaluate EMS ascertainment of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication use in older adults with head trauma. 10– 12 Accuracy of medication history in patients with preinjury anticoagulant or antiplatelet use and head trauma is crucial. Clinicians who are unaware that their patient is taking one of these medications may not obtain appropriate diagnostic imaging. The results of our study demonstrated two key findings. First, preinjury use of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication in older adults with head trauma was common – ED and hospital providers recorded that over 28% of patients were taking these medications.

Second, only EMS medication ascertainment for preinjury warfarin use had an acceptable level of agreement with ED and hospital providers. Medication ascertainment for DOAC, aspirin, and other antiplatelet agent use had kappa statistics less than 0.
60. Our results suggest that prehospital medication ascertainment is better in patients with preinjury warfarin use than in patients with preinjury aspirin or other antiplatelet agents use. This may be due to EMS providers having greater awareness of the bleeding issues from warfarin and being more vigilant in identifying preinjury warfarin use than antiplatelet agents. Many head injury guidelines highlight the risk of intracranial bleeding in patients with warfarin use but they do not consider antiplatelet agents an indication for cranial imaging. Preinjury clopidogrel use in the setting of blunt head trauma, however, has been shown to have a higher risk for tICH than preinjury warfarin use.

13, 15, 16 The higher level of agreement with warfarin compared to aspirin or other antiplatelet agents may also be due to patients reporting warfarin use to prehospital providers more accurately than reporting antiplatelet use. The use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications in older adults with blunt head trauma and transported by EMS is common. EMS and ED/hospital providers have acceptable agreement with when assessing for a patient’s use of warfarin but not with DOAC, aspirin, and other antiplatelet agent use.

Materials and methods

A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted. All patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy between November 2021 and May 2023 were enrolled.

Data were collected anonymously. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Prot. 842/2023 I.5/1).

We collected the following data: age, sex, diagnosis leading to surgery (traumatic brain injury (TBI) without acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), TBI with ASDH, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke; additional diagnoses, whether they were the cause of the procedure or complementary to one of the main indications were collected separately in a single category), intracranial pressure (ICP), use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets both preoperatively (acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), others antiplatelets, Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), Novel Oral AntiCoagulants (NOAC), heparin, antiplatelet + anticoagulant, Dual AntiPlatlet Therapy (DAPT)) and postoperatively (heparin for DVT prophylaxis or ASA) and their management, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk factors, CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, comorbidities and Charlson Comorbidities Index (CCI), tobacco and alcohol abuse, postoperative hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, length of stay in the intensive care unit, pre and post operative Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pre and post operative laboratory exams, 1 and 6 months post operative Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).

In patients treated with antithrombotic therapy before surgery, we recorded whether they discontinued the drugs, the duration between suspension and surgery, and the time from surgery to the resumption of therapy. Additionally, perioperative treatment with anticoagulant antagonists, such as platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K, was evaluated.

Post-operative radiological follow-up with CT scans was conducted to identify any complications. For hemorrhagic complications (bleedings in the surgical field), events occurring within 30 days after surgery were considered. We documented the time elapsed between surgery and the complication, and, in cases where antithrombotic therapy was resumed, the time between the hemorrhagic event and the resumption of therapy. Thromboembolic complications were categorized into three main types: stroke, myocardial infarction, and others. Additionally, the time elapsed from the discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy to the onset of the thromboembolic event was documented. The patient's coagulation status was analyzed preoperatively and immediately postoperatively using INR.

### Clinical outcomes and hemorrhagic or thromboembolic risks in decompressive craniectomy for patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy [^712f7411]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The number of patients enrolled, even if higher than similar studies, remains limited. Moreover, different type of baseline diagnosis (trauma, stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage) were considered together. Indeed, this could influence the final clinical outcome or complications (DC in trauma or stroke is usually a last line of therapy and brain injury could be already very diffuse; intracerebral hemorrhage has been shown to be the only factor increasing the hemorrhagic risk).

Due to the limited number of patients a sub-analysis per type of medication (ASA, NOAC, Vitamin k antagonist, ecc ecc) was not possible. A sub-analysis of the type of antithrombotic therapy (e.g. aspirin, NOACs, or dual therapy) and specific patient characteristics (e.g. age, baseline diagnosis) would provide more actionable insights.

Due to the lack of practical guidelines about the management of these kind of drugs in patients undergoing DC, we did not apply any standard protocol. We were only able to collect time of suspension and resumption of the drugs.

To minimize this bias, we could employ several strategies, such as blinding outcome assessors to the treatment groups to reduce assessment bias. Evaluation of outcome, hemorrhagic, or thromboembolic events could be performed by a blinded assessor. Another strategy to reduce bias could be standardizing treatment protocols across all participating centers. This included uniform guidelines for the suspension and resumption of antithrombotic drugs and postoperative care.

While sensitivity analyses were not conducted, the multivariate models were built using clinically relevant variables, and overfitting was minimized.

Regarding the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, at multivariate analysis there was no significant influence on thromboembolic or hemorrhagic risk. For this reason, the identification of a proper threshold for clinical decision guidance was not possible. We believe that this identification could be very useful and we plan to keep on collecting more data about these scores in order to try to identify possible threshold values.

Finally, while outcome assessors were not blinded to the treatment groups, objective criteria were used for defining haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications to minimise bias.

### Restarting and timing of oral anticoagulation after traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: a review and summary of ongoing and planned prospective randomized clinical trials [^94b99ff1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (tICrH) is a devastating injury with high morbidity and mortality. For survivors, treating clinicians face the dilemma of restarting oral anticoagulation with scarce evidence to guide them. Thromboembolic risk is high from the bleeding event, patients’ high baseline risks, that is, the pre-existing indication for anticoagulation, and the risk of immobility after the bleeding episode. This must be balanced with potentially devastating hematoma expansion or new hemorrhagic lesions. Retrospective evidence and expert opinion support restarting oral anticoagulants in most patients with tICrH, but timing is uncertain. Researchers have failed to make clear distinctions between tICrH and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICrH), which have differing natural histories. While both appear to benefit from restarting, sICrH has a higher rebleeding risk and similar or lower thrombotic risk. Clinical equipoise on restarting is also divergent. In sICrH, equipoise is centered on whether to restart. In tICrH, it is centered on when. Several prospective randomized clinical trials are ongoing or about to start to examine the risk–benefit of restarting. Most of them are restricted to patients with sICrH, with antiplatelet control groups. Most are also restricted to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), as they are associated with a lower overall risk of ICrH. There is some overlap with tICrH via subdural hematoma, and one trial is specific to restart timing with DOACs in only traumatic cases. This is a narrative review of the current evidence for restarting anticoagulation and restart timing after tICrH along with a summary of the ongoing and planned clinical trials.

### Bleeding of a familial cerebral cavernous malformation after prophylactic anticoagulation therapy. case report [^94f12eec]. Neurosurgical Focus (2006). Low credibility.

The risk of hemorrhage in cavernous malformations (CMs) depends on lesion, host, and environmental factors. Anticoagulation therapy is a well-known risk factor for intracerebral bleeding, but the occurrence of hemorrhages in patients with CMs has not been reported. Low molecular weight heparin therapy is generally considered to be safe, although significant hemorrhagic complications have recently been reported. The authors report a case of intralesional bleeding in a CM after prophylactic anticoagulation therapy was administered in a patient with the familial form of the disease. The leaky endothelial structure of CMs may constitute an unexpected target of the vascular effects of heparin.

### Post-operative segmental cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: risk factors, clinical implications, and therapeutic considerations [^d60d7b9b]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Apra et al. used therapeutic enoxaparin in a majority of patients with lateral CVST finding a statistically significant elevated risk of post-surgical complications compared with patients without anticoagulation (p = 0.020).

Moore et al. reported a successful management of postoperative CVST in 5 patients using intravenous heparin transitioned to warfarin for 6 months with low risk of hemorrhagic complications.

However, despite it all, concerns about the risk of catastrophic hemorrhages in postoperative period are rampant in surgeons’ minds. Abou-Al-Shaar et al. for example denounced severe hemorrhagic complications attributable to enoxaparin in the immediate postoperative period for treatment of CVST. This has led most of the authors to recently review their therapeutic attitude towards this nosological entity. For instance, Orlev et al. reported a large institutional series along with a literature review regarding transverse/sigmoid sinus thrombosis following suboccipital craniectomy showing a higher rate of early complications; however, most of them resolved without anticoagulation, therefore suggesting to manage these patients conservatively in order to avoid additional hemorrhagic risks.

Similarly, Brahimaj et al. reported a unusually higher incidence of CVST after vestibular schwannoma surgery compared with other similar series, but they did not observe any symptomatic patient despite none was treated with anticoagulation. According to their evidence, they did not suggest a routinely use of dedicated vascular imaging such as CT or MR venograms with possible time-of-flight sequences to better delineate the presence of a sinus thrombosis.

However, it is important to note that some of the imaging modalities and in particular the contrast-enhanced MRI, are unable to delineate if the thrombi are flow limiting. A thrombus causing total occlusion versus a flow limiting thrombus may have different clinical consequences.

Therefore, at present, due to the limited data regarding the natural history of post-operative CVST and the absence of guidelines, the rational for treatment and the choice of medications are leaved to the experience of the surgeon. The majority agrees regarding a hydration and hemodilution in the post-operative period and reserving the medications to those patients who had a sinus violation during surgery which required suturing repair. Also, the addition of the aspirin to the anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin has been proposed by some authors with limited risk.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients who received IMBRUVICA. Major hemorrhage (≥ Grade 3, serious, or any central nervous system events; e.g., intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) occurred in 4.2% of patients, with fatalities occurring in 0.4% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA in 27 clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade including bruising and petechiae occurred in 39%, and excluding bruising and petechiae occurred in 23% of patients who received IMBRUVICA, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.

Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major hemorrhage. Across clinical trials, 3.1% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy experienced major hemorrhage. The addition of antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulant therapy increased this percentage to 4.4%, and the addition of anticoagulant therapy with or without antiplatelet therapy increased this percentage to 6.1%. Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)].

5.2 Infections

Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 21% of 1,476 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] . Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately.
