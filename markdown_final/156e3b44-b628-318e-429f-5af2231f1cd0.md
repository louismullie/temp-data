## Question

SCAD management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why SCAD differs from atherosclerotic ACS. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and angiographic classification. Next, I will examine the evidence for conservative versus invasive management and define clear indications for revascularization. After that, I need to review pharmacotherapy nuances, including antiplatelet strategies, beta-blockers, statins, and ACEi/ARBs. Finally, I should consider special populations, long-term surveillance, and practical implementation, while continuously checking the strength and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and epidemiology, because management hinges on these fundamentals. SCAD is a non-atherosclerotic separation of the coronary arterial wall with intramural hematoma compressing the true lumen, most often in young to middle-aged women, and it accounts for a substantial share of MI in women under 50 years old, with associations to fibromuscular dysplasia, pregnancy/postpartum, and extreme physical or emotional stressors, which explains why standard atherosclerotic ACS protocols often misfit this entity [^acbac3a2] [^03955940] [^5434cf89].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before discussing treatment. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard, with the Yip-Saw classification (types 1–3) helping recognize patterns, though angiographic typing does not itself dictate therapy or predict outcomes; intracoronary imaging (OCT or IVUS) is reserved for ambiguous cases or when PCI is contemplated, because it can clarify true versus false lumen and guide stent sizing, but it carries a risk of iatrogenic propagation and should be used judiciously [^8e7bf643] [^9320ed6b] [^bba43142].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about revascularization. I need to check the comparative outcomes data. Multiple observational series and meta-analyses consistently show no mortality advantage to routine PCI over conservative therapy, with PCI plagued by high technical failure (about 35–53%) and complications such as hematoma propagation, iatrogenic dissection, and the need for urgent CABG; importantly, most SCAD lesions heal spontaneously within weeks to months, and long-term outcomes appear similar between strategies when patients are appropriately selected, supporting a conservative-first approach when safe [^bcad32b4] [^643c56ce] [^a95738ba] [^b0f1f5bf].

> I should confirm the indications for revascularization, because missing high-risk features would be unsafe. Revascularization is indicated for ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, left main disease, or proximal LAD with TIMI 0–1 flow threatening a large myocardial territory; in STEMI-SCAD, primary PCI can be lifesaving when indicated, and contemporary series suggest reasonable success when performed by experienced operators, though complication rates remain higher than in atherosclerotic STEMI [^a6d99800] [^1235bbe6] [^51226e2d].

> Let me think about PCI technique, because if we must intervene, we should minimize harm. Gentle wiring with avoidance of false lumen, hand injections rather than power injectors, conservative balloon sizing, and long stents to cover the entire diseased segment are recommended; some operators prefer femoral access to reduce iatrogenic dissection risk, though this remains debated and radial-first teams can still succeed with meticulous technique; when possible, balloon-only restoration of flow without stenting is attractive to avoid long-segment metal, but this requires careful case selection and operator judgment [^ddf4c176] [^3b9b2696] [^a6d99800].

> Next, I should review pharmacotherapy in conservatively managed patients, and I need to be cautious because evidence is limited. Beta-blockers are the most consistently supported therapy, with observational data associating their use with lower recurrence; mechanistically, they reduce shear stress and catecholamine surge, which aligns with SCAD pathophysiology, so I should prioritize beta-blockade unless contraindicated [^d18ab230] [^5434cf89]. For antiplatelet therapy, I initially thought dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) might be beneficial early on, but wait, let me verify; the DISCO registry showed higher 12-month MACE with DAPT versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) in conservatively managed SCAD, so I should favor SAPT with low-dose aspirin, reserving DAPT for stented patients or compelling indications, and even then prefer clopidogrel over potent P2Y12 inhibitors to mitigate bleeding risk [^f9c067e4] [^e2c43c70]. Statins are not routine unless there is concomitant atherosclerosis or dyslipidemia, given the non-atherosclerotic nature of SCAD; ACE inhibitors or ARBs are reasonable for LV dysfunction or hypertension, but not universally indicated otherwise [^d6cf1c64] [^e2c43c70].

> I should double-check special populations and high-risk phenotypes. Pregnancy and postpartum SCAD carry higher in-hospital complication rates and warrant extended monitoring; left main SCAD is rare but high risk, with pooled data suggesting early revascularization reduces a composite of death, shock, recurrent MI, and urgent revascularization; in cardiogenic shock, mechanical circulatory support may serve as a bridge to recovery or revascularization when both conservative care and immediate PCI are unsafe or infeasible [^032661cc] [^042a5946] [^c4115669] [^17c61bc6].

> Let me consider long-term surveillance and recurrence prevention, because this shapes outpatient care. Recurrent SCAD occurs in roughly 10–20% over several years, often in a different vessel, and hypertension is a consistent risk factor; thus, strict blood pressure control, aerobic exercise with avoidance of heavy isometrics, stress management, and screening for extracoronary arteriopathies such as fibromuscular dysplasia are recommended; cardiac rehabilitation improves quality of life and may reduce events, and many patients benefit from psychosocial support given high rates of anxiety and depression after SCAD [^5434cf89] [^331cf15a] [^ec7fb236].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with chest pain again soon after discharge? I need to ensure I don't overcall recurrent SCAD. Early chest pain is common and often non-ischemic; late propagation within the first days to weeks can occur, whereas true de novo recurrences typically happen after months and involve new segments; repeat angiography should be reserved for objective ischemia or clinical deterioration, and noninvasive testing can help triage low-risk symptoms [^17b59b67] [^94acdb3d].

> I should confirm practical implementation details to close the loop. Centers should develop SCAD-aware protocols, train cath lab teams to recognize angiographic patterns, and coordinate multidisciplinary care including interventional cardiology, vascular medicine, maternal-fetal medicine, genetics, and behavioral health; patient education on triggers, contraception, and safe return to activity is essential, and participation in registries advances evidence and supports quality improvement [^41f5dc63] [^679a10c9].

> In summary, I need to ensure the management algorithm is explicit: if the patient is stable with preserved TIMI flow and no high-risk features, conservative management with beta-blocker and SAPT is preferred; if unstable or high risk, proceed to PCI or CABG using SCAD-specific techniques; throughout, minimize intracoronary manipulation, tailor pharmacotherapy to SCAD pathophysiology, and commit to structured follow-up and risk modification, recognizing that most lesions heal spontaneously and that our best evidence remains observational and consensus-based pending randomized trials [^a95738ba] [^a6d99800] [^bcad32b4].

---

SCAD management centers on **conservative therapy first** [^a95738ba] for stable patients with preserved flow, using beta-blockers [^d18ab230], single antiplatelet therapy [^f9c067e4], and risk-factor control, as most dissections heal spontaneously [^b0f1f5bf]. Revascularization is reserved for **ongoing ischemia**, hemodynamic instability, left main disease, or large myocardial territory at risk [^a6d99800] [^60138345], given higher PCI complication rates and similar long-term outcomes between strategies [^bcad32b4] [^a986970e]. Dual antiplatelet therapy is used only if stents are placed [^e2c43c70]; statins are not routine unless atherosclerosis is present [^d6cf1c64]. Cardiac rehabilitation and screening for fibromuscular dysplasia are recommended [^5434cf89], and recurrence risk is ~10–20% at 3–5 years, mitigated by beta-blockers and blood pressure control [^5434cf89] [^d18ab230].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical suspicion**: High index in young women with ACS and minimal risk factors [^03955940] [^acbac3a2].
- **Coronary angiography**: Gold standard; classify SCAD using Yip-Saw types 1–3 [^8e7bf643] [^af2300b2].
- **Intracoronary imaging**: OCT or IVUS when diagnosis is uncertain or to guide PCI [^9320ed6b] [^3b9b2696].
- **Extracoronary screening**: Evaluate for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and other arteriopathies [^5434cf89] [^d201eb29].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** for stable patients with preserved coronary flow (TIMI 2–3) and no ongoing ischemia [^a95738ba] [^8e573279].

| **Component** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Antiplatelet therapy | Single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with low-dose aspirin is preferred [^f9c067e4]; dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is reserved for stented patients [^e2c43c70] |
| Beta-blockers | Recommended for all patients to reduce recurrence risk and shear stress [^d18ab230] [^5434cf89] |
| Statins | Not routine unless atherosclerosis or dyslipidemia is present [^d6cf1c64] [^e2c43c70] |
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | Use if LV dysfunction or hypertension is present [^d6cf1c64] [^e2c43c70] |
| Heparin | Use cautiously; discontinue early due to risk of intramural hematoma propagation [^d6cf1c64] [^5dfa7d42] |

---

## Indications for revascularization

Revascularization is indicated for **high-risk features**:

- **Ongoing ischemia**: Persistent chest pain or ischemia despite medical therapy [^a6d99800] [^60138345].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest [^a6d99800] [^8e7bf643].
- **High-risk anatomy**: Left main dissection, proximal LAD with TIMI 0–1 flow, or large myocardial territory at risk [^a6d99800] [^8e7bf643].
- **Failure of conservative management**: Progressive dissection or recurrent ischemia [^8e7bf643] [^3815d80f].

---

## Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

PCI is the **preferred revascularization method** when indicated, but it carries higher complication rates in SCAD:

- **Technical challenges**: High rates of iatrogenic dissection, hematoma propagation, and stent malapposition [^fbf92e17] [^3b9b2696].
- **Procedural success**: Lower than in atherosclerotic ACS, especially in type 2 SCAD or long lesions [^fbf92e17] [^51226e2d].
- **Techniques**: Use gentle wiring, hand injections, long stents to cover the entire dissection, and intracoronary imaging to guide therapy [^ddf4c176] [^3b9b2696].

---

## Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

CABG is reserved for **left main dissection**, multivessel disease unsuitable for PCI, or failed PCI [^d6a11cb1] [^ddf4c176]. Graft patency may be limited by spontaneous healing of the native vessel, leading to competitive flow and occlusion [^71a66aa3] [^ddf4c176].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

- **Cardiac rehabilitation**: Strongly recommended to improve quality of life and reduce recurrence [^e2c43c70] [^5dfa7d42].
- **Screening for FMD**: Repeat imaging at 3–6 months; if negative, no further routine screening is needed [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Blood pressure control, stress management, and avoidance of extreme physical exertion [^331cf15a] [^5dfa7d42].
- **Pregnancy counseling**: Avoidance of estrogen-containing contraceptives; multidisciplinary care if pregnancy is planned [^331cf15a] [^5dfa7d42].

---

## Recurrence and prognosis

Recurrence occurs in **10–20% at 3–5 years**, typically in a different vessel; beta-blockers and blood pressure control reduce risk [^5434cf89] [^d18ab230]. Long-term prognosis is **generally favorable**, with low mortality but significant psychosocial morbidity [^07d54439] [^ec7fb236].

---

SCAD management prioritizes **conservative therapy** for stable patients, reserving revascularization for high-risk scenarios. Beta-blockers and risk-factor control are central to reducing recurrence, and multidisciplinary care improves outcomes.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of myocardial infarction that most frequently affects younger women, making it an important cause of morbidity and mortality within these demographics. The evolution of intracoronary imaging, improved diagnosis with coronary angiography, and ongoing research efforts and attention via social media, has led to increasing recognition of this previously underdiagnosed condition. In this review, we provide a summary of the current body of knowledge, as well as focused updates on the pathogenesis of SCAD, insights on genetic susceptibility, contemporary diagnostic tools, and immediate, short- and long-term management.

### Initial management strategy and long-term outcomes in 186 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^a986970e]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but important nonatherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome. Indications for revascularization and long-term outcomes of SCAD remain areas of active investigation. We report our experience with initial management strategy and long-term outcomes in SCAD. We reviewed all patients treated at our institution from 1996-2021 with a SCAD diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentations, angiography findings, and management strategies were obtained by chart review. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, recurrent/progressive SCAD, subsequent diagnosis of congestive heart failure, or subsequent/repeat revascularization after the initial management. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Of 186 patients with a SCAD diagnosis treated at our institution, 149 (80%) were female. Medical management was the initial treatment in 134 (72.0%) patients, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 43 (23.1%), and coronary artery bypass grafting in 9 (4.8%). Surgery/PCI intervention was associated with younger age (38.8 vs 47.7 years, P = 0.01), ST elevation myocardial infarction on presentation (67.0% vs 34.0%, P < 0.001), lower ejection fraction (45.0% vs 55.0%, P = 0.002), and left anterior descending coronary artery dissection (75.0% vs 51.0%, P = 0.006). Ten-year freedom from our composite outcome was similar between revascularized patients and those managed with medical therapy (P = 0.36). Median follow-up time was 4.5 years. SCAD in the setting of ST elevation myocardial infarction, left anterior descending coronary artery involvement, or decreased cardiac function suggests greater ischemic insult and was associated with initial percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Despite worse disease on initial presentation, long-term outcomes of patients undergoing revascularization are similar to medically managed patients with SCAD.

### Contemporary review on spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^1f16c82e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is gaining recognition as an important cause of myocardial infarction, especially in young women. There has been a surge in the diagnosis of SCAD in recent years, presumably due to an increased use of coronary angiography, and the clinical availability and application of high-resolution intracoronary imaging. The improved recognition and diagnosis, together with increased publications and attention through social media, have considerably raised awareness of this condition, which was once believed to be very rare. Recent publications of moderate to large contemporary case series have helped elucidate the early natural history, presenting characteristics (clinical and angiographic), underlying etiology, management, and cardiovascular outcomes with this condition, thus providing observations and important clinical insights of value to clinicians managing this challenging and perplexing patient cohort. The aim of our review is to provide a comprehensive contemporary update of SCAD to aid health care professionals in managing these patients in both the acute and chronic settings.

### Management and long-term prognosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^f5576411]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The optimal management and short- and long-term prognoses of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) remain not well defined. The aim of this observational multicenter study was to assess long-term clinical outcomes in patients with SCAD. In-hospital and long-term outcomes were assessed in 134 patients with documented SCAD, as well as the clinical impact and predictors of a conservative rather than a revascularization strategy of treatment. The mean age was 52 ± 11, years and 81% of patients were female. SCAD presented as an acute coronary syndromes in 93% of patients. A conservative strategy was performed in 58% of patients and revascularization in 42%. On multivariate analysis, distal versus proximal or mid location of dissection (odds ratio 9.27) and basal Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 or 3 versus 0 or 1 (odds ratio 0.20) were independent predictors of conservative versus revascularization strategy. A conservative strategy was associated with better in-hospital outcomes compared with revascularization (rates of major adverse cardiac events 3.8% and 16.1%, respectively, p = 0.028); however, no significant differences were observed in the long-term outcomes. In conclusion, in this large observational study of patients with SCAD, angiographic features significantly influenced the treatment strategy, providing an excellent short- and long-term prognosis.

### Long-term outcomes comparing medical therapy versus revascularization for spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^bcad32b4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The ideal management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has yet to be clearly defined. We conducted a comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science from database inception from 1966 through September 2020 for all original studies (randomized controlled trials and observational studies) that evaluated patients with SCAD. Study groups were defined by allocation to medical therapy (medical therapy) versus invasive therapy (invasive therapy) (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting). The risk of death (risk ratio [RR] = 0.753; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-2.73; I 2 = 21.1%; P = 0.61), recurrence of SCAD (RR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.61-1.93; I 2 = 0.0%; P = 0.74), and repeat revascularization (RR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.21-1.94; I 2 = 57.6%; P = 0.38) were not statistically different between medical therapy and invasive therapy for a follow-up ranging from 4 months to 3 years. In conclusion, in this meta-analysis of observational studies, the long-term risk of death, recurrent SCAD, and repeat revascularization did not significantly differ among patients with SCAD treated with medical therapy compared with those treated with invasive therapy. These findings support the current expert consensus that patients should be treated with medical therapy when clinically stable and no high-risk features are present. Further large-scale studies including randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

6 MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS

6.1 Conservative management

Whilst there have been no prospective studies to‐date evaluating the optimal revascularization strategy in SCAD, observational data have indicated that a conservative approach is preferable. This recommendation relies on observations that the majority of SCAD lesions heal spontaneously in the weeks to months after conservative management of the index event, and that revascularization is associated with high failure rates,,,as well as major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) both in‐hospital and during follow‐up.Furthermore, a recent meta‐analysis of studies comparing the efficacy and safety of a conservative approach demonstrated similar outcomes and lower likelihood of the need for target vessel revascularization when compared to invasive revascularization.

The currently available consensus statements, therefore, advocate a conservative strategy for the management of acute SCAD in the majority of patients.Notable exceptions are patients with ongoing ischemia, haemodynamic or electrical instability or left main dissection who may require urgent revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A proposed management algorithm for the acute treatment of SCAD is depicted in Figure 3. In the CanSCAD study the majority of patients were managed conservatively (86.4%), with only 2.3% requiring subsequent revascularization (2% with PCI and 0.3% with CABG).The risk of early complications, including recurrent MI, in conservatively managed patients has led experts to suggest an extended period of monitoring in‐hospital for conservatively managed SCAD patients.Typically this is 3–5 days, depending on symptoms and the location of SCAD.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): a contemporary review [^3232aee1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent, yet important cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). It is defined as a non‐atherosclerotic, non‐traumatic and non‐iatrogenic separation of the coronary arterial wall by intramural haematoma, resulting in a false lumen with or without intimal tear. Compression of the arterial lumen by intramural haematoma can lead to compromise of antegrade coronary perfusion and result in myocardial ischemia or infarction.SCAD is more common both in women and in younger patients, making it an important cause of morbidity and mortality within these demographics. Once believed to be a rare phenomenon, a combination of the evolution of intracoronary imaging, improved diagnosis on coronary angiography, coupled with ongoing research efforts and attention via social media, has led to increasing recognition of this condition. In fact, among women less than 50 years old, SCAD may account for nearly a quarter of all cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Yet despite raised awareness and recent insights into the epidemiology, clinical and angiographic characteristics of SCAD, high‐quality evidence‐based guidance for its management remains lacking and currently available consensus guidelines still rely heavily on expert opinion. The Canadian SCAD study is an ongoing large multicenter, prospective, observational study in North America, that continues to enroll patients to improve our understanding of the natural history of this condition. The 3‐year outcomes of this study were published in 2022.Initiatives such as this have informed and justified concurrent randomized control trials evaluating the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in SCAD. Both will contribute to an evolved understanding and best practices required to improve outcomes in this not‐so‐uncommon condition.

### Risks and benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention in spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^fbf92e17]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), predominantly affecting young to middle-aged women.Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute SCAD has been associated with an increased risk of procedural complications compared with atherosclerotic ACS, with ‘PCI technical failure’ reported in 36%–53% of cases.Complications include iatrogenic dissection, haematoma extension and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).When managed conservatively, most SCAD heals completely with restoration of apparently normal coronary architecture at follow-up.For this reason, the American and European Consensus Statements on SCAD both advocate conservative management over PCI, where this is possible.

Accepting that conservative management is favoured ‘where possible’, there remains a significant population of SCAD patients where conservative management risks extensive infarction.For these higher risk cases, it remains unclear to what extent complications are a necessary cost of improving coronary perfusion and if a more proactive approach to revascularisation may be important for selected patient groups.

In this study, our objective was to investigate outcomes in a large observational SCAD-PCI cohort derived from three national registries. In particular, to investigate the balance of risks and benefits of PCI in a SCAD population.

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^03955940]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in young patients. 1 SCAD is characterized by spontaneous development of a false lumen within the coronary artery wall, either from an intimal tear or through spontaneous hemorrhage arising from the vasa vasorum within the vessel wall. 2, 3, 4 This results in compression of the true lumen and compromise of coronary flow. The vast majority of patients with SCAD present with ACS, with up to half of the cases being ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction; life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias occur in ≈4% of cases. 5

In the general population, SCAD is the cause of ACS in the minority of cases, accounting for 1% to 4% of cases. 6, 7 In contrast, SCAD is an important cause of ACS in young women, accounting for almost a quarter of cases of ACS in women <50 years of age. 8, 9 Remarkably, patients with SCAD tend not to have conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease. 5, 10 The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of SCAD are not well understood, although several factors, including connective tissues disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, emotional or physical stress, and pregnancy, were associated with SCAD and are believed to increase a patient's susceptibility. 1, 11

The optimal management strategy is not well defined. It is unclear if secondary preventive treatments proved to be effective in patients with ACS attributable to atherosclerotic disease confer similar benefits in patients with SCAD. No randomized trials exist to guide therapy. The long‐term outcome of patients with SCAD is not well established, with published case series reporting significantly different rates of morbidity and mortality. 10, 12, 13 The variation in outcomes between published series may be partly because of referral bias inherent in registry studies conducted at major tertiary referral centers.

The purpose of this study was to perform a population‐based analysis, using a community‐based cohort of patients followed by a health system in southern California, to determine the clinical characteristics, treatment strategy, and long‐term clinical outcomes of patients with SCAD and to identify clinical factors associated with recurrent SCAD.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: pitfalls of angiographic diagnosis and an approach to ambiguous cases [^bba43142]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is recognized as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) leading to myocardial infarction. It is caused by hematoma formation within the tunica media of the coronary vessel wall, leading to the development of a false lumen that tracks both longitudinally and circumferentially. There is increasing evidence that in most cases, this hematoma arises de novo within the vessel wall, rather than as a consequence of a primary endothelial-intimal tear or flap. Compression of the true lumen leads to coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, and in some cases ventricular arrhythmia. Accurate diagnosis is critical, as management of SCAD differs compared with that for ACS of atherosclerotic etiology both in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and afterward. For example, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in SCAD is associated with high rates of complications and lower rates of angiographic success, whereas conservative management is associated with complete coronary healing in most cases. For this reason, both European and American consensus documents recommend a conservative strategy when practicable. The diagnosis of SCAD can be challenging. At present, there is no biomarker that reliably differentiates SCAD from atherosclerosis. Noninvasive diagnosis by computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) is not routinely recommended, because of its lower spatial resolution, which limits assessment of the more distal coronary territories that are frequently affected by SCAD. As such, the diagnosis continues to rely upon recognition of characteristic features on invasive angiography. The aim of this review is to revisit the diagnostic features of SCAD, present potential pitfalls including SCAD mimickers, and suggest an approach to optimize accurate diagnosis.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^17b59b67]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Considering all these aspects, a simplified practical algorithm for decision-making in the acute management of SCAD is proposed in figure 5. This algorithm primarily considers patient clinical status for decision-making, but also encompasses anatomical features such as size of the dissected vessel and degree of flow impairment.

Clinically driven repeat angiography

After either conservative or revascularisation management, it is imperative to monitor the patient closely for early detection of ischaemic relapses. Recurrent atypical chest pain episodes are common after the SCAD event and can last long after discharge in some patients.After-event chest pain is frequently not accompanied by new angiographic findings. Thus, when returning a SCAD patient to the catheterisation laboratory for chest pain, one should consider the possibility of spurious linking between symptoms and angiographic findings, but also bear in mind the dynamic behaviour of SCAD lesions. Precisely, a particular phenomenon that may occur in SCAD is the delayed longitudinal propagation of the dissection plane to a different segment or vessel. In the event of a relapse with objective ischaemia and worsening clinical status, the decision to revascularise should not be very different to that recommended for initial presentation, particularly avoiding PCI if thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) coronary flow is preserved (figure 5).

### Outcomes during the first year following spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a systematic timeframe pooled analysis [^7e407ada]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to compare the incidence and timing of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the first year after spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) according to the management strategy: conservative versus invasive.

Background

Treatment of SCAD remains controversial.

Methods

A pooled analysis of studies providing separate individual clinical outcomes for conservative and invasive treatment strategies within 1year after SCAD was performed. The primary outcome measure was MACE incidence within three predefined study periods after SCAD, namely "in-hospital", "discharge-to-6-months" and "6-to-12-months". MACE was defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, heart failure and SCAD recurrence.

Results

A total of 16 studies (444 patients) were included; 277 (62%) patients were treated conservatively and 167 (38%) invasively. Within 1-year follow-up, 39 (67%) MACE occurred during the in-hospital period compared to 10 (17%) in the "discharge-to-6 months" period and 9 (16%) in the "6-to-12-months" period (p< 0.0001 for the overall comparison). MACE incidence was also significantly different between the three study periods in the conservatively-treated group (23 [78%] vs. 7 [23%] vs. 0 [0%], respectively; p< 0.0001) and the invasively-treated group (12 [66%] vs. 3 [17%] vs. 3 [17%], respectively; p< 0.0001), although no significant difference was found regarding MACE incidence in the intra-period comparisons between conservative and invasive treatment strategies.

Conclusions

This pooled analysis showed that most MACE following SCAD occurred during the in-hospital period compared to the following two semesters, regardless of the treatment strategy. No difference regarding MACE incidence was found between conservative and invasive strategies in each study period.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a nonatherosclerotic acute coronary syndrome for which optimal management remains undefined.

Methods and Results

We performed a retrospective study of 189 patients presenting with a first SCAD episode. We evaluated outcomes according to initial management: (1) revascularization versus conservative therapy and (2) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus conservative therapy stratified by vessel flow at presentation. Demographics were similar in revascularization versus conservative (mean age, 44±9 years; women 92% both groups), but vessel occlusion was more frequent in revascularization (44/95 versus 18/94). There was 1 in-hospital death (revascularization) and 1 late death (conservative). Procedural failure rate was 53% in those managed with PCI. In the subgroup of patients presenting with preserved vessel flow, rates of PCI failure were similarly high (50%), and 6 (13%) required emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. In the conservative group, 85 of 94 (90%) had an uneventful in-hospital course, but 9 (10%) experienced early SCAD progression requiring revascularization. Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year rates of target vessel revascularization and recurrent SCAD were no different in revascularization versus conservative therapy (30% versus 19%; P=0.06 and 23% versus 31%; P=0.7).

Conclusions

PCI for SCAD is associated with high rates of technical failure even in those presenting with preserved vessel flow and does not protect against target vessel revascularization or recurrent SCAD. A strategy of conservative management with prolonged observation may be preferable.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^ca4f11b9]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an unusual cause of acute myocardial ischemia with complex pathophysiology. This paper reviews the major diagnostic and therapeutic issues of this rare but important disease. The diagnosis of SCAD should be strongly considered in any patient who presents with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia, particularly in young subjects without traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease (especially in young women during the peripartum period or in association with oral contraceptive use). Urgent coronary angiography is indicated to establish the diagnosis and to determine the appropriate therapeutic approach. The decision to pursue medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention, or surgical revascularization is based primarily on the clinical presentation, extent of dissection, and amount of ischemic myocardium at risk.

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^2aceca0f]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged over the last decade as an increasingly recognised cause of myocardial infarction, especially among younger women. The advances in our understanding of SCAD and the evolution of coronary angiography and intracoronary imaging have led to improved diagnoses and outcomes; however, there are still knowledge gaps and challenges in the management of this condition. In this review, we summarise the pathogenesis, genetics, diagnosis and acute and chronic management of patients with SCAD. We also provide focused updates on the following: genetics of SCAD, the role of cardiac CT angiography and cardiac MRI, the use of intracoronary imaging, revascularisation techniques and the overlap between SCAD and Takotsubo syndrome.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: current state of the science: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^acbac3a2]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and sudden death, particularly among young women and individuals with few conventional atherosclerotic risk factors. Patient-initiated research has spurred increased awareness of SCAD, and improved diagnostic capabilities and findings from large case series have led to changes in approaches to initial and long-term management and increasing evidence that SCAD not only is more common than previously believed but also must be evaluated and treated differently from atherosclerotic myocardial infarction. High rates of recurrent SCAD; its association with female sex, pregnancy, and physical and emotional stress triggers; and concurrent systemic arteriopathies, particularly fibromuscular dysplasia, highlight the differences in clinical characteristics of SCAD compared with atherosclerotic disease. Recent insights into the causes of, clinical course of, treatment options for, outcomes of, and associated conditions of SCAD and the many persistent knowledge gaps are presented.

### Clinical features, management, and prognosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^e2dbc305]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an acute coronary event of uncertain origin. Clinical features and prognosis remain insufficiently characterized.

Methods and Results

A retrospective single-center cohort study identified 87 patients with angiographically confirmed SCAD. Incidence, clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, in-hospital outcomes, and long-term risk of SCAD recurrence or major adverse cardiac events were evaluated. Mean age was 42.6 years; 82% were female. Extreme exertion at SCAD onset was more frequent in men (7 of 16 versus 2 of 71; P<0.001), and postpartum status was observed in 13 of 71 women (18%). Presentation was ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 49%. Multivessel SCAD was found in 23%. Initial conservative management (31 of 87) and coronary artery bypass grafting (7 of 87) were associated with an uncomplicated in-hospital course, whereas percutaneous coronary intervention was complicated by technical failure in 15 of 43 patients (35%) and 1 death. During a median follow-up of 47 months (interquartile range, 18-106 months), SCAD recurred in 15 patients, all female. Estimated 10-year rate of major adverse cardiac events (death, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and SCAD recurrence) was 47%. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the iliac artery was identified incidentally in 8 of 16 femoral angiograms (50%) undertaken before closure device placement and in the carotid arteries of 2 others with carotid dissection.

Conclusions

SCAD affects a young, predominantly female population, frequently presenting as ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Although in-hospital mortality is low regardless of initial treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with high rates of complication. Risks of SCAD recurrence and major adverse cardiac events in the long term emphasize the need for close follow-up. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a novel association and potentially causative factor.

### Left main spontaneous coronary artery Dissection: clinical features, management, and outcomes [^042a5946]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and is associated with substantial adverse events. SCAD involving the left main coronary artery (LM) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Currently, minimal data on LM SCAD have been reported.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate clinical features, contemporary management, and clinical outcomes of patients with LM SCAD.

Methods

A systematic review and pooled analysis of published case reports was conducted using "left main" and "dissection" as keywords. The authors screened 1,106 papers in MEDLINE and Embase published between 1990 and 2023.

Results

The final analysis included 132 patients (mean age 40 ± 11 years, 80% women) diagnosed with LM SCAD. Remarkably, 36% of cases occurred during pregnancy, and 95% presented with acute coronary syndrome, 22% with cardiogenic shock, and 8% with ventricular arrhythmias. At 120-day median follow-up, all-cause death occurred in 9%, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation in 4%, recurrent MI in 13%, and urgent myocardial revascularization (MR) in 21%. Compared with conservative management, early revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting significantly reduced the composite endpoint of all-cause death, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation, recurrent MI, and urgent MR (adjusted HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20-0.69; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

LM SCAD carried significant acute morbidity and mortality. Early revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft) was associated with a lower incidence of early adverse outcomes compared with conservative management, driven largely by reduction in recurrent MI and urgent MR. These hypothesis-generating data should be confirmed in future prospective registries and clinical trials.

Despite marked advancements in the recognition and diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) over the past decade, knowledge of the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, contributing factors, and treatment continue to be poorly understood. We describe significant research gaps in our knowledge of SCAD and introduce strategies including the role of patient advocacy, independent registries, and creation of diverse centers of excellence to bridge the gap in clinical care, research, and outcomes. Lastly, we introduce an innovative patient-centered clinical care and research framework established through the SCAD Alliance and International Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection registry as a model for advancing knowledge of SCAD.

### Recent advances on the genetics of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^04e9b13c]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has been acknowledged as a significant cause of acute myocardial infarction, predominantly in young to middle-aged women. SCAD often occurs in patients with fewer cardiovascular risk factors than atherosclerotic acute myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, SCAD remains underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness among health care providers leading to misdiagnosis. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of SCAD are not well understood. SCAD occurring in members of the same family has been described, suggesting a potentially identifiable genetically triggered cause in at least some cases. However, thus far, the search for highly penetrant mutations in candidate pathways has had a low yield, often pointing to genes involved in other clinically undiagnosed hereditary syndromes manifesting as SCAD. Recent exploratory efforts using exome sequencing and genome-wide association studies have provided several interesting leads toward understanding the pathogenesis of SCAD. Here, we review recent publications where rare and common genetic factors were reported to associate with a predisposition to SCAD and indicate suggestions for the future strategies and approaches needed to fully address the genetic basis of this intriguing and atypical cause of acute myocardial infarction.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: overview of pathophysiology [^620d61aa]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The growing use of imaging examinations has led to increased detection of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) as a non-atherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Since a greater awareness of pathophysiologic mechanisms has relevant implications in clinical practice, we aim to provide an update to current knowledge of SCAD pathophysiology. We discuss the most common conditions associated with SCAD, including predisposing factors and triggers, and focus on potential mechanisms leading to SCAD development. Furthermore, we report the main genetic research findings that have shed further light on SCAD pathophysiology. Finally, we summarize practical considerations in SCAD management based on pathophysiologic insights.

Acute management

In contrast to the common atherosclerotic ACS, it is now widely acknowledged that conservative management is the preferred strategy for patients with SCAD whenever clinically possible (ie, preserved epicardial flow and clinical stability);yet, no direct randomised comparison between revascularisation and conservative strategy has been undertaken.

The preference of conservative management resides in the natural history of spontaneous healing in SCADcoupled with the challenging scenario that the dissected coronary vessels means for PCI (fragile vessels, often mid-distal location) and the consequent high rates of failure and/or complications.As a matter of fact, conservative management is generally associated with favourable outcomes and low rates of early urgent revascularisation (<10%),whereas revascularisation subgroups have consistently shown poor clinical outcomes.As stated above, this are not randomised comparisons and consequently there is a potential confusion bias. In fact, patients selected for revascularisation present from the beginning with high-risk prognostic-modifying features such as impaired TIMI flow at presentation, extensive ischaemia and haemodynamic instability.

The real-world practice reflected in the series published in the last years shows revascularisation rates varying from 12% to 56%.However, the paradigm shift appears to be taking place, as a recent national temporal trend analysis has revealed a decrease in in-hospital mortality in SCAD patients parallel to a decline in PCI rates.Nevertheless, in some cases, SCAD leads to extensive ongoing myocardial ischaemia that jeopardises a significant amount of myocardium, particularly where SCAD affects more proximal coronary segments. These patients may benefit from revascularisation with PCI or emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

PCI is usually attempted as the first revascularisation method given its readiness and less invasiveness, whereas CABG is generally deemed auxiliary or reserved for cases where PCI is deemed too complex. CABG has shown acceptable clinical outcome in SCAD series, though graft failure has been reported as high as two thirds in the follow-up, likely consequence of the spontaneous healing of the native vessel.A firm recommendation cannot be issued for selecting patients with SCAD for CABG, but rather this should be dictated by site expertise.

Conclusion

In clinical practice, the diagnosis and management of patients with SCD can be improved by incorporating available knowledge of this condition. Awareness of its high prevalence in middle-age women presenting with ACS in combination with diagnostic workflow algorithms will ultimately aid to deliver an individualised treatment. Patients with SCAD also benefit from personalised counselling and assessment of their concomitant medical disorders.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): a contemporary review [^491ccf71]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of myocardial infarction that most frequently affects younger women, making it an important cause of morbidity and mortality within these demographics. The evolution of intracoronary imaging, improved diagnosis with coronary angiography, and ongoing research efforts and attention via social media, has led to increasing recognition of this previously underdiagnosed condition. In this review, we provide a summary of the current body of knowledge, as well as focused updates on the pathogenesis of SCAD, insights on genetic susceptibility, contemporary diagnostic tools, and immediate, short‐ and long‐term management.

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: where are we now? [^98bd4aca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a heterogeneous condition that often presents as an acute coronary syndrome in young patients with a paucity of cardiovascular risk factors. In most registries, >90% of patients with SCAD are women.SCAD is primarily a non‐atherosclerotic, non‐calcified, non‐iatrogenic dissection of the coronary artery resulting from either an intramural hematoma (IMH) alone, an intimal tear alone, or both an IMH and an intimal tear. Recent studies suggested that an IMH usually precedes the occurrence of an intimal tear.Although underlying mechanisms remain unclear, fibromuscular dysplasia, pregnancy, as well as certain autoimmune and inflammatory disorders have been reported as possible predisposing factors in patients with SCAD.To date, there are no randomized clinical trials comparing revascularization versus conservative management for SCAD; thus, SCAD management is primarily based on observational data and expert opinion,(Table 1).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Table 1 
Registries in Patients With SCAD Comparing Conservative Management Versus Revascularization

A retrospective analysis from the Mayo Clinic showed that in patients presenting with SCAD and low‐risk features (clinically stable with TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] flow 2–3), both conservative management and revascularization were associated with low mortality (1 of 94 conservative versus 1 of 95 revascularization).However, an earlier systematic review inclusive of 440 patients from a total of 381 reports identified in a Medline database search between 1931 and 2008 demonstrated that 21% of conservatively treated patients with SCAD required subsequent revascularization because of early SCAD progression and recurrent ischemia.A recent study (n=750 patients) showed that 8.8% of conservatively treated patients with SCAD had major adverse cardiac events within 30 days of initial presentation.Another recent study showed that SCAD‐related ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) had a higher frequency of left main or left anterior descending culprit lesions (13% versus 1%; P =0.003), and cardiogenic shock (19% versus 9%; P =0.026) compared with STEMI attributable to atherosclerotic plaque disruption.We herein summarize the contemporary evidence for revascularization after SCAD and review the indications, techniques, and factors influencing its outcomes.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection classification and revascularization challenges.

SCAD indicates spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

However, revascularization is associated with suboptimal procedural success rates and high rates of complications despite preserved coronary flow.Most importantly, revascularization strategies may not protect against future target vessel revascularization or recurrent SCAD.Overall, revascularization should be avoided, particularly in patients with low‐risk features (eg, no active ischemia, coronary dissection in an arterial segment subtending a small territory), because the majority of dissections in patients with SCAD will heal spontaneously. In a study of 156 patients with SCAD (182 lesions) who underwent repeat coronary angiography with a median time of 154 days (interquartile range, 70–604 days) for a variety of indications, 95% of SCAD lesions were healed when angiography was performed ≥30 days after the acute SCAD event.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: an underdiagnosed clinical entity – A primer for cardiac imagers [^a96a7ae5]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a nonatherosclerotic cause of myocardial infarction in young and middle-aged women that has gained increasing awareness in recent years. Its diagnosis presents a challenge. Invasive coronary angiography is the primary imaging modality for diagnosing SCAD; however, it carries risk in these patients, who have an increased predisposition to complications. Advances in CT technology enable robust noninvasive evaluation of the coronary arteries at low radiation doses and have been increasingly utilized for the diagnosis or resolution of SCAD, in hemodynamically stable patients or when diagnosis of SCAD is uncertain at invasive angiography, particularly in proximal vessels. However, criteria for the diagnosis of SCAD with use of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have not been currently established, and sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis have not yet been defined. The appearance of SCAD at CCTA can be subtle and can be missed, especially in distal small-caliber coronary arteries; hence utilization of other noninvasive imaging multimodalities may help solve this diagnostic challenge. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is vital, as management of SCAD differs significantly from that of traditional atherosclerotic acute coronary syndromes, with conservative management preferred for the majority of SCAD patients, and invasive treatment reserved for those with ongoing or recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or hemodynamic compromise. The goal of this review is twofold: (a) to discuss the potential role of CCTA in the diagnosis of SCAD, and (b) to discuss the role of multimodality imaging that may improve diagnostic yield, guide management, and enable subsequent surveillance.

### Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection vs coronary artery disease [^76cbb8e2]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute myocardial infarction. Revascularization in SCAD remains very challenging and therefore is not recommended as the initial management strategy in stable SCAD without high-risk features.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission rates between patients with SCAD with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and patients with STEMI without SCAD undergoing PPCI.

Methods

This study was conducted using the administrative minimum dataset of the Spanish National Health System (2016-2020). Risk-standardized in-hospital mortality ratios and readmission ratios were calculated, and results were adjusted using propensity score (PS) analyses.

Results

A total of 65,957 episodes of PPCI were identified after exclusions. The crude in-hospital mortality rate was 4.8%. Of these, 315 (0.5%) were SCAD PPCI and 65,642 were non-SCAD PPCI. SCAD PPCI patients were younger and more frequently women than non-SCAD PPCI patients. Crude mortality (5.7% vs 4.8%), risk-standardized in-hospital mortality ratio (5.3% vs 5.3%), and PS-adjusted (315 pairs) mortality (5.7% vs 5.7%) were similar in SCAD PPCI and non-SCAD PPCI patients. In addition, crude (3% vs 3.3%) and PS-adjusted (297 pairs) 30-day readmission rates (3% vs 4%) were also similar in both groups.

Conclusions

PPCI, when indicated in patients with STEMI and SCAD, has similar in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission rates compared with PPCI for atherothrombotic STEMI. These findings support the value of PPCI in selected patients with SCAD.

### Multimodality imaging for spontaneous coronary artery dissection in women [^ddbb03cb]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has gained attention as a key cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death among women. Recent advancements in cardiac imaging have improved identification and accelerated awareness of SCAD. Accurate diagnosis of SCAD through use of imaging is critical, as emerging evidence suggests that the optimal short- and long-term management strategies for women with SCAD differs substantially from that of women with atherosclerotic coronary disease. This review summarizes the application of both invasive and noninvasive imaging for the diagnosis, assessment, surveillance, and treatment of women affected by SCAD.

Diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous and surgical management

Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard for the appropriate identification and diagnosis of suspected SCAD. The Yip-Saw angiographic classificationis used for the phenotypic recognition of angiographic SCAD patterns with the use of additional intracoronary imaging only in the context of angiographic uncertainty given the increased risk of iatrogenic extension of the IMH and dissection propagation. However, angiographic classification has neither been shown to assist in decision-making nor to be predictive of outcomes.The high rates of procedural complications associated with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in SCAD, such as extension of dissection, technical failure, and long-term risk of stent restenosis and thrombosis, have led to low rates of revascularization among patients with identified SCAD. Additionally, given the high rates of short-term spontaneous angiographic healing and no association between PCI and reduction in the risk of recurrent SCAD, the majority of SCAD lesions are primarily medically managed.Limited data exist to guide appropriate risk stratification to predict which patients will demonstrate SCAD progression and/or failure of medical management upfront.,

Surgical management using coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been described in case series, observational studies, and case reports. Data support initial technical success but a high rate of graft failure due to the natural history of SCAD lesion healing. Given that CABG has usually been reserved for unstable patients with left main lesions, PCI complications, or failures, there is neither prospective comparison of PCI to CABG nor of CABG conduit type in the setting of SCAD.Use of venous bypass grafts and preservation of arterial conduits for future revascularization should be considered and further investigated.

Optimal strategies for invasive management of high-risk anatomy for which neither PCI nor surgical strategies have been optimized for SCAD are currently unknown. Prospective studies should focus on innovation in invasive options, role of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, and understanding mechanisms of stent restenosis and thrombosis in SCAD PCI.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: the management dilemma continues [^93814e04]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognised cause of acute coronary syndrome, particularly in women. A 36-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our hospital with sudden onset chest pain and was diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed mid and distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) dissection with distal LAD occlusion. A short segment of apical LAD filled late with incomplete opacification (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 1 flow). A decision was made to treat the patient conservatively, with subsequent resolution of dissection over the next 3 months. Our patient made a good clinical recovery with healing of her affected coronary vasculature on subsequent angiogram. The case illustrates that SCAD can be managed conservatively with antiplatelet agents, β-blockers, heparin and statins, if the patient is haemodynamically stable and coronary flow is adequate.

### Outcomes of primary percutaneous intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with versus without spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^e88b18de]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute coronary syndrome, but there is no clear consensus on the choice and timing of revascularization strategy. Recent data from outside the United States suggested similar inpatient mortality after primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PPCI) in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) secondary to SCAD versus non-SCAD. Utilizing similar methodologies in a contemporary US cohort, we found that SCAD patients had higher inpatient mortality after PPCI for STEMI compared with non-SCAD patients. We also found that the SCAD group had prolonged hospitalization and hospitalization costs compared with on-SCAD patients. Furthermore, these trends have not changed over the past 5 years. Our findings reiterate the need for continued discussion and research on the role and timing of PPCI in SCAD-STEMI patients in well-designed prospective cohorts.

### Clinical presentation of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^966ef1ae]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent but important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) especially in younger women. However, the clinical presentation and the acuity of symptoms prompting invasive management in SCAD patients have not been described. Understanding these presenting features may improve SCAD diagnosis and management.

Methods

We reviewed SCAD patients who were prospectively followed at the Vancouver General Hospital SCAD Clinic. Their presenting symptoms and unstable features were obtained from detailed clinical histories and hospital admission documentation. Baseline characteristics, predisposing and precipitating conditions, angiographic findings, management strategies, in-hospital, and long-term events were recorded prospectively.

Results

We included 196 SCAD patients who had complete documentation of their presenting symptoms. The majority were women (178/196; 90.8%) and all presented with MI (24.0% STEMI). The most frequent presenting symptom was chest discomfort, reported by 96%. Other symptoms included arm pain (49.5%), neck pain (22.1%), nausea or vomiting (23.4%), diaphoresis (20.9%), dyspnea (19.3%), and back pain (12.2%). Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation occurred in 8.1% (16/196), with 1.0% having cardiac arrest. The time from symptom onset to hospital presentation was 1.1±3.0 days. NSTEMI patients had longer delay for coronary angiography compared with STEMI (2.0±2.5 days vs. 0.8±1.7 days, P=0.002). Overall, 34.2% had unstable symptoms upon arrival for coronary angiography. Those with unstable symptoms were more likely to undergo repeat angiography (65.7% vs. 50.4%, P=0.049), and repeat or unplanned revascularization (14.9% vs. 5.4%, P=0.033) during acute hospitalization.

Conclusion

Chest discomfort was the most frequent presenting symptom with SCAD and one-third had unstable symptoms prompting urgent invasive angiography. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^c610bdaa]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The majority of SCAD patients in the study were managed medically; albeit that this management was highly variable among the patients. Most patients received aspirin, a second antiplatelet agent and a β-blocker. There was no apparent difference in the medical management of the patients who had recurrent SCAD episodes and the broader cohort, and unfortunately no data were available on patient compliance. Optimal medical management of SCAD has not been described but often includes short-term inpatient cardiac monitoring and administration of an antiplatelet agent, a β-blocker and, if dyslipidaemia is diagnosed, a statin.These treatments are largely empirical and have not been studied in prospective clinical trials of SCAD patients.A conservative treatment approach should be the default management option in patients with SCAD as there are high rates of complications from PCI and similar 5-year outcomes when compared with conservative treatment.In unstable patients or those with ongoing ischaemia, revascularisation of the coronary artery in the form of PCI or surgery may be required. The complication rate from PCI in SCAD is high due to vessel fragility and technical difficulties.A retrospective study of 189 patients presenting with their first SCAD event, of whom 87 underwent initial PCI, reported a PCI failure rate of 53%.

At follow-up, 8% of our patients had at least one new coronary dissection. An additional 8% of patients had another coronary vascular event at follow-up. Patients with SCAD therefore require close outpatient surveillance. Early recurrence is commonly due to extension of dissection in the affected coronary artery, whereas recurrence more than 2 months after the initial SCAD tends to be in a remote coronary vessel.SCAD recurrence was reported at 6% in a recent small retrospective study.Another retrospective study of 75 patients reported a recurrence rate of 24% over a 15-year period.SCAD recurrence was 13% over a variable follow-up period in a mixed retrospective (median follow-up 6.9 years) and prospective (median follow-up 0.8 years) cohort.A prospective study of 115 patients with SCAD found a recurrence rate of 28% over a median follow-up of 21 months.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^0dd60f3f]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

Nearly all patients with SCAD present as typical ACS. Despite progresses in diagnosing ACS, there is still a risk of underdiagnosing it in women owing to their low cardiovascular risk profile or atypical symptoms at presentation.A high index of suspicion is required to avoid misdiagnosis and appropriately refer the patient for coronary angiography. Although most patients with SCAD present with acute onset chest pain with raise in cardiac biomarkers, a smaller proportion (11%–16%) present with cardiogenic shock or ventricular arrhythmias.Sudden cardiac death, although likely underestimated, accounts for the least common presentation (<1%).

The proportion of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI varies significantly among SCAD series: STEMI 26%–87% (weighed average 37 %), non-STEMI 13%–77% (weighed average 63%).This variation likely owes to the dynamic behaviour of the SCAD lesion and its translation into the ECG. Single-vessel dissection is the most common anatomical presentation, with only ~10% of SCAD cases presenting with multivessel involvement (the least in non-contiguous vessels). Principal vessels’ territories are affected in the following frequencies (not exclusive): left anterior descending (~57%), left circumflex (~32%), right coronary artery (~23%) and left main (~3%).Although not homogeneously reported, it is known that SCAD typically presents in mid to distal segments, with about 10% involving proximal vessels.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): a contemporary review [^fdda584b]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSIONS

SCAD remains an infrequent cause of ACS in the general population, but accounts for a significant proportion of young women who present with MI, up to 35% in women younger than 50 years. Although both SCAD and atherosclerotic ACS may have a similar presenting symptoms and signs, the disease pathophysiology, predisposing factors, patient demographics and prognostic implications are noticeably distinct. And while we have relatively good evidence behind the rationale for treatment of atherosclerotic ACS, the same is lacking for patients with SCAD. Although large prospective cohort studies have paved the way for improving our understanding of its natural history, randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in SCAD patients are highly anticipated. Furthermore, improving clinician understanding and index of suspicion for this infrequent, but important, cause of morbidity and mortality in young women especially will hopefully improve both immediate and long‐term outcomes in these patients.

In-hospital mortality is reported low, 0% in many series and no higher than 3%.In-hospital MACE was reported in 8.8% of the recently presented Canadian registry (n=750), with about half of them being reinfarctions.P-SCAD, TIMI flow 0–1, proximal dissections and STEMI are characteristics that associate a worse in-hospital outcome.

Reported long-term MACE of patients with SCAD vary from 6% to 28% in the different series, and this is not explained by different follow-up times.Long-term mortality rate is very low across the series (0%–5% with follow-up medians of 3–6 years).Long-term MACE are mainly driven by recurrent SCAD and MI in these patients, and revascularisation does not prevent it, nor prevents late target vessel revascularisation.The wide variability observed in the rates of MACE is likely due to a heterogenous criteria for adjudicating SCAD recurrence. The latter should be distinguished from late propagation, which is the early relapse that tends to occur within first days (weeks the latest) after the index event. A true recurrence, also called de novo recurrence, is a new event occurring in the mid to long term and consists in a new SCAD that appears to invariably involve a distinct coronary segment (and vessel in most cases) from the initially dissected and subsequently healed one.True or de novo recurrences occurred in 10.4% at a median of 3.1 years in the largest series published.

To date, apart from coronary tortuosity,no other predictors for recurrence have been identified and, as abovementioned, no evidence-based therapies effectively modify prognosis. However, for the time being, the recommendations presented in this review, which are essentially in keeping with those from expert consensus from Europe and North America,are considered the best standard of care for patients with SCAD, and are assumed to provide the better outcomes.

6.3 Pharmacologic therapy

Like the invasive management of SCAD, there remains no evidence‐based guidelines to guide the medical treatment of SCAD patients either in the acute, or in the long‐term setting. It is unknown whether the standard guidelines‐directed medical therapy for patients with atherosclerotic disease and ACS apply to individuals with SCAD, as the latter has never been specifically studied, and based on the pathophysiology there are likely to be core differences in their management. Thus, current strategies for medical therapy in SCAD are largely based on expert opinions from observational series.

The key medications administered in SCAD patients are beta‐blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Theoretically at least, the administration of beta‐blockade in SCAD patients is generally thought to reduce coronary arterial wall sheer stress, similar to their therapeutic action in patients with aortic dissection. Strengthening this theoretical benefit of beta‐blocker was the demonstration of a lower risk for the recurrence of SCAD (hazard ratio: 0.36, p =.004) in a Vancouver series of 327 patients.

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: where are we now? [^d6a11cb1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Ascertaining the appropriateness of revascularization, choosing the safest modality, and using optimal techniques are critically important in the treatment of patients with SCAD. Patients presenting with STEMI, hemodynamic instability, active/ongoing ischemia, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, proximal coronary occlusions, and those who progress to occlusion after initial conservative management should be considered for coronary revascularization. PCI is the most common revascularization strategy for SCAD. However, CABG may be considered in those with high‐risk features (eg, left main dissections with ongoing ischemia/infarction, severe proximal 2‐vessel dissection, or in the case of PCI failure). Lifelong low‐dose aspirin is recommended, and the duration of DAPT (preferably clopidogrel as a second antiplatelet agent) after stenting is tailored to the location of SCAD as well as the number and size of stents used. Beta‐blockers and cardiac rehabilitation are preferred in all patients with SCAD, while statins and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin‐receptor blockers may be considered selectively when other clinical indications exist.

Diagnosis

Coronary angiography remains central for SCAD diagnosis. A simplified angiographic classification was described to enhance its recognition.This classification has its primer in the insight gained from the early use of intracoronary imaging (ICI) in SCADand it has a correspondence with the pathological substrates depicted with ICI (figure 2). Nevertheless, the angiographic aspect is sometimes too ambiguous to make a firm diagnosis of SCAD, requiring confirmation through ICI or by assessing vessel restoration in repeat angiography. Considering all the available resources and its appropriate use is key to refine diagnosis and avoid overlooking SCAD, which would crucially change patient management and prognosis.

First row describes the anatomical lesions behind each angiographic lesion (circles). Column 1 corresponds to angiotype 1: double lumen or luminal flap. Column 2 corresponds to angiotype 2: long smooth tapering. Column 3 corresponds to angiotype 3: focal stenosis.

The orientation provided in this regard by the position papers recently publishedis vague and perhaps too simple for practical application. Adapting the existing guidance and available evidence, we here propose an up-to-date diagnostic algorithm intended to maximise the role of coronary angiography for SCAD diagnosis (figure 3).

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^a6d99800]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in STEMI—angiographic patterns and treatment approach: SCAD with intimal disruption and intramural hematoma is an increasingly recognized nonatherosclerotic mechanism of STEMI leading to acute coronary occlusion and is often a cause of myocardial infarction in young women. Recognition of SCAD features on coronary angiography is critical, as the management of STEMI due to SCAD is different than the management of STEMI due to atherosclerosis; angiographic SCAD classification includes type I (multiple radiolucent lumens or arterial wall contrast staining), type II (diffuse stenosis of varying severity and length), and type III (focal or tubular stenosis that mimics atherosclerosis). Conservative therapy is often indicated especially in stable patients or with a limited territory of myocardium at risk, whereas PCI (or coronary bypass surgery) may be necessary in acute total occlusion, large myocardium at risk, refractory ongoing symptoms, or hemodynamic instability. If PCI is indicated, the goal is to restore vessel patency and achieve TIMI flow, and if this can be achieved without stent placement, a balloon alone is preferred; when PCI is used in STEMI, contemporary data suggest reasonable success with rates exceeding 90%.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on sex-specific considerations in myocardial revascularization [^a4ace980]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)—epidemiology and initial management in women emphasize substantial burden and conservative strategy when stable. SCAD accounts for 25-33% of MIs in women younger than 50 years and is the most common cause of pregnancy-associated MI (43%), and 10%-20% of SCADs are peripartum-related, typically occurring in the postpartum period. Because revascularization in SCAD is associated with increased complications, it is reasonable to defer revascularization in patients with preserved coronary flow, minimal ischemia, and distal coronary involvement, particularly since spontaneous healing has been shown to occur in 95% of patients after 30 days. In the absence of high-risk clinical features, most patients can be managed with conservative therapy, and while guideline-based heart failure medications are used for left ventricular dysfunction, the benefit in preserved function is unclear except for beta-blockers, which may reduce recurrence of SCAD.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^5434cf89]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)—epidemiology, diagnosis, and management are summarized: SCAD is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a strong female predilection (> 90% female), and a minority of cases (~10%) occur during or after pregnancy; SCAD accounts for 10–25% of AMIs in women under 50 years and 50% in the post-partum period. SCAD can usually be diagnosed angiographically and intracoronary imaging can be helpful in equivocal cases. There is a growing consensus in favor of conservative medical management when possible (e.g. TIMI 3 flow and no ongoing documented ischemia). Although most dissections heal completely within 3–6 months, recurrent SCAD has been reported in 10.4% from 327 patients in one prospective series followed for a median 3.1 years. Data on optimal medical therapy are limited, with initial evidence suggesting a potential role for beta-blockade and control of hypertension in reducing recurrence risk.

### Early natural history of spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^3815d80f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Risks and mechanisms of extension of conservatively managed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) remain incompletely understood. Study objectives were to (1) evaluate mechanisms of early SCAD evolution through serial angiographic analysis, and (2) determine predictors of early SCAD progression.

Methods and Results

Retrospective registry study of patients with SCAD managed with an initial conservative strategy (n=240). Patients who experienced significant SCAD progression within 14 days, defined as clinical worsening plus new critical coronary obstruction on repeat angiography, were compared with remaining controls. A total of 42 of 240 (17.5%) experienced significant SCAD progression after index conservative approach; 91% by day 6. Isolated intramural hematoma (IMH) at baseline (no intimal dissection) was observed more frequently in those experiencing progression compared with controls (69.1% versus 44.4%; P=0.004). Multivariable predictors of SCAD progression included lesion severity, multivessel involvement, and isolated IMH. To investigate mechanisms of SCAD evolution, all repeat angiograms ≤14 days were compared with corresponding baselines (n=82 patient angiogram pairs). Of those with isolated IMH at baseline, 20% developed intimal dissection at repeat study. IMH was associated with greater longitudinal lesion extension (11.5 versus 2.8 mm; P=0.01), worsening Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow (-0.8 versus 0.1; P=0.003), and a nonsignificant lower rate of angiographic improvement (20.0% versus 31.3%; P=0.16) compared with the group with baseline intimal dissection. Optical coherence tomography subgroup analysis (n=17) indicated intimo-medial thickness to be lowest at the midpoint of IMH.

Conclusions

Conservatively managed SCAD carries a 1:6 hazard for serious deterioration within 6 days. The risk was higher in those with isolated IMH at baseline. IMH often precedes development of intimal dissection, which has implications for mechanisms of SCAD.

### Interventional versus conservative strategy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissections: insights from DISCO registry [^80b43fb5]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is defined as a coronary epicardial dissection not related to trauma, iatrogenic injuries, or atherosclerotic disease. It accounts for up to 4% of acute coronary syndromes in the general population. – Although current guidelines suggest pursuing a conservative strategy whenever clinically possible,, uncertainty remains regarding the potential advantage of performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as first approach to avoid early progression and propagation of hematoma to proximal segments, with a consequent risk of serious adverse events. Additionally, in many cases of ongoing ischemia or hemodynamic instability, a conservative approach is arguable and ineffective in clinical practice.However, PCI is burdened by higher procedural risks and lower success rate in SCAD compared to classical atherosclerotic disease.Furthermore, spontaneous healing is often possible in the short-to-mid-term,whereas bailout revascularization is rare in conservatively managed individuals.

In the absence of randomized trials, the choice between these approaches remains largely based on expert recommendations, and observational evidence, with few studies, and meta-analyses, specifically comparing an initial strategy of invasive versus conservative management.

In a SCAD cohort enrolled in the multicenter DISCO (Dissezioni Spontanee Coronariche) registry, we aimed to investigate: (1) the prevalence of PCI or medical therapy as the initial approach, (2) the predictors of the initial treatment strategy, and (3) the association between the initial treatment strategy and clinical outcomes.

9 CONCLUSION AND CALL FOR ACTION

A high index of suspicion is required to establish SCAD as a diagnosis on presentation (Table 2). The opportunity to make a confirmatory diagnosis may be lost, if additional relevant intracoronary imaging is not performed by the unsuspecting interventionist. A missed diagnosis most likely occurs in a relatively young woman who presents with ACS in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors—sometimes conveniently brushed off as type 2 MI of unclear etiology. Although the largest SCAD cohort studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Switzerland, 1 it would be presumptive to conclude that SCAD is a predominantly Caucasian disease. In fact, the incidence was reported as 0.31% in a Japanese SCAD study, 3 similar to 0.2% estimated in Western cohorts. Until there is improved awareness of SCAD and an actionable plan to pick up this disease, it is likely to remain under‐diagnosed and under‐recognized in and around the Asian region. The two cases illustrated depict the heterogeneity in clinical presentation, angiographic appearance, and course of action taken by managing physicians. More research and prospective studies are needed, especially in the Asian region, to elucidate our understanding of this disease entity and its best management strategies. At present, our center is participating in a USA registry (DSRB ref: 2017/00763).

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection with cardiogenic shock: how frequent is it? How should we treat it? [^c4115669]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) may represent 1-2% of all STEMI and 20-25% of STEMI in women <50. Cardiogenic shock is relatively low (2-3%) in the overall SCAD population but may occur in up to 25% of SCAD patients with STEMI. The ideal treatment for a SCAD patient with cardiogenic shock requires thoughtful patient specific-management decisions in regards to both the choice of revascularization and the choice of mechanical circulatory support. When treated appropriately these patients have excellent long-term outcome, with mortality lower than STEMI or cardiogenic shock related to atherosclerosis.

### A case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection: it is not always plaque rupture [^1e4ddd27]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an extremely rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients may present with a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios, ranging from angina pectoris to myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and sudden death. Standard therapy has not been established; current treatments range from conservative management to percutaneous revascularization or coronary artery bypass surgery.

Objective

SCAD greatly mimics ACS, and this diagnosis should be considered when evaluating young patients who present with ACS with or without classical risk factors for coronary artery disease.

Case Report

We report a case of a 45-year old man who presented with chest pain typical of ACS. He had no risk factors except for a smoking history of 2.5 pack-years. Once the clinical findings suggested acute inferolateral myocardial infarction, the patient underwent emergent cardiac catheterization, which revealed left anterior descending coronary artery dissection. This in itself is not a common cause of inferolateral ST elevation changes on electrocardiogram.

Conclusion

This case highlights the fact that although SCAD is a rare entity, it is increasingly being recognized as a significant cause of ACS. Urgent angiography should be considered if SCAD is suspected, because early diagnosis and appropriate management significantly improve the outcome in these patients.

### A young male with SCAD: challenging conventional risk factors and insights [^b85eb0f7]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare and underdiagnosed condition that can lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with a notable incidence in young female patients without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. We present an unusual case of SCAD in a young male patient in the absence of common predisposing factors such as fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), connective tissue disorders, and systemic inflammatory conditions. A 29-year-old man presenting with chest pain was diagnosed with SCAD involving the left anterior descending artery (LAD), resulting in an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Coronary angiography revealed a 100% occlusion, and successful angioplasty and stenting were performed. The patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy along with other therapeutic approaches. Seven months post-intervention, his ejection fraction improved, and statin therapy was discontinued due to the absence of atherosclerotic disease. SCAD should be suspected in younger patients with ACS-like symptoms in the absence of traditional risk factors. Tailored medical therapy, psychological support, and comprehensive evaluation for underlying causes, such as extracoronary vascular abnormalities (EVAs), are critical to recovery and prevention of recurrence. A multidisciplinary approach, balancing conservative, and interventional strategies is essential for optimizing outcomes in SCAD.

### Coronary artery dissection: a management dilemma in the district general hospital [^c6a023ed]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of myocardial ischaemia with a high mortality. It most commonly occurs in young women with few risk factors for atherosclerosis. Presentation is varied, from sudden death to chest pain with features of myocardial ischaemia. The case presented highlights the dilemma of the need to treat a myocardial infarction within an acceptable time frame versus exploring a rare but entirely possible pathology, which may only be diagnosed in a tertiary referral centre a minimum of 90 min away.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^71a66aa3]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A new Study Group for this unusual and serious condition was announced at ESC Congress in Rome by the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACCA) of the ESC.

Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of non-atherosclerotic acute coronary syndromes afflicting predominantly younger women. It is characterized by a separation of the layers of the coronary arterial wall by an accumulation of blood to form a false lumen. A build-up of pressure within the false lumen leads to external compression of the true coronary lumen restricting coronary blood flow and leading to myocardial ischaemia or infarction. SCAD should be distinguished from atherosclerotic dissections arising from plaque rupture events or erosions and from traumatic dissections or iatrogenic dissections arising during coronary procedures.

Historically SCAD was primarily considered to be a condition of pregnancy or associated with known connective tissue disorders. However, it is now clear these cases make up a small proportion of the prevalent population and most events occur unheralded in patients with minimal cardiovascular risk factors.1–3 In this conventionally low-risk group, diagnosis is frequently missed or significantly delayed. Furthermore, characteristic angiographic and intracoronary imaging appearances are not widely recognized, partly because of a common misconception that a visible dual lumen or linear dissection ‘flap’ will usually be present.2,4

Accurate diagnosis of SCAD is important because of key differences in management compared to atherosclerotic coronary disease. Success rates following revascularisation are lower in SCAD and if conservative management is possible (e.g. in haemodynamically stable patients with TIMI 3 flow in the infarct related artery), the dissection usually heals over a few weeks/months.5 Stenting may be essential to restore coronary blood flow but is complicated by the risk of proximal and distal migration of the mural haematoma such that long lengths of stenting may be required to restore coronary integrity and flow. Bypass surgery can be used as a bail out where percutaneous coronary intervention has failed or for high-risk left main stem or proximal dissections but longevity of grafts in the context of SCAD is reduced by healing of the native coronary and subsequent competitive flow leading to high-graft occlusion rates.

Management of SCAD-survivors is challenging with considerable uncertainty about the optimal approach. For example, antiplatelet therapy, whilst required in patients following coronary stenting, can precipitate menorrhagia and the indication in conservatively managed patients for a condition whose primary pathophysiological event is an intramural bleed, is less clear, especially after the acute phase. Likewise, the use of statins has been questioned for a condition whose primary pathophysiology appears distinct from atherosclerosis and unrelated to cholesterol. Furthermore, SCAD patients face particular questions unusual in an atherosclerotic population, such as about safe contraception and the risk of pregnancy. Of particular concern is recurrent SCAD which is well recognized and may affect as many as one in four patients over 5 years.4,6

To date research in Europe has been limited to a number of national registries, small clinical studies, and case series. Globally the largest reported series contain just a few hundred cases. As a result, SCAD represents a substantial area of unmet clinical need.

There is therefore an urgent necessity to coordinate research internationally to enable larger numbers of patients to be studied. This will advance our knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of SCAD. With this aim, an inaugural meeting was held to welcome the SCAD Study Group within the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association of the ESC at the recent ESC Congress in Rome. Support from the European Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) Group (a condition which occurs in a significant proportion of SCAD patients1–3) was especially welcome. The aims of the Study Group are: 

•To establish a collaborative partnership to advance research into SCAD


•To maintain a European registry of SCAD patients to advance understanding of epidemiology and variations in patient management and outcomes


•To coordinate and support clinical and pre-clinical research into SCAD


•To formulate and disseminate a European consensus on the diagnosis and management of SCAD


•To improve accurate diagnosis by raising awareness of SCAD


•To support patients with this condition



The Study Group welcomes any interested clinicians to make contact and hope by working together we can make an important contribution to better understanding SCAD and improving our care and support for SCAD-survivors.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: pitfalls of angiographic diagnosis and an approach to ambiguous cases [^38f15ea7]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a pathophysiologically distinct cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). It is increasingly recognized that optimal management is different from that for atherosclerotic ACS and that a SCAD diagnosis has specific long-term prognostic and therapeutic implications. Accurate diagnosis is therefore essential to ensure the best treatment of patients. At present this relies on the recognition of typical features of SCAD identified on invasive coronary angiography. Although most SCAD can be readily distinguished angiographically from alternative causes of ACS, false positive and false negative diagnoses remain common. In particular, sometimes non-SCAD presentations, including atherothrombosis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, coronary embolism, coronary vasospasm, contrast streaming, and myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries, can mimic angiographic features usually associated with SCAD. The authors present the combined experience from European and US SCAD referral centers reviewing the classical angiographic appearances of SCAD, presenting potential diagnostic pitfalls and exemplars of SCAD mimickers. The authors further review the benefits and limitations of intracoronary imaging in the context of SCAD. Finally, the authors discuss the investigation of ambiguous cases and an approach to minimize misdiagnosis in difficult cases.

Patient profile

Epidemiology

Although the true incidence of SCAD is still uncertain, in modern series it has been reported to represent 1.1%–4% of all ACS casesand has been identified as the cause of 15%–35% of ACS in women under 50 years.Moreover, it has been suggested to underlie 0.5% of sudden cardiac deaths.SCAD is believed to be underdiagnosed at patient level (misdiagnosis of ACS in young otherwise healthy women) and in angiographic studies (oversight of angiographic subtle signs). However, with the advent of high-sensitivity troponin, the readiness of invasive angiography and availability of ICI, a higher number of SCAD cases can now be detected. All these advances have also permitted a better depiction of recognisable angiographic patterns that can raise the suspicion and, in many cases, establish the diagnosis of SCAD.

Table 1 summarises modern (from 2012) well-described SCAD series/cohorts (n=1004). This entity predominantly affects female gender, which represent 81%–100% (weighed average 91.6%). Mean age ranges from 45 to 56 (weighed average 50+/-9.8) years presenting normal distributions within series, where cases <30 or >80 years are rare.Caucasian or white race is reported in US and Canadian series as much as 76%–82% of the patients,though this is likely influenced by local demographics and referral bias. Cardiovascular risk factors, although not necessarily absent, are less prevalent in the SCAD population when compared with ACS population with similar age and sex.

Associated conditions and precipitating factors

An array of conditions frequently coexists with SCAD; however, it is not fully understood whether they act as preconditioners, precipitators or are just bystanders. Of note, a considerable number of patients do not present with these conditions and are sometimes labelled as idiopathic SCAD.

Convalescence management

Special considerations for management of patients with SCAD after clinical stabilisation are summarised in Box 2. In-hospital management is similar to that of any other patient with ACS, with extra consideration regarding the appearance of ischaemic relapses (including late propagation). Most cases can be safely discharged after a few days of convalescence, yet this should be individualised to each case. Ventricular function should be monitored during hospitalisation and later after discharge since left ventricular systolic impairment at baseline has shown to improve significantly in the short term.This has implications for tailoring medical treatment and, especially, for appropriately indicating primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in those patients with severe ventricular disfunction.If left ventricular function is severely depressed, until reassessment, the role of wearable defibrillators for this relatively young population is appealing.

Box 2 
Summary of recommendations for spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) survivors

Reassessment of left ventricular function (life vest if necessary until then)

Differential diagnosis of chest pain after SCAD should distinguish non-ischaemic chest pain from less common serious causes: late propagation (days, weeks) or de novo SCAD recurrence (months, years), which may occur regardless of the treatment received

Medications:

Tailor heart failure therapy in accordance with left ventricular function that should be monitored to evaluate recovery
Dual antiplatelet therapy only for patients having stents implanted
Consider long-term beta-blocker if well tolerated (nebivolol for coexisting migraine)
Statins only for dyslipidaemia or evidence of atherosclerosis
For patients with fibromuscular dysplasia: aspirin, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor or ARB

Systematic screening of extracoronary arteriopathy, preferably with a magnetic resonance angiography-based protocol

Genetic testing only if a connective tissue syndrome or familiar aggregation is suspected

Cardiac rehabilitation programmes and mental health assessment are appropriate

Discharge counselling:

Control of cardiovascular risk factors, with special emphasis in smoking and blood pressure
Encourage physical activity but avoid extenuating or isometric exertion (weight lifting)
Avoid recognisable emotional stressors
Preferential use of non-hormonal over hormonal therapies
Eventual pregnancies should be closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: where are we now? [^b83a37ed]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Post‐Revascularization Care

Several ongoing clinical trials and registries in patients with SCAD are currently underway (Table 3). Although a paucity of data on re‐imaging in patients with SCAD exists, repeat angiography should be considered in patients with an indication for angiography (eg, recurrent or ongoing chest pain), and revascularization is necessary for ongoing, unstable ischemia (or in the context of recurrent SCAD).It takes time for dissected vessels to heal, and evidence of residual dissection in the absence of clinical ischemia would not be an indication for revascularization.Follow‐up computerized tomography coronary angiography can also be considered in medically managed patients, particularly those with type 1 dissections. No clinical trial data exist to guide the need and timeline for repeat imaging, the duration of DAPT, or the merits of other pharmacotherapies in patients with SCAD. The American Heart Association Scientific Statement on SCAD suggests using DAPT as one would base on current guidelines for non‐SCAD PCI.In individuals at higher risk of bleeding events, per the expert consensus, consideration of recommending DAPT for at least 2 to 4 weeks after SCAD and low‐dose aspirin alone is reasonable. Long‐term DAPT may be considered in cases of severe late‐acquired stent mal‐apposition observed at follow‐up.Aspirin and clopidogrel are generally used, given the higher risk of bleeding with the newer generation P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors. In general, some experts recommended lifelong low‐dose aspirin DAPT for 1 year following the current guideline‐based therapy for acute coronary syndrome.In fact, the duration of DAPT therapy remains controversial and depends on the location of SCAD, revascularization modality, and the number and size of stents used. For example, there is a theoretical concern that antiplatelet therapy in patients with SCAD with IMH could potentially cause bleeding or dissection extension, even with low‐dose aspirin monotherapy. Further study of antiplatelet therapy in patients with SCAD is needed. Beta‐blockers may be considered in all patients with SCAD, as they likely help mitigate SCAD recurrence, possibly by reducing coronary arterial shear stress and reversing catecholamine‐mediated cardiac dysfunction.Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin‐receptor blocker and follow‐up echocardiography should be considered if evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present. Statin use in patients with SCAD remains controversial but should be considered in patients with elevated atherosclerotic risk. Cardiac rehabilitation may be considered in all patients with SCAD to expedite their recovery and improve quality of life.

### Regional and temporal variations of spontaneous coronary artery dissection care according to consensus recommendations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^15e24017]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of myocardial infarction (MI), especially in young women.Once thought to be a rare condition, SCAD has been reported to be the cause of up to 4% of all acute coronary syndrome (ACS)and up to 35% of ACS among women less than 50 years of age.Despite its significance, our understanding about this potentially life-threatening condition remains incomplete. No randomised data have been published to guide treatment for SCAD, and clinicians have largely relied on standard ACS guidelines. This was not ideal as these guidelines are for atherosclerotic ACS.

In 2018, the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology published the world-first scientific statements on the management of SCAD.The recommendations of these documents were based on data from mostly observational studies and, where no data were available, expert opinions. Although there are some minor variations with regards to the use of antiplatelets, the consensus recommendations for SCAD treatment are similar and can be summarised as follows: (1) at least one antiplatelet agent, (2) beta-blocker, (3) ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in the presence of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, (4) referral to cardiac rehabilitation and (5) screening for fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). So far, there have been no data about the effects of these treatments on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The use of beta-blockers was found to be associated with lower risks of SCAD recurrence in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis.As the use of antiplatelets, beta-blockers, ACEI or ARB, and cardiac rehabilitation was also present in guidelines for atherosclerotic ACS, it is worth highlighting the following differences in SCAD consensus recommendations compared with atherosclerotic ACS guidelines: (1) optimal time for antiplatelet therapy was not defined in SCAD and dual-antiplatelets therapy was only recommended if coronary stents were used, (2) ACEIs or ARBs were only recommended in patients with impaired LV systolic function, (3) statins were not recommended in patients with SCAD, and (4) FMD screening was specific for patients with SCAD only and was not recommended in patients with atherosclerotic ACS.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): a contemporary review [^e2c43c70]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms of SCAD from those of atherosclerotic ACS suggest the rationale and potential risks of using standard ACS therapies in SCAD patients. For those undergoing PCI, a standard dual antiplatelet regimen (DAPT) with aspirin and P2Y12‐inhibitor should be administered.The majority of SCAD patients, however, are managed conservatively and there is controversy regarding the benefit of DAPT versus aspirin alone in this cohort. The recent DISCO study retrospectively compared DAPT to single antiplatelet therapy in 199 conservatively managed SCAD patients and reported significantly higher rates of MACEs in those discharged on DAPT.However, 14 of the 15 in‐hospital MACE events were due to unplanned revascularization with PCI leading to questionable categorization of these patients as “conservatively managed.”In the significantly larger, prospectively enrolled, Canadian SCAD cohort study of 750 patients, 67.4% were on DAPT at the time of discharge and 28.2% at 1 year. When patients who were managed with PCI at any point during their hospital admission were excluded, the use of P2Y12 inhibitors was not a predictor of worse in‐hospital or longer‐term outcomes. Similar to currently published expert consensus documents, we prescribe clopidogrel as the P2Y12 inhibitor of choice (preferred over ticagrelor or prasugrel due to the lower bleeding risk), limited to a duration of 1–3 months in conservatively managed SCAD patients.Most experts recommend aspirin for at least 1 year, and typically indefinitely following a SCAD event, in the absence of any contraindications.

Renin–angiotensin system antagonists (ACE‐inhibitors) are usually administered in cases of LV dysfunction or hypertension and statins are reserved for patients with preexisting dyslipidemia or concomitant atherosclerotic disease, both according to relevant society guidelines.

6.4 Post‐discharge recommendations

As lifestyle and psychological stressors could affect SCAD recurrence, some combination of cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial counseling, and peer support are likely beneficial in SCAD patients. Therefore, all patients should be referred to dedicated and individualized cardiac rehabilitation programs to facilitate safe return to physical activities within the recommended limitations following a SCAD event. These dedicated programs are both safe and associated with lower long‐term cardiovascular events.Patients are advised to avoid heavy weightlifting (empiric threshold for women is ~30 lbs and men is ~50 lbs) and to have lower target heart rate (50%–70% heart rate reserve) and systolic blood pressure of <130 mmHg with exercise during rehabilitation after SCAD event.

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^ae873657]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite differences in the racial/ethnic makeup, the presentation and clinical manifestation of SCAD in this cohort are comparable to other series. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 10 patients (4.8%), similar to the 3% to 11% previously reported rate of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. 1, 5, 8, 12, 14 The left anterior descending artery is the artery most commonly involved (seen in 42.2% of patients), and 11% of patients had dissection involving >1 artery. These rates are remarkably similar to coronary angiographic characteristics reported in a predominantly white cohort. 13

Compared with other patients presenting with ACS, a significantly higher proportion of patients with SCAD were treated conservatively. Only 4.3% of patients with SCAD were treated with coronary artery bypass grafting and 11.1% of patients were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The low rate of revascularization is in accordance with expert consensus that recommends conservative management as the preferred initial treatment strategy. 1, 11 Observational studies reported an increased rate of coronary complications with revascularization attempts and suboptimal rates of procedural success. 1, 5, 8, 12 With percutaneous intervention, one study reported a 22.2% rate of procedural‐related complications. 15 With coronary artery bypass grafting, one study reported a high rate of graft failures, which was believed to be attributable to subsequent healing of the native vessel, resulting in competitive flow that led to graft occlusion. 8 Case series in which patients underwent follow‐up repeated angiography found angiographic healing of the dissected coronary segments in most patients with SCAD who were managed conservatively. 8, 16 The low rate of short‐term mortality in the SCAD cohort, despite a low revascularization rate, supports conservative management as a viable initial approach.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: current knowledge, research gaps, and innovative research initiatives: advances expert panel [^41f5dc63]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients affected by SCAD are clinically complex and require access to multiple specialists familiar with SCAD and access to appropriate diagnostic testing and procedures. Understanding that participation in the iSCAD Registry would lead to heightened recognition of sites as centers with experience in treating patients with SCAD, the leadership of the study developed criteria for SCAD “Centers of Excellence.” The key component for a SCAD “Center of Excellence” is the presence of at least 1 clinician champion who has, or is willing to, develop and grow referral pathways to ensure standardized care of patients with SCAD at their institution. Other core criteria include the access to a multidisciplinary team of specialists including those with expertise in vascular disease, headache and vascular neurology, interventional cardiology, maternal fetal medicine, behavioral health, cardiac rehabilitation, and medical genetics, among others. SCAD “Centers of Excellence” are also capable of committing needed time and resources to support participation in multicenter research and have a commitment to connecting patients to patient advocacy groups and encouraging, participating in, and/or organizing patient-centered educational events (Table 3). Through the iSCAD registry, there is an annual conference for clinician education as well as an in-person patient educational conference, led by SCAD Alliance. In addition, as knowledge of SCAD management advances through research, it is a priority to disseminate this to all cardiovascular clinicians who care for patients both within and outside of specific SCAD “Centers of Excellence” through publications in high-impact journals and presentations at highly attended medical conferences.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)—revascularization versus conservative care: Observational data note that “62% underwent revascularization with PCI and 7.5% with CABG,” and a single-center series of “189 patients with SCAD reported similar mortality rates at 5 years with a strategy of revascularization and with conservative care,” with “a higher rate of emergency or urgent CABG … when they were treated with PCI versus conservative care.” Across “Three large, single-center retrospective studies of patients undergoing PCI for SCAD” the “failure rate of 35% to 53% and a need for urgent CABG of 9% to 13%” were reported, whereas “conservatively treated patients experienced recurrent symptoms leading to revascularization only 2% to 10% of the time.” Meta-analyses found “no differences in short- or long-term mortality rate, MI, heart failure, or SCAD recurrence between the groups,” and the text concludes that “the data support a conservative management approach in clinically stable patients,” while noting that “it is reasonable to consider revascularization in the presence of ongoing ischemia and hemodynamic instability.”

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: cardiovascular events incidence and quality of life evaluation in a single-center 10 years' experience [^2cd868d1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite recent advancements in the recognition and diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), pathophysiologic mechanisms, predisposing and precipitating factors, risk of recurrences remain poorly understood and evidence-based treatment strategies are still unavailable.

Aims

The goals of the study are to assess the characteristics of SCAD patients highlighting the predisposing and precipitating factors, to analyse the therapeutic management in the acute phase, to evaluate the incidence of SCAD recurrence and cardiovascular events during the follow-up and to assess the factors influencing the quality of life of patients after a SCAD event. We also aim to introduce our experience about the use of intra-aortic balloon pump in acute SCAD setting in order to support the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or its use as part of a conservative management.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, single-center, observational cohort study of patients with non-atherosclerotic, non-iatrogenic SCAD presenting to our Cath Lab in Santa Maria Annunziata Hospital (Bagno a Ripoli, Florence, Italy) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We enrolled 84 patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome and SCAD documented by coronary angiography or intracoronary imaging, from January 2015 to December 2024. We excluded patients with iatrogenic dissection and coronary atherosclerotic disease.

Results

Mean age was 56.2±11.6 years and 79 (94%) patients were women. At baseline, 40% had hypertension, 38.8% dyslipidaemia, 29.4% was current smoker, only 2.4% had diabetes mellitus. The most frequent hospital presentation was NSTEMI (70,6%), followed by STEMI (28,2%) and ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (3.5%). Majority of SCAD involved a single coronary artery territory (89.3%), and the most common coronary artery dissected was the left anterior descending artery and its branches (40.5%). Majority of patients (82%) were treated conservatively as initial strategy; 15 patients (18%) underwent myocardial revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In nine cases (10.6%) IABP was implanted to perform a protect PCI (4.8%), as bridge to emergency CABG in course of hemodynamic instability (2.4%) or as part of conservative management (3.6%) avoiding coronary instrumentation and PCI with positive long-term outcome. During the follow-up period (median follow-up 2.6 years with interquartile range 1.1-5.4 years) the primary endpoint, defined as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence and new onset or recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF), occurred in 18 patients (21.4%). Hypertension emerged as independent predictor of primary outcome (p 0.001, HR 7.965) and low-dosage aspirin at discharge appeared to be protective reducing risk of primary outcome (p<0.001, HR 0.0034). The secondary outcome was to evaluate quality of life (QoL) of patients who suffered SCAD using EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7. No significative differences emerged between patients treated by PCI and patients treated conservatively.

Conclusions

In SCAD patients, hypertension increases risk of primary outcome while low-dosage aspirin reduces risk during follow-up period. In terms of quality of life and post-SCAD chest pain, no significative differences emerged between patients treated by PCI and patients treated conservatively.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection and menopause [^e06726a9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare but well-known cause of acute coronary syndrome in women. The role of sexual hormones has been related to the pathophysiology of SCAD. However, clinical features, angiographic findings, management and outcomes of SCAD women in relation to menopause status remain unknown. The Spanish multicenter prospective SCAD registry (NCT03607981), included 318 consecutive patients with SCAD. All coronary angiograms were analyzed in a centralized Corelab. In this substudy, 245 women were classified according to their menopause state (pre-menopausal and post-menopausal). In-hospital outcomes were analyzed: 148 patients (60.4%) were post-menopausal. These patients were older (57 [52 to 66] vs 49 [44 to 54] years, p <0.01) and had more often hypertension (49% vs 27%, p <0.01) and dyslipidemia (46% vs 25%, p <0.01). Post-menopausal women showed more often previous history of acute coronary syndrome, including previous SCAD (9% vs 3%, p = 0.046), and presented less frequently as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction on admission, compared with premenopausal women (34% vs 49%, p = 0.014). On the other hand, premenopausal women showed more often proximal and multisegment involvement (24% vs 7%, and 32% vs 18%, respectively, both p <0.01). Post-menopausal women were more often managed conservatively (85% vs 71%, p <0.01) and presented less frequently left ventricular dysfunction (both, p <0.01). There were no differences between groups in terms of in-hospital stay or mortality, new acute myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary angiography or heart failure. In conclusion, post-menopausal women with SCAD show different clinical and angiographic characteristics compared with pre-menopausal SCAD patients. Initial treatment strategy was different between groups, though in-hospital outcomes did not significantly differ (NCT03607981).

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection across the health care pathway: a national, multicenter, patient-informed investigation [^019b73c8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a spontaneous separation of the coronary artery wall by intramural hemorrhage that may occur with an intimal tear or bleeding from vasa vasorum, consequently resulting in partial or total occlusion of coronary vessels. SCAD presents most frequently as a myocardial infarction.The incidence of SCAD has been estimated to account for ≈1% to 4% of cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS),,but for younger women (aged <50 years), ≈40% of myocardial infarctions are due to SCAD.At the time of ACS, SCAD is detected and confirmed by coronary angiogram,,and may be supplemented by intracoronary imaging with intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography. The pathophysiology of SCAD is heterogeneous, but an accumulating evidence base has identified predisposing arteriopathies, genetic factors, hormonal influences, and precipitating intense physical or emotional stressors as prominent precursors.A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of 19 studies (N=2172) reporting on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with SCAD determined that approximately half of patients with SCAD have concomitant hypertension, two‐thirds have been diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia, and three‐quarters reported identifiable physical or emotional stressors.Recommendations are for SCAD to be conservatively managed; invasive coronary revascularization procedures have been reported in 15% to 30% of cases.

Medical therapy

Limited observational data exist to guide the medical management to promote coronary artery healing and reduce dissection recurrence. Expert consensus guidelines recommend the empiric use of single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with consideration of short duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) strategy in conservatively managed patients with SCAD based on presumed pathophysiological benefits.In particular, antiplatelet agents are currently utilized based on concerns regarding shear-mediated platelet activation in the context of endothelial exposure in dissected vessels.However, data from conservatively managed SCAD patients in the multicenter, retrospective DISCO (DIssezioni Spontanee COronariche) registry found an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events at 12 months among the patients treated with DAPT compared with SAPT driven primarily by nonfatal MI and unplanned revascularization, though these data should be considered within the limitations of a small registry-based cohort.Single-center retrospective registry data have shown the use of beta-blockers post-SCAD to be associated with a decreased risk of recurrent SCAD. Beyond this, targeted medical therapy to reduce SCAD recurrence is unknown.The reliance of current treatment strategies on purely observational, retrospective registry data are limiting, and future prospective and randomized studies should be designed to disaggregate the medical treatment of SCAD based on presenting clinical phenotype, presence of underlying genetic vasculopathy, and initial treatment strategy, given the unified angiographic findings but marked heterogeneity in clinical context and patient substrate. The BA-SCAD (Beta-blockers and Antiplatelet agents in patients with Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection) randomized clinical trial led by the Spanish Society of Cardiology is designed to evaluate the potential benefit and duration of SAPT vs DAPT among SCAD patients without coronary revascularization and the use of beta blockers post-SCAD in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction.Future studies should aim to incorporate insights from genetic and mechanistic studies of pathophysiological mechanisms of SCAD to tailor treatment strategies.

Pharmacologic treatments

No firm recommendations can be made regarding medical treatment in SCAD given the lack of evidence-based therapies and the current limited knowledge about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this condition. Potential risks, adverse effects and theoretical benefits should be weighed when deciding the pharmacologic treatment for patients with.

While some concerns have been raised regarding the potential deleterious effect of antithrombotic therapy in enhancing intramural bleeding and facilitating haematoma propagation,no evidence supports this theoretical hazard. It is relatively straightforward that in those receiving stents dual antiplatelet therapy should be maintained for 12 months in keeping with current guidelines.However, for conservatively managed patients no benefit is expected. Most common practice is to maintain lifelong low-dose aspirin and to stop the second antiplatelet agent early after the acute event.We do encourage to stop the second antiplatelet agent soon after diagnosis of SCAD has been made. Heparin is given as a standard for ACS, but since there is no foreseeable benefit for this condition and there is a theoretical potential harm, early discontinuation is also encouraged.

In the presence of any intolerance or bleeding (beware of uterine bleeding), even stopping aspirin should be considered given the lack of evidence for the SCAD population. Uterine bleeding can be a problem in these patients, and cardiologists may not be well acquainted with it. Stopping the antithrombotic agent is generally possible; though, if not (eg, stented SCAD), a high-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine coil can be prescribed to reduce significant bleeding.

Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be administrated according to ACS guidelines.However, given the trend towards prompt recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction,the duration of these medications should be appropriately tailored. On the other hand, data from a multivariate analysis in a large SCAD cohort in Canada suggest a long-term benefit in maintaining beta-blockers for preventing recurrences,though these data still need to be reproduced in other cohorts. Their antiadrenergic effect (to buffer physical/emotional stressors) or the reduction of arterial wall shear stress are plausible mechanisms for this alleged benefit. Renin–angiotensin antagonists should be used with caution in women in childbearing age given their potential teratogenicity. Statins are not considered beneficial in these patients; what is more, a previous observation suggested potential harm.Statins should only be prescribed if there is evidence of atherosclerosis or hyperlipidaemia, as commonly for primary or primordial prevention for cardiovascular disease.

### A successful emergency management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection and review of the literature [^b2927376]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare and lethal myocardial ischemic event, which usually causes acute coronary syndrome and sudden death. Emergency management of SCAD includes medical treatment, percutaneous coronary interventions, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Here, we report 1 case of 37-year-old young woman who was found to have a mid-distal SCAD of the left anterior descending artery, taking conservative management decision. In another case of a 50-year-old woman who was found to have a proximal-middle spiral SCAD of the right coronary artery, she underwent coronary angioplasty. After 6 months later at follow-up, 2 patients remained stable without symptom and in recovery of the left ventricular function; angiogram showed the SCAD healed.

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1235bbe6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in younger women, often treated conservatively due to revascularization risks. Revascularization outcomes are largely unknown in SCAD presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare revascularization strategies and outcomes of STEMI-SCAD with STEMI atherosclerosis (STEMI-ATH).

Methods

Consecutive STEMI patients were retrospectively analyzed (2003 to 2017) at 2 regional STEMI programs (Minneapolis Heart Institute and Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute) with 3-year outcomes.

Results

Among 5,208 STEMI patients, SCAD was present in 53 (1%; 93% female). SCAD prevalence was 19% in female STEMI patients age ≤50 years. Compared with STEMI-ATH, STEMI-SCAD patients were younger (age 49 ± 10 years vs. 63 ± 13 years), were more often female (93% vs. 27%), and had more frequent cardiogenic shock (19% vs. 9%); all p ≤ 0.03. In STEMI-SCAD, the culprit artery was more commonly left main (13% vs. 1%) or left anterior descending (47% vs. 38%); both p = 0.003. Acute revascularization was lower in STEMI-SCAD (70% vs. 97%); p < 0.001. In STEMI-SCAD, acute revascularization included percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), n = 33 (62%), or bypass grafting, n = 4 (8%); PCI success was 91%. Those with revascularization were more likely to have shock, left main culprit, proximal dissection, and initial TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 0 to 1. The 3-year survival was 98% for STEMI-SCAD versus 84% for STEMI-ATH; p < 0.001.

Conclusions

STEMI-SCAD represents an important STEMI subset, particularly among younger women, characterized by significantly greater frequency of left main or left anterior descending culprit and cardiogenic shock than STEMI-ATH. Primary PCI is successful in most STEMI-SCAD patients, with low 3-year mortality.

### Improvement of symptoms and coronary perfusion gradient with mechanical left ventricular unloading in flow-limiting complex spontaneous coronary artery dissection, without revascularization [^17c61bc6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) can lead to acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death, particularly in young women. Observational data show that, in SCAD patients, both percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting seem to be hampered by higher technical complexity, lower success rates, and worse outcomes. As spontaneous healing is a common occurrence, expert consensus advices medical management of the acute phase, when feasible. We present the case of a young woman with SCAD of left anterior descending artery causing myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation. High-anatomical complexity and unstable conditions of the patient made both medical management and immediate revascularization unfeasible options. Therefore, we decided to implant a percutaneous off-loading mechanical support device to improve coronary perfusion pressure by unloading the left ventricle and preserve cardiac function, preventing worse complications of acute myocardial infarction. This strategy was successful in stabilizing the patient, until the definitive revascularization treatment became an option.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease-AAFP (...) [^14e606cb]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Stable coronary artery disease is defined as an established pattern of angina pectoris, a history of myocardial infarction, or the presence of plaque documented by catheterization. Although CAD caused one out of five deaths in 2005, improved management of the disease has achieved a 34 percent decline in CAD mortality since 1995. 1 This article focuses primarily on optimal drug therapy for CAD; other aspects of CAD management, such as coronary revascularization and treatment of comorbidities, will not be covered here, although lifestyle modifications are briefly summarized in Table
1. 2, 3. 8, 9 The National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III recommends using statins to achieve LDL levels of less than 100 mg per dL in patients with CAD.

2 The American College of Cardiology recommends that patients with CAD have a target LDL measurement of less than 100 mg per dL, and for those at very high risk, a goal of less than 70 mg per dL or treatment with intensive statin therapy should be considered. 3, 8. 11 In addition, a meta-analysis addressed whether a goal of less than 70 mg per dL or less than 100 mg per dL was better, and found that more intensive treatment resulted in an NNT of 20 over one to five years to prevent one MI or cardiovascular death. 8 A reduction in LDL cholesterol, regardless of the specific number, is important as well. Another meta-analysis showed that a reduction of at least 40 mg per dL yielded a 23 percent decrease in CAD mortality that was sustained over five years. 12 Reducing triglyceride levels and increasing high- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also should be considered in the management of CAD.

However, these are secondary interventions to incorporate after the LDL goal has been achieved. 19 The reduction should be limited to a minimum diastolic pressure of 55 mm Hg. 17 Besides reducing blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs improve mortality in patients following MI and can relieve anginal symptoms. Antihypertensive treatment works by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, lowering left ventricular ejection fraction, and preventing left ventricular hypertrophy. 17, 18.

6.2 Considerations for invasive revascularization

Preference for a conservative strategy is also influenced by case series reporting on the poor technical success of PCI in SCAD. In the CanSCAD study technical success rates with PCI were relatively poor; in 30.1% PCI was unsuccessful, 40.8% partially successful and in 32% there was propagation of SCAD during PCI.Given the underlying frailty and disrupted integrity of arterial wall, PCI can result in iatrogenic dissection and/or extension of dissection. It is, therefore, the opinion of the authors that to enhance the technical success of PCI and avoid potential complications, a number of strategies should be employed by the interventional cardiologist as depicted in Table 2. Preference for the femoral approach, both for diagnostic angiography and PCI in SCAD, is based upon a potentially threefold higher rate of iatrogenic dissection with a radial approach.With either approach, meticulous technique and care with catheter engagement is paramount, and use of hand injections as opposed to a power injector is also preferred to best control the hydraulic force of dye injected. The use of longer stents can provide adequate coverage of both proximal and distal edges of the dissected arterial segment. Alternatively, for longer lesions which require multiple stents, a multi‐step approach of first stenting the distal edge, followed by the proximal edge, and finally the middle segment, may be useful in preventing propagation of IMH.

Table 2 
Challenges and suggestions for PCI in SCAD.

The available literature on the role of CABG in SCAD is limited to case series and retrospective observational data but surgical revascularization may act as a bridge to recovery in SCAD patients not amenable to conservative or PCI options. These patients have mostly shown good acute survival,but suboptimal longer‐term outcomes with poor graft patency (only 27% in one small series)likely due to healing of dissected SCAD segments. Therefore, CABG should only be considered a potential revascularization strategy for patients with left main dissection, extensive dissection involving the proximal coronary arteries or in patients in whom PCI is not feasible when ischemia is refractory. Similarly, evidence for the use of therapies supportive of left ventricular function or persistent ischemia in SCAD, such as intraaortic balloon pumps, Impella devices or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, are limited to case reports. These therapies may be considered in cases of SCAD with cardiogenic shock as a bridge to recovery, CABG or transplantation and in line with current society guidelines in this area.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: contemporary aspects of diagnosis and patient management [^3b9b2696]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Stent malapposition or underdeployment are frequent findings in routine surveillance angiographies or autopsy.However, since an increased incidence of stent thrombosis in the setting of SCAD has not been confirmed, the clinical implication of these findings remains uncertain.

ICI guidance is paramount for ensuring true lumen access and avoiding stents deployed in the false lumen,which causes obliteration of the true lumen and pathological remodelling of the vessel.ICI also allows a fine depiction of the lesion and its extension, accurate dimensioning of the vessel and proper stent selection. In this regard, IVUS may be better for accurately sizing of the vessel and provide a more detailed characterisation of the false lumen, especially in cases where the true lumen is severely distorted and contrast filling is insufficient for OCT.

Dissection propagation, another issue derived from PCI in SCAD, frequently leads to further stenting of a longer artery segment. This can occur either by simple wiring or following dilatation that provokes blood displacement through the false lumen plane. Avoiding a constant target of 1:1 vessel:stent and optimal apposition, as well as being gentle with dilatation pressure, may help to prevent this complication.

Whenever clinically possible, conservative management is the preferred strategy in SCAD.
Because SCAD is a treacherous scenario for percutaneous coronary intervention, every precaution must be taken to prevent specific complications (see Box 1).

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^b5811640]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no randomized controlled trials comparing different medical treatment strategies for SCAD. Despite the lack of clear evidence to support the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with SCAD, most patients with SCAD were treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), at a rate similar to patients without SCAD who presented with ACS. It is possible that, in the absence of guidelines specifically written for the SCAD population, many physicians opted to follow the guidelines written for acute coronary syndrome, despite the distinct pathophysiological processes involved in SCAD and atherosclerotic plaque rupture. 17 Similarly, the vast majority of patients with SCAD in this cohort was discharged with prescriptions for β blockers and statins. Whether β blockers and statin therapy confer benefit in SCAD is not well established. One study showed a reduction in recurrent SCAD associated with β‐blocker therapy. 13 However, a theoretical risk of exacerbating vasospasm exists with β‐blocker treatment. 1 With statin therapy, one study suggests an association with SCAD recurrence, whereas another showed no difference in clinical outcomes. 8, 13 No association was seen between treatment with antiplatelet agents, β blockers, or statins and the risk of recurrent SCAD in our cohort. In the absence of clear evidence, use of these medications probably should be decided on the basis of the presence of other risk factors, balancing a potential benefit with their adverse effect profile.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint Committee on Clinical practice guidelines [^60138345]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)—in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) among younger patients, particularly women, SCAD is present in roughly one-fourth of women ≤50 years of age presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Management has shifted toward cautious use of PCI because case series demonstrated low success rates and higher complication rates with PCI for SCAD and good long-term outcomes with conservative care; expert consensus statements emphasize conservative care in most patients. However, patients with ongoing symptoms, hemodynamic instability, or severely compromised blood flow involving a large myocardial territory (the proximal LAD or left main lesions) may not be suitable for conservative care, and further investigation is needed to define when and how to revascularize.

### Clinical outcomes in spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^67e2e5be]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent cause of acute coronary syndrome. Our aim was to assess adverse events at follow-up from a nationwide prospective cohort.

Methods

The Spanish Registry on SCAD (SR-SCAD) included patients from 34 hospitals. All coronary angiograms were analysed by two experts. Those cases with doubts regarding the diagnosis of SCAD were excluded. The angiographic SCAD classification by Saw et al was followed. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) was predefined as composite of death, myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularisation, SCAD recurrence or stroke. All events were assigned by a Clinical Events Committee.

Results

After corelab evaluation, 389 patients were included. Most patients were women (88%); median age 53 years (IQR 47-60). Most patients presented as non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (54%). A type 2 intramural haematoma (IMH) was the most frequent angiographic pattern (61%). A conservative initial management was selected in 78% of patients. At a median time of follow-up of 29 months (IQR 17-38), 46 patients (13%) presented MACCE, mainly driven by reinfarctions (7.6%) and unplanned revascularisations (6.2%). Previous history of hypothyroidism (HR 3.79; p<0.001), proximal vessel involvement (HR 2.69; p=0.009), type 2 IMH (HR 2.12; p=0.037) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at discharge (HR 2.18; p=0.042) were independent predictors of MACCE.

Conclusions

In this large prospective cohort of patients with SCAD, prognosis was overall favourable, with events mainly driven by reinfarctions or unplanned revascularisations. History of hypothyroidism, proximal vessel involvement, type 2 IMH and DAPT at discharge were associated with MACCE.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection management

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an under-recognized cause of MI that is more prevalent in women.Acute events are typically medically managed, although certain unstable patients may require revascularization. Following acute management of SCAD, the primary focus is preventing recurrences. While patients with SCAD are generally well-managed with conservative medical management, estimated 5-year recurrence rates can be up to 27%.The most common triggers for SCAD, either initial or recurrent, are emotional stress and physical exertion.Other observed triggers potentially include perimenopausal state, use of oral contraceptives, postmenopausal hormone therapy, infertility treatments, and high-dose corticosteroid administration.It is important for clinicians to investigate potential triggers and to educate on avoidance, if possible. There is little evidence on pharmacologic therapies specifically to prevent SCAD recurrence, but emerging data emphasize the potential benefit of beta-blocker therapy in the management of patients who have had SCAD.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a potentially devastating cardiovascular disease in young women [^f38b4eb6]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the review article by Bullock‐Palmer et al entitled “Emerging misunderstood presentations of cardiovascular disease in young women.” 1

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an uncommon medical condition with potentially devastating effects that affects primarily young women; a population considered not at risk for coronary artery disease. The optimal management for this condition is yet unknown, mainly due to the lack of robust evidence, as mentioned in the article.

The article approaches very well the current knowledge about the condition and the currently recommended therapy; it does mention the use of beta‐blockers as a therapy to prevent a recurrence, and we would like her to highlight the proposed pathophysiology involved, that is based on the idea of reducing shear stress, similar to what is used in acute aortic dissection. 2 Beta‐blocker therapy is also important as secondary prophylaxis; one prospective study 3 with 327 patients suggested that the use of beta‐blockers was associated with reduced incidence of recurrent SCAD.

We agree that further investigation, especially with randomized clinical trials, should be pursued to be a better understanding of the treatment options for this pathology. Two large studies are currently ongoing: a prospective cohort (NCT02188069) and a registry (NCT01429727) of angiographic images of those patients. Hopefully, these studies will allow a better understanding and guide future research for SCAD.

### Chronic infarct size after spontaneous coronary artery dissection: implications for pathophysiology and clinical management [^cf7986d5]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

We provide novel insights into the role of revascularization in the management of SCAD. It is well-established that conservatively managed SCAD usually heals and that PCI is associated with high failure rates or suboptimal outcome, in part, due to extension of the false lumen due to tracking of the haematoma during stent deployment. Consistent with previous series, we also found high rates of complications in those patients undergoing PCI (25/56 or 45%; Supplementary material online, Table SA). The generally small infarcts observed suggest the management strategy adopted in these patients (2/3 managed conservatively) is associated with good outcomes from the perspective of left ventricular injury, albeit with some early hazard of dissection extension.

However, this study also identifies higher risk SCAD cases such as those presenting with STEMI, poor TIMI flow or multivessel disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention was not independently associated with infarct size. This may be due, in part, to the fact that PCI complications did not appear to be associated with significantly increased chronic infarct size or to the confounding effect of other covariates such as STEMI presentation and TIMI flow interact and are themselves associated with adoption of PCI. Furthermore, in cases propensity matched for STEMI/NSTEMI presentation, TIMI flow, and angiographic appearance, there was no difference in % infarct mass between conservative and PCI managed cases. However, it should be noted that most of the cases included will be ‘grey zone’ cases, as those where management appears clear-cut will not be readily matched. Therefore, in the absence of randomized data, these data appear to support the currently recommended strategy of conservative management where possible in SCAD, reserving PCI for presentations at high risk of incurring large myocardial injuries (e.g. proximal vessel involvement with TIMI 0/1 flow and STEMI presentation). Such high-risk patients could form the basis for a future randomized controlled trial, perhaps with infarct size as the primary outcome, especially as we have shown no difference in infarct size in the STEMI cases vs. those with atherosclerotic type 1 STEMI.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a young man-case report [^23dd5b62]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome first described in 1931. The ratio female to men is 2:1 and the dissection is more frequently diagnosed in the left coronary artery. Coronary artery dissection is characterized by a separation of the layers of the artery wall. This results in a false lumen or an intramural haematoma in the area of the media. Coronary angiography is the primary tool for diagnosis of SCAD. Intracoronary imaging techniques such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), which provide detailed morphological information on coronary lesions and on the location of dissection planes between the different layers of the arterial wall, have enabled a more detailed clinical assessment of SCAD. Furthermore, non-invasive coronary angiography by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been used for longitudinal follow-up evaluation of patients with SCAD. We did not utilize IVUS in the patient presented in this report because angiographic assessment revealed high diagnostic accuracy. We did not expect further information from additional imaging that might have changed clinical decision making. SCAD occurs during pregnancy in 26,1% of the cases. In this patient population, SCAD was diagnosed most frequently during the postpartum period. SCAD may be associated with Marfan's Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Disease, intensive exercise and cocaine abuse, female hormonal treatments as oral contraceptives, although in some cases no predictor could be identified [-]. A hereditary factor has been discussed previously. There are no randomized trials on treatment of coronary artery dissection. The literature consists of case reports and case series. Different strategies of treatment have been discussed in the last years. Conservative management of patients with SCAD is a possible treatment strategy in stabile patients. Antiplatelet therapy can be used because of the flow limitations caused by platelet thrombi. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been successfully used in patients with SCAD. We did not use a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in the present patient because of clinical success with dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin and risk-benefit calculation with respect to the recent stoke. However, utilization of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor would have been our bail-out-strategy. Koller et al. reported a spontaneous healing of the lesion of a postpartum SCAD with the treatment including prednisone and cyclophosphamide combined with the conventional therapy. Stent implantation can be performed in limited disease after identification of the true and false lumen. Fibrinolysis is not recommended due to the increase of the bleeding risk. In the case of multivessel dissection, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) may be a reasonable choice. In conclusion spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an uncommon disease, more frequently seen in women without cardiac risk factors. The postpartum period, cocaine, intensive exercise and diseases like Ehlers-Danlos are risk factors for SCAD [-]. The management strategy has to be based on clinical presentation, additional findings and morphological details during invasive assessment in a case by case fashion.

### Canadian spontaneous coronary artery dissection cohort study: in-hospital and 30-day outcomes [^032661cc]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) was underdiagnosed and poorly understood for decades. It is increasingly recognized as an important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in women. We aimed to assess the natural history of SCAD, which has not been adequately explored.

Methods and Results

We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study of patients with non-atherosclerotic SCAD presenting acutely from 22 centres in North America. Institutional ethics approval and patient consents were obtained. We recorded baseline demographics, in-hospital characteristics, precipitating/predisposing conditions, angiographic features (assessed by core laboratory), in-hospital major adverse events (MAE), and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We prospectively enrolled 750 SCAD patients from June 2014 to June 2018. Mean age was 51.8±10.2 years, 88.5% were women (55.0% postmenopausal), 87.7% were Caucasian, and 33.9% had no cardiac risk factors. Emotional stress was reported in 50.3%, and physical stress in 28.9% (9.8% lifting >50 pounds). Predisposing conditions included fibromuscular dysplasia 31.1% (45.2% had no/incomplete screening), systemic inflammatory diseases 4.7%, peripartum 4.5%, and connective tissue disorders 3.6%. Most were treated conservatively (84.3%), but 14.1% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 0.7% coronary artery bypass surgery. In-hospital composite MAE was 8.8%; peripartum SCAD patients had higher in-hospital MAE (20.6% vs. 8.2%, P=0.023). Overall 30-day MACE was 8.8%. Peripartum SCAD and connective tissue disease were independent predictors of 30-day MACE.

Conclusion

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection predominantly affects women and presents with MI. Despite majority of patients being treated conservatively, survival was good. However, significant cardiovascular complications occurred within 30days. Long-term follow-up and further investigations on management are warranted.

### Risks and benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention in spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^2a366ebb]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

While a conservative approach to revascularisation in SCAD is optimal where possible, sometimes the clinical presentation (STEMI, cardiac arrest, poor TIMI flow and proximal occlusive dissection) mandates intervention to improve coronary perfusion and reduce myocardial injury. This study demonstrates that although more extensive stenting may be required, with an elevated risk of procedural complications, improved coronary flow and good medium-term outcomes can be achieved with PCI. More extensive dissection, proximal segment location and an absence of contrast penetration of the false lumen associate with the highest risk of PCI complications.

### Interventional versus conservative strategy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissections: insights from DISCO registry [^8850a4f2]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Our analysis expands the current knowledge by investigating a larger cohort derived from several Italian and Spanish centers. Among revascularized patients, we restricted the analysis to those treated with PCI, by far the most adopted revascularization strategy at present. Although we confirmed the overall trend toward a conservative approach, the proportion of patients treated with PCI was higher than several previous studies,,– which, at least in part, might have resulted from the lack of a standardized treatment protocol across the participating centers. In agreement with the existing evidence, revascularized patients were those perceived at higher risk. However, it is not surprising that the angiographic subtype 2B portended a conservative management, as, in this SCAD phenotype, the hematoma extends toward the far periphery of the coronary tree,discouraging an interventional approach.

In line with previous reports –,, procedural success was as high as 75% in our immediate PCI arm, and, as opposed to another cohort study,there was no need for emergency coronary artery bypass graft as a result of procedural failure, suggesting that PCI may be effectively performed in appropriately selected patients. We did not appreciate significant differences in the rate of in-hospital adverse events between the treatment strategies. In this regard, differently from the previous literature, we also provide an estimation of hemorrhagic events, which were rare and all nonmajor. We also found substantial equipoise between the strategies with respect to clinical outcomes. Notably, the frequency of all-cause mortality was very low in both arms (<1% at 2-year follow-up), and all deaths occurred during hospital stay. Therefore, in case the clinical judgment favors an interventional approach, PCI does not seem to expose patients with SCAD to an excess of adverse events, even if the interventional strategy is adopted in those who are deemed, at baseline, at higher risk. Notably, this finding is in contrast with previous meta-analyses suggesting heightened risk of target vessel revascularization in patients treated with an interventional approach. With regard to the abovementioned studies, however, it should be noted that the disadvantage of PCI was primarily driven by older reports,, in which contemporary revascularization techniques were likely unavailable or poorly implemented.

Although the frequency of secondary events among patients with SCAD varies widely in the literature,recent estimates indicate SCAD recurrence (extension, de novo recurrent, iatrogenic dissection) occurs in 27% of patients within the first year.A recent prospective multicenter study determined that at a median follow‐up of 3 years, ≈10% of patients had a SCAD recurrence.Other studies have reported that major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke/transient ischemic attack, death) are experienced by 20% to 30% of patients within 3 years of the initial SCAD event.Recurrent chest pain in the post‐SCAD setting is common, afflicting approximately half of all patients.Depressed mood (20%–41%),anxiety (14%–71%),,and posttraumatic stress symptoms (23%–43%)are pervasive among patients with SCAD, reflecting rates 3 to 4 times higher than the general population. Notably, prospective studies are lacking in this area. Recommendations for the convalescence of patients with SCAD have been provided in contemporary reviews,,,and 2 scientific statements,,but clinical guidelines for this patient population have yet to be developed. The targeted content, delivery, and outcomes of interventions that demonstrate the most benefit for this population remain unclear.

### Clinical implications of the "Broken line" angiographic pattern in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^6f43bd6b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but increasingly recognized cause of acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography remains the best diagnostic tool; however, clinical suspicion and experience is required to interpret angiographic findings. This study sought to assess the clinical implications of the "broken line" (BKL) angiographic pattern in a large, nationwide, cohort of patients with SCAD. The Spanish SCAD registry (NCT03607981) prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with SCAD. All angiograms were centrally analyzed and the BKL pattern was systematically assessed. The BKL angiographic pattern was found in 64 of 389 patients (16%). Patients with the BKL appearance were more frequently female (97 vs 87%, p <0.05), presented more often as intramural hematoma (83 vs 58%, p <0.001), had longer lesions (47 ± 29 vs 36 ± 22 mm, p <0.01), and had severe tortuosity (25 vs 10%, p <0.01) but showed better initial coronary flow (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow 2.6 ± 0.8 vs 2.1 ± 1.2, p <0.01). Patients with BKL received more frequently conservative medical management (91 vs 76%, p <0.01). At late clinical follow-up (median 29 months, interquartile range 17 to 38) predefined adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, recurrent SCAD, or stroke) occurred less frequently (3.5 vs 15%, p <0.05) in patients with the BKL appearance. The better clinical outcomes of patients in the BKL group persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted hazard ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 0.9, p <0.05). In conclusion, patients with SCAD presenting the BKL angiographic pattern are more frequently female and present more often as intramural hematoma with longer lesions and severe vessel tortuosity but have better coronary flow. Patients with the BKL morphology have a favorable prognosis (NCT03607981).

### Interventional versus conservative strategy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissections: insights from DISCO registry [^200d844e]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the DISCO cohort, most patients were conservatively managed, yet PCI was eventually adopted in around one-third of them. ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction at presentation, the involvement of a proximal coronary segment, a suboptimal TIMI flow in the culprit vessel at first coronary angiogram, and an increasing severity of luminal narrowing independently predicted the choice of PCI as initial strategy, whereas the 2B-angiographic subtype was the only predictor of medical management. No significant differences were detected in terms of in-hospital and mid-term outcomes.

SCAD is increasingly recognized as an important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in young females. Unlike atherothrombosis, SCAD is presumed to result from the development of a parietal hematoma within the tunica media or, less frequently, between the intima and the media, leading to ab extrinseco lumen obstruction.Based on this pathophysiology, key differences with atherosclerotic disease exist from an interventional standpoint. First, as intramural hematoma does not always communicate with the true arterial lumen, inside-out wall compression during coronary balloon inflation or stent placement potentially results in hematoma squeezing, leading to SCAD propagation. Moreover, the risk of iatrogenic dissection in patients with SCAD is higher than usual, especially as a result of aggressive guiding catheter manipulation and deep coronary intubation.Further drawbacks of coronary intervention include accidental wiring of the false lumen and stent malapposition due to late hematoma resorption.Thereby, coronary revascularization, and particularly PCI, is associated with high procedural risks and increased frequency of failure in SCAD. On this basis, caution is advocated by expert consensus documents, which favor a conservative approach when there is no hemodynamical instability, ongoing ischemia, or compromised epicardial flow. Noteworthy, most SCAD heal spontaneously over a short-to-mid-term follow-up. Despite accumulating studies,,– only few authors have specifically investigated the distinctive features of revascularized patients with SCAD, as well as their clinical outcomes, as compared to those who are medically treated.

### Improvement of symptoms and coronary perfusion gradient with mechanical left ventricular unloading in flow-limiting complex spontaneous coronary artery dissection, without revascularization [^9b24fb61]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) can lead to acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death, particularly in young women. Observational data show that, in SCAD patients, both percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting seem to be hampered by higher technical complexity, lower success rates, and worse outcomes. As spontaneous healing is a common occurrence, expert consensus advices medical management of the acute phase, when feasible. We present the case of a young woman with SCAD of left anterior descending artery causing myocardial infarction with ST‐segment elevation. High‐anatomical complexity and unstable conditions of the patient made both medical management and immediate revascularization unfeasible options. Therefore, we decided to implant a percutaneous off‐loading mechanical support device to improve coronary perfusion pressure by unloading the left ventricle and preserve cardiac function, preventing worse complications of acute myocardial infarction. This strategy was successful in stabilizing the patient, until the definitive revascularization treatment became an option.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: clinical implications and diagnostic challenges. overlooked and underappreciated in Asia? [^5dfa7d42]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

There is currently no guideline directed medical therapy for SCAD. However, there is expert consensus that since the pathophysiology and disease progression differ greatly, medical treatment of SCAD cannot be extrapolated from treatment of usual atherosclerotic coronary disease. The routine use of heparin and dual antiplatelet therapy may result in increased intramural bleeding and further complications in SCAD patients. The recommendation is to give single agent antiplatelet therapy instead, and continuation beyond 1 year should be made on a case‐by‐case basis, taking into account the bleeding risk and benefits of therapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated if SCAD patients had coronary stents implanted to prevent stent‐related thrombosis. Regarding anticoagulation, heparin may be used during revascularization with PCI if indicated. However, long‐term anticoagulation therapy is recommended only where there is a clear clinical indication such as left ventricular thrombus formation or atrial fibrillation. Statin therapy should not be routine in SCAD and should be initiated according to guideline‐based indications for primary prevention of atherosclerosis. Beta‐blockers for those with depressed left ventricular function, hypertension, or arrhythmias have been shown to be helpful. Lastly, antianginals have been shown to have a role in symptomatic treatment of chest pain syndromes post‐SCAD, but routine use is not required in asymptomatic patients. 1

Recurrent de novo SCAD has been reported in 10% of patients. A 2‐fold increase of recurrent SCAD is seen in those with hypertension. Secondary prevention with beta‐blocker should be considered. By reducing arterial shear stress, hypertension, and myocardial contractility beta‐blockers seem to play a pivotal role in protecting patients from further coronary dissection. Management of emotional and physical stressors through tailored exercise programs and psychosocial counseling also help. Illicit drug use of methamphetamine and cocaine should be addressed. Further pregnancy after a diagnosis of SCAD has usually been discouraged by the medical community, although this life changing advice has been based on few case reports and series. 10

Cardiac rehabilitation is fundamental in recovery. Patients reported less chest pain and improved quality of life scores in depression, anxiety and stress level at the end of a dedicated rehabilitation program. 24 There was also lower MACE rates in rehabilitation participants (4.3%) vs the nonparticipating group (26.2%). Long‐term prognosis is usually good for those who survive the initial episode, although the risk of recurrence has been reported to be up to 22%. 3 Pregnancy is generally discouraged in patients diagnosed with SCAD, and strict contraceptive advice should be given if the affected women are in the reproductive age group.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): a contemporary review [^07d54439]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

6.5 Prognosis

Long‐term survival in SCAD is excellent, with low rates of mortality (0.8%) out to 3 years in the CanSCAD study cohort, the majority of whom were treated conservatively.Rates of recurrent MI and de novo recurrent SCAD were similarly low (9.9% and 2.4%, respectively), compared to previously published smaller, retrospective cohorts. These findings may have been due also to the high rate of aspirin (93.7%) and beta‐blocker (84.3%) administration in the CanSCAD study. Notably, pregnancy‐associated SCAD was associated with increased in‐hospital, 30‐day and 3‐year event rates, consistent with other reports and denoting that this entity is likely a more severe phenotype. Other independent predictors of 3‐year MACE were genetic disorders and extra‐coronary FMD.

Despite a relatively good long‐term prognostic outlook for SCAD patients, many still suffer from significant psychosocial morbidity in the form of recurrent nonischemic chest pain and anxiety or depression. Routine clinical follow‐up of SCAD patients is paramount, and the clinician should be vigilant for signs or symptoms of in‐stent restenosis or recurrent SCAD. However, the evaluation of chest pain can be challenging, and often results in frequent evaluations, diagnostic testing and a substantial psychosocial burden. Further studies are required to explore strategies to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Risks and benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention in spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^51226e2d]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) practice in an international cohort of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). To explore factors associated with complications and study angiographic and longer term outcomes.

Methods

SCAD patients (n=215, 94% female) who underwent PCI from three national cohort studies were investigated and compared with a matched cohort of conservatively managed SCAD patients (n=221).

Results

SCAD-PCI patients were high risk at presentation with only 8.8% undergoing PCI outside the context of ST-elevation myocardial infarction/cardiac arrest, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0/1 flow or proximal dissections. PCI complications occurred in 38.6% (83/215), with 13.0% (28/215) serious complications. PCI-related complications were associated with more extensive dissections (multiple vs single American Heart Association coronary segments, OR 1.9 (95% CI: 1.06-3.39),p=0.030), more proximal dissections (proximal diameter per mm, OR 2.25 (1.38-3.67), p=0.001) and dissections with no contrast penetration of the false lumen (Yip-Saw 2 versus 1, OR 2.89 (1.12-7.43), p=0.028). SCAD-PCI involved long lengths of stent (median 46mm, IQR: 29-61mm). Despite these risks, SCAD-PCI led to angiographic improvements in those with reduced TIMI flow in 84.3% (118/140). Worsening TIMI flow was only seen in 7.0% (15/215) of SCAD-PCI patients. Post-PCI major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and left ventricular function outcomes were favourable.

Conclusion

While a conservative approach to revascularisation is favoured, SCAD cases with higher risk presentations may require PCI. SCAD-PCI is associated with longer stent lengths and a higher risk of complications but leads to overall improvements in coronary flow and good medium-term outcomes in patients.

### Interventional versus conservative strategy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissections: insights from DISCO registry [^62377e2a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Strengths

This analysis is limited by its retrospective and observational design. We cannot exclude selection bias as well as the influence of potential confounders. Furthermore, some key information might have been not collected, and the accuracy of the analysis might be affected by missing values. However, it should be also acknowledged that observational studies represent the main source of knowledge in the rare and complex field of SCAD,as conducting adequately-powered randomized studies will always be challenging. Although our study represents one of the largest SCAD cohorts studied so far, the absolute number of patients remains low, which, together with the low incidence of adverse events, significantly limits the statistical power, affecting both the comparison of clinical events rates and the multivariable analysis. For these reasons, our findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating. MACE (death, MI, target lesion revascularization) might not reflect some of the technical issues derived from complex interventions in patients with SCAD (such as loss of side branches, inadequate final TIMI flow, larger MI). Type 4 SCAD represents a scenario where SCAD diagnosis and treatment can be even more challenging than other subtypes. Although we do not provide specific analyses in this regard, a subanalysis of the DISCO registry has been recently published.

Finally, intravascular imaging use was not as high as in other series., However, it is in line with some seminal articles in the field. It should be noted that, despite being of undoubtful help for SCAD diagnosis, intravascular imaging still remains an ancillary technique, as diagnosis and classification of SCAD are in fact based on angiographic appearance according to expert consensus documents. Furthermore, the central adjudication of angiographic images guarantees the appropriateness of SCAD diagnosis.

Conclusions

The choice between medical or interventional management of SCAD is driven by clinical presentation and procedural aspects, including stenosis severity, the angiographic type of SCAD, and the involvement of proximal coronary segments. In this DISCO cohort subanalysis, the primary treatment approach was not associated with different short-to-mid-term adverse events, although the limited sample size and the observational design necessarily make these results hypothesis-generating.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection and evidence-based medicine [^c0f18da7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively newly diagnosed area, and evidence-based medicine (EBM) standards are emerging and currently include an aspirin, β blocker, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blocker for patients with hypertension, vascular abnormality imaging, and cardiac rehabilitation. Because SCAD is an uncommon condition, many providers are unfamiliar with EBM treatment standards which could affect the implementation of recommended treatment. This study documented the frequency of failure to meet EBM SCAD treatment standards and factors contributing to conformance failure. Patients who presented to a tertiary referral hospital from January 1, 2005, to July 6, 2020, were included. The electronic medical record was reviewed for EBM treatment. Patients who did not meet the criteria of EBM were contacted by phone for a phone interview. The study period included 118 patients with SCAD, 3 of whom (2.5%) died and were not eligible for this study. In the final cohort of 115 patients, the average age was 55 years, female gender (97%) and EBM standards were met in 30%. Of patients who participated in the phone interview, 38 (33%) reported frustration with SCAD misdiagnosis (39%), inadequate mental health resources (37%), and communication failure regarding the need for cardiologist follow-up (26%). Cardiac rehabilitation use was impacted by location, time of day, availability, and cost. The most common medication-limiting factor for β-blocker usage was fatigue (15%). Most (59%) patients did not undergo fibromuscular dysplasia imaging. In conclusion, in this 15-year SCAD study from a single tertiary care hospital SCAD registry, only 30% met the current EBM for SCAD. Unique solutions that are both patient-informed and evidence-driven are needed to achieve the best clinical outcomes.

### Revascularization in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: where are we now? [^8e7bf643]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Which Patients With SCAD Should Undergo Revascularization?

The decision to revascularize patients with SCAD is challenging, given the associated complications and technical difficulties. An assessment of the clinical presentation and angiographic features is critical when determining whether, when, and how to revascularize patients with SCAD. Invasive coronary angiography is the diagnostic modality of choice for SCAD, which according to the Saw classification, can be angiographically classified into 3 types.(Figure) The angiographic characteristics of type 1 SCAD include a dissection flap, false lumen appearance, contrast staining of the arterial wall, and late contrast clearing. Type 2 SCAD consists of a long diffuse (usually >30 mm) lesion with abrupt changes in the arterial caliber from its normal diameter to diffuse smooth narrowing. Type 2 SCAD can also be classified into type 2A (diffuse narrowing bordered by normal artery segments) and 2B (diffuse narrowing extending to the apical tip of the artery). Similar to atherosclerosis, the angiographic characteristics of type 3 SCAD include single or multiple focal stenoses attributable to intramural hematoma. In patients with high clinical suspicion for SCAD (eg, young women with AMI and no cardiovascular risk factors), SCAD should be initially evaluated by prompt coronary angiography, with particular emphasis on identifying type 1 and 2 SCAD. Intracoronary imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be further required to distinguish between specific SCAD types, especially between type 3 SCAD and coronary atherosclerotic disease. The aforementioned angiographic classification assists with angiographic recognition of SCAD as an entity but does not direct the choice of therapy and has not been shown to impact outcomes. Patients with SCAD with completely occluded coronary arteries subtending a large area of jeopardized myocardium, cardiogenic shock, active/ongoing ischemia with persistent compromise in coronary blood flow, hemodynamic instability, ventricular arrhythmias, STEMI, and high‐risk anatomy (eg, TIMI flow 0–1, left main dissection and proximal dissection) should be considered for revascularization.In addition, the classification of SCAD by the presence or absence of IMH, presence of additional intimal dissections, and length/stenosis parameters can inform the clinician as to the patient's risk of early serious SCAD extension. In a retrospective study of 240 patients with SCAD, Waterbury et al found that the angiographic finding of isolated IMH (ie, absence of intimal tear) was associated with a higher risk of early clinically important extension of SCAD in patients treated with conservative management.Lesion length and stenosis severity were additional parameters that conferred a higher risk of acute extension. Angiographic features may be dynamic, as recurrent SCAD often involves coronary segments not affected previously and may manifest as a different angiographic type than that of the initial presentation.

### Outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^d201eb29]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In a retrospective study of 40 patients with SCAD, the vast majority were women, with a low rate of risk factors for IHD. There was a strong association of SCAD with FMD, although only 48% of the cohort was screened. An interesting association is that with migraine headache, which may be pathophysiologically linked. We recommend that all patients with SCAD are screened for FMD and close follow-up is required given the risk of recurrent events. Further studies are needed to assess the pathogenesis, association with migraines and appropriate management strategies.

### Antiplatelet therapy in patients with conservatively managed spontaneous coronary artery dissection from the multicentre DISCO registry [^f9c067e4]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

The role of antiplatelet therapy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) undergoing initial conservative management is still a matter of debate, with theoretical arguments in favour and against its use. The aims of this article are to assess the use of antiplatelet drugs in medically treated SCAD patients and to investigate the relationship between single (SAPT) and dual (DAPT) antiplatelet regimens and 1-year patient outcomes.

Methods and Results

We investigated the 1-year outcome of patients with SCAD managed with initial conservative treatment included in the DIssezioni Spontanee COronariche (DISCO) multicentre international registry. Patients were divided into two groups according to SAPT or DAPT prescription. Primary endpoint was 12-month incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as the composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and any unplanned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Out of 314 patients included in the DISCO registry, we investigated 199 patients in whom SCAD was managed conservatively. Most patients were female (89%), presented with acute coronary syndrome (92%) and mean age was 52.3 ± 9.3 years. Sixty-seven (33.7%) were given SAPT whereas 132 (66.3%) with DAPT. Aspirin plus either clopidogrel or ticagrelor were prescribed in 62.9% and 36.4% of DAPT patients, respectively. Overall, a 14.6% MACE rate was observed at 12 months of follow-up. Patients treated with DAPT had a significantly higher MACE rate than those with SAPT [18.9% vs. 6.0% hazard ratios (HR) 2.62; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.22-5.61; P = 0.013], driven by an early excess of non-fatal MI or unplanned PCI. At multiple regression analysis, type 2a SCAD (OR: 3.69; 95% CI 1.41-9.61; P = 0.007) and DAPT regimen (OR: 4.54; 95% CI 1.31-14.28; P = 0.016) resulted independently associated with a higher risk of 12-month MACE.

Conclusions

In this European registry, most patients with SCAD undergoing initial conservative management received DAPT. Yet, at 1-year follow-up, DAPT, as compared with SAPT, was independently associated with a higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events (ClinicalTrial.gov id: NCT04415762).
