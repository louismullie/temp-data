## Question

Pneumobilia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pneumobilia, specifically seeking a stepwise expert analysis with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pneumobilia and distinguishing it from portal venous gas. Then, I should categorize etiologies and map them to imaging patterns. Next, I will review imaging modalities and diagnostic pitfalls, followed by a focused differential diagnosis. After that, I need to outline management strategies by etiology, including when to observe versus intervene. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with key takeaways and prognostic implications.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core pathophysiology. Pneumobilia is air within the biliary tree, typically reflecting an abnormal biliary–enteric communication or sphincter incompetence that permits retrograde gas entry from the duodenum; it is distinct from portal venous gas, which tracks peripherally with portal venous flow and signals a different set of emergencies, so I need to ensure I do not conflate these entities on imaging [^114W1jfM] [^115iPAW7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes before I categorize them. I should group etiologies into iatrogenic, spontaneous fistulous, sphincter-related, infectious, and miscellaneous categories to anchor the differential and guide workup. Iatrogenic causes include post-ERCP sphincterotomy, biliary stenting, and biliary–enteric anastomoses; spontaneous fistulas arise from cholecystoenteric or choledochoduodenal communications, often in the setting of chronic cholecystitis and gallstone disease; sphincter of Oddi incompetence can be primary or secondary; gas-forming bacterial cholangitis is a rarer infectious cause; and miscellaneous associations include trauma and postoperative states, so I should keep these buckets in mind as I interpret imaging [^116PRrUg] [^117Ug22U] [^111vys2H] [^11166WTC] [^1116YZQx] [^114W1jfM] [^113eq7qa].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging patterns that help distinguish pneumobilia from portal venous gas. On CT, pneumobilia tends to be central and follows the branching pattern of the bile ducts, whereas portal venous gas extends peripherally toward the subcapsular liver. On ultrasound, pneumobilia appears as echogenic foci within the ducts, while portal venous gas shows echogenic specks moving with portal flow and may show bidirectional spikes on spectral Doppler, so I should double-check the distribution and dynamics before assigning significance [^115iPAW7] [^114oBhBT].

> I will now examine the role of different imaging modalities. CT is the workhorse because it detects pneumobilia with high sensitivity and can localize obstructing stones and fistulous tracts. Ultrasound can suggest pneumobilia but is operator dependent and limited by bowel gas. MRCP can be confounded by susceptibility artifacts from gas and may mimic stones, so I should be cautious and correlate with other sequences or modalities when pneumobilia is suspected. Plain radiography may show Rigler's triad in gallstone ileus but has limited sensitivity, so I should not rely on it to exclude disease [^117A99H8] [^113fL8zB] [^113NLhBq].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis systematically. In a post-ERCP patient, pneumobilia is often expected and benign. In an older woman with prior gallstones and obstructive symptoms, I should think gallstone ileus or Bouveret syndrome. In a patient with peptic ulcer disease and pneumobilia, a choledochoduodenal fistula becomes likely. In a patient with emphysematous cholecystitis, gas can extend into ducts. And in a patient with no clear cause, sphincter incompetence or an occult fistula should be considered, so I need to align the imaging with history and exam to avoid premature closure [^117Ug22U] [^112VG5yX] [^111wkDhL] [^112QTbYp] [^114W1jfM].

> Next, I should review management by etiology, starting with iatrogenic pneumobilia. Post-ERCP pneumobilia is common and often requires no intervention, but I should confirm stent position and patency and counsel on increased risks of multiple stone recurrences and cholangitis; if pneumobilia resolves after stent placement, that change is highly specific for stent occlusion, so I should act on that signal with ERCP reassessment rather than ignore it [^117Ug22U] [^116PRrUg] [^116ZGtGx].

> For spontaneous biliary–enteric fistulas, I need to ensure I do not conflate observation with cure. While some advocate nonoperative management in stable patients, the risk of recurrent obstruction, cholangitis, and nutritional compromise is substantial, and most patients ultimately require enterolithotomy with or without cholecystectomy and fistula repair. Endoscopic extraction can be attempted in Bouveret syndrome, but success varies and surgical backup is prudent, so I should tailor the approach to patient physiology and local expertise [^1114r5hx] [^112VG5yX] [^112G2ESu].

> But wait, what if the pneumobilia reflects sphincter of Oddi incompetence without a fistula. I should confirm the absence of stones, strictures, or tumors and consider conservative management with surveillance, recognizing that some cases remain idiopathic and benign; however, if symptoms or infections recur, I should reconsider the possibility of an occult fistula or structural lesion and escalate imaging accordingly [^114W1jfM] [^116SYevp].

> I need to check for infectious or inflammatory mimics. Emphysematous cholecystitis can seed gas into the biliary tree and mandates urgent source control; gas-forming bacterial cholangitis is rare but life-threatening and requires prompt antibiotics and biliary drainage, so I should not dismiss pneumobilia in a septic patient without evaluating for these entities [^112QTbYp] [^114W1jfM].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts. In neonates and infants, portal venous gas predominates and pneumobilia is uncommon, so if I see biliary air I should verify the diagnosis and look for congenital anomalies or iatrogenic causes. In postoperative patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy or hepaticojejunostomy, pneumobilia is expected and can help identify anastomoses. In trauma, pneumobilia is rare but reported, so I should correlate with mechanism and associated injuries before attributing significance [^114oBhBT] [^111vys2H] [^113eq7qa].

> I should double-check prognostic implications tied to pneumobilia. Post-ERCP pneumobilia correlates with higher risks of multiple stone recurrences and cholangitis even without demonstrable stones, and after pancreaticoduodenectomy, the presence of pneumobilia is a strong independent risk factor for refractory cholangitis, so I should use these signals to intensify follow-up and consider prophylactic strategies when appropriate [^116PRrUg] [^113Znvjh].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical algorithm. If pneumobilia is found, I will first confirm the imaging pattern and exclude portal venous gas. Then I will categorize the likely etiology using history, prior procedures, and concurrent findings. If post-ERCP or postoperative, I will observe and ensure stent or anastomosis integrity. If spontaneous and complicated by obstruction or cholangitis, I will plan enterolithotomy with fistula management. If uncomplicated and idiopathic, I will observe with close follow-up and low threshold to re-image if symptoms evolve, ensuring I do not miss a fistula or stone [^115iPAW7] [^112VG5yX] [^1114r5hx].

> In summary, I need to ensure that pneumobilia is interpreted in context: it is a sign, not a diagnosis, and its significance ranges from benign expected post-procedural air to a herald of gallstone ileus or biliary sepsis. By integrating imaging patterns, clinical history, and risk stratification, I can avoid unnecessary interventions while promptly treating life-threatening causes, and I should maintain vigilance for complications such as recurrent stones, cholangitis, and fistula-related obstruction throughout follow-up [^114W1jfM] [^112VG5yX] [^116PRrUg].

Pneumobilia is the presence of air in the biliary tree, most often due to **biliary-enteric fistula** or **post-sphincterotomy/ERCP** [^114W1jfM] [^116PRrUg]. It is best diagnosed by **CT**, which shows air tracking with the bile ducts and helps distinguish it from portal venous gas [^115iPAW7]. Management targets the cause: **surgery for fistula or obstruction** [^1114r5hx], and **endoscopic therapy for stones or strictures** [^111YBEBw]; pneumobilia alone without symptoms may be observed [^116SYevp]. Complications include cholangitis, biliary obstruction, and gallstone ileus, so **prompt recognition and targeted therapy are essential** [^11166WTC] [^116PRrUg].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Pneumobilia arises from **abnormal biliary-enteric communication** or **loss of sphincter competence**, allowing enteric gas to reflux into the biliary tree [^114W1jfM]. The **most common causes** include:

- **Biliary-enteric fistulas**: cholecystoduodenal, choledochoduodenal, or cholecystocolonic fistulas, often from chronic cholecystitis, gallstone erosion, or peptic ulcer disease [^11166WTC] [^111wkDhL] [^1114r5hx].

- **Post-ERCP/sphincterotomy**: sphincter of Oddi incompetence or surgical anastomoses (e.g. hepaticojejunostomy) allow reflux [^116PRrUg] [^117Ug22U].

- **Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction**: incompetence permits reflux without fistula [^114W1jfM].

- **Gas-forming bacterial infection**: emphysematous cholecystitis or cholangitis can introduce gas into ducts [^112QTbYp].

---

## Clinical presentation

Pneumobilia is often **incidental**, but symptoms reflect the underlying cause:

- **Asymptomatic**: common when due to sphincterotomy or mild sphincter incompetence [^11166WTC].

- **Biliary colic or jaundice**: from stones, strictures, or fistulas [^116FuyrK].

- **Obstructive symptoms**: nausea, vomiting, distension from gallstone ileus or Bouveret syndrome [^112VG5yX].

- **Cholangitis**: fever, RUQ pain, jaundice, sepsis [^notfound].

---

## Imaging findings

Imaging is **diagnostic**, with **CT the modality of choice**:

| **Modality** | **Findings** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Plain radiography | - Central branching lucencies in the RUQ <br/> - Rigler triad (pneumobilia, SBO, ectopic stone) in gallstone ileus | Low sensitivity; often missed [^113NLhBq] |
| Ultrasound | - Echogenic lines/arcs in ducts with dirty shadowing <br/> - Nondependent, moves with respiration | Operator dependent; bowel gas limits sensitivity [^113ivWTm] |
| CT | - Air tracking with bile ducts <br/> - Central distribution <br/> - Fistula/stone localization <br/> - Differentiates from portal venous gas | Radiation; contrast risks [^notfound] |
| MRI/MRCP | - Signal voids on GRE <br/> - Susceptibility artifact <br/> - May mimic stones | Confounded by gas; less reliable for pneumobilia [^113fL8zB] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key distinction is from **portal venous gas**, which is peripheral and associated with ischemia or sepsis [^115iPAW7]. Other mimics include **intraductal stones** and **postoperative air**.

---

## Management

Management is **cause-directed**:

- **Fistula or obstruction**: cholecystectomy with fistula repair, enterolithotomy, or bypass [^1114r5hx].

- **Stones/strictures**: ERCP with stone extraction, balloon dilation, or stenting [^112bqT1H].

- **Infection**: antibiotics and source control (e.g. cholecystectomy, drainage) [^112QTbYp].

- **Asymptomatic pneumobilia**: observation with follow-up [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Untreated pneumobilia can lead to:

- **Cholangitis**: recurrent or refractory, especially post-PD [^113Znvjh].

- **Biliary obstruction**: from stones or strictures [^116PRrUg].

- **Gallstone ileus**: small bowel obstruction from impacted stone [^1116YZQx].

- **Bouveret syndrome**: gastric outlet obstruction from duodenal stone [^116JAvDf].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause and comorbidities. Benign causes (e.g. post-ERCP) have **excellent outcomes**, whereas fistulas or obstruction carry higher morbidity and may require surgery [^116PRrUg] [^1114r5hx].

---

Pneumobilia is air in the biliary tree, most often from fistula or sphincter incompetence; **CT is diagnostic** and guides therapy. Management is cause-specific, with surgery for fistula/obstruction and endoscopy for stones/strictures; **asymptomatic cases may be observed** [^115iPAW7] [^1114r5hx] [^111YBEBw] [^111FutrG].

### Pneumatosis intestinalis in the adult: benign to life-threatening causes [^117ENN8K]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The frequency of detection of pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) appears to be increasing. This increase may be the result of increased CT use. New medications and surgical procedures have been reported to be associated with an increase in the incidence of PI. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the imaging features and clinical conditions associated with PI.

Conclusion

This article illustrates the imaging findings of PI due to benign and life-threatening causes, with emphasis placed on describing newly associated conditions and also the imaging appearance on CT.

### More than meets the eye: subtle but important CT findings in bouveret's syndrome [^112DnS97]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Gallstones are a rare cause of duodenal or gastric outlet obstruction and therefore are not commonly suspected. Rigler's radiographic triad of pneumobilia, bowel obstruction, and an ectopic gallstone is seen in few of these patients. The symptoms are insidious and nonspecific, and the diagnosis is usually made radiologically. Although CT scans are far more sensitive, 25% of cases are still missed, often because the size of the offending gallstone is underestimated.

Conclusion

Better assessment of stone size, and therefore higher accuracy of diagnosis, could be achieved if attention is paid to more subtle but nonetheless important signs. These include compressed air in dependent areas of the duodenal lumen, an area of soft-tissue rather than fluid density surrounding the calcified rim of the stone, and a faint radiolucency in or beyond this soft-tissue area that could represent laminations of fat or air in the stone.

- clinical signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or cough, fever, hypoxemia, chest pain

- imaging findings compatible with PCP, preferably chest CT

- with or without unexplained serum LDH elevation.

### Choledochoduodenal fistula: a rare complication of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^111wkDhL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 75-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of melaena and right upper quadrant pain. This was on a background of significant alcohol intake and a complex medical history. He was haemodynamically unstable with investigations indicating a new iron-deficiency anaemia. After resuscitation, urgent intervention was required under general anaesthesia. This involved a triple phase abdominal CT, followed by emergency oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. This revealed deep ulceration with extension to the pancreatic head and common bile duct. There was also evidence of pneumobilia on CT, secondary to a choledochoduodenal fistula. Treatment encompassed an invasive and medical approach. Following treatment, the patient was stable, with follow-up endoscopy exhibiting good duodenal mucosal healing.

Alternatively, PUD may fistulise into the gallbladder or biliary tract, causing superimposition of jaundice and ascending cholangitis on chronic PUD complaints. Spontaneous pneumobilia without previous surgery or instrumentation is the CT hallmark of bilio-digestive fistulas. Other suggestive findings include close adhesion and possible communication between posterior duodenum and either ventral aspect of pancreatic head (Fig. 17) or gallbladder (Fig. 18). The gold standard technique for biliary fistulas, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is often unfeasible because of duodenal deformity and narrowing. Surgical management is indicated in cases refractory to medical therapy. Coledochoduodenal fistulas from PUD are very uncommon compared to cholelithiasis-related perforation into a normal duodenum: the latter are suggested by contracted gallbladder with mural thickening, and may give rise to further complications, such as gallstone ileus and Bouveret syndrome.

### Pneumobilia with gastric outlet obstruction [^112Hgme3]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Complications of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) like gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) and biliary fistula have become extremely rare with the advent of proton-pump inhibitors. This is a case of PUD presenting with GOO, a cholecystoduodenal fistula discovered incidentally on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and the presence of pneumobilia on a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen. A gastrojejunostomy with internal pyloric exclusion was performed. Since the patient did not have any signs of biliary tract disease, we decided not to operate on the fistula to prevent injury to the bile duct. The patient had an uneventful recovery.

Gallbladder pathology

Like acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis can cause inflammatory thickening of the duodenal wall adjacent to the inflamed gallbladder wall (Fig. 19). If this process is long-standing and severe, a gallstone may erode through the gallbladder wall and into the duodenum, resulting in a "gallstone ileus". CT findings include pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, ectopic gallstone, and cholecystoduodenal (or choledocoduodenal) fistulas (Fig. 20). Impaction of a gallstone in the duodenum or stomach via a bilioenteric fistula can cause gastric outlet obstruction (Bouveret syndrome).

### Pneumoperitoneum without peritonitis: a case report [^113qD1vW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum (PP), or air within the abdominal cavity, is frequently the harbinger of serious abdominal pathology and frequently represents visceral perforation. Most cases of PP ultimately need surgical exploration and intervention. In addition, cases of nonsurgical PP have also been described in the literature, and it has been suggested that these cases can be managed conservatively. This report documents the occurrence of incidentally found PP. However, it is unclear how often PP is found incidentally, and more importantly how to manage the patient with clinically unsuspected PP without peritoneal signs. Future research could help to better determine the incidence of unsuspected PP and to validate the various diagnostic and treatment algorithms in the literature.

### "Innocent" pneumobilia… [^111FutrG]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A young woman was found to have pneumobilia during evaluation for right-upperquadrant abdominal pain. Preoperative studies and surgical exploration failed to uncover any cause for the abnormal gas, and it was still present one year postoperatively. There is a discussion of the possible causes and a review of the literature. It is concluded that cholecystectomy is indicated in this rare situation, even in the absence of cholelithiasis, to prevent the later development of ascending cholangitis.

### All about portal vein: a pictorial display to anatomy, variants and physiopathology [^115iPAW7]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Portal venous gas

Portal venous gas (aeroportia) was traditionally considered a life-threatening sign thought to be a finding almost exclusive of advanced mesenteric ischemia. Nowadays, other recognized causes of portal venous gas include inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, bowel distention, intra-abdominal sepsis, trauma, iatrogenic, and idiopathic causes. Imaging findings on CT relates to a linear, branching pattern, or ovoid areas with gas attenuation, within the main PV or its branches (Fig. 20). As aeroportia needs to be distinguished from pneumobilia (gas in bile ducts), it has to be taken into account the pattern of gas distribution: peripheral in portal venous gas, even reaching the sub-capsular areas, and central in pneumobilia, following the direction of the portal venous flow and biliary drainage, respectively.

Fig. 20
Portal venous gas. MPR images from portal venous phase CT shows air branching pattern fulfilling some segments of peripheral right PV branches

Portal hypertension

Clinically significant PH is defined as a portal venous pressure above 10 mmHg, and it is associated with an increased risk of developing varices and variceal bleeding.

When pressure increases, PVS rearranges, and one of the first signs is the increase of veins caliber: PV (> 13 mm), SMV, and splenic vein (> 10 mm). One should note that no significant venous dilatation might be present in PH in case of compensatory portosystemic collateral pathways. In the initial stages of PH increased diameter and tortuosity of hepatic artery and its branches may also be seen, as a result of hepatic venous inflow disturbance. Along with these findings, splenomegaly (Fig. 21) is frequently present, considered when splenic bipolar diameter is increased (> 130 mm in males and > 120 mm in females). In more advanced cases, ascites may occur as a result of decompensated PH. PVS calcification has a strong association with long standing PH, regardless of the underlying etiology (Fig. 21). Causes of PH can be easily identified, and categorized according to its relation to the hepatic sinusoids: pre-sinusoidal [e.g. PV thrombosis, extrinsic compression of PV (Fig. 22 a), tumor invasion (Fig. 22 b)]; sinusoidal (e.g. cirrhosis, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome — previously known as hepatic veno-oclusive disease); and post-sinusoidal (e.g. Budd-Chiari syndrome).

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in adults [^113XFjRg]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Pneumocystis pneumonia:

- **Definition**: PCP is a severe opportunistic fungal infection caused by P. jirovecii, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of PCP involves airborne transmission of the fungus, which then invades lung tissue and adheres to type 1 epithelial cells. The attachment of Pneumocystis to the alveolar epithelium promotes the transition of the organism from the trophic to the cyst form, leading to the production of inflammatory mediators, lung injury, and impaired gas exchange.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of PCP is estimated at 2.2–4.5 per 100,000, with more than 80% occurring in patients without HIV. In the US, approximately 10,500 hospitalizations and 400 deaths are reported annually due to PCP.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PCP include HIV infection with a low CD4+ T-cell count, malignancies, solid organ transplantation, hematologic stem cell transplantation, prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, such as chemotherapy (especially purine analogs), T-cell-depleting agents, TNF-α inhibitors, anti-interleukin 6, anti-CD26, and calcineurin inhibitors.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PCP often presents with a progressive nonproductive cough, exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and fever. Patients with HIV may have an indolent course, while patients without HIV usually present with rapidly progressive onset.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality rate of PCP in patients with and without HIV is estimated at 25% and 33–69%, respectively.

### Spontaneous pneumomediastinum: diagnostic and therapeutic interventions [^115GJ2Hy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pneumomediastinum is an uncommon self-limiting benign condition that is frequently over-investigated and over-treated due to concern for missing an aero-digestive injury. A handful of small case series in the literature have suggested the benign course of this condition, but there are still not clear guidelines regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions needed for patient with spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Our experience with spontaneous pneumomediastinum suggests limiting the use of swallow studies, antibiotics, and dietary restriction to allow for early discharge and better use of hospital resources.

We suggest that a complete blood count and a CT of the chest for all patients. Even for patients with obvious pneumomediastinum on chest x-ray, a CT the chest with intravenous contrast should be obtained since chest x-rays are obviously not sensitive at picking up mild disease or evaluating the chest for pathology. An elevated D-dimer may occur in patient with benign pneumomediastinum in the absence of thromboembolic disease, but leucocytosis is unusual in such patients.

Not all patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum need contrast swallow studies. A contrast swallow study should be obtained for patients with emesis, dysphagia, gastro-intestinal disease, trauma, hemodynamic instability, fever, leucocytosis, pleural effusion, or pneumoperitoneum. While esophageal rupture (Boerhaave's syndrome) is classically described with left-sided pleural effusions, one must be suspected esophageal injury in the presence of any pleural effusion whether it is left or right-sided. The classic Meckler's triad of esophageal rupture includes vomiting, lower chest pain, and cervical subcutaneous emphysema following overindulgence in food or alcohol. Our experience, however, demonstrates that both cervical subcutaneous emphysema and odynophagia are quite common in the setting of benign spontaneous pneumomediastinum, and that patients with either finding do not need an esophageal evaluation.

### Clinical significance of pneumatosis intestinalis-correlation of MDCT-findings with treatment and outcome [^111Qf4Xv]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study including 149 consecutive emergency patients confirmed that PI may be caused by various disorders. However, unlike our initial hypothesis that, today, non-life-threatening aetiologies are commonly associated with PI, possibly more commonly than bowel ischemia, the latter turned out to represent 53.7% of the aetiologies of PI. Thus, in more than half of our patients, PI indicated either primary (i.e. occlusive or non-occlusive vascular origin) or secondary ischemia (i.e. due to bowel obstruction). Each of the other various aetiologies of PI were far less frequent, among them infection being the most common cause, occurring in 18 patients (12.1%).

Furthermore, we initially thought that PI was not, on its own, a good indicator of underlying ischemia. Our findings confirm this hypothesis, but further reveal that when accompanied by PMVG, PI significantly indicates underlying intestinal ischemia. Indeed, among the 69 patients with PI and PMVG in our study, 48 (69.6%) had bowel ischemia. While Heye et al. reported that PMVG located in the arcade vessels was the best indicator for ischemia compared to other, more proximal, sites of PMVG, our study is the first to show a statistically significant correlation for any possible location except for gas located in the superior mesenteric vein. This latter result is likely a random finding and clinically insignificant, since PI and PMVG represent progressive steps in a single pathophysiological process. Gas progressively ascends from the bowel wall to the liver, extending through the arcade veins, the segmental veins, the superior mesenteric vein, and finally into the extra- and intrahepatic portal veins. Nevertheless, although significantly correlated with ischemia in our study, PMVG may result from various other conditions, as reported by Hussain et al. namely the increase of luminal pressure in case of obstructive and non-obstructive bowel dilatation as well as bacterial contamination of the portomesenteric venous system from the digestive tract. However, other MDCT findings, (most helpfully, decreased bowel wall enhancement) may give clues of the underlying disease.

### Pneumatosis intestinalis an increasingly common radiological finding, benign or life-threatening? A case series [^114wiw5E]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

This case series reviews two cases where elderly patients were found to have pneumatosis intestinalis on imaging. The two clinical presentations differed from one another, however, both were managed conservatively to good effect. In case one the patient presented with abdominal pain, a change in bowel habit and weight loss. In case two the patient presented with problematic diarrhoea, reduced oral intake, lethargy and weight loss. Both patients were haemodynamically stable and neither had an abnormal abdominal examination. Case 2 was started on oral metronidazole and by day 11 of treatment there was resolution of the pneumatosis on her abdominal X-ray and her diarrhoea had settled. These two cases illustrate the benefit of conservative management and avoidance of unnecessary surgical intervention in primary pneumatosis intestinalis. However, it is important to distinguish between these benign causes of pneumatosis intestinalis and those which are life-threatening in which surgery may be necessary.

### Impacted gallstone within a cholecystoduodenal fistula: endoscopic laser lithotripsy to the rescue [^116MbRDc]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

We share here the case of a 67-year-old man who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of bloating, chills, and dyspepsia for 2 weeks. He was admitted 3 years earlier for similar symptoms, attributed to symptomatic cholelithiasis. Because his symptoms resolved, elective cholecystectomy was not pursued at that time. A CT scan on admission demonstrated pneumobilia with a large stone within the gallbladder and the question of emphysematous cholecystitis versus biliary enteric fistula (Fig. 1). Due to symptom improvement on antibiotics, he was discharged but returned after MRCP showed choledocholithiasis with bile duct enhancement, previously seen 3.5 cm stone in the gallbladder body, and pneumobilia concerning for a cholecystoduodenal fistula. Because of concerns for cholangitis, GI service was consulted for endoscopic management. EUS assisted delineation of biliary anatomy and was followed by ERCP with removal of purulent debris and 3 stones with a 9- to 12-mm extraction balloon followed by placement of a 10F × 7-cm plastic biliary stent.

### The clinical presentations of ectopic biliary drainage into duodenal bulbus and stomach with a thorough review of the current literature [^1156cEvL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Less invasive or even non-invasive methods can be used for the diagnosis of this condition. Absence of the sphincteric muscle leads to pneumobilia in these cases. Pneumobilia can also be seen in the presence of choledochoduodenal fistula and choledochoduodenostomy. Thus, it is not specific for cases with ectopic biliary drainage problem. Some authors also propose that spontaneous passage of barium into the biliary tree support the diagnosis of ectopic biliary drainage problem. However, a similar finding can also be seen in cases with choledochoduodenostomy.

In the literature, we could not find any data about additional contribution of abdominal ultrasonography to the diagnosis of ectopic biliary drainage. An abdominal ultrasound examination showed dilated stomach in one of our cases admitted for obstructive jaundice. In this case, choledochus was 2.5 cm in maximal diameter and contained similarly large-size stones within its lumen. Though the choledochus was dilated but not tortuosed in appearance, we thought it to be shorter than its normal size. Gastric dilatation was attributed to gastric outlet obstruction due to bulbar ulcer. Thus, abdominal ultrasonography helped us to make an unequivocal diagnosis of ectopic biliary drainage. In the literature, there are case reports favoring the utility of endoscopic ultrasound examination and MR cholangio-pancreatography in the diagnosis of ectopic biliary drainage problem. In a case series of 8 patients with ectopic biliary drainage anomaly, computerized tomography could not reveal any specific finding.

### Bouveret syndrome: approaching the obstructive duodenal gallstone [^114AyGuX]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of 2 weeks of right upper quadrant and epigastric pain that acutely worsened 5 days prior to admission. This was associated with nausea and vomiting. Her medical history was significant for morbid obesity (body mass index 67 kg/m 2), hypothyroidism, hypertension, congestive heart failure and multiple cerebrovascular events on therapeutic rivaroxaban. Her abdomen demonstrated moderate epigastric tenderness without peritoneal signs. Laboratory values were all normal. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast showed a large gallstone causing partial gastric outlet obstruction and pneumobilia (figure 1).

### Gastric pneumatosis: the role of CT in diagnosis and patient management [^111FKX6u]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric pneumatosis is rare, with causes ranging from benign to lethal. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to present a series of cases of gastric pneumatosis, review the causes, and demonstrate how computed tomography (CT) can help guide management. A range of primary gastric pathology can cause air in the wall of the stomach. However, gastric pneumatosis may reflect intraabdominal pathology arising from other hollow viscera, with indicators of the extragastric etiology on CT.

### Gallstone ileus: a review [^117A99H8]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

The imaging findings of intestinal tract dilation showed similar frequency in both abdominal radiography and CT (88% vs 92%); however, CT achieved more than twofold higher rate of diagnosis of ectopic gallstone than radiography (33% vs 81%), which suggests that CT is useful for visualisation of pneumobilia and intestinal calculi.

Several case reports have indicated that contrast-enhanced CT achieves high sensitivity (93%), specificity (100%), and accuracy (99%) in the diagnosis of gallstone ileus. The presence of a fistula can be diagnosed by drip infusion cholangiographic CT to confirm leakage of contrast medium from the biliary system into the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, abdominal ultrasonography can visualise impacted calculus and presence of cholelithiasis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be used to confirm the diagnosis of impacted calculus and internal biliary fistulas such as cholecystointestinal fistulas.

The differential diagnosis includes adhesive ileus in patients with history of abdominal surgery or abdominal radiotherapy, dietary ileus, ileus accompanying gastric calculus, ileus due to ingestion of a foreign object undetectable through radiography, and ileus due to malignant tumour.

### Clinical significance of pneumatosis intestinalis-correlation of MDCT-findings with treatment and outcome [^112jtiH6]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical significance of pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) including the influence on treatment and outcome.

Method and Materials

Two radiologists jointly reviewed MDCT-examinations of 149 consecutive emergency patients (53 women, mean age 64, range 21–95) with PI of the stomach (n = 4), small (n = 68) and/or large bowel (n = 96). PI extension, distribution and possibly associated porto-mesenteric venous gas (PMVG) were correlated with other MDCT-findings, risk factors, clinical management, laboratory, histopathology, final diagnosis and outcome.

Results

The most frequent cause of PI was intestinal ischemia (n = 80,53.7%), followed by infection (n = 18,12.1%), obstructive (n = 12,8.1%) and non-obstructive (n = 10,6.7%) bowel dilatation, unknown aetiologies (n = 8,5.4%), drugs (n = 8,5.4%), inflammation (n = 7,4.7%), and others (n = 6,4%). Neither PI distribution nor extension significantly correlated with underlying ischemia. Overall mortality was 41.6% (n = 62), mostly related to intestinal ischemia (p = 0.003). Associated PMVG significantly correlated with underlying ischemia (p = 0.009), as did the anatomical distribution of PMVG (p = 0.015). Decreased mural contrast-enhancement was the only other MDCT-feature significantly associated with ischemia (p p < 0.001). Elevated white blood count significantly correlated with ischemia (p = 0.03).

Conclusion

In emergency patients, ischemia remains the most common aetiology of PI, showing the highest mortality. PI with associated PMVG is an alerting sign. PI together with decreased mural contrast-enhancement indicates underlying ischemia.

Key Points

- In emergency patients, PI may be caused by various disorders.
- Intestinal ischemia remains the most common cause of PI in acute situations.
- PI associated with decreased mural contrast-enhancement indicates acute intestinal ischemia.
- PI associated with PMVG should alert the radiologist to possible underlying ischemia.

### Major pancreatic resections: normal postoperative findings and complications [^111vys2H]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Pneumobilia-pneumowirsung

Air can be seen in both the biliary tract and lumen of the main pancreatic duct. Pneumobilia is far more common (67–80% of cases) and typically is much more evident in the left biliary tree (Fig. 8 a). The presence of air can be exploited to identify the pancreatic or biliary anastomosis (Fig. 8 b).

Fig. 8
Pneumobilia and pneumowirsung (a, b). a There is a fair amount of air in the main and in left bile ducts (black arrow). The hepaticojejunostomy (white arrow) and anastomotic jejunal loop (j) are visualised. b The pancreas (p), anastomotic jejunal loop (s) and pancreaticojejunostomy (white arrow) are visualised. The main pancreatic duct is mildly dilated with an air bubble within (black arrow)

Perivascular cuffing

Perivascular cuffing is a soft-tissue stranding in the mesenteric fat that can occur within the surgical bed and surrounding the caeliac axis and its branches and the superior mesenteric artery. This cuffing is due to an inflammatory reaction and can be observed in up to 60% of patients. It can potentially be extremely focal and mass-like in appearance (Fig. 9). However, in patients with negative surgical margins, in the first postoperative period this finding should not be mistaken for residual disease or local recurrence.

Fig. 9
Perivascular cuffing. a, b) Axial CT images show a thickening (white arrows in a and b) of the fat tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric vessels in a and caeliac trunk in b. This stranding can be very focal and mass-like. In a, a postoperative reactive thickening of the anterior left pararenal fascia and a fluid collection on the same side (*) are visible

### Cholecystocolonic fistula: an unusual presentation of large bowel obstruction [^1114r5hx]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Historically, CCF was commonly diagnosed intraoperatively at the time of planned cholecystectomy. CT of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast is now considered the gold-standard diagnostic study. However, the classic triad of pneumobilia, bowel dilation, and an ectopic gallstone is observed in less than half of all cases, thus highlighting the ongoing need for appropriate clinical suspicion.

Surgical repair is typically recommended for CCF, but there is no formalized consensus on management. Although attempts at non-operative management may be reasonable in select patients, approximately 74% will require surgical intervention. Case reports of attempted colonoscopic extractions have been described in clinically stable patients, although few are ultimately successful.

Overall survival is 87%, but decreases substantially to 54% in the 21% of patients who present with obvious bowel ischemia or perforation. Of this subset who require emergent surgical intervention, the majority are managed with a colectomy and diverting stoma creation. In clinically stable patients who can be managed less urgently, conflicting data exist regarding the morbidity and mortality of enterolithotomy alone versus enterolithotomy plus cholecystectomy with fistula takedown. Any presence of bowel compromise warrants segmental resection with either primary anastomosis or diversion. Although some patients are brought back for a two-stage operation, it has been shown that leaving the gallbladder and fistula in situ is a safe and feasible option. If a patient's comorbidities and physiology permit and there is not prohibitive cholecystocolonic inflammation present intraoperatively, we will consider a one-stage operation. Otherwise, we most commonly leave the CCF intact in the presence of significant inflammation, bowel ischemia or perforation as well as in frail or unstable patients. If we consider a two-stage operation in a surgically fit patient, the preference is to wait a minimum of 8–12 weeks to address the CCF itself to allow for some inflammatory resolution. Ultimately, both surgical and non-surgical care is likely best tailored to a patient's physiology and comorbid disease as well as the surgeon's preference and skill set.

### Cross-sectional imaging of common and unusual complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^112W4zYk]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

In up to 29% of asymptomatic patients, limited retroperitoneal air observed within 24 h from ERCP may result from excessive insufflation during and after endoscope withdrawal. Although this occurrence is categorised as type IV perforation according to the Stapfer classification (Table 1), we suggest not to emphasise the term "perforation" in the radiological report, since its does not require treatment.

Table 1
Classification of duodenal perforations according to Stapfer et al. (Ref. 8)

Finally, reversible oedematous-type mural thickening consistent with acute duodenitis (Fig. 3) may be observed following therapeutic ERCP.

Role and limitations of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Compared to CT, sonographic investigation of patients with suspected post-ERCP complications is strongly limited by the usual abdominal distension due to ileus, pneumoperitoneum or pneumoretroperitoneum and by its inability to assess pancreatic necrosis and bleeding. Practically, ultrasound may be useful for rapid assessment of the gallbladder and biliary tree (with or without stents) and for follow-up of known collections, and its use is not recommended by current practice guidelines.

An increasingly attractive alternative modality, MRI can image PEAP and abnormal collections without use of ionising radiation, and it is particularly beneficial in young patients. Unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted sequences with and without fat suppression may be complemented with MRCP sequences to assess the biliary and pancreatic ducts and with additional dynamic fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient echo sequences during intravenous gadolinium contrast when pancreatic necrosis is suspected. Furthermore, diffusion-weighted MRI may be more sensitive in detecting cases of mild pancreatic inflammation. However, despite recent technical advancements MRI remains limited in acutely ill or uncooperative patients, and the presence or pneumobilia often renders MRCP sequences uninformative or confusing.

### Anomalous opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb: endoscopic treatment [^1174MnAW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Other imaging studies

All the patients had an abdominal ultrasound imaging. Fourteen (35.9%) had air in the IHBD on transabdominal ultrasound. The CBD and/or IHBD dilation and CBD and/or gall bladder stones were the other frequent findings on ultrasound evaluation. Liver abscesses were detected in one patient by ultrasound also. In 3 (7.7%) patients who had upper gastrointestinal series for abdominal pain, barium reflux into the IHBD was detected. CT was performed in only two patients and findings were nonspecific for ectopic CBD opening into the duodenal bulb except one who had air in the IHBD considering the possibility of abnormality.

### Clinical significance of pneumatosis intestinalis-correlation of MDCT-findings with treatment and outcome [^11156oTG]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Some authors distinguish between a bubbly and a linear pattern of PI seen on MDCT. They advocated a benign origin in case of a bubbly or cystic PI and a malignant (thus life-threatening) aetiology in case of a linear or curvilinear pattern of PI. However, the authors admitted that none of these patterns was pathognomonic of one or the other category. Therefore, we did not consider the appearance of PI, either bubbly or linear, in our study.

There were several limitations to this study. First, the main limitation is that histopathological proof was available in 61% of our patients only (n = 91), since it was impossible to be obtained for all of them. However, it is unrealistic to have a histological proof for all the patients as not all of them were suitable candidates for surgical therapy depending on their medical condition. We tried to compensate for this by thoroughly reviewing the patients' electronic files and taking into account as many anamnestic, clinical, and laboratory findings as possible. Thus, our reference standard was the final diagnosis that was based on the patient's histological result, if available, together with the medical investigations that were performed and the discharge letter. Second, the retrospective character of our study may, by definition, include bias. Third, 46 of the 149 patients (30.8%) included in this study underwent unenhanced MDCT, thus rendering impossible the evaluation of bowel wall enhancement and vascular findings.

In conclusion, our retrospective analysis of 149 emergency patients with PI suggests that bowel ischemia remains the most common cause. Among all the considered clinical signs, laboratory investigations, and MDCT features, concomitant PMVG, decreased bowel wall enhancement, and severe atherosclerosis highly significantly correlate with an ischemic origin of PI. Given the significant relation between ischemic PI and mortality as well as the absence of significant relation between ischemic PI and clinical findings or most laboratory tests, diagnosing the aetiology of PI remains a challenging situation for both the clinician and the radiologist that must not be trivialized.

Fig. 1
Gastroscope Examination. A Gastric pylorus showed massive bile adhesion. B Duodenal bulb mucosa is red and white, with patchy erosion, shallow ulcers and bile outflow

Then, she was admitted to gastrointestinal surgery. Abdominal enhanced CT showed gall bladder absence after cholecystectomy and pneumobilia. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography presented gall bladder absent, intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation. The common bile duct is locally adjacent to the descending duodenum, and appears to be connected, considering a choledochoduodenal fistula formed (Fig. 2). The general surgeon considered the patient with operation indications, and the patient was advised to undergo surgery. After the patient completed the cardiopulmonary function tests, excluded surgical contraindications, she received surgical treatment in December 2020. Choledochoduodenal fistula was verified during the operation, and distal gastrectomy + gastrojejunostomy Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed. After surgery, the patient's cough symptoms were significantly improved.

### Cross-sectional imaging of common and unusual complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^113ikojH]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Stent-related complications

Relatively rare, early complications after biliary stenting include haemorrhage (Fig. 10), PEAP, stent misplacement, perforation (Fig. 19) and injury to the CBD or main pancreatic duct.

Fig. 19
In a 60-year-old male with severe chronic calcific pancreatitis, after ERCP positioning of the metallic pancreatic stent (arrowhead in a) contrast-enhanced CT showed minimal intraperitoneal air (*), which was treated conservatively with success.

Chronic stent-related complications are more common and include stent obstruction (25–35% of patients), migration, fracture or collapse, infections such cholangitis, liver abscess (Fig. 18) or sepsis. Biliary stent dislodgement (Fig. 18) occurs after a variable time interval in up to 6% of patients and is more frequent with plastic stents compared to SEMS. Displacement may be proximal, particularly in patients with malignant obstruction, or alternatively distal to the intestine, the latter not unusually asymptomatic.

### Laparoscopic surgery for gallstone ileus [^114aiWQp]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present a case of a woman in her 70s who arrived in the emergency department with signs of small-bowel obstruction. CT scanning revealed acute cholecystitis with a cholecystoduodenal fistula, pneumobilia and small-bowel obstruction possibly secondary to gallstone ileus although no radio-opaque gallstones were seen. The patient underwent an emergency operation and intra-operative findings revealed mechanical small-bowel obstruction of the proximal jejunum where a 4×2 x 3 cm gallstone was impacted. A laparoscopic-assisted enterotomy was performed with stone extraction and primary closure. The patient made a full recovery. A planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy and repair of cholecystoduodenal fistula is scheduled on elective basis.

### Esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis with subsequent pneumoporta and intramural duodenal hematoma after endoscopic hemostasis: a case report [^1145GAN4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Traditionally, once the pneumoporta is recognized along with PI, surgical intervention is preferred due to the concern of having ischemic bowel. But, PI is a radiological finding with wide spectrum of clinical severity and outcome. Surgical or conservative treatment should be considered according to the underlying etiology. In this patient, esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis and intramural duodenal hematoma were resolved spontaneously six days later. Therefore, we suggest that conservative treatment and close clinical assessment should be considered as an initial management for patients who complicate with IDH and PI after an endoscopic procedure. But, surgery is needed for those patients if the diseases progress or complications persist.

An 87-year-old woman presented to us with a 5-day history of worsening epigastric pain and vomiting. Her medical history included known gallstones and a previous episode of acute cholecystitis complicated by a perforated gallbladder for which she had declined surgery 5 years prior. Radiological imaging confirmed a large gallstone impacted in the first part of the duodenum with gross gastric outlet obstruction and pneumobilia, confirming the diagnosis of Bouveret syndrome, an often overlooked and rare variant of gallstone ileus. Following an unsuccessful oesophagogastroduodenoscopy for stone retrieval, she underwent a laparotomy and gastrotomy with a successful outcome and discharged from hospital 4 weeks following the procedure.

### Bouveret syndrome: a rare form of gallstone ileus [^1114vQUZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 57-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of worsening right upper quadrant pain, bilious emesis and approximately 20 pounds of weight loss. The patient was afebrile, without jaundice and had mild tenderness in her right upper quadrant. She noted an incidental finding of asymptomatic cholelithiasis on imaging 4years earlier. An abdominal radiograph revealed pneumobilia and a large ectopic calculus. An abdominal CT scan confirmed pneumobilia, a large concretion completely obstructing the third portion of the duodenum and a soft tissue communication between the gallbladder and proximal duodenum. She was brought to the operating room for definitive treatment and had the obstructing gallstone removed via a transverse duodenotomy. Bouveret syndrome is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction that requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. It should be considered in older patients with clinical evidence of gastric or duodenal obstruction, particularly with a history of cholelithiasis.

Portal venous gas

PVG is seen as echogenic foci within the portal venous system or in a branched pattern within the distal liver parenchyma, corresponding with portal venous branch vessels (figure 12). It may be seen moving distally within the central vessels on cine clips. On spectral Doppler waveforms, it is seen as sharp bidirectional spikes superimposed on the underlying waveform.

Figure 12
Shadowing hyperechoic foci within the right portal vein consistent with portal venous gas (arrows).

PVG is caused by intramural gas extending to the mesenteric venous system and passing into the portal venous system. As this is transient, it has a low sensitivity but high specificity for diagnosing definite NEC. The amount of PVG does not directly correlate with the amount of pneumatosis. Therefore, although presence can establish the diagnosis of NEC, it is of limited value in terms of clinical management beyond this. Specifically, PVG does not have a strong association with overall outcomes and has not been found to be a predictor of surgical necessity. Treatment should be determined by clinical findings as non-surgical management may be sufficient.

Pitfalls: umbilical venous catheter manipulation can cause iatrogenic PVG; however, this can usually be determined based on history. Pneumobilia, or air within the bile ducts, can appear similar, however should be more centrally located than PVG and is uncommon in the neonatal period.

An overview for quick clinical reference of the key findings and their relative significance are summarised in box 3.

### Risk factors for recurrent bile duct stones after endoscopic papillotomy [^115iGCiW]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The long term outcome of endoscopic papillotomy (EPT) is not well known. The aims of this study were to clarify the clinical course of post-EPT patients and to detect predictors for bile duct stone recurrence.

Methods

A total of 1042 consecutive patients who underwent EPT for bile duct stones from December 1975 to September 1998 were prospectively followed up. Patients were divided into four groups according to gall bladder (GB) status: "acalculous GB" group, "calculous GB" group, "cholecystectomy" group, and "prior cholecystectomy" group. Reliable follow up information was obtained for 983 (94.3%) of the 1042 patients. The following factors were considered in the evaluation of predisposing risk factors for recurrence of bile duct stones: age, sex, gall bladder status, periampullary diverticulum, number of bile duct stones, diameter of bile duct stones, diameter of bile duct, lithotripsy, precutting, pneumobilia, and early complications.

Results

Recurrence occurred in 111 patients. The "acalculous GB" group was less prone to recurrence than the "prior cholecystectomy" group and the "calculous GB" group. The relative risks (RR) for the latter two compared with the former group were 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–4.14; p = 0.0078) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.21–3.87; p = 0.0093), respectively. Other prognostic factors were lithotripsy (RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.47–3.81; p = 0.0004) and pneumobilia (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.01–2.43; p = 0.044).

Conclusions

Gall bladder status, lithotripsy, and pneumobilia were significantly related to bile duct stone recurrence after EPT.

Pneumoperitoneum has a wide differential diagnosis and presents with varying degrees of severity; however, not all etiologies require operative intervention. It is imperative that all patients with this diagnosis are evaluated by a surgeon.

### The clinical presentations of ectopic biliary drainage into duodenal bulbus and stomach with a thorough review of the current literature [^116y4xVs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Other imaging methods

Abdominal ultrasonography performed in each patient showed dilated biliary tree in all of them. Besides, five had choledocholithiasis, 4 had hydropic gall bladder containing small stones on ultrasonography. One patient also had air in intrahepatic bile ducts. Another case had signs of obstructive jaundice and his past medical history was positive for peptic ulcer disease. Abdominal ultrasonography showed dilated stomach fully filled with large amount of fluid. The choledochus was 2.5 cm in diameter and also contained approximately a 2.5 cm-sized bile stone. An ectopic biliary opening and gastric outlet obstruction were presumed to be part of differential diagnosis in this case and were later confirmed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

On abdominal CT examination, five patients had dilated choledochus, 3 had stones in the common bile duct and one had air in the biliary tree (Figure 5). On MRCP, one patient had small stones in the common bile duct and the other had dilated biliary tree which terminated into the duodenum in a hook-like appearance (Figure 6).

### Pneumobilia: where to look for on hepatic MR imaging? [^113fL8zB]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The presence of pneumobilia is a particular problem in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRPC) and may create an appearance that can be mistaken for intraductal stones. Compared with biliary stones, however, pneumobilia causes a susceptibility artifact on hepatic MR imaging and appears as a signal void on a dual echo gradient MR sequence, such as the T1-weighted in-phase and opposed-phase gradient echo sequence. This susceptibility artifact is more pronounced on the gradient echo image with the longer echo time due to the continued decay of the transverse magnetization. Besides identification of hepatic steatosis, the double echo approach is particularly helpful in identification of pneumobilia.

### Portomesenteric venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to mesenteric ischaemia [^112wxYrb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Description

We describe a case of a 61-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the emergency department because of severe periumbilical pain associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, there was gross distension with generalised tenderness, more prominent in the left iliac fossa. The patient was afebrile and parameters were stable.

Coronal and axial CT images showed extensive branching radiolucency extending to within 2 cm of the liver capsule, which is characteristic of portal venous gas (PVG) and differentiates it from pneumobilia (figure 1). Gas was also present throughout the superior mesenteric vein and its tributaries (closed arrow, figure 2 B). A large portion of the small bowel wall showed band-like intramural gas (open arrow figure 2 A), in keeping with pneumatosis intestinalis (PI).

Step 2: Biliary puncture

a) Air bubbles within the biliary tree can significantly impair echo visualization. Withdrawing the stylet and priming the needle with contrast will minimize the likelihood of pneumobilia.
b) Excluding arterial or venous blood vessels on EUS before puncture is essential. This is ideally done without the application of excess pressure on the transducer because this may collapse veins and mask Doppler flow.
c) As the needle is advanced from the liver capsule to the target intrahepatic bile duct, care should be taken to avoid puncturing any intervening biliary radicles or blood vessels. This may result in bleeding, bile leak, or potentially a portobiliary fistula.
d) Puncture of the target bile duct can be particularly challenging in patients with fibrosis or biliopathy. In such situations, a rapid forward thrust of the needle may be required to gain access. It is not uncommon to puncture beyond the posterior wall of the bile duct. If this does occur, apply gentle suction while slowly withdrawing the needle. A bilious aspirate confirms an intraductal location of the needle tip.
e) Consider using the "curved-needle technique" when a suitable needle trajectory cannot be obtained. The technique involves unsheathing the needle ex vivo and bending it gently by hand to create a smooth arc. The bent needle tip allows it to follow an elliptical path after entering the liver parenchyma, hence avoiding intervening structures.

Step 3: Contrast injection

a) Decompressing the biliary tree before injecting the contrast will reduce the risk of bacterial dissemination in patients with cholangitis. Aspirated bile may be sent for microbiologic studies.
b) Using a water-soluble radiocontrast that is diluted to 50% with sterile saline solution or water will result in better visualization of the guidewire and a more uniform distribution of contrast within the biliary tree.
c) Very quick contrast dissipation indicates an intravascular injection. This should be recognized and the needle repositioned.
d) Inject only enough contrast to plan the procedure and direct the guidewire. Overinjection of contrast will increase intraductal pressure and may increase the risk of a bile leak.

### Long-term prognosis and risk factors associated with post-ERCP pneumobilia in patients with common bile duct stones [^116PRrUg]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Post-ERCP pneumobilia is not uncommon; however, studies focusing on the long-term prognosis of patients with post-ERCP pneumobilia are limited. This study aimed to explore long-term prognosis and risk factors associated with post-ERCP pneumobilia in patients with common bile duct stones (CBDSs).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1380 patients who underwent ERCP for CBDSs at our hospital from January 2010 to December 2017. Patients were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and divided into pneumobilia and nonpneumobilia groups, followed by propensity score matching. The matched groups were then compared in terms of incidence rates of both single and multiple recurrences of CBDSs, acute cholangitis, and acute cholecystitis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore risk factors associated with pneumobilia.

Results

After propensity matching, there was no significant difference in the rate of single recurrence of CBDSs (22.5% vs 30%; p = 0.446) between the pneumobilia and nonpneumobilia groups. However, the incidences of multiple recurrences of CBDSs (32.5% vs 12.5%; p = 0.032) and acute cholangitis without stone recurrence (32.5% vs 2.5%; P = < .001) were significantly higher in the pneumobilia group. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, in addition to a dilated CBD (diameter of > 1 cm) (odds ratio [OR], 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–3.76; p = 0.043), endoscopic sphincterotomy with moderate incision (OR, 5.38; 95% CI, 1.14–25.47; p = 0.034) and with large incision (OR, 8.7; 95% CI, 1.83–41.46; p = 0.007) were identified as independent risk factors for pneumobilia after initial ERCP.

Conclusions

Patients with post-ERCP pneumobilia have increased risk of multiple recurrences of CBDSs and acute cholangitis without stone recurrence. Independent risk factors for pneumobilia include peripapillary diverticulum, a dilated CBD (> 1 cm), and endoscopic sphincterotomy with moderate and large incisions. A normal-sized CBD appears to serve as a secondary barrier against enterobiliary reflux, necessitating further research for confirmation.

### An unusual presentation of cholecystoduodenal fistula: vomiting of gallstones [^112G2ESu]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Bouveret's syndrome is defined as gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an impacted gallstone in the duodenum via a cholecystoduodenal or cholecystogastric fistula. Common radiological findings include pneumobilia, calcified right upper quadrant mass, pyloric or duodenal obstruction and cholecystoduodenal fistula. Initial attempts through endoscopic retrieval may be successful; however, results can vary. Surgical options include enterolithotomy or gastrotomy with or without cholecystectomy and fistula repair. We describe a unique case of Bouveret's syndrome with short-lived obstruction followed by vomiting of gallstones in a morbidly obese patient and discuss the complexities of investigation and management of these patients.

### Gallstone ileus: a review [^112VG5yX]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis

Gallstone ileus has no distinctive symptoms, but tumbling gallstone advancement that results in alternating aggravation and resolution of ileus is a relatively common feature. Many patients with gallstone ileus are elderly, present with comorbidities, have poor general condition and delayed diagnosis that leads to dehydration, shock, sepsis, or peritonitis.

In a review of 176 cases (49 male and 127 female patients; age, 24–91 years) of gallstone, Nakao et al reported abdominal pain at presentation in majority of the patients (91.5%) with accompanied abdominal distension, vomiting and fever in 84.7%, 59.7% and 40.9% of all patients, respectively.

In a review of 128 cases of Bouveret syndrome, Cappell and Davisreported the mean age of patients of 74.1 years, a larger proportion of female patients (female-to-male ratio of 1.86), and clinical symptoms of nausea and vomiting (87%), abdominal pain (71%), haematemesis (15%), weight loss (14%) and poor appetite (13%).

In a systematic review of 38 cases of sigmoid gallstone ileus, Farkas et al reported the age range of patients of 65–94 years, mean age of 81.1 years, and nearly threefold higher proportion of female patients than of male patients; regarding clinical symptoms, 74% of the patients presented abdominal pain, whereas 93% of the patients presented other obstructive symptoms of constipation (61%), vomiting (50%) and abdominal distension (26%).

Rigler et al reported that pneumobilia and intestinal tract dilatation and specularity, calculus within the intestinal tract, and calculus movement observed on plain abdominal radiography are useful for diagnosis of the condition; however, the combined signs only appeared in < 50% of cases.

In another review, Cappell and Davisreported the frequency of the plain radiographic findings as follows: pneumobilia, 25%; gastric dilatation, 15%; calcified mass or calculus around the gallbladder or in the upper right abdominal area, 24%; moreover, those findings were confirmed on CT scans at frequency of 60%, 20% and 90%, respectively, which indicates that advances in CT could significantly improve the diagnosis rate.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^117QUspT]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Although pneumobilia is a sign highly suggestive of gallstone ileus, it is not isolated to gallstone ileus. Its presence on AXR has been described in sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, as well as post-ERCP. Several studies have also shown a lack of consistency in the identification of pneumobilia. It is often a subtle radiological sign and may be missed by the attending physician, only identified in retrospect to be present in up to 50% of plain AXRs.

Since Rigler defined his triad in 1941, two further radiological signs for gallstone ileus have been described: change in the location of a previously noted gallstone (Rigler's tetrad), and a dual air-fluid level in the right upper quadrant (herein Rigler's pentad). The latter was described by Balthazar and Schecter in 1978 as either a dual air-fluid level on upright AXR, or a double air bubble on supine AXR, and it is estimated to be present in up to 24% of patients at admission.

A further literature search has revealed two signs seen on AXR with oral contrast (either water soluble contrast or barium): Forchet sign, when contrast passes around a radiolucent calculus (forming a snake's head of contrast with a clear halo of the calculus) and Petren sign (passage of contrast from bowel to gallbladder through a fistulous connection). In addition to reports of oral contrast for gallstone ileus, there are also reports of the use of contrast enemas for the identification of gallstone coleus. We, as many authors before us, emphasize that oral or rectal contrast should not be routinely used in suspected gallstone ileus. In cases of perforation, barium leak can lead to barium peritonitis (voided by the use of water soluble contrast). In addition, in cases of bowel obstruction, excessive oral fluid intake can aggravate the symptoms including vomiting with a high risk of aspiration of contrast. Furthermore, gallstone ileus nowadays is easily diagnosed on CT scanning, negating the need for oral contrast AXRs.

In summary, there are five commonly seen radiological signs (as defined above) visible on plain AXR, the presence of a combination with is almost diagnostic for the presence of gallstone ileus.

### Massive pneumoretroperitoneum arising from emphysematous cholecystitis: a case report and the literature review [^112QTbYp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysematous cholecystitis is a severe variant of acute cholecystitis caused by anaerobic bacteria. Although intraperitoneal air as a complication has been described in association with emphysematous cholecystitis, pneumoretroperitoneum arising from emphysematous cholecystitis is extremely rare. Herein, we describe a rare case of pneumoretroperitoneum arising from emphysematous cholecystitis that was successfully treated with emergency surgery.

Case Presentation

An 84-year-old male was transported to the Emergency Department of our hospital for acute abdomen. Computed tomography revealed acute cholecystitis accompanied by emphysematous change. Computed tomography also revealed massive pneumoretroperitoneum complicated with pneumobilia and gas in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Clinical findings fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis. Emergency surgery was carried out with a diagnosis of both emphysematous cholecystitis and gastrointestinal perforation. Intraoperative findings revealed acute gangrenous cholecystitis and pneumoretroperitoneum presenting with an odor-free foamy abscess along the loose connective tissue behind the ascending colon and mesocolon. No evidence of gastrointestinal perforation was found during surgery. Therefore, cholecystectomy and lavage drainage were performed. Bacterial culture examination isolated a single species of anaerobe, Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was considered to be the cause of emphysematous cholecystitis, pneumobilia, and pneumoretroperitoneum.

Conclusions

Emphysematous cholecystitis should be considered as a possible cause of pneumoretroperitoneum. The present case is the first report of massive pneumoretroperitoneum extending to the dorsal side of the ascending mesocolon as a complication of emphysematous cholecystitis.

### Choledochoduodenal fistula: an unusual case of pneumobilia [^11166WTC]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Pneumobilia is the finding of air in the biliary tree. Most cases are iatrogenic in origin, especially after sphincterotomy and after hepaticojejunostomy or choledochojejunostomy. In patients without such history, the presence of pneumobilia needs further investigation. Most patients are likely to have an enterobiliary fistula. Although patients may be asymptomatic, possible complications include gallstone ileus, Bouveret syndrome or recurrent episodes of cholangitis. We present a case of a 38-year-old man presenting with obstructive jaundice and pneumobilia in whom choledochoduodenal fistula was diagnosed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. A description of different types of choledochoduodenal fistulas and management recommendations are also provided.

### Portal venous gas on point-of-care ultrasound in a case of cecal ischemia [^116ZvnDm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal venous gas has mainly been studied in pediatrics and seen in cases of necrotizing enterocolitis. It is a rare finding in adults and is typically associated with underlying intestinal ischemia or other malignant intra-abdominal pathology. Portal venous gas is seen more readily on ultrasound compared to radiographs in both pediatric and adult patients. Findings include lucencies extending to the periphery of the liver, echogenic bubbles flowing centrifugally throughout the portal venous system, and bidirectional spikes interrupting the monophasic portal venous waveform on spectral analysis.

Case Report

We present a case of a 36-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain. She had findings consistent with portal venous gas on point-of-care ultrasound, prompting computed tomography of her abdomen and surgical consultation. She was ultimately found to have cecal ischemia from cecal volvulus, had surgical resection and anastomosis, and was able to be discharged from the hospital following recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With the ever-increasing use of point-of-care ultrasound, emergency physicians should be aware of the findings consistent with portal venous gas as well as its implications. Emergency physicians should know portal venous gas is associated with intestinal ischemia and other malignant pathologies and should prompt more advanced imaging or surgical consultation when observed. Emergency physicians should also understand the distinctions between portal venous gas and pneumobilia found on point-of-care ultrasound, given that portal venous gas is typically a malignant finding and pneumobilia is most frequently benign.

### Endoscopic nasobiliary drainage-based saline-injection ultrasound: an imaging technique for remnant stone detection after retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^112bqT1H]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis is a common condition that undermines human health, affecting 10–20% of patients with biliary tract disease. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is widely accepted for the diagnosis and treatment of choledocholithiasis. In addition to eliminating the need for surgery, the minimal trauma entailed, short procedural times, few complications, and brief hospital stays are clearly advantageous. Standard methods of ERCP primarily include sphincterotomy (EST), balloon dilation, balloon lithotripsy, basket retrieval, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD), and occlusion cholangiogram. Occlusion cholangiograms are often used to determine the completeness of stone clearance. However, a previous study has shown that they fail to detect residual calculi in 11–30% of cases, especially in the setting of a severe pneumobilia or biliary ductal dilatation and in the course of lithotripsy. Currently, rates of recurrent choledocholithiasis after ERCP range from 4–24%. Residual stones are important causative factors in such recurrences, prompting recrudescence of biliary symptoms, complications (i.e. pancreatitis, cholangitis), and clinical issues, including untoward hospital costs and patient suffering.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^114C1piq]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

A confounding case of gallstone ileus

Recently, we encountered a case of gallstone ileus. An 82-year-old man was admitted with sudden onset of central abdominal pain and vomiting, describing coffee-ground vomitus. On examination, he appeared distressed with a tender distended abdomen. Blood tests were normal except for chronic microcytic anemia. Patient's past medical history included the following: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, gout, stroke, prostate cancer, iron-deficiency anemia, and osteoarthritis. Recent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated multiple angiodysplasias in the gastric and duodenal mucosa. The patient was initially managed for an upper gastrointestinal tract bleed (angiodysplasias being a red herring). Erect chest X-ray demonstrated no evidence of perforation, with a poor quality abdominal X-ray (Fig. 1) demonstrating a radio-opaque density in the left iliac fossa with a small loop of distended bowel. These findings were suggestive of gallstone ileus, confirmed by CT scanning (see Fig. 2), and patient underwent laparotomy, enterotomy, and retrieval of gallstone. Patient made an uneventful post-operative recovery and was discharged home.

Due to its uncommon nature, gallstone ileus is often missed or diagnosed late. The lesson from our own case experience has led us to look at the clinical and radiological presentation and diagnosis of gallstone ileus, in order to address issues contributing to the delays in diagnosis.

### Pneumoscrotum after jejunal perforation: a case report [^115rZeB8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumoscrotum is a rare disease entity in which gas is present in the scrotum. It has been described after diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as well as with disease states. The entity itself is a benign condition, but is associated with both incidental and life-threatening conditions.

Objectives

We discuss the pathophysiology and associated conditions of pneumoscrotum.

Case Report

We report a case of pneumoscrotum after jejunum perforation.

Conclusion

Even though pneumoscrotum is a benign, rare condition, its mere presence should signal the possibility of a severe, life-threatening disease process within the peritoneum or retroperitoneum.

### Pneumocystis carinii infection: current treatment and prevention [^113K3JQu]. The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (1996). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Miller criteria for PCP severity assessment" for Pneumocystis pneumonia.

The Miller criteria is a clinical calculator used for assessing the severity of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. This scoring system is crucial in determining the need for hospitalization and intensive care, as well as guiding treatment decisions. The Miller criteria takes into account factors such as arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), arterial-alveolar gradient (A-a gradient), and the presence of extrapulmonary disease. Patients with severe PCP according to the Miller criteria may require more aggressive treatment and closer monitoring. The calculator may not be applicable or accurate in patients with co-existing lung diseases or conditions that can affect the PaO2 or A-a gradient.

The Miller criteria for assessing the severity of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia) guide healthcare professionals through evaluating a patient's symptoms, arterial oxygen levels, and chest X-ray findings. By analyzing these inputs, we can categorize the disease into mild, moderate, or severe.

Here's how the evaluation works:

Inputs considered:

- **Symptoms and Signs**:
	- Dyspnea on exertion, possibly with cough and sweats
	- Dyspnea on minimal exertion, occasional rest dyspnea, fever, cough
	- Dyspnea and tachypnea at rest, persistent fever, cough

- **Arterial Oxygen Tension** (partial pressure of oxygen at rest on room air):
	- Greater than 11.0 kPa (82.5 mmHg)
	- Between 8.1 and 11.0 kPa (60.75 to 82.5 mmHg)
	- Less than 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg)

- **Arterial Oxygen Saturation** (SaO2, at rest on room air):
	- Above 96%
	- Between 91% and 96%
	- Below 91%

- **Chest X-ray Findings**:
	- Normal or shows minor perihilar shadowing
	- Diffuse interstitial shadowing
	- Extensive interstitial shadowing, possibly with diffuse alveolar shadowing

To determine the severity:

- **Severe PCP is indicated by any of these conditions**:

- Symptoms of dyspnea and tachypnea at rest
- Arterial oxygen tension less than 8.0 kPa
- Arterial oxygen saturation below 91%
- Extensive interstitial shadowing present on X-ray

- **Mild PCP is likely when all these specific conditions are met**:

- Symptoms are limited to dyspnea on exertion (cough and sweats possible)
- Arterial oxygen tension more than 11.0 kPa
- Arterial oxygen saturation above 96%
- Chest X-ray shows normal or minor perihilar shadowing

- **Moderate PCP is diagnosed if any of the following are true**:

- Symptoms include minimal exertion dyspnea, occasional rest dyspnea, fever, cough
- Arterial oxygen tension between 8.1 and 11.0 kPa
- Arterial oxygen saturation between 91% and 96%
- Diffuse interstitial shadowing seen on X-ray

These evaluations help clinicians make informed decisions about the management of the patient's condition by accurately assessing the severity of PCP based on the presented criteria.

### Endoscopic management of bouveret syndrome with electrohydraulic lithotripsy [^111YBEBw]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Bouveret syndrome is a rare form of gallstone ileus resulting from impaction of a gallstone in the duodenum, usually because of a cholecystoduodenal fistula, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. Bouveret syndrome was first described in 1896 by Leon Bouveret. Patients are typically older and malnourished and have a number of comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 85% of patients present with nausea and vomiting, with 70% of patients complaining of abdominal pain. Diagnosis is typically considered in the presence of Rigler's triad on radiography: dilated stomach, pneumobilia, and an opacity suggesting an enteric gallstone. However, symptomatology is frequently varied and vague. In our case, the diagnosis was confirmed on a "tubogram" via the patient's cholecystostomy. Alternative methods of obtaining the diagnosis include cross-sectional imaging modalities such as CT and MRCP.

Management of this condition is often challenging given the age and comorbidities of the patient demographic. Historically, Bouveret syndrome was managed surgically with techniques ranging from enterolithotomy, enterolithotomy with cholecystectomy, or in rare cases, a Whipple procedure. These techniques often required a laparotomy and bowel resection, and they carry a high mortality rate, making them less favorable.

As a result of this, endoscopic techniques have increasingly been used in the management of Bouveret syndrome. The use of endoscopy was first described in 1985 by Bedgoni. This procedure used a basket to successfully remove a gallstone causing pyloroduodenal obstruction. Initial success rates for endoscopic removal of impacted gallstones were very low, often not greater than 10%.

Mechanical lithotripsy using a mechanical lithotriptor with the aid of a basket, snare, or Roth Net has frequently been used, although it has often been unsuccessful and may lead to further gallstone ileus as a result of fragments migrating farther into the small bowel and out of reach of an endoscope.

### From blockage to passage: twin gallstones' journey through the gut [^111RXwfc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

A 41-year-old man with cholecystolithiasis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease presented to our hospital because of right upper abdominal pain and vomiting for one day. Physical examination revealed a positive Murphy sign, with no jaundice. Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell count of 14,750 per cubic millimeter (normal range: 3,500–9,500/mm 3); the alanine aminotransferase level was 25 units per liter (normal range: 9–50 U/L), and the total bilirubin level was 9.8 µmol per liter (normal range: 5.1–22.2 µmol/L). After the insertion of a nasogastric tube, a large amount of gastric content mixed with bile was aspirated. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed a cholecystoduodenal fistula (a) and the presence of the Rigler triad — pneumobilia (b), ectopic gallstones within the bowel lumen (c, with the arrow indicating a stone and the arrowhead indicating a suspected proximal stone), and intestinal obstruction (c, with the hollow arrow indicating the collapsed distal bowel). The patient continued to experience abdominal pain, and subsequent plain magnetic resonance imaging showed ileal obstruction with a petal-like arrangement of the bowel loops (d). Two ectopic stones were confirmed on different MR sequences (e and f). After 12 days of treatment, including oral liquid paraffin and intravenous antibiotics, the patient's abdominal pain was relieved, and he spontaneously passed 2 stones (g). He was referred for outpatient cholecystectomy and fistula repair. (Informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish these images.)

### Duodenal imaging on the spotlight: from A to Z [^1145gdnJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Biliary ileus

It occurs following subacute or chronic cholecystitis that leads to gallstone erosion into the bowel (most often through a cholecystoduodenal fistula).

The site of obstruction is usually the terminal ileum because it is the narrowest portion of the small bowel.

Rigler's triad encompasses the three typical findings of gallstone ileus on a radiograph: pneumobilia, dilated small bowel loops, and a calcified gallstone in an ectopic location.

CT is the modality of choice because it allows a correct diagnosis of gallstone ileus with higher accuracy and detects the exact location of the ectopic stone and the biliary–enteric fistula (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Biliary ileus. CT coronal reformation (a) shows air in the gallbladder (arrowhead) and communication between its lumen and D2 — cholecystoduodenal fistula (arrow). Axial CT scans (b) show a 2 cm-wide elliptical gallstone impacted at the distal jejunum (arrow). Coronal reformation 9 c) shows air-filled dilated small bowel loops (asterisk)

Bouveret syndrome

Bouveret syndrome is a subtype of gallstone ileus which refers to gastric outlet obstruction due to the impaction of a gallstone in the pylorus or proximal duodenum.

The diagnosis was usually made with endoscopy but is increasingly being found on CT in the setting of abdominal pain in emergency departments.

On the UGIS, there is an endoluminal filling defect in the duodenum that produces partial or complete gastric outlet obstruction.

CT shows to a better extent the gallstone, the cholecystoduodenal fistula, and the gastric dilatation that make up this syndrome (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Bouveret syndrome. CT coronal reformation (a) shows marked gastric dilatation (asterisks) caused by a round lesion at the duodenal bulb (arrowhead); there is also densification and indefinition of the contour of the gallbladder (arrow). Unenhanced CT (b) shows the lesion is spontaneously hyperdense-endoluminal gallstone at the duodenal bulb (arrowhead). A small fistulous tract filled with air (c) (arrowhead) is seen between the duodenal bulb and the expected location of the gallbladder, which had ruptured and formed a phlegmon (arrow)

Diagnostic imaging

Plain abdominal film

Plain abdominal film radiography, or abdominal X-ray (AXR), is an ideal modality in the emergency setting. It is a quick and technically easy diagnostic test, and the radiation dose is low at 0.7 mSv per film. AXR may be performed upright or supine, with the latter being the conventional method. It is often the first-line investigation used for the diagnosis of gallstone ileus, or indeed any case of bowel obstruction. The sensitivity of AXR for the diagnosis of gallstone ileus is between 40 and 70%, and its positive predictive value approaches 80% in patients with high-grade intestinal obstruction. Rigler described his famous triad of radiological signs in 1941 for gallstone ileus on plain film: air within the biliary tree (pneumobilia), signs of small bowel obstruction, and ectopic radio-opaque gallstones. Rigler's triad is pathognomonic for gallstone ileus, but in most cases, only two signs out of the triad are present. In the literature, only 14–53% of cases present with the full criteria.

One of the most prominent signs of gallstone ileus on AXR is that of any other cause of mechanical bowel obstruction. In the case of small bowel obstruction, supine AXR shows multiple loops of dilated small bowel (in an upright AXR, there are multiple air fluid levels within dilated bowel) with paucity of air in the large bowel and/or rectum. In the case of gallstone coleus, the large bowel is dilated, and depending on the competency of the ileocecal valve, the small bowel may be decompressed. In the rare cases of Bouveret's syndrome of gastric outlet obstruction, AXR may sometimes demonstrate a prominent gastric shadow.

Gallstones are notoriously difficult to visualize on plain film radiography, with only 10–20% of stones containing enough calcium to be radio-opaque. Of those stones not visualized, the vast majority are radiolucent (typically associated with cholesterol stones), but a number may be veiled by obesity, or superimposed by bony structures or fluid-filled bowel.

Extra-biliary complications

Gallstones can also cause pathology outside of the biliary system. The most common cause, although rare, is a cholecystoenteric fistula. Chronic irritation from a large gallstone can erode through the gallbladder wall with fistulisation into small bowel. This can be seen on imaging with air seen within the gallbladder or biliary tree (pneumobilia).

When a gallstone passes through the fistula into the small bowel, this can result in intestinal obstruction, either proximal or more commonly distal. The most common place for distal small bowel obstruction and gallstone ileum is at the level of ileocecal valve as this is the narrowest point; however, gallstone ileus can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis is suggested on abdominal X-ray by the presence of pneumobilia in the right upper quadrant with dilated loops of bowel consistent with bowel obstruction. Gallstone ileus is more accurately diagnosed with CT which may show pneumobilia or may directly demonstrate the presence of a cholecystoenteric fistula and associated bowel obstruction (Fig. 21).

Fig. 21
Coronal (a) and axial (b) contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrating multiple dilated loops of small bowel. There is a 3-cm peripherally hyperattenuating obstructing gallstone in the left flank (arrow 1). There is an extensive inflammatory process in the gallbladder bed with air in the gallbladder (arrow 2) consistent with a cholecystoenteric fistula. Appearances are consistent with a bowel obstruction secondary to a gallstone ileus

Bouveret's syndrome is a particular eponymous syndrome in which a stone obstructs the upper GI tract proximally at the level of duodenum or gastric outlet. Patients typically present with copious vomiting owing to the proximal level of obstruction. There may be little or no small bowel dilatation; in particular, the X-ray abdomen may be completely normal which can falsely reassure. Imaging will demonstrate evidence of gastric outlet or duodenal obstruction related to a gallstone in the upper GI tract (Fig. 22).

### Cholangioscopic appearance after radiofrequency ablation of cholangiocarcinoma [^112q7MTP]. VideoGIE (2017). Low credibility.

Six months later, after the patient completed a second cycle of chemotherapy, CT, in comparison with the patient's prior imaging, demonstrated an interval decrease in the size of the caudate lobe lesion to approximately 1.7 × 2.1 cm (previously 2.6 × 2.7 cm), with post-RFA changes around the left hepatic duct and an intact stent with pneumobilia (Fig. 8). This decrease in tumor size was likely due to systemic chemotherapy.

Repeated ERCP was 6 months after the RFA was performed, during which the cholangiogram showed improvement in the left hepatic ductal stenosis (Fig. 9). A cholangioscope was used, the left duct remained patent, and poststenting inflammatory changes were visible. His liver function values remained normal, and he has had no hospitalizations or obstructive biliary adverse events.

Preclinical data in animal models have confirmed the safety and efficacy of RFA in this setting. An additional open-labeled study in humans demonstrated clinical safety, leading to subsequent device approval. Since the availability of this probe, retrospective series have evaluated its efficacy in biliary neoplasms not amenable to surgery. These retrospective data have alluded to the benefit of RFA in improving stenosis, the duration of stent patency, and survival.,

In this case, the appearance of postintraductal RFA was an interesting finding as seen by a cobweb appearance on cholangioscopy.

### Totally laparoscopic management of gallstone ileus [^115F2hun]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Gallstone ileus is an uncommon disease of elderly patients who present with bowel obstruction. Mortality and severe complications are common, even in modern series, due to the comorbidities in the affected patient population. A number of less invasive ways to treat this disease are described. We report on a case where enterolithotomy was performed laparoscopically. The patient is a 60-year-old diabetic woman who presented with a bowel obstruction and pneumobilia on abdominal radiographs. She underwent exploratory laparoscopy using three reusable ports, an enterolithotomy, and her remaining bowel was examined. The benefits to a minimal access approach to this rare disorder are discussed. The ability to suture laparoscopically is emphasized.

### Elucidating early CT after pancreatico-duodenectomy: a primer for radiologists [^1131mpVw]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD) represents the standard surgical treatment for resectable malignancies of the pancreatic head, distal common bile duct, periampullary region and duodenum, and is also performed to manage selected benign tumours and refractory chronic pancreatitis. Despite improved surgical techniques and acceptable mortality, PD remains a technically demanding, high-risk operation burdened with high morbidity (complication rates 40–50% of patients). Multidetector computed tomography (CT) represents the mainstay modality to rapidly investigate the postoperative abdomen, and to provide a consistent basis for an appropriate choice between conservative, interventional or surgical treatment. However, radiologists require familiarity with the surgically altered anatomy, awareness of expected imaging appearances and possible complications to correctly interpret early post-PD CT studies. This paper provides an overview of surgical indications and techniques, discusses risk factors and clinical manifestations of the usual postsurgical complications, and suggests appropriate techniques and indications for early postoperative CT imaging. Afterwards, the usual, normal early post-PD CT findings are presented, including transient fluid, pneumobilia, delayed gastric emptying, identification of pancreatic gland remnant and of surgical anastomoses. Finally, several imaging examples review the most common and some unusual complications such as pancreatic fistula, bile leaks, abscesses, intraluminal and extraluminal haemorrhage, and acute pancreatitis.

Teaching Points

- Pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD) is a technically demanding surgery burdened with high morbidity (40–50%).

- Multidetector CT is the mainstay technique to investigate suspected complications following PD.

- Interpreting post-PD CT requires knowledge of surgically altered anatomy and expected findings.

- CT showing collection at surgical site supports clinico-biological diagnosis of pancreatic fistula.

- Other complications include biliary leaks, haemorrhage, abscesses and venous thrombosis.

### Large bowel obstruction due to gallstones: an endoscopic problem? [^114FjWuU]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 73-year-old man was admitted with symptoms of large bowel obstruction. An emergency CT scan revealed pneumobilia and large bowel obstruction at the level of the rectosigmoid due to a 4×4 cm impacted gallstone. Flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed the diagnosis but initial attempts to drag the stone into the rectum failed. An endoscopic mechanical lithotripter was employed to repeatedly fracture the gallstone into smaller fragments, which were passed spontaneously the next day. The patient made a complete recovery avoiding the potential dangers of surgery. This case report discusses cholecystoenteric fistula and a novel minimally invasive treatment for large bowel obstruction due to gallstones.

### Multicenter epidemiological survey of pneumatosis intestinalis in Japan [^115Gm7PQ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding treatment, oxygen therapy was significantly associated with patients with a past medical history of bowel obstruction, and surgery was significantly associated with complicating PI. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a controversial treatment for adhesive postoperative small bowel obstruction, but Fukami et al. described that 143 patients (87.7%) were treated successfully with hyperbaric oxygen therapy without long-tube decompression. This oxygen therapy was associated with earlier resumption of oral intake and a shorter hospital stay, and the rate of operation was 7.4% in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and 14.8% in group treated by decompression alone. In this context, patients with PI with a history of bowel obstruction likely underwent oxygen therapy. Duron et al. reported that abdominal distention, peritonitis, and lactic acidemia were predictive of positive intraoperative findings mandating intervention including mesenteric ischemia, an obstruction, or an incarcerated hernia on multivariate analysis in a retrospective multicenter record review of 150 PI patients, 54 (36%) of whom were managed nonoperatively, 72 of whom underwent surgery, and 24 of whom were given comfort measures only. Generally, complicating or pathologic PI is an indication for surgery, as shown in the present study.

The last finding of the present study was that complicating PI was significantly associated with exacerbation of PI and subsequent death, which also makes medical sense. Wiesner et al. reported that of seven patients with infarction limited to one bowel segment (jejunum, ileum, or colon), only one patient (14%) died, whereas of the 10 patients with infarction of two or three bowel segments, eight patients (80%) died. These authors concluded that CT findings of PI and portomesenteric venous gas due to bowel ischemia do not generally allow prediction of transmural bowel infarction because these findings may be observed in patients with only partial ischemic bowel wall damage, and the clinical outcomes of patients with bowel ischemia with these CT findings seem to depend mainly on the severity and extent of their underlying disease, which is consistent with our comprehensive finding.

The present study has inherent limitations, including its retrospective design, ethnically homogeneous sample, low response rate to this survey, no laboratory data or images included, no CKD classification obtained, and participation bias in terms of data collection, which was conducted mainly by gastroenterologists and a few surgeons but no radiologists or acute care physicians. Therefore, the proportion of surgery in the treatment was as low as 4.6%.

### Pneumobilia: benign or life-threatening [^114W1jfM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumobilia, or air within the biliary tree of the liver, suggests an abnormal communication between the biliary tract and the intestines, or infection by gas-forming bacteria. Pneumobilia usually can be distinguished from air in the portal venous system by its appearance on computed tomography (CT) scan. The most common conditions associated with pneumobilia include: 1) a biliary-enteric surgical anastamosis, 2) an incompetent sphincter of Oddi, or 3) a spontaneous biliary-enteric fistula. Three cases of pneumobilia associated with its most common causes are presented and further differential diagnostic possibilities as well as the implications of this finding on patient management are discussed.

### Which clinical factors are predictive of outcome in primary spontaneous pneumothorax management? [^111C2Yug]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) occurs when air leaks into the pleural space in patients without known underlying lung disease, causing pain and breathlessness. Optimal management of PSP is not defined and we are unable to predict who will fail medical treatment (ongoing pneumothorax with prolonged air leak). We hypothesised that patients with longer symptom duration and higher symptom scores would be more likely to fail treatment.

Methods

Prospectively collected data from the Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax randomised controlled trial of ambulatory management were used to determine which clinical factors are associated with treatment failure including symptom scores, time from symptom onset to presentation, treatment allocation, vital signs, history of prior pneumothorax and size of initial pneumothorax.

Results

Overall, 63/236 patients (26.7%) failed treatment. On average, symptoms started 1 day before admission. Multivariable analysis found that patients who presented at least 1 day after symptoms began had a lower risk of treatment failure than those presenting on the day symptoms began (ORs 0.39 (0.18 to 0.81)).

Conclusion

Further work is required to determine psychological drivers of PSP presentation and risks of prolonged air leak.

### Refractory long-term cholangitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a retrospective study [^113Znvjh]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative cholangitis is one of the major late complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and recurrent cholangitis has a negative impact on patients' quality of life. However, detailed reports are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features of postoperative cholangitis after PD.

Methods

Between January 2007 and December 2013, 155 consecutive patients underwent PD. Of these, 113 patients were included in this study. Cholangitis was diagnosed according to the criteria in the revised Tokyo Guidelines 2013, and repeated cholangitis with three or more episodes was defined as 'refractory cholangitis'. Data from patients with refractory cholangitis were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

Refractory cholangitis was observed in 21 patients (18.6%). Of these, 17 patients experienced cholangitis within 1 year after PD, and 10 patients had biliary strictures. These patients required an average of two interventional or endoscopic treatments for stricture dilatation, which led to remission. The 2-year cumulative incidence rate for refractory cholangitis was 18.9% (95% CI 11.65–26.15). Multivariate analysis revealed five risk factors for developing refractory cholangitis: benign disease (odds ratio [OR] 18.52; P = 0.001), long operation time (OR 18.73; P = 0.002), elevated C-reactive protein (OR 6.55; P = 0.014), elevated alkaline phosphatase (OR 6.03; P = 0.018), and the presence of pneumobilia (OR 28.81; P = 0.009).

Conclusions

Postoperative refractory cholangitis after PD usually developed within a year. Almost half of the patients had biliary strictures, and aggressive dilatation might be effective to achieve remission in these patients.

### Anomalous opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb: endoscopic treatment [^115TBMxP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Anomalous opening of the CBD into the duodenal bulb is a very rare anomaly, which can cause severe clinical outcomes due to its anatomic location. It can also have different characteristics from the other bilioenteric opening anomalies due to its specific localization. The indirect findings of anomalous opening in a patient who does not have bilioenteric anastomosis are biliary tract pneumobilia seen in USG, CT or direct radiographs; biliary tract barium reflux in upper intestinal barium series and finally deformed or stenosed duodenal bulb with an orifice coming out bile seen during upper GI endoscopy. In the presence of these findings, one must suspect anomalous opening of the CBD. To differentiate from the choledochoduodenal fistula, diagnosis must be confirmed by ERCP.

It is wise to remember that the treatment not only consists of operation, but also of endoscopic balloon dilatation of the orifice with stone extraction and of other endoscopic treatments such as stenting and nasobiliary drainage which can be performed successfully and safely as well. Endoscopic sphincterotomy can cause complications such as perforation and bleeding and should be avoided due to lack of a normal sphincter structure at the opening of the CBD. Surgery should only be reserved for the patients who do not respond to the endoscopic therapies with a real stricture at the end of the CBD or simply for those patients who have large stones with or without stricture.

### An incidental finding? Pneumatosis intestinalis after minor trauma [^1149tEdd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) refers to the identification of air within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. This finding often marks serious underlying pathology, which can be potentially surgical in nature. However, this process may also occur within a benign context, for example, in patients who are chronically immunosuppressed. The prevalence of benign PI may be greater than previously anticipated, because its discovery is facilitated by the increasingly widespread use of computed tomography (CT) scanning.

Objectives

We will illustrate how widespread use of CT scanning after trauma leads to incidental findings, some of which are difficult to distinguish from acute pathologic findings. We will also discuss the differential diagnosis for PI and the associated clinical significance.

Case Report

A female patient with two autoimmune disorders requiring immunosuppression presented after minor trauma. Her clinical stability and benign examination led us to refrain from ordering a full radiographic evaluation, including an abdominal CT scan. She was safely discharged; however, per CT several days later, the incidental finding was made of PI with free intraperitoneal air. These findings after trauma commonly prompt an exploratory laparotomy. However, given her persistent stability, we attributed this to immunosuppression rather than to recent trauma.

Conclusion

The indications for ordering CT scans after minor trauma must be carefully considered, and incidental findings must be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical scenario.

### Can endoscopic papillary balloon dilation really preserve sphincter of oddi function? [^113iCGkS]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) is assumed to preserve sphincter of Oddi function because it causes little trauma to the papilla. However, few studies have addressed this issue specifically. In this study, we investigated whether EPBD can preserve sphincter function, and evaluated whether or not such preservation has clinical significance.

Methods

Seventy patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones were randomly assigned to EPBD or endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST). Sphincter of Oddi (SO) function was measured by endoscopic manometry before, one week after, and one year after treatment. Incidence of pneumobilia and later complications were compared between the two groups at one year. Series manometric data were compared within each group and between the two groups. For a more detailed analysis of the cumulative incidence of later complications, retrospective cohorts were added to the study groups, giving a total number of 235 patients in the EPBD group and 126 in the EST group.

Results

Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the 35 EPBD and 35 EST patients. CBD stones were discharged successfully in all cases. CBD pressure, SO basal and peak pressures, and contraction frequency decreased significantly at one week in both groups. The damage was more severe in the EST group, and SO contraction completely disappeared in 23 patients in this group. The incidence of pneumobilia was significantly lower in the EPBD group than in the EST group (p < 0.01) whereas CBD stones recurred and cholecystitis appeared at a similar rate in both groups at one year. A complete series of manometric data up to one year was obtained in 55 patients; 28 in the post-EPBD and 27 in post-EST groups. In the post-EPBD group, SO basal and peak pressures significantly recovered at one year compared with data at one week but these measures still remained significantly lower than those before EPBD (p < 0.01). In the post-EST group, SO contraction did not recover even after one year. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of 235 EPBD and 126 EST patients for a median follow up of 37 months revealed significantly lower incidences of biliary complications such as recurrent CBD stones and cholangitis, and cholecystitis in the EPBD group than in the EST group (p < 0.05). The risk of pneumobilia was also significantly lower in the EPBD group (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Preservation of papillary function after EPBD was not complete but remained somewhat reduced. However, preservation was more successful with EPBD than with EST. Such preservation may be clinically beneficial for the prevention of later complications.

### Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^116AXadk]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Dysphagia is a Greek terminology that refers to 'disordered eating'. Typically, the term dysphagia means difficulty in swallowing. It is an important and very serious symptom and requires a medical emergency when associated with chronic bleeding of the GI tract, dyspepsia, persistent vomiting, progressive unintentional weight loss, epigastric mass, deficiency anaemia and other upper GI symptoms. Several conditions affecting the upper GI may contribute to dysphagia. These conditions may be malignant or benign. Among these include structural or neuromuscular disorders that result in dysmotility of the oesophagus or oropharynx. Although the precise prevalence of dysphagia remains unknown, studies suggest that it may be within the range of 16%–22% after 50 years of age.

The presentation of a pneumomediastinum is an indication that an air-retaining mediastinal structure has been breached. The air in the mediastinum tissues enters through the air passageway, for instance, after subjecting the pharynx to blunt trauma, hypopharynx, facial bones, main stem bronchi and the trachea. Dental care techniques, Valsalva manoeuvre, GI perforation and severe straining may trigger the appearance of subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum.

In a freely perforated GI tract, air may flow into the mediastinum through the cavity of the peritoneum via the hiatus oesophagus, and also the Morgagni foramen. It is worth noting that pneumomediastinum in the absence of perforation has been observed after oesophagogastroscopy, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, endoscopic sphincterotomy, endoscopic polypectomy and air contrast barium enema. Reports have also been issued describing pneumothorax for upper GI endoscopy.

Probable explanations for the occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum in our patient include injury to the afferent segment of the Billroth II gastroenterostomy or mucosa of the gastric mucosa by the endoscopic tip. This would allow entry of insufflated air into the wall. Pressurisation of the sensory segment of the Billroth II gastroenterostomy could contribute via allowance of forceful entry of air into the interstitium's connective tissues.

### Pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas after CPR [^114vEf5N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas are usually associated with severe intra-abdominal pathologies. As diagnostic technologies advanced, a number of variant etiologies have been identified. We report 2 cases in which pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas developed after prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The pathogenic mechanism was most probably bowel infarction caused by poor mesenteric perfusion during and after CPR. Limited cardiac output during prolonged resuscitation and severe vasoconstriction after large doses of epinephrine and vasopressors might both contribute to the compromised mesenteric perfusion. The risk seems especially high for old patients with severe atherosclerosis. Once it happens, the prognosis is extremely poor. In patients of cardiac arrests receiving prolonged CPR, catastrophic complications like this should be considered in the postresuscitation phase, especially those with multiple risk factors like old age, severe atherosclerosis, and use of large doses of vasoconstrictors.

Spontaneous biloma and pneumobilia developed in a patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) who presented with acute abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. Bilomas are fluid-filled cysts that develop from a bile leak and are located outside of the biliary system. Pneumobilia is characterized by gas within the biliary system due to an abnormal connection between the biliary tree and adjacent organs, particularly the gastrointestinal tract. Although hepatobiliary complications are common in SCD, we report on biloma and pneumobilia in a young patient with this condition.

### Pneumoperitoneum following percutaneous biliary intervention: not necessarily a cause for alarm [^116E9HXo]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is a well-established technique for assessing and treating obstructive jaundice. Plastic and self-expanding metal stents can be deployed as an alternative when ERCP is not feasible or hilar strictures require an antegrade approach. Complication rates of percutaneous procedures are low, and are usually related to bile leakage or hemorrhage; pneumoperitoneum following PTC is rare and is usually taken to indicate bowel perforation. We describe two cases of pneumoperitoneum without peritonitis following PTC and stenting, both of which resolved spontaneously with conservative management. The literature is reviewed and possible causes discussed.

### Pneumatosis intestinalis versus pseudo-pneumatosis: review of CT findings and differentiation [^114vN3ex]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Pneumatosis intestinalis is defined as the presence of gas within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Originally described on plain abdominal radiographs, it is an imaging sign rather than a specific diagnosis and it is associated with both benign and life-threatening clinical conditions. The most common life-threatening cause of pneumatosis intestinalis is bowel ischaemia. Computed tomography (CT) is usually requested to detect underlying disease. The presence of pneumatosis intestinalis often leads physicians to make a diagnosis of serious disease. However, an erroneous diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis may be made (i.e. pseudo-pneumatosis) when intraluminal beads of gas are trapped within or between faeces and adjacent mucosal folds. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review and describe the CT imaging findings of pneumatosis and pseudo-pneumatosis intestinalis and to discuss key discriminatory imaging features.

### Resolution of pneumobilia as a predictor of biliary stent occlusion [^116ZGtGx]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To predict biliary stent occlusion on computed tomography (CT) from the loss of pneumobilia.

Methods

A total of 66 patients with common bile duct stents with pneumobilia after initial stent placement had a follow-up CT and diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Two readers evaluated all CT exams for pneumobilia. Resolution or decrease of pneumobilia on CT was compared with ERCP findings.

Results

Sensitivity and specificity was 60–64% and 95% with a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 49–51%.

Conclusion

Resolution or reduction of pneumobilia after stent placement is specific (95%) and is moderately accurate (70–73%) for predicting biliary stent occlusion.

### Imaging the postoperative patient: long-term complications of gastrointestinal surgery [^117J9WPQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Multiplanar reformatted images may prove decisive in achieving correct diagnosis of a closed-loop obstruction.

CT findings of strangulated obstruction include wall thickening, altered pattern of enhancement of the bowel wall, dilated mesenteric veins, mesenteric edema, ascites, pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumatosis portalis and pneumoperitoneum.

The most common CT finding in bowel ischemia, although nonspecific, is bowel wall thickening. It is caused by mural edema (low attenuation before contrast administration), hemorrhage (high attenuation before contrast administration) and/or superinfection of the ischemic bowel wall. If unenhanced CT is not performed prior to contrast-enhanced CT, the ability to differentiate between intramural hemorrhage and hyperemia and/or hyperperfusion is impaired.

On contrast-enhanced CT, a highly specific but less sensitive finding is absent or diminished parietal contrast enhancement. In some cases, prolonged enhancement due to delayed return of the venous blood, with subsequent slowing of the arterial supply, can also be seen.

As ischemia advances, venules in the mesentery become engorged with blood. Mesenteric fat stranding due to edema and/or ascites is also a nonspecific CT finding in acute bowel ischemia (Figs. 4 and 5). In a recent prospective study, fluid in the mesentery adjacent to abnormal (thickened, dilated or both) bowel loops was the individual sign most frequently associated with strangulation (88%) and had an extremely high negative predictive value.

When bowel wall thinning rather than thickening occurs, transmural small-bowel infarction has probably already ensued. In this setting, it is also more likely for pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumatosis portalis and pneumoperitoneum to develop (Fig. 6). Pneumatosis intestinalis is caused by dissection of luminal gas into the bowel wall across the compromised mucosa. Portomesenteric venous gas is due to the propagation of that gas to the mesenteric venous system, towards the liver. Free intraperitoneal air represents perforation of the gangrenous bowel loop.

### Cross-sectional imaging of common and unusual complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^117Ug22U]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

After ERCP the presence of air in the biliary tree is an expected, common finding. Intra- and extrahepatic pneumobilia is visible in the majority of patients studied with CT within a few weeks from the procedure and may persist for months or years in patients who underwent sphincterotomy (Fig. 2). Shortly after ERCP retained CM is commonly seen in the biliary tree and gallbladder, often with a characteristic stratified appearance (Fig. 2).

Normal findings observed hours after operative ERCP in a 75-year-old male investigated with unenhanced CT (c, d) to verify correct placement of a plastic biliary stent, including dependent contrast medium (arrows) and air (arrowheads) in the intrahepatic bile ducts. In a different patient, a 44-year-old female patient suffering from acute post-procedural pain, contrast-enhanced CT (a, b) 2 days after ERCP excluded signs of acute complications and showed stratified iodinated contrast medium (*), bile and air (thin arrow) in the gallbladder

Multiplanar CT reformations (Figs. 2 and 3) provide high-resolution visualisation of biliary endoprostheses, whether of plastic or metallic reticular "mesh" material, and of their anatomical relationships. When interpreting post-procedural studies, the stent type should be reported along with the integrity, patency and position including proximal and distal extremities.

Acute reversible duodenitis following ERCP. A 78-year-old male with common bile duct (CBD) carcinoma causing concentric stenosis of the proximal choledochus suffered from acute diffuse abdominal pain without peritonitis 24 h after ERCP including cytological brushing and positioning of a 10-French plastic biliary stent. Urgent contrast-enhanced CT (a, b) showed a correctly placed biliary stent, appearance of moderate ascites (*) and of marked circumferential thickening of the duodenum from the Vaterian papilla to the Treitz angle, with enhancing mucosa and hypoattenuating oedematous submucosa (" target sign ", thin arrows), and minimal associated inflammatory changes in the periduodenal fat. Imaging findings, laboratory data and the subsequent course excluded iatrogenic pancreatitis, haemorrhage and DP. Three weeks later, the plastic biliary stent was removed and replaced with a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS). Follow-up CT (d) showed imaging resolution of both biliary obstruction and acute duodenal inflammatory changes [partly reprinted from Ref. 20]
