## Question

What are the laboratory findings in DIC?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the laboratory findings in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology that drives the lab pattern. Then, I should verify which routine tests are most informative and why. Next, I will review the ISTH diagnostic scoring system and its components. After that, I need to consider special contexts that can confound interpretation, such as liver disease, COVID-19, and trauma. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized lab approach and note emerging or adjunctive markers, while double-checking areas where fibrinogen can be misleading.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis, because the lab pattern in DIC is a direct consequence of systemic thrombin generation, consumption of platelets and clotting factors, and secondary fibrinolysis. Widespread intravascular activation of coagulation with microthrombosis, plus impaired anticoagulant and fibrinolytic control, produces consumption coagulopathy and elevated fibrin degradation products, which is exactly what the labs should reflect [^114A9bGm] [^114hQSn9].

> I will now examine the platelet count, since thrombocytopenia is one of the most sensitive and consistent markers of consumption in DIC. Wait, let me verify the scoring thresholds: the ISTH overt DIC score assigns 0 points for platelets ≥ 100 × 10⁹/L, 1 point for 51–100 × 10⁹/L, and 2 points for ≤ 50 × 10⁹/L, underscoring that progressive thrombocytopenia tracks disease severity and correlates with outcomes in ICU cohorts [^117AYd2c] [^112ygEak]. Hold on, I should also note that in chronic or malignancy-associated DIC, platelets may be less severely depressed early on, so a "normal" platelet count does not exclude DIC in the right clinical context [^11718YhC].

> Next, I should review global clotting times, because consumption of clotting factors prolongs PT and aPTT. Let me think about the scoring: PT prolongation is weighted 0, 1, or 2 points based on < 3, 3–6, or ≥ 6 seconds above the upper limit of normal, respectively, which operationalizes the degree of factor consumption into the diagnosis and prognosis of overt DIC [^117AYd2c]. I need to ensure I remember that PT and aPTT reflect multiple factor deficiencies and are dynamic, so serial measurements are essential to capture trajectory [^1112yb6Y].

> Now, fibrinogen deserves careful interpretation. Initially, I thought fibrinogen is always low in DIC, but wait, let me verify that assumption because fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant and can be normal or even high early in sepsis or trauma despite ongoing consumption, masking the true deficit until late. The ISTH score awards 1 point only if fibrinogen is ≤ 1.0 g/L, and multiple studies show fibrinogen has poor discriminative power early in DIC, whereas a falling fibrinogen trend in the right clinical setting is more informative than a single value [^117AYd2c] [^112ygEak] [^1144LnYd]. Hold on, I should double-check that persistent, severe hypofibrinogenemia, especially < 1.5 g/L in bleeding patients, is when replacement is considered, which aligns with guideline thresholds for cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate [^111Q1fAh].

> I will now examine fibrin degradation markers, where D-dimer is the cornerstone. D-dimer rises due to plasmin-mediated breakdown of cross-linked fibrin, reflecting both thrombin generation and fibrinolysis; in the ISTH score, D-dimer or FDP elevation is weighted 2 or 3 points depending on severity, and D-dimer has excellent negative predictive value for excluding DIC when combined with other parameters, though it lacks specificity in cancer and inflammation [^117AYd2c] [^112DozZL]. Let me reconsider the role of FDP versus D-dimer: both are used, but D-dimer is more specific for fibrin breakdown, whereas FDP detects both fibrin and fibrinogen degradation; in trauma, an elevated FDP/D-dimer ratio may signal fibrinogenolysis and worse bleeding risk, which can refine phenotype assessment [^1144LnYd] [^11351xqV].

> But wait, what if the patient has liver disease or is pregnant, where baseline coagulation parameters are already abnormal? I need to ensure I contextualize the labs. In cirrhosis and ACLF, reduced hepatic synthesis of factors and thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism can mimic DIC, and many patients meet DIC score criteria without true intravascular activation; distinguishing features include clinical thrombosis, rising D-dimer, and falling fibrinogen in true DIC, whereas cirrhosis often shows relatively preserved or high fibrinogen and minimal D-dimer rise early on [^notfound]. In pregnancy and obstetric DIC, abrupt platelet drops, rising PT/aPTT, and falling fibrinogen accompany clinical bleeding and support the diagnosis when correlated with obstetric triggers like placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism [^1117eqzS].

> Next, I should review COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, because it is not classic DIC. Initially, I almost equated COVID-19 coagulopathy with DIC, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: COVID-19 typically shows markedly elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen with relatively preserved platelets and PT/aPTT early, and thrombotic complications predominate, reflecting endotheliopathy and complement activation rather than gross consumption; DIC scoring can be positive, yet the phenotype and management differ, so I need to flag this distinction to avoid misinterpretation [^114UssdE] [^113apArk] [^1142dGzc].

> I should also consider trauma-associated coagulopathy, where an early hyperfibrinolytic phenotype with low fibrinogen, high D-dimer/FDP, and prolonged PT/aPTT predicts massive transfusion and mortality; this overlaps with DIC but may include hypoperfusion-driven protein C activation and fibrinolysis, so I need to check for lactate, base deficit, and viscoelastic testing to distinguish mechanisms and guide hemostatic therapy [^1144LnYd] [^11351xqV].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized lab approach. First-line tests that best capture consumption and fibrin formation/degradation are platelet count, PT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer, interpreted in the clinical context and, ideally, scored with the ISTH algorithm to standardize diagnosis and risk stratify; a total score ≥ 5 indicates overt DIC and correlates with worse outcomes, so I should confirm dynamic changes with serial testing rather than a single snapshot [^117AYd2c] [^1112yb6Y]. Second-line or adjunctive tests that add mechanistic and prognostic insight include antithrombin activity, which often falls in overt DIC and tracks severity, and viscoelastic testing, which can rapidly profile clot formation and lysis at the bedside, though I should confirm that these are not yet validated for standalone DIC diagnosis [^112ygEak] [^11148vf8].

> I need to ensure I mention emerging markers and limitations. Biomarkers such as thrombin–antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragment 1+2, and PAI-1 reflect early activation and fibrinolytic shutdown, but they are not widely available and lack robust validation for routine DIC diagnosis; nonetheless, they may help detect nonovert DIC or pre-DIC states in research or specialized centers, so I should be cautious about overpromising their clinical utility [^11148vf8] [^112933VE]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance still emphasizes that no single test diagnoses DIC and that composite scoring with clinical correlation remains the standard, which it does across ISTH and BCSH documents [^114hjtJr] [^117Cbrf1].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence: the canonical laboratory pattern of overt DIC is thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT (and often aPTT), elevated D-dimer or FDP, and late hypofibrinogenemia, interpreted dynamically and in the context of an underlying trigger; recognizing exceptions such as early high fibrinogen, liver disease confounding, COVID-19 endotheliopathy, and trauma-related hyperfibrinolysis prevents misclassification and guides timely, mechanism-informed therapy [^114A9bGm] [^116vFT2w] [^114UssdE] [^1144LnYd].

The laboratory diagnosis of DIC relies on a **combination of tests** because no single assay is sensitive or specific enough [^114hjtJr]. The most consistent abnormalities are **thrombocytopenia**, **prolonged PT/aPTT**, **hypofibrinogenemia**, and **elevated D-dimer** [^114A9bGm]; however, fibrinogen may be normal or high early due to its acute-phase properties, so serial measurements are essential [^112ygEak]. The **ISTH scoring system** integrates platelet count, PT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer to standardize diagnosis and risk stratification [^117AYd2c] [^114NFaAf]. Additional tests (antithrombin, protein C, thrombin–antithrombin complexes, and viscoelastic assays) can help detect early or non-overt DIC but are not routinely required [^11148vf8].

## Core laboratory findings

| **Test** | **Typical findings in DIC** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Platelet count | Decreased (≤ 100 × 10⁹/L) | Consumption due to intravascular thrombosis [^114A9bGm] |
| Prothrombin time (PT) | Prolonged (> 3 seconds above normal) | Consumption of clotting factors (I, II, V, VII, X) [^114A9bGm] |
| Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) | Prolonged (> 10 seconds above normal) | Consumption of intrinsic pathway factors (VIII, IX, XI, XII) [^notfound] |
| Fibrinogen | Low (< 1.5 g/L) in advanced DIC; normal or high early | Acute-phase reactant; consumed with progression [^112ygEak] |
| D-dimer | Markedly elevated (> 4-fold normal) | Intravascular fibrin formation and degradation [^1125ZaMV] |
| Peripheral smear | Schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) | Microangiopathic hemolysis from microthrombi [^115G8nHt] |

---

## Additional laboratory tests

- **Antithrombin (AT)**: Reduced due to consumption and endothelial injury; correlates with severity [^112ygEak].
- **Protein C and protein S**: Reduced due to consumption and impaired synthesis [^notfound].
- **Thrombin–antithrombin complexes (TAT)**: Elevated, indicating ongoing thrombin generation [^notfound].
- **Fibrin degradation products (FDPs)**: Elevated, reflecting fibrinolysis [^1144LnYd].
- **Viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM)**: Shows rapid clot formation and lysis; useful for real-time assessment [^notfound].

---

## ISTH diagnostic scoring system

The ISTH provides a **standardized scoring system** for overt DIC using readily available tests:

| **Parameter** | **Score 0** | **Score 1** | **Score 2** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Platelet count (× 10⁹/L) | ≥ 100 | 50–99 | < 50 |
| PT prolongation (seconds) | < 3 | 3–6 | > 6 |
| Fibrinogen (g/L) | > 1.0 | ≤ 1.0 | N/A |
| D-dimer/FDP | No increase | Moderate increase | Severe increase |

---

A **total score ≥ 5** indicates overt DIC and correlates with clinical severity and mortality [^117AYd2c] [^112ygEak].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Liver disease**: Prolongs PT/aPTT, lowers fibrinogen, and elevates D-dimer, mimicking DIC [^116vFT2w].
- **COVID-19**: Elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen with minimal PT/aPTT/platelet changes early; distinct from classic DIC [^114UssdE] [^111Yv3ze].
- **Early DIC**: May show normal fibrinogen and subtle changes; serial testing improves detection [^112ygEak] [^1112yb6Y].

---

## Summary of laboratory findings

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Sensitive early marker of consumption [^112ygEak].
- **Prolonged PT/aPTT**: Reflects factor consumption [^114A9bGm].
- **Hypofibrinogenemia**: Late finding as synthesis lags behind consumption [^112ygEak].
- **Elevated D-dimer**: Indicates fibrin formation and breakdown [^1125ZaMV].
- **Schistocytes**: Suggest microangiopathic hemolysis [^115G8nHt].

---

The laboratory diagnosis of DIC requires a **multiparameter approach**, with the ISTH score providing standardized, prognostically relevant classification; serial testing and clinical context are essential to distinguish DIC from look-alikes and to detect early or non-overt disease [^114A9bGm] [^11148vf8].

### Current concepts in the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation [^114JNY7K]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation is a clinicopathological syndrome where widespread intravascular coagulation occurs in response to an inciting process. The pathophysiology for this disorder is complex with an important role for thrombin, the central regulator of the coagulation process. Since the clinical spectrum of DIC is variable due to its dynamic nature, the laboratory diagnosis should ideally be not based on a single marker or an isolated set of results. The treatment should primary focus on the management of the underlying triggering condition with blood products used as resuscitative measures. Newer therapeutic modalities have been recently tried with success although the management of DIC still remains a major challenge.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^113hX7Xt]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current knowledge on the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Data Source

Selected articles from the MEDLINE database.

Data Synthesis

DIC may complicate a variety of disorders and can cause significant morbidity (in particular related to organ dysfunction and bleeding) and may contribute to mortality. The pathogenesis of DIC is based on tissue factor-mediated initiation of systemic coagulation activation that is insufficiently contained by physiologic anticoagulant pathways and amplified by impaired endogenous fibrinolysis. The diagnosis of DIC can be made using routinely available laboratory tests and scoring algorithms. Supportive treatment of DIC may be aimed at replacement of platelets and coagulation factors, anticoagulant treatment, and restoration of anticoagulant pathways.

Conclusions

Insight into the pathogenesis of DIC has resulted in better strategies for clinical management, including straightforward diagnostic criteria and potentially beneficial supportive treatment options.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation current concepts of etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114BAkMw]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical and laboratory manifestations of DIC are complex, partly because of inter-relationships within the hemostasis system. Only by clearly understanding these extraordinarily complex pathophysiologic inter-relationships can the clinician and laboratory scientist appreciate the divergent and wide spectrum of often-confusing clinical and laboratory findings in patients with DIC. Many therapeutic decisions to be made are controversial and lack validation. Nevertheless, newer antithrombotic agents and agents that can block, blunt, or modify cytokine activity and the activity of vasoactive substances seem to be of value. The complexity and variable degree of clinical expression suggest that therapy should be individualized depending on the nature of DIC, the patient's age, etiology of DIC, site and severity of hemorrhage or thrombosis, and hemodynamics and other appropriate clinical parameters.

### Updated definition and scoring of disseminated intravascular coagulation in 2025: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on disseminated intravascular coagulation [^115Gwcb4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Compelling evidence supports the need to update the 2001 definition and diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to reflect our current understanding of disease pathophysiology. DIC has been long considered a critical and untreatable sequela of various underlying causes, with resolution only after treatment of the eliciting etiology. Recent views have evolved to appreciate that DIC-associated mortality may be reduced by detection and treatment at an early stage. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Scientific and Standardization Committee on DIC proposes an updated definition of DIC: "an acquired, life-threatening intravascular disorder characterized by systemic coagulation activation, dysregulated fibrinolysis, and endothelial injury, resulting in microthrombosis. DIC arises from various underlying etiologies and progresses from a potentially asymptomatic early phase to an advanced phase with hemorrhage and/or organ dysfunction". In accordance with this more comprehensive definition, we propose to establish more tailored diagnostic criteria that detect early-phase DIC based on the underlying disease. We also propose a modification to overt DIC diagnostic criteria and scoring for late-phase DIC. These consensus-driven modifications reflect knowledge obtained since the original 2001 definition, which advanced clinical practice and research on DIC. This revised framework is anticipated to foster more precise and earlier diagnoses, improve patient stratification in clinical studies, and facilitate the development of targeted therapies dependent on pathophysiological context.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation: epidemiology, biomarkers, and management [^114JSrDE]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic activation of the coagulation system, which results in microvascular thrombosis and, simultaneously, potentially life-threatening haemorrhage attributed to consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Underlying conditions, e.g. infection, cancer, or obstetrical complications are responsible for the initiation and propagation of the DIC process. This review provides insights into the epidemiology of DIC and the current understanding of its pathophysiology. It details the use of diagnostic biomarkers, current diagnostic recommendations from international medical societies, and it provides an overview of emerging diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Last, it provides guidance on management. It is concluded that timely and accurate diagnosis of DIC and its underlying condition is essential for the prognosis. Treatment should primarily focus on the underlying cause of DIC and supportive treatment should be individualised according to the underlying aetiology, patient's symptoms and laboratory records.

### Pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation in sepsis… [^112WmrkA]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective. — To review new insights in the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation in septic patients, in order to develop new directions for therapeutic intervention. Data Sources. — Articles and published peer-reviewed abstracts on the mechanism of the initiation of DIC in sepsis. Study Selection. — Studies selected for detailed review were those reporting specifics about the mechanism of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in experimental human and animal models of sepsis. Data extraction guidelines for assessing data quality included validity of the model, quality of the laboratory assessment of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and methodological considerations, such as the presence of control experiments and statistical analysis. Data Synthesis. — After the presence of endotoxin in the circulation, significant coagulation activation can be detected.

This activation is preceded by an increase in the serum levels of various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukins. Inhibition of the increase in tumor necrosis factor results in inhibition of coagulation activation. Measurement of molecular markers for the activation of coagulation proteins at various levels indicates that the activation of coagulation is mediated by the tissue factor — dependent pathway, which is further confirmed by experiments in which the inhibition of the tissue factor — dependent pathway resulted in complete inhibition of coagulation activation. The activation of coagulation seems to be amplified by impaired function of the protein C — protein S inhibitory pathway. An imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, ultimately leading to plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 — mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis, may further promote the procoagulant state. Conclusion.

— The increased knowledge of the various pathogenetic mechanisms of coagulation activation and fibrinolysis in sepsis may have therapeutic implications; however, their efficacy needs to be assessed in appropriate clinical trials.

### Current consideration and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation [^11768YJY]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a devastating clinical condition that is characterized by the loss of normal hemostatic control in response to sustained and systemic cell injury. The inciting injury may be from infection, trauma, or malignancy, but the consequent pathophysiology is multifactorial involving intertwined feedback loops between the coagulant, immune, and inflammatory pathways. Central to this is thrombin generation, but the ubiquitous nature of its in vivo functional consequences can make it difficult to dissect away the separate but overlapping components to the clinical problem. Therefore, early recognition and resolution of the precipitating events leading to DIC remains the central tenet to clinical care. This article refreshes our conceptual understanding of DIC pathogenesis and draws in recent advances in the cycle of cell death caused by extracellular nuclear proteins. It also aims to delineate recognition of response pathways that can be predominantly procoagulant or profibrinolytic to enable a more personalized and evidence-based approach to be delivered to the patient with DIC.

### Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^11718YhC]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is the physiologic result of pathologic overstimulation of the coagulation system. Despite multiple triggers, a myriad of laboratory abnormalities, and a clinical presentation ranging from gross hemostatic failure to life-threatening thrombosis, or even both simultaneously, a simplified clinical approach augmented by a few readily available tests allows prompt identification of the process and elucidation of treatment opportunities. Platelet counts in DIC may be low, especially in acute sepsis-associated DIC, yet increased in malignancy-associated chronic DIC. Thrombotic risk is not a function of the platelet count, and thrombocytopenia does not protect the patient from thrombosis. The stratification of both thrombotic risk and hemorrhagic risk will be addressed.

### How I treat disseminated intravascular coagulation [^111cy5Jr]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by systemic activation of coagulation, potentially leading to thrombotic obstruction of small and midsize vessels, thereby contributing to organ dysfunction. At the same time, ongoing consumption of platelets and coagulation proteins results in thrombocytopenia and low concentrations of clotting factors, which may cause profuse hemorrhagic complications. DIC is always secondary to an underlying condition, such as severe infections, solid or hematologic malignancies, trauma, or obstetric calamities. A reliable diagnosis of DIC can be made through simple scoring algorithms based on readily available routine hemostatic parameters. The cornerstone of supportive treatment of this coagulopathy is management of the underlying condition. Additionally, administration of heparin may be useful, and restoration of physiological anticoagulants has been suggested, but has not been proven successful in improving clinically relevant outcomes so far. In patients with major bleeding or at risk for hemorrhagic complications, administration of platelet concentrates, plasma, or coagulation factor concentrates should be considered.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^114hQSn9]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a syndrome triggered by infectious and noninfectious pathologies characterized by excessive generation of thrombin within the vasculature and widespread proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen. Despite diverse clinical manifestations ranging from thrombo-occlusive damage to bleeding diathesis, DIC etiology commonly involves excessive activation of blood coagulation and overlapping dysregulation of anticoagulants and fibrinolysis. Initiation of blood coagulation follows intravascular expression of tissue factor or activation of the contact pathway in response to pathogen-associated or host-derived, damage-associated molecular patterns. The process is further amplified through inflammatory and immunothrombotic mechanisms. Consumption of anticoagulants and disruption of endothelial homeostasis lower the regulatory control and disseminate microvascular thrombosis. Clinical DIC development in patients is associated with worsening morbidities and increased mortality, regardless of the underlying pathology; therefore, timely recognition of DIC is critical for reducing the pathologic burden. Due to the diversity of triggers and pathogenic mechanisms leading to DIC, diagnosis is based on algorithms that quantify hemostatic imbalance, thrombocytopenia, and fibrinogen conversion. Because current diagnosis primarily assesses overt consumptive coagulopathies, there is a critical need for better recognition of nonovert DIC and/or pre-DIC states. Therapeutic strategies for patients with DIC involve resolution of the eliciting triggers and supportive care for the hemostatic imbalance. Despite medical care, mortality in patients with DIC remains high, and new strategies, tailored to the underlying pathologic mechanisms, are needed.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^114WSSp8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide a review of the definition, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Methods

A case scenario and a review of the literature related to the pertinent facts concerning DIC are provided.

Results

DIC is a systemic pathophysiologic process and not a single disease entity, resulting from an overwhelming activation of coagulation that consumes platelets and coagulation factors and causes microvascular fibrin thrombi, which can result in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome from tissue ischemia. Some conditions associated with acute DIC include septic shock, exsanguinating trauma, burns, or acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Conclusions

The massive tissue factor stimulus results in excess intravascular thrombin, which overcomes the anticoagulant systems and leads to thrombosis. Because of consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, DIC also has a hemorrhagic phase. Treatment of the bleeding patient with DIC is supportive with the use of blood components.

### Clinical characteristics of disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with solid and hematological cancers [^115GiyeP]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Malignant disease can be complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is defined as systemic intravascular triggering of coagulation (resulting in intravascular fibrin clot formation) and concurrent depletion of clotting factors and platelets (increasing the risk of hemorrhage). The clinical presentation of DIC in patients with cancer has usually a less fulminant presentation than DIC that may accompany other underlying disorders, such as sepsis and trauma. A more insidious, but also more protracted, diffuse activation of coagulation can proceed without any symptom. Ultimately this may lead to deficiency of platelets and clotting factors and hemorrhage (often at the site of the tumor or metastases) may be the first clinical symptom indicating the presence of DIC. An alternative presentation may be thrombosis, ranging from overt venous thrombo-embolism to microvascular disease and thrombotic microangiopathy. The therapeutic foundation of DIC is management of the underlying condition but in some cases supportive interventions, specifically targeting the hemostatic system may be needed.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^114A9bGm]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by widespread intravascular activation of coagulation that can be caused by infectious insults (such as sepsis) and non-infectious insults (such as trauma). The main pathophysiological mechanisms of DIC are inflammatory cytokine-initiated activation of tissue factor-dependent coagulation, insufficient control of anticoagulant pathways and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-mediated suppression of fibrinolysis. Together, these changes give rise to endothelial dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis, which can cause organ dysfunction and seriously affect patient prognosis. Recent observations have pointed to an important role for extracellular DNA and DNA-binding proteins, such as histones, in the pathogenesis of DIC. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) established a DIC diagnostic scoring system consisting of global haemostatic test parameters. This scoring system has now been well validated in diverse clinical settings. The theoretical cornerstone of DIC management is the specific and vigorous treatment of the underlying conditions, and DIC should be simultaneously managed to improve patient outcomes. The ISTH guidance for the treatment of DIC recommends treatment strategies that are based on current evidence. In this Primer, we provide an updated overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of DIC and discuss the future directions of basic and clinical research in this field.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^1172MVUu]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should encompass both clinical and laboratory information. The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of < 50 x 10(9)/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (< 1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5–2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of < 30 x 10(9)/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h).

### Management of cancer-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation [^116nqe8A]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Cancer may be complicated by the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is characterized by a widespread and intravascular activation of coagulation (leading to intravascular fibrin deposition) and simultaneous consumption of coagulation factors and platelets (potentially resulting in bleeding). Clinically, DIC in cancer has in general a less fulminant presentation than the types of DIC complicating sepsis and trauma. A more gradual, but also more chronic, systemic activation of coagulation can proceed subclinically. Eventually this process may lead to exhaustion of platelets and coagulation factors and bleeding (for example at the site of the tumor) may be the first clinical symptom indicating the presence of DIC. In some cases, the clinical presentation of DIC in cancer may be reminiscent of thrombotic microangiopathies, which is understandable in view of the role of endothelium in both conditions. The therapeutic cornerstone of DIC is treatment of the underlying disorder but supportive treatment, specifically aimed at the hemostatic system may be required.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe, often life-threatening, syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system with intravascular thrombin generation, and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, the primary aim of which is to eliminate the underlying condition (i.e. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases).D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC because, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value, the use of D-dimer measurement in this context has been endorsed by all national and international guidelines. For example, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) not only validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value, but also recommended sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor DIC evolution, and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

Cancer, inflammation, and infection

The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors, being associated with growth and progression. As a consequence, up to 20% of cancer patients develop VTE, which is the second leading cause of death.D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common finding of high D-dimer in cancer even in the absence of thrombosis limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, incorporating D-dimer measurement in appropriate scoring systems including other biomarkers may help to identify cancer patients at increased risk of developing VTE who are thus candidates for primary thromboprophylaxis. In addition, although the value of screening patients with increased D-dimer for occult cancer is still a subject of debate, an occult cancer may be considered as the potential source of a substantial rise in D-dimer levels when other physiological or pathological causes have been ruled out. The usefulness of this approach has been highlighted in a clinical study in patients with unprovoked VTE, demonstrating that extremely high D-dimer (> 4,000 µg/L) is independently associated with the likelihood of an occult cancer.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^115PXu32]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation in obstetrics is commonly seen associated with massive hemorrhage due to different etiological factors. It may also be seen with intrauterine demise, infections, and hepatic conditions. It is associated with very high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A battery of laboratory tests (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and plasma fibrinogen) can be used in the diagnosis, but no single test in isolation is sensitive and specific enough for diagnosis. Cornerstone of management is to identify the underlying pathology for disseminated intravascular coagulation. This chapter looks into molecular basis of obstetric DIC and identifies important laboratory tests, along with management. It also identifies topics of future research in the field of obstetric DIC.

Many critically ill patients develop hemostatic abnormalities, ranging from isolated thrombocytopenia or prolonged global clotting tests to complex defects, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. There are many causes for a deranged coagulation in critically ill patients and each of these underlying disorders may require specific therapeutic or supportive management. In recent years, new insights into the pathogenesis and clinical management of many coagulation defects in critically ill patients have been accumulated and this knowledge is helpful in determining the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.

### Antithrombin and simultaneous tissue plasminogen activator therapy in A 15-month-old patient with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation… [^111GQbVa]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a complication that occurs in 35% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in children and adults. This disorder is characterized by widespread thrombosis as well as suppressed fibrinolysis. Management includes both treatment of the underlying infection and the hematologic abnormalities that contribute to DIC and its complications. Currently, there is no consensus on a treatment algorithm for DIC in pediatric patients. We present a 15-month-old female with sepsis-induced DIC secondary to group A Streptococcus infection, who was treated with antithrombin and simultaneous tissue plasminogen activator infusions.

Her physical examination and laboratory findings were consistent with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, as evidenced by her cardiovascular compromise, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, and diffuse, purpuric lesions on her extremities with no proximal or distal pulses. She required high flow oscillatory ventilation, 100% inspired oxygen, inhaled nitric oxide, and inotropic support in addition to receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. For treatment of her DIC, an AT infusion consisting of a 500 IU intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion ranging from 25–35 units/kg/hr was administered for 48 hours to maintain AT levels at 150%. tPA was simultaneously started at 0. 025 mg/kg/hr with the AT infusion.

Within the first 12 hours of this combination therapy, the patient was transitioned to conventional mechanical ventilation from HFOV, had a decrease in inspired oxygen to 50%, iNO was discontinued, inotropic support was significantly weaned, and there was noted clinical improvement in the patient's extremities. Proximal and distal pulses returned, indicating marked improvement of perfusion in previously devitalized limbs. No bleeding complications or adverse events were noted in the patient during or after therapy. Continuous infusions of AT and tPA as combination therapy resulted in rapid improvement of the patient's sepsis-induced DIC, weaning of cardiopulmonary support, resolution of MODS, and restoration of perfusion in devitalized extremities. This treatment demonstrates potential for further research that could alter the approach to the management of DIC in pediatric patients.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation or extended intravascular coagulation in massive pulmonary embolism [^113xgwsE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic activation of coagulation may occur in the context of a variety of clinical situations. This coagulation activation may only be detectable by measuring sensitive molecular markers for activation of coagulation factors and pathways, but can become clinically manifest as changes in routine coagulation tests may occur. The spectrum of clinically manifest coagulation activation ranges from a small decrease in platelet count and sub-clinical prolongation of global clotting times to its most extreme form, for example fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), characterized by gross laboratory abnormalities and simultaneous widespread microvascular thrombosis and profuse bleeding from various sites. DIC is not a disease or a symptom but a syndrome, which is always secondary to an underlying disorder. Although these conditions may be very different, the pathogenesis of DIC seems to follow similar lines. Briefly, intravascular fibrin deposition is a result of tissue factor-mediated thrombin generation that is insufficiently balanced by dysfunctional physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms, such as the antithrombin system and the protein C system. In addition to enhanced fibrin formation, fibrin removal is impaired as a result of depression of the fibrinolytic system caused by high circulating levels of the fibrinolytic inhibitor PAI-1.

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^111zPzQr]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Three guidelines have recently been published for the diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults. This communication seeks to harmonize the recommendations in these guidelines using a modified GRADE system. The scoring system for diagnosis of DIC using global coagulation tests is known to correlate with key clinical observations and outcomes (Moderate quality). The cornerstone of DIC treatment is the treatment of the underlying condition (Moderate quality). In general, transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should be reserved for patients who are bleeding (Low quality). Therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered in cases of DIC where clinical features of thrombosis predominate. Heparin is not recommended in those patients with a high risk of bleeding, (Moderate quality). However, prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin or low molecular we ight heparin is recommended in critically ill and non-bleeding patients with DIC for prevention of venous thromboembolism (Moderate to High quality). Although further prospective evidence from randomized controlled trials is required, administration of antithrombin or recombinant thrombomodulin may be considered in certain patients with DIC. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents (Low quality). However those who present with severe bleeding, that is characterized by a markedly hyperfibrinolytic state such as leukemia (Low quality) and trauma (Moderate quality), may be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. © 2013 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1125ZaMV]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic condition triggered by infectious and noninfectious causes. According to the International Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH), DIC is an acquired syndrome characterized by systemic activation of coagulation within the vasculature leading to microvascular damage and organ dysfunction. The definition emphasizes that DIC originates, develops within, and affects the microvasculature and is not restricted to the site of insult, but spreads throughout the body.

Etiology

DIC is a complication of many disorders, such as severe systemic infections, malignancy, trauma, obstetrical complications, vascular malformations, severe immunological reactions, and heat stroke. Despite a heterogenous clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic, to mild, to overwhelming thrombosis or bleeding, at its core, DIC follows exposure to or production of procoagulants insufficiently balanced by endogenous anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms. The excessive activation of thrombin, evidenced by elevated thrombin-antithrombin complexes or prothrombin activation fragments in the circulation, leads to proteolytic fibrinogen conversion and intravascular formation of fibrin. If usage of clotting factors exceeds the synthetic hepatic output, a consumptive coagulopathy develops that, in conjunction with thrombocytopenia, predicts an elevated risk of bleeding. Intravascular fibrin is counterbalanced by plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis leading to increased fibrin degradation products (-dimers) in the circulation. When fibrinolysis cannot compensate for the excessive coagulopathy, obstructive microthrombi formation may lead to hypoperfusion and hypoxia of peripheral organs.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in paediatrics [^115gzxMM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in paediatrics is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although there have been several recent advances in the pathophysiology of DIC, most of these studies were done in adults. Since the haemostatic system is very different in early life and changes dramatically with age, creating a variety of challenges for the clinician, delay in the diagnosis of DIC can happen until overt DIC is evident. In this review article, we report the aetiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tests and a management algorithm to guide paediatricians when treating patients with DIC.

The following constitutes key background information on disseminated intravascular coagulation:

- **Definition**: DIC is a clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by systemic activation of widespread coagulation resulting in severe bleeding and organ failure.
- **Pathophysiology**: DIC is mostly caused by hypercoagulation (infection, particularly sepsis) and hyperfibrinolysis (acute promyelocytic leukemia, obstetric diseases, or aortic aneurysms).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of DIC in the US is estimated at 18.6 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include latent and compensated activation of coagulation (no obvious clinical symptoms) and overt DIC (microvascular thrombosis, multi-organ dysfunction, macrovascular thrombi resulting in venous or arterial obstruction and embolization). Sustained thrombin generation results in severe bleeding and an increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital mortality of DIC in critically ill patients is 45%.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome: clinical and haematological characteristics of 23 patients [^112otsBm]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterised by formation of microthrombi and fibrin deposition in the microvasculature. The catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterised by multiorgan thrombosis, mainly involving small vessels. A broad spectrum of disorders may develop DIC features; however, the catastrophic APS has not previously been recognised as a cause of DIC.

Objective

To analyse the clinical and laboratory characteristics of catastrophic APS patients with DIC features.

Methods

The web site based international registry of patients with catastrophic APS (CAPS registry) (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM) was analysed and the cases with DIC features selected.

Results

In 173 patients with catastrophic APS, 23 (13%) were found with DIC features. The clinical and immunological characteristics were similar in catastrophic APS patients with and without DIC features; a significant difference was found only in the prevalence of thrombocytopenia (100% in patients with DIC features v 59% in those without DIC features).

Conclusions

DIC features are not rare in catastrophic APS, supporting the need for systematic screening of antiphospholipid antibodies in all patients with DIC features without precipitating factors. The presence of DIC features in the context of an APS makes it imperative to rule out the catastrophic variant of this syndrome.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and cirrhotic coagulopathy: overlap and differences. the current state of knowledge. communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^116vFT2w]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have decreasing plasma levels of coagulation factors and platelet counts with increased levels of D-dimer. Standard laboratory tests are used clinically to diagnose DIC and quantify the severity of the disease. In patients with cirrhosis, liver-derived plasma coagulation factor levels are reduced due to decreased hepatic synthesis, further exacerbated by extravascular redistribution of these proteins, causing prolongation of routine diagnostic coagulation tests. Platelets are often decreased in cirrhosis due to reduced production and portal hypertension, resulting in hypersplenism and sequestration. Patients with cirrhosis frequently have elevated fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product levels without having acute medical decompensation. As a result, these patients commonly meet the laboratory criteria of DIC. However, it has been debated whether laboratory-assessed DIC is present in patients with cirrhosis and if it has clinical relevance. In this communication, we review hemostatic features in cirrhosis and DIC, examine published studies that evaluate the activation of hemostasis in patients with cirrhosis, and highlight future directions for research.

### Microvascular thrombosis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [^116qC8os]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This paper will review the involvement of disseminated intravascular coagulation-induced microvascular thrombosis in the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and the interaction between disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in critically ill patients. The published literature on clinical and experimental studies are the data sources of the study. Histologic evidence of microvascular thrombosis and tissue injury in disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported in clinical, experimental, and autopsy findings. Proinflammatory cytokine-evoked neutrophil-endothelial activation and interplay between inflammation and coagulation through protease-activated receptors contribute to enhanced microvascular fibrin deposition in organs. In a clinical setting, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation synergistically play pivotal roles in the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and in the poor prognosis of critical illness. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to microvascular thrombosis and subsequent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Recent knowledge on the relationship between disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome gives further insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to patients with malignancy, ISTH 2015 guidelines recommend to consider transfusing 1–2 doses of platelets (commonly from 5 donors or equivalent) in patients with DIC at high risk of bleeding (such as surgery or invasive procedures), if the platelet count is < 30×10⁹/L in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and < 20×10⁹/L in other cancers.

### Management of disseminated intravascular coagulation: a survey of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^113R6oh3]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is not clear if and how international guidelines on the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are translated in routine clinical practice.

Materials and Methods

A survey was conducted among different specialists who treat DIC. The survey examined six hypothetical case scenarios including the diagnosis of DIC, the treatment of non-overt and overt DIC with or without thrombosis, and the management of DIC patients at risk of bleeding or actively bleeding.

Results

There were 191 respondents and 73 returned complete questionnaires. Most of respondents were specialists in hematology (48%) or intensive care (30%). In suspected overt or non-overt DIC, only one third use formal diagnostic scores while two thirds rely on a broad panel of coagulation tests independently of any score. In non-overt DIC, 68% provide no treatment, but monitor laboratory tests. Monitoring was considered by 48% of respondents in overt DIC without thrombosis or bleeding. When a thrombotic or bleeding complication ensues, 29% consider intervening only if the event is major. In DIC patients judged at risk of bleeding, 67% use prophylactic transfusions, mostly fresh-frozen plasma (73%) and platelets (65%). Active bleeding is often managed with fresh-frozen plasma (83%) and platelet transfusions (68%) as first line and recombinant activated factor VII (31%) as second line treatment.

Conclusions

This survey shows a largely heterogeneous approach of clinicians to the diagnosis and management of DIC. There is limited use of diagnostic scores despite guidelines' recommendations. The prevalent attitude seems monitoring DIC and limiting treatment to the underlying disease, unless thrombosis or bleeding develop, but modalities varied considerably.

Future perspectives

The diversity of DIC, in terms of underlying conditions, prothrombotic triggers, anticoagulant dysregulation, and the gamut of hemostatic complications from thrombosis to bleeding that can sometimes occur in the same patient during the course of disease, makes it challenging to assess this broad pathology in clinical settings. As a result, nonovert DIC states are harder to diagnose accurately, and overt DIC diagnosis is usually confirmed when physiologic compensatory mechanisms are long overcome. Better biomarker definitions and stratification of DIC subtypes and patients are needed. Ideally, combinations of biomarkers that define DIC subtypes would reflect the underlying pathologic mechanisms and allow for targeted therapeutic approaches, unlike the global anticoagulant strategies used so far. This need is painfully obvious from retrospective analyses of anticoagulant trials in sepsis, where benefits observed ex post facto in subgroups of patients are drowned by the overall heterogeneity of these studies. Furthermore, we need a better understanding of the pre-DIC state along with predictive assessments of clinical developments. This knowledge would greatly expand the therapeutic repertoire, adding preventive interventions with fewer side effects.

Current therapeutic approaches in patients with DIC target the resolution of the underlying trigger (infection, trauma, and malignancy) and are mostly compensatory in nature, being restricted to supplementation of the missing components (clotting factors, anticoagulants, and platelets) necessary to restore hemostatic balance.

Targeting the TF pathway directly or by TFPI supplementation significantly increases the risk of bleeding due to hemostatic impairment. Unless the inhibitors can be spatially and/or temporally aimed toward the developing thrombi, they are unlikely to be useful systemically. In contrast, limiting clotting amplification through inhibition of the contact/intrinsic pathways and/or modulation of terminal reactions seems to have better potential. We and others have shown that contact pathway inhibition reduces sepsis-associated coagulopathy and improves organ function in experimental bacteremia. Defining the role of the contact pathway in DIC associated with other pathologies is needed to identify additional patients for whom the strategy may be useful. Likewise, inhibitors of terminal clotting reactions have long been used for thromboprophylaxis. They usually have relatively long half-lives in circulation, and, as such, their use is problematic in fast-progressing acute coagulopathies with the potential for bleeding. In contrast, short-lived inhibitors of FXa and thrombin attenuated DIC and protected organ function in Escherichia coli sepsis in baboons, and may be useful in clinical settings. These strategies nevertheless require further clinical validation.

### Prevention and management of thrombosis in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [^113apArk]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

A proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop moderate or severe COVID-19, with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. The inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an acute-phase response and endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, the clinical and laboratory features of which differ in some respects from those of classic disseminated intravascular coagulation. Understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis in COVID-19 is needed to develop approaches to management and prevention, with implications for short-term and long-term health outcomes. Evidence is emerging to support treatment decisions in patients with COVID-19, but many questions remain about the optimum approach to management. In this Viewpoint, we provide a summary of the pathophysiology of thrombosis and associated laboratory and clinical findings, and highlight key considerations in the management of coagulopathy in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19, including coagulation assessment, identification of thromboembolic complications, and use of antithrombotic prophylaxis and therapeutic anticoagulation. We await the results of trials that are underway to establish the safety and benefits of prolonged thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in pediatric patients: clinical and laboratory features and prognostic factors influencing the survival [^114fbcvu]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Although disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been a well-known disorder for many years, there is lack of sufficient number of clinical trials about incidence, frequency of underlying disorders, and prognosis of DIC in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, etiologic factors, and clinical and laboratory findings of DIC and to determine the prognostic factors influencing the mortality in hospitalized pediatric patients. Medical records of 5535 children who were hospitalized were investigated. Sixty-two patients who were diagnosed as acute DIC were enrolled. The frequency of DIC was 1.12%. The underlying etiologic factors were infection in 59 patients (95.2%) and major trauma in 3 patients (4.8%). The frequency of bleeding and thrombosis was 48.8 and 4.8%. Respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, and gastrointestinal dysfunction was present in 71, 67.7, 35.5, 16.1, 16.1 and 11.3% of patients, respectively. Respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunctions were significantly associated with mortality. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was present in 85.5% of the patients, and 54.8% of the patients had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality rate was significantly high in patients with MODS and ARDS. In multivariete logistic regression analysis, only ARDS and cardiovascular dysfunction had predictive and prognostic value on mortality. None of the diagnostic laboratory tests had predictive or prognostic value and the degree of abnormality of these tests did not show any correlation with mortality. In conclusion, DIC is not a rare disorder in hospitalized children, especially in patients with sepsis, and MODS, ARDS, and respiratory and cardiovascular system dysfunctions are poor prognostic factors.

Diagnosis

Considering the multitude of causative factors, DIC diagnosis is always made in the context of the clinical presentation. Currently, DIC cannot be diagnosed by any single laboratory test, and combinations of clinical biomarkers are used instead. Global coagulation tests, such as activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (PT) are routinely used in patients with sepsis to assess the consumptive coagulopathy. Although not yet validated for diagnostic use, viscoelastic point-of-care testing allows for rapid and concomitant monitoring of both coagulation and fibrinolysis in patientstreated for trauma and, in pilot studies, distinguished between critically ill patients with DIC and patients without DIC.

Three diagnostic algorithms for DIC have been developed, 2 in Japan and 1 by the ISTH Standardization Committee. The ISTH diagnostic score for overt DIC (Table 1) is calculated based on platelet count, PT, fibrinogen level, and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation peptides (-dimer) in conjunction with clinical considerations. A score of 5 or more indicates overt DIC. A simpler DIC score calculated in the first 48 hours using platelet counts and PT could reflect the severity of the underlying disorder.

Table 1.
ISTH diagnostic algorithm for the diagnosis of overt DIC

There have been attempts to establish scoring algorithms to detect early (nonovert, compensated) DIC before it reaches a full-blown, frequently irreversible stage. Biomarkers of thrombin generation (TAT and prothrombin fragment-1 and -2), fibrinolysis activation (plasmin-antiplasmin and D-dimer), and suppression (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI1]; tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]-PAI-1 complexes) are used to assess early stages of DIC, as well as its severity and progression. Measurement of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as high-mobility group box-1, nucleosomes, extracellular histones, and cell-free DNA, in correlation with scores of organ function (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score) and severity of disease (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), could provide additional information, but their diagnostic and prognostic potential has not been demonstrated in large cohorts. Currently, the absence of algorithms with DIC prediction power greatly limits preventive therapeutic interventions.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1142dGzc]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The intravascular coagulopathy commonly observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, which frequently exhibit nonovert DIC, can trigger both thrombotic and bleeding complications. The progressive-dimer elevation documented in nonsurviving patients with COVID-19indicates active coagulopathy, associates with hyperinflammatory markers, and predicts thrombotic complications and mortality. Elevated-dimer accompanied by thrombocytopenia predict an enhanced bleeding risk. No significant changes in global coagulation test results and fibrinogen level were observed between patients with or without coagulopathic COVID-19, indicating compensatory hepatic synthesis of clotting factors. The coagulopathic mechanisms in COVID-19 are under active investigation. Because endothelial cells harbor the ACE-2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the endothelium promoting endotheliopathy and microvascular thrombosis. Unlike SARS-CoV-1, which replicates and triggers TF transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, SARS-CoV-2 replication in monocytes has not been confirmed. Nevertheless, intravascular TF can be induced by platelet-monocyte aggregates in patients with COVID-19. We learned that inflammatory mediators, complement, and autoimmune mechanismscould amplify the coagulopathy, but such findings will require mechanistic confirmation in experimental models. Thus, anticoagulants can benefit patients with prothrombotic COVID-19, but coagulopathic monitoring is still necessary to prevent bleeding. At the moment, the American Society of Hematology recommends prophylactic-intensity anticoagulants for patients with COVID-19 who do not have confirmed venous thromboembolism.

### Diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation: guidelines of the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET) [^112LbMUw]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) remain extremely controversial.

Purpose

The Italian Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis commissioned a project to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of DIC.

Methods

Key questions about the diagnosis and treatment of DIC were formulated by a multidisciplinary working group consisting of experts in clinical medicine and research. After a systematic review and discussion of the literature, recommendations were formulated and graded according to the supporting evidence. In the absence of evidence, evidence of low quality, or contradictory evidence, a formal consensus method was used to issue clinical recommendations.

Results and Conclusions

In suspected DIC, we suggest the use of the diagnostic scores ISTH (grade C), JMHW (grade C) or JAAM (grade D) over stand alone tests. The cornerstone of the management of DIC remains the treatment of the underlying triggering disease. We do not suggest the use of antithrombin (grade D), dermatan sulphate (grade D), gabexate (grade D), recombinant factor VIIa (grade D), activated protein C (grade D), thrombomodulin (grade B). The use of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is not suggested except for thromboembombolic prophylaxis in patients a high risk who do not have active bleeding (grade D). In patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and DIC we suggest the use of human recombinant activated protein C (grade D). In patients with DIC and active bleeding we suggest the use of transfusion therapy (platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate) (grade D).

### New diagnostic strategy for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: a prospective single-center observational study [^111CdUo7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is often a complication that occurs in the clinical course of medical and surgical patients treated for other diseases, and remains one of the most significant causes of mortality in intensive care units. The most recent international sepsis guidelines entitled "Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012" recommend early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis to avoid multiple organ failure and other adverse outcomes. Sepsis is diagnosed based on evidence of infection along with the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) defined by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) guidelines. And sepsis was diagnosed when patients met the criteria for SIRS and an infectious source was documented or strongly suspected based on clinical presentation.

The majority of ill patients with SIRS present with coagulation abnormalities. Inflammation and coagulation play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Evidence of extensive cross-talk between these two systems has been increasing; inflammation leads to the activation of coagulation, which in turn considerably affects inflammatory activity. Since infection-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is closely associated with SIRS in a considerable percentage of patients, patients who exhibit two or more SIRS criteria for more than three consecutive days are frequently associated with DIC. Sepsis is the most common disease associated with DIC. Approximately 20 to 40% of all sepsis patients are complicated with DIC. There are some standard care procedures for sepsis, including the use of antibiotics, oxygen, fluid resuscitation and corticosteroids. However, the mortality rate is still within the range of 30 to 50% in patients with septic shock. Gando et al. reported that DIC is frequently associated with SIRS (83%) and that such patients have a high mortality rate (63%). Thus, the mortality rate of sepsis patients complicated with DIC is clearly higher than that of patients without DIC. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced DIC are critical for improving the prognosis.

However, there are different diagnostic systems and criteria for SIRS/sepsis and DIC. Furthermore, there are still no diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced DIC, which may delay diagnosis and treatment initiation, and consequently be detrimental for the patient. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced DIC.

Key messages

We proposed new diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced DIC.
The optimal two-marker panel for sepsis-induced DIC comprises the following: (1) presepsin, an inflammatory biomarker and (2) protein C, a coagulation marker.
The new sepsis-induced DIC diagnostic criteria were defined as the following three groups: (1) severe, presepsin > 900 pg/mL and PC < 45%; (2) mild, presepsin < 650 pg/mL and PC > 45%, or 650 < presepsin < 900 pg/mL and PC > 55%; and (3) moderate, ranges between those of the severe and mild groups.
The severity of sepsis-induced DIC criteria proposed herein allows the discrimination of patients who have severe status according to DIC, physiological illness (APACHE II), multiple organ failure (SOFA) and mortality.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a frequent test sent to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of ill patients. Not uncommonly hematologic abnormalities may be the first sign of an underlying systemic disorder. The astute clinician needs to understand how systemic disease can affect the CBC to direct further diagnostic investigations. This article focuses on the 2 most common acquired anemias including iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Year in review 2013: critical care – sepsis [^116jtfdx]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation scoring system includes SIRS criteria, platelet count, fibrinogen level, and prothrombin time. Gando and colleagues showed that disseminated intravascular coagulation-positive patients with severe sepsis at admission exhibited higher prevalence of septic shock and positive blood cultures. The 28-day mortality gradually increased with the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation score, and the score at day 1 was an independent predictor of 28-day mortality.

Abnormal body temperature is a frequent finding in patients with sepsis, and it was hypothesised that temperature patterns could be early indicators of sepsis and prognostic markers. In a retrospective case–control study, Drewry and colleagues identified abnormal temperature patterns 72 hours prior to clinical suspicion of sepsis (described as an 'increase in amplitude, change in frequency or loss of variability') in afebrile ICU patients as predictive of subsequent diagnosis of sepsis (OR = 4.43, 95% CI = 1.31 to 15.00, P = 0.017). In a second prospective multicentre observational study of 624 patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, Kushimoto and colleagues demonstrated that hypothermia during the first 24 hours of diagnosis, defined as body temperature ≤ 36.5°C, was identified as an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.25 to 3.04, P = 0.003). Elevated body temperature, in contrast, was not associated with an increased disease severity or risk of mortality. These findings are of importance, as temperature is easily recorded at the bedside and could bring useful diagnostic and prognostic information. However, care should be taken regarding how and when body temperature is recorded, which should be standardised in future prospective studies.

### Communication from the scientific standardization committees of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis on vascular endothelium-related biomarkers in disseminated intravascular coagulation [^113qpTRG]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is not a disease criterion but a pathomechanistic process that accompanies various underlying diseases. According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition, endothelial injury is an essential component in addition to systemic coagulation activation. Despite this definition, current diagnostic criteria for DIC do not include biomarkers for vascular endothelial injury. Endothelial cells are critical for hemostatic regulation because they produce various antithrombotic substances and express anticoagulant factors at the same time as facilitating coagulation, inflammatory reactions, platelet aggregation, and fibrinolysis with acute injury. Endothelial cells also exhibit various receptors, adhesion molecules, and the critical role of glycocalyx that regulates cellular interactions in thromboinflammation. For clinicians, biomarkers suitable for assessing endothelial injury are not readily available. Although we still do not have ideal biomarkers, antithrombin activity and von Willebrand factor can be candidates for the endothelium-related markers because those reflect the severity and are available in most clinical settings. Further, the dysfunction of endothelial cell in DIC arising from various underlying diseases is likely highly variable. For example, the involvement of endothelial dysfunction is significant in sepsis-induced coagulopathy, while moderate in trauma-induced coagulopathy, and variable in hematologic malignancy-associated coagulopathy. Because of the complexity of disease status associated with DIC, further research searching clinically available endothelium-related biomarkers is expected to establish individualized diagnostic criteria and potential therapeutic approaches.

### Comparison of diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): diagnostic criteria of the international society of thrombosis and hemostasis and of the Japanese ministry of health and welfare for overt DIC [^117AYd2c]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ISTH criteria criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation" for disseminated intravascular coagulation.

The ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of DIC, a complex systemic thrombohemorrhagic disorder. The tool is particularly useful in stratifying patients based on the severity of their coagulation abnormalities, thereby facilitating timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions.

The ISTH DIC criteria incorporates four primary components: platelet count, fibrinogen degradation product level, prothrombin time (PT) prolongation, and fibrinogen level. Each component is scored based on the severity of the abnormality. For platelet count, a score of 0 is assigned for counts ≥ 100 ×10⁹/L, 1 for counts between 51–100 ×10⁹/L, and 2 for counts ≤ 50 ×10⁹/L. Fibrinogen degradation product level is scored as 0 for no increase, 2 for a moderate increase, and 3 for a severe increase. Prolonged PT is scored as 0 for < 3 seconds, 1 for 3–6 seconds, and 2 for ≥ 6 seconds. Lastly, fibrinogen level is scored as 0 for > 1 g/L and 1 for ≤ 1 g/L.

The total score is calculated by summing the scores from each of the four components. A score of less than 5 suggests that the criteria for DIC are not met, while a score of 5 or more meets the criteria for DIC. This scoring system allows for a standardized and objective assessment of DIC, which can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable clinical presentation and the lack of a single definitive diagnostic test.

The ISTH criteria calculator assesses the likelihood of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) by evaluating four key clinical parameters, each contributing to a composite score.

1. **Platelet count (cells ×10⁹/L)**:
- **≥ 100**: 0 points
- **51–100**: 1 point
- **≤ 50**: 2 points

2. **Fibrinogen degradation product level**:
- **No increase**: 0 points
- **Moderate increase**: 2 points
- **Severe increase**: 3 points

3. **Prolonged PT (seconds)**:
- **< 3**: 0 points
- **3–6**: 1 point
- **≥ 6**: 2 points

4. **Fibrinogen level (g/L)**:
- **> 1**: 0 points
- **≤ 1**: 1 point

The process begins by examining each parameter and selecting the option that aligns with clinical observations. Each choice is assigned a predetermined score. These individual scores are then aggregated to form a total score, which ranges from 0 to a maximum of 8.

The interpretation hinges on this total score:

- A total score less than 5 suggests that the criteria for DIC are not met, indicating a lower probability of the condition.
- A score of 5 or more implies that the criteria for DIC are met, signaling a higher likelihood of the disorder.

Through this calculated approach, the ISTH criteria tool aids clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the diagnosis of DIC.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in children with cancer: a systematic review [^116qcw6S]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may complicate malignant disease. Numerous studies have investigated this association in adults, however only sparse knowledge exists on DIC in pediatric cancer patients. The objective of this article was to systematically review the literature regarding DIC in pediatric malignancies. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant articles on January 31, 2020. In total, 6,070 articles were identified out of which 24 articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. These were included in the qualitative synthesis. The National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tools was used to assess bias in the included articles. The studies were of only moderate quality mainly based on medical charts and demonstrated high heterogeneity, especially as regards to diagnostic criteria. DIC was reported most frequently in patients with acute leukemia, particularly the subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Standard coagulation parameters were used as diagnostic laboratory tests supporting the diagnosis of DIC. Hemorrhage was the predominant clinical manifestation, whereas thromboembolic events and organ failure were reported less frequently. Unfractionated heparin, platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma were the most frequently used supportive treatment agents. Hemorrhage accounted for the majority of deaths in children with acute leukemia and solid tumors. In conclusion, only a limited number of studies, being heterogenous and of moderate quality, have investigated DIC in pediatric malignancy. Notably, this entity seems to be complicated mainly by hemorrhage. High quality studies are needed to evaluate diagnosis, clinical manifestations and optimal treatment of DIC in childhood cancers.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation or acute coagulopathy of trauma shock early after trauma? An observational study [^115TTiXZ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trauma is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, and since hemorrhage accounts for approximately 40% of all trauma fatalities. this is a leading cause of potentially preventable deaths. When death is not immediately due to exsanguination, bleeding and prolonged shock increase the risk of multiple organ failure and late mortality. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for death in trauma patients remain elusive but much attention has been given to coagulopathy since this is an independent predictor of mortality that is present already at the scene of an accident and upon arrival at the emergency department.

Different drivers of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) have been proposed by different groups of researchers: Some advocate that TIC reflects disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with a fibrinolytic (hemorrhagic) phenotype based on the observation that trauma DIC patients display prolonged prothrombin time (PT), have low fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) levels early after injury and have high fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer levels indicating massive (uncontrolled) thrombin generation and activation (through the tissue-factor dependent coagulation pathway) followed by extensive fibrin(ogen)olysis and consumption coagulopathy. Furthermore, they infer that the higher FDP/D-dimer ratio and low fibrinogen levels result from fibrin(ogen)olysis caused by excessive plasmin and neutrophil elastase production and release, independent of hypoperfusion. Contrary to this view, Brohi and colleagues proposed that TIC, as identified by a moderately prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) is driven by the combination of trauma and shock and, importantly, by the degree of tissue hypoperfusion (acute coagulopathy of trauma shock, ACoTS). The underlying mechanism is suggested to include enhanced early generation of activated factors, including thrombin that, due to reduced thrombin clearance, results in increased thrombin-thrombomodulin complex formation on adjacent endothelial cells and ensuing enhanced activation of the anticoagulant protein C (PC) pathway with enhanced PC activation. This leads to reduced thrombin generation, through inhibition of FV and FVIII, decreased fibrinogen utilization and enhanced fibrinolysis. Importantly, they emphasize that microvascular thrombosis does not occur in trauma hemorrhage and that there is a relative sparing of platelets and fibrinogen, thereby making ACoTS a distinct clinical entity from the DIC observed in, for example, sepsis and other disease conditions classically associated with DIC.

### Frequency and hemostatic abnormalities in pre-DIC patients [^112933VE]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) sometimes has a poor outcome, and therefore early diagnosis and treatment are required. This study prospectively evaluated the hemostatic abnormalities and the onset of DIC in 613 patients with underlying diseases to identify a useful marker for diagnosing Pre-DIC. Pre-DIC was defined as the condition of patients within a week before the onset of DIC. Initially, 34.4% of patients were diagnosed with DIC, and about 8.5% of the patients without DIC were diagnosed as DIC within a week after registration (pre-DIC). The mortality of DIC, Pre-DIC and "without DIC" was 35.3%, 32.4% and 17.2%, respectively. All hemostatic parameters were significantly worse in "DIC" than "without DIC" and the values of the prothrombin time ratio, platelet count and fibrin monomer complex could classify the three groups; "DIC", "pre-DIC" and "without DIC". No useful marker was identified that provided an adequate cutoff value to differentiate "pre-DIC" from "without DIC". A multivariate analysis identified clinical symptoms that were related to poor outcome. DIC must be treated immediately; there is no specific marker to identify pre-DIC.

### The unique characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy [^114UssdE]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic complications and coagulopathy frequently occur in COVID-19. However, the characteristics of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) are distinct from those seen with bacterial sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with CAC usually showing increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels but initially minimal abnormalities in prothrombin time and platelet count. Venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis are more frequent in CAC compared to SIC/DIC. Clinical and laboratory features of CAC overlap somewhat with a hemophagocytic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy. We summarize the key characteristics of representative coagulopathies, discussing similarities and differences so as to define the unique character of CAC.

### Emerging evidence of a COVID-19 thrombotic syndrome has treatment implications [^116cj7kV]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Reports of widespread thromboses and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been rapidly increasing in number. Key features of this disorder include a lack of bleeding risk, only mildly low platelet counts, elevated plasma fibrinogen levels, and detection of both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and complement components in regions of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This disorder is not typical DIC. Rather, it might be more similar to complement-mediated TMA syndromes, which are well known to rheumatologists who care for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome. This perspective has critical implications for treatment. Anticoagulation and antiviral agents are standard treatments for DIC but are gravely insufficient for any of the TMA disorders that involve disorders of complement. Mediators of TMA syndromes overlap with those released in cytokine storm, suggesting close connections between ineffective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, severe pneumonia and life-threatening microangiopathy.

### Treatment effects of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in patients with severe sepsis with or without overt disseminated intravascular coagulation [^111AvQaG]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious condition associated with sepsis. Clinical management of DIC is hampered by lack of clear diagnostic criteria. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) has proposed a diagnostic scoring algorithm for overt DIC based on routine laboratory tests. The objective was to assess a modified version of the ISTH scoring system and determine the effect of drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA, recombinant human activated protein C) on patients with DIC. The large database from the PROWESS clinical trial in severe sepsis was retrospectively used to assess a modified ISTH scoring system. Baseline characteristics and treatment effects of DrotAA were evaluated. At baseline, 29% (454/1568) of patients had overt DIC. Overt DIC was a strong predictor of mortality, independent of APACHE II score and age. Placebo-treated patients with overt DIC had higher mortality than patients without (43 vs. 27%). DrotAA-treated patients with overt DIC had a trend towards greater relative risk reduction in mortality than patients without (29 vs. 18%, P = 0.261) but both groups had greater relative risk reduction than placebo-treated patients. Serious bleeding rates during DrotAA infusion in patients with and without overt DIC were slightly increased (P = 0.498), compared with placebo, while clinically overt thrombotic events during the 28-day period were slightly reduced (P = 0.144). Modified ISTH overt DIC scoring may be useful as an independent assessment for identifying severe sepsis patients at high risk of death with a favorable risk/benefit profile for DrotAA treatment. Patients without overt DIC also received significant treatment benefit.

### Predictors of disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with severe sepsis and septic shock… [^116bosRi]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e18511 Background: Multiple pathophysiological pathways predispose Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients to Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation. As sepsis can also trigger DIC, we aim to evaluate the predictors of DIC among AML patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods: We queried adults with a diagnosis of AML and severe sepsis with septic shock admitted between 2016 and 2020 in the United States via the National Inpatient Sample. Patients ages < 18 years were excluded from our sample. Multivariate regression models were used to estimate the impact of multiple factors on events of DIC among these patients. Results: Our sample consisted of 19545 cases of severe sepsis with septic shock in AML adults that matched our selection criteria. It included 1705 patients who also experienced DIC during hospitalization. Several factors, such as medium and high frailty risk or Hispanics. DIC patients who died were also older. Finally, we were also able to confirm that events of DIC led to poorer prognosis with a higher rate of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Factors increasing the risk of DIC in patients with AML and severe sepsis with septic shock included anemia, cirrhosis, CKD, SLE, medium and high frailty risk, female sex, and Medicare insurance. While we noted lower odds of DIC among patients who are ≥ 60 years old, obese, cachectic, and smokers, further hospital-based studies to evaluate the severity of their illnesses along with other variables that could be analyzed via the NIS should be encouraged.

### Quinine-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: case report and review of the literature [^116tE6dM]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical course of quinine-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and review all previous cases reported in the medical literature.

Design

Case report/literature review.

Setting

University teaching hospital medical ICU.

Patients

One patient in whom thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, intravascular hemolysis, DIC, and acute renal failure temporally followed the ingestion of quinine.

Data Sources

We conducted a computerized free-text MEDLINE database search from 1969 to 2000 using the keywords quinine and thrombocytopenia, quinine and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and quinine and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Study Selection

All reported cases and reviews of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and DIC were reviewed. DIC was distinguished from quinine-induced thrombocytopenia or quinine-induced HUS based on the presence of abnormal clotting times, elevated fibrin degradation products, and/or elevated D-dimer levels.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen previous patients were found to meet the criteria for DIC temporally related to the recent ingestion of quinine. The clinical course and laboratory abnormalities documented for each case are reviewed.

Conclusions

Quinine-induced DIC is a distinct clinical entity, which may present as unexplained thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, or renal failure. In susceptible patients, the immune response to quinine may result in the production of not only anti-platelet antibodies but also antibodies against leukocytes, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells. Furthermore, the varying patterns and specificities of antibody production in an individual patient may result in a spectrum of clinical disease from mild, transient thrombocytopenia to overt intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, coagulopathy, and DIC. Early recognition of quinine-induced DIC is paramount, as this diagnosis affords a better prognosis than other adult forms of HUS or DIC.

### Bleeding related to disturbed fibrinolysis [^1144LnYd]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

In contrast to the rare acquired FXIII deficiency, DIC is a common severe complication of systemic infection (sepsis) and extensive tissue destruction (major trauma). DIC is defined as 'an acquired syndrome characterized by the intravascular activation of coagulation with loss of localization arising from different causes. It can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which if sufficiently severe, can produce organ dysfunction' (Taylor et al, 2001). Innate immune mechanisms are activated by pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in sepsis or altered self‐tissue damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [reviewed by (Manson et al, 2012)] that provoke pro‐thrombotic mechanisms in the microvasculature of the injured tissue to restrict the propagation of the damaging agent. Recruited monocytes express tissue factor, which initiates the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, whereas neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Histones, the most abundant proteins in NETs, induce activation of platelets (Fuchs et al, 2011) and endothelial cells (Saffarzadeh et al, 2012) and inhibit the activated protein C‐mediated negative feedback of the coagulation cascade (Ammollo et al, 2011). If the impaired anticoagulant pathways cannot localize the pro‐thrombotic factors to the primary injury site, overt multi‐organ microthrombosis develops that is accompanied by activation of fibrinolysis. The outcome of simultaneous systemic activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is consumptive coagulopathy, the laboratory signs of which provide the diagnostic criteria: thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, low fibrinogen and high circulating levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP) (Taylor et al, 2001). Depending on the nature of the provoking factor and the stage of the disease, the phenotype of DIC can be either thrombotic or haemorrhagic. Strong evidence supports the primary role of hyperfibrinolysis in the early stage of trauma‐associated DIC presenting typically as bleeding and requirement for massive transfusion. Excessively elevated levels of D‐dimers in patients with major trauma are documented at their hospital admission (Brohi et al, 2008; Sawamura et al, 2009) and thromboelastography has confirmed a hyperfibrinolytic state (Kashuk et al, 2010) or identified enhanced fibrinolysis even in cases when FDP levels are normal (Perouansky et al, 1999). The pattern of fibrinolytic and anticoagulant markers in trauma patients (elevated D‐dimer, tPA and soluble thrombomodulin, low protein C and normal PAI‐1 levels) (Brohi et al, 2008) is consistent with a pathomechanism initiated by hypoperfusion‐induced endothelial damage in posttraumatic shock. Hypoxia is known to induce tPA release from endothelial cells, whereas thrombomodulin detached from the damaged endothelium promotes the activation of protein C, which neutralizes PAI‐1 (Sakata et al, 1986). The imbalance of tPA and its inhibitor results in early hyperfibrinolysis in patients with major traumatic injury, as discussed in more detail below.

### Modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria predict the early phase of overt-DIC [^115AJiNc]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been proposed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, but are not useful for the diagnosis of early phase of overt-DIC (pre-DIC). Therefore, in the current study the non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria were modified using the global coagulation tests, the change rate in the global coagulation tests and molecular hemostatic markers to detect the pre-DIC state and were prospectively evaluated in 613 patients with underlying DIC disease. The frequencies of patients with DIC (DIC positive), late onset DIC, and without DIC (DIC absent) were 29.5%, 7.2%, and 63.3%, respectively. The modified non-overt-DIC criteria can correctly predict 43/44 patients (97.7%) who were DIC absent at admission and became DIC positive, within a week (late onset DIC state). The mortality rate was higher in DIC positive compared with pre-DIC (37.6% vs. 22.7%, P < 0.05) or DIC negative (37.6 vs. 13.7%, P < 0.01). It was also significantly higher in pre-DIC compared with DIC negative (P < 0.05). Thus, these modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria might therefore be useful for the diagnosis of early-phase DIC.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation or extended intravascular coagulation in massive pulmonary embolism [^115gDP7g]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

The traditional list of underlying diseases known to be associated with DIC includes infectious diseases, systemic inflammatory conditions, trauma and cancer, obstetrical complications and severe toxical and immunological reactions. In this issue of the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Leitner et al. propose to add a new diagnosis to that list. They report on a series of 113 patients with massive pulmonary embolism, serious enough to require cardiopulmonary resuscitation. These patients had a prolonged prothrombin time, lower platelet count and reduced antithrombin levels as compared with subjects with pulmonary embolism that did not need cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Nine percent of the patients that needed resuscitation had DIC, according to the criteria of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that massive pulmonary embolism could be an eliciting factor for DIC. While this could indeed be the case, an alternative explanation might also be proposed: cardiopulmonary collapse and resuscitation as a consequence of the embolus rather than the pulmonary embolism itself could be responsible for the activation of coagulation. Indeed, several studies have indicated that patients with (out of hospital) cardiac arrest display signs of intravascular coagulation activation and subsequent fibrin deposition. The mechanism underlying this widespread coagulation activation may be a systemic inflammatory response as a result of ischemia reperfusion in patients with circulatory arrest and/or hypoxia. Studies in patients during and after cardiopulmonary arrest have shown enhanced tissue factor expression in combination with reduced tissue factor pathway inhibitor. In addition, this activation of coagulation and fibrin formation is insufficiently balanced by endogenous fibrin removal, as a result of high levels of PAI-1. Indeed, both mechanisms are crucial in the pathogenesis of DIC. Contradictory to the hypothesis that the resuscitation per se is responsible for the systemic coagulation activation Leitner et al. has shown that patients that were resuscitated for reasons other than pulmonary embolism (i.e. resuscitation as a result of primary cardiac causes) had a markedly less intense activation of coagulation than patients with pulmonary embolism. Hence, it is likely that a pulmonary clot itself may contribute to the coagulopathy. Following that conclusion, it may be suggested that the presence of a large intravascular thrombus in the pulmonary circulation may result in insufficiently contained thrombin generation at the clot surface and overflow of active coagulation factors into the systemic circulation. In that case, extended intravascular coagulation may be a better term than disseminated intravascular coagulation. Similarly, large aortic aneurysms with clots in the false lumen or large arteriovascular malformations have been associated with a consumption coagulopathy mimicking DIC.

### Thrombocytopenia in the ICU: disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies-what intensivists need to know [^111d5dDw]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

DIC is relatively common, developing in 9–19% of ICU patients, usually as a result of sepsis, with an incidence of 18/100,000 in the overall population. By contrast, TTP and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC)-associated HUS have estimated incidences of 6 and up to 29 cases per million, respectively, and atypical HUS (aHUS) a prevalence of 0.2–0.4 cases per million, making these conditions far rarer than DIC. Although TTP is described as a pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, MAHA, renal dysfunction, and neurological impairment, often some of these features are not present. Accordingly, TTP may be confused with HUS, which is most commonly characterized by the triad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and renal dysfunction. These clinical similarities of DIC, TTP, and HUS are a major concern because they pose a risk of misdiagnosis as intensivists are more likely to consider a diagnosis of DIC than of the rarer TTP or HUS, thus delaying potentially lifesaving treatment.

Several diagnostic algorithms for TMA have been published. However, currently the only available guidance specific to the ICU are the recently published expert statements of Azoulay and colleagues. This publication provides an excellent guide for the differential diagnosis of TMAs but only briefly mentions DIC. A concise diagnostic algorithm tailored to intensivists would aid rapid differential diagnosis of TTP and HUS from DIC, and enable early appropriate treatment.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^116v8C8L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Laboratory Findings

Hematologic abnormalities are among the most consistent laboratory findings reported in patients with SARS; most patients have total leukocyte counts that are normal or slightly low, and 70%–95% of patients have lymphopenia. Platelet counts are mildly depressed in 30% to 50% of patients. Prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time can be observed in 40% to 60% of patients, but disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon.

Other common abnormal laboratory findings include elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels in 70% to 90% of patients, elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels in 20% to 30%, elevated creatine phosphokinase in 30% to 40%, and elevated C-reactive protein.

Radiographic Findings

While the full understanding of the spectrum of radiographic manifestations of SARS will require additional information, available data suggest that almost all reported patients with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection have radiographic evidence of pneumonia documented at some point during their illness. Chest radiographs may be normal in up to 30% of patients with the clinical diagnosis of SARS at the time when first evaluated (,–). In reports from China, radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia were detected in 67% to 80% of SARS patients by day 3 of illness, 97%-100% by day 7, and in 100% by day 10. A lesion typically begins as an isolated focal lesion found in a peripheral location, often in the lower lobes. In 75% of patients, the lesions progress over several days to involve additional lobes or both lungs.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest appears to be more sensitive than conventional chest radiography for detecting pneumonia; SARS patients who have normal chest radiographic findings early in their clinical course often have evidence of pneumonia by CT. Common CT findings are ground-glass opacification and a lower lobe and peripheral distribution.

Distinguishing SARS from Other Illnesses

As with other causes of bacterial and viral pneumonia, clinical findings in patients with SARS cannot accurately predict the causative agent. Further study is required to determine whether a constellation of clinical findings alone can be used to discriminate accurately between SARS and other (especially viral) respiratory illnesses. Many of the clinical and laboratory features of SARS are similar to those in other forms of viral pneumonia. Several clinical features, however, may be helpful in facilitating recognition of patients with SARS (Table 1).

### Modified score for disseminated intravascular coagulation in the critically ill [^112ygEak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the value of the diagnosis of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria and that of the parameters included in the ISTH score for overt DIC in predicting day 28 mortality in intensive care patients. Also, to assess the value of the components of the score in the diagnosis of overt DIC.

Design and Setting

Retrospective clinical study in a university hospital intensive care unit.

Patients and Participants

494 consecutive patients admitted in the ICU between January 2002 and October 2003.

Measurements and Results

Clinical and laboratory data, including hemostatic parameters, were collected from computerized databases and patient files. Altogether 19% (95/494) of the patients fulfilled the criteria for overt DIC. Their day 28 mortality rate was higher than that of patients without overt DIC (40% vs. 16%). The lowest platelet count (area under curve, AUC, 0.910), highest plasma D-dimer (AUC 0.846), lowest antithrombin (AUC 0.823), and Owren-type prothrombin time activity (AUC 0.797) discriminated well the patients with and without overt DIC, whereas plasma fibrinogen (AUC 0.690) had poor discriminative power. No patient with the diagnosis of overt DIC had decreased plasma fibrinogen. Day-1 SOFA and APACHE II score, the first CRP measurement, and the lowest antithrombin were independent predictors of day 28 mortality.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of overt DIC was not an independent predictor of day 28 mortality. In ICU patients plasma antithrombin seems a promising candidate in the panel of indicators for overt DIC whereas the value of plasma fibrinogen is in doubt.

### The unique characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy [^113kMsbV]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The number of out-of-hospital sudden death episodes has increased since COVID-19 outbreaks. One of the possible reasons is the high incidence of major thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19; however, the pathogenesis of these life-threatening events is multifactorial and continues to be determined. CAC resembles SIC/DIC, HPS/HLH, APS, and TTP/HUS in some aspects but has unique features that may be defined as a new category of coagulopathy (Fig. 3). Since multiple factors are involved in the development of CAC, further understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is necessary for appropriate management.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation with a fibrinolytic phenotype at an early phase of trauma predicts mortality [^11351xqV]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with an antifibrinolytic phenotype is characterized by microvascular thrombosis leading to poor outcome at the late-stage of trauma. To test the hypothesis that DIC with a fibrinolytic phenotype at an early stage of trauma also contributes to a poor outcome due to severe bleeding, we conducted a retrospective, cohort study.

Materials and Methods

The subjects included 314 consecutive severe trauma patients. A systematic review of medical records of the patients was conducted to provide the base line characteristics and DIC-related variables. The data of these variables were obtained at 4 time points within 24 hr after arrival to the emergency department (ED); Time Point 1, immediately after arrival to the ED to 4 hr after arrival; Time Point 2, 4 to 8 hr after arrival; Time Point 3, 8 to 16 hr after arrival; Time Point 4, 16 to 24 hr after arrival.

Results

Nonsurvivors (87.3%, 48/55) met the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC criteria showing lower fibrinogen levels, a prolonged prothrombin time, and higher fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer levels in comparison to those of the 289 survivors. The FDP/D-dimer ratio and lactate level were significantly higher in the nonsurvivors than those of the survivors. Lower fibrinogen levels and higher FDP/D-dimer ratio suggest fibrinogenolysis in DIC of the nonsurvivors. Furthermore a stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the JAAM DIC score, levels of fibrinogen, FDP and lactate at Time Point 1 are independent predictors of death. Low levels of fibrinogen and high FDP but not D-dimer predict massive bleeding at an early stage of trauma. The optimal cutoff points for the prediction of death and massive bleeding were fibrinogen (1.90, 1.90 g/L) and FDP (35.2, 68.7 mg/L), respectively.

Conclusions

DIC with a fibrinolytic phenotype modified through fibrinogenolysis at an early phase of trauma contributes to poor prognosis due to massive bleeding. Tissue hypoperfusion may be involved in the pathogenesis of this type of DIC.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^1117eqzS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism — coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation notes that disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in up to 83% of cases and that the coagulopathy of amniotic fluid embolism may occur in conjunction with the cardiopulmonary manifestations, be manifest only after initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation has been completed, or in very rare cases may be the only finding in women without cardiorespiratory compromise. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is commonly manifested by hemorrhagic complications including bleeding from venipunctures or surgical sites, hematuria, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and vaginal bleeding. However, bleeding from incompletely controlled atony followed by hypovolemic shock and either a consumptive or dilutional coagulopathy cannot be attributed to amniotic fluid embolism, nor does amniotic fluid embolism occur as a mild coagulopathy followed hours later by sudden cardiovascular collapse in the absence of interval hemorrhage and hypovolemia.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy… [^111D81Ae]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is most common in children with bacterial septic shock, infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome, in giant hemangiomas, and in purpura fulminans. The diagnosis is suspected when purpuric bleeding and/or thrombosis occurs in those clinical settings known to have DIC associated with them. The coagulopathy is also suspected when the patient has thrombocytopenia and prolonged clotting times in coagulation screening tests. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires further laboratory data. Although it would be ideal to have a complete analysis of all the coagulation factors, this is generally not universally available nor always necessary in all cases. In the absence of liver disease, the minimal criteria for diagnosis is the combination of thrombocytopenia, positive fibrinolytic split products, and hypofibrinogenemia.

In the presence of liver disease, reduced factor VIII and/or the presence of circulating soluble fibrin complexes would be needed to diagnose DIC. Once the diagnosis is established and the underlying illness identified and treated, the therapy of the DIC is generally supportive. Anticoagulation management is rarely needed except in cases of purpura fulminans, where it can be lifesaving, and selected cases of giant hemangioma or malignancy. In cases of septic shock and in severe RDS, successful management of the shock and the respiratory failure will cause the DIC to disappear without the use of anticoagulation.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^114U8d2W]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Further derangement of routine coagulation parameters seen in ACLF resembles that of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the defining characteristics of DIC are of systemic coagulation activation with intravascular fibrin formation leading to small/medium vessel thrombosis and organ dysfunctionrather than hepatic synthetic failure and endothelial activation of ACLF. The diagnosis of DIC relies on the use of a scoring system in the presence of a recognized associated condition. This is problematic in liver disease as all components of the DIC score are frequently abnormal in ACLF (Table 1). In the aforementioned critically ill cohort of patients with cirrhosis (n = 211), 63% of patients met the laboratory diagnostic criteria for DIC. Whilst the DIC score was significantly associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, marked thrombocytopenia (platelets < 30 000/µl) and hypofibrinogenemia (< 60 mg/dl) were stronger predictors of bleeding (along with aPTT > 100 s). Hypofibrinogenemia is the least common feature of DIC, but is prevalent in critically ill patients with advanced liver disease. The need and/or benefit of correcting it is not well established. Hyperfibrinolysis is a further diagnosis to consider; this is extensively described during liver transplantation secondary to endothelial release of tissue plasminogen activator (t‐PA). Whether it is a defined feature of ACLF remains uncertain; recent studies utilizing plasma‐based clot lysis assays have demonstrated shortened clot lysis times with increasing disease severity, but with wide inter‐individual variation. In this cohort, sepsis appeared to be associated with hypofibrinolysis, and bleeding events were not associated with shortened clot lysis times.

### New diagnostic strategy for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: a prospective single-center observational study [^112ar58g]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inflammation and coagulation are closely interrelated pathophysiologic processes in the pathogenesis of sepsis. However, the diagnostic criteria of sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are different. This study aimed to define a biomarker panel to predict sepsis-induced DIC in emergency department patients.

Methods

Eighty-two patients who were admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary university hospital were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age > 18 years; (2) ≥ 1 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Patients were excluded if they lacked biomarker data or apparent clinical manifestations. Eleven biomarkers were assayed from blood drawn on ED admission. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis including the area under the ROC and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify an optimal combination of biomarkers to create a diagnostic panel. The derived formula for weighting biomarker values was used to determine the severity of sepsis-induced DIC, which was divided into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. We also investigated the ability of this classification to predict secondary outcome measures of rates of sepsis and DIC, DIC score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, sequential organ failure score (SOFA) score, and 28-day all-cause mortality.

Results

Among the 11 biomarkers tested, the optimal 2-marker panel comprised presepsin and protein C. The area under the curve for the accuracies of predicting sepsis and DIC from these two biomarkers were 0.913 and 0.880, respectively. When patients were divided according to the severity of sepsis-induced DIC, all secondary outcomes except for mortality were significantly higher depending on the severity (P < .0001). The overall mortality rates of mild, moderate, and severe sepsis-induced DIC were 7.14%, 15.4%, and 28.6%, respectively (P = 0.0994).

Conclusions

A biomarker panel of presepsin and protein C is predictive of the severity of sepsis-induced DIC in suspected ED patients. These criteria for sepsis-induced DIC are very simple, easy to implement, and can be used in intensive care units as a point-of-care test.

### COVID-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation [^111Yv3ze]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.

### Animal models of DIC and their relevance to human DIC: a systematic review [^111GsAw9]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe clinical condition with activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Its diagnosis is based on the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) scoring system of DIC. Animal models of DIC, used to investigate pathophysiology and evaluate treatments, have not been developed in a standardized way, which impedes comparison between models and translation to the human setting. In the current review of animal models of DIC an overview of species, inducers, and dosing regimens is provided. Diagnostic approaches are compared in the light of the ISTH score and treatments tested in animal models of DIC are summarized. Systematic analysis revealed that the rat is by far the preferred species amongst animal models of DIC and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) the preferred inducer of DIC. An overview of the reporting of ISTH DIC score parameters elucidated that only about 25% of the studies measure all of the four parameters necessary for the implementation the ISTH scoring system. Furthermore, most therapeutic interventions tested in animal models of DIC are administered prophylactically, which may be irrelevant to the clinical setting and could explain why compounds effective in preclinical animal models often fail in clinical trials. It is concluded that Implementation of a scoring system in animal models of DIC may increase the ability to compare DIC amongst animal models and improve the translational aspect of treatment effect.

Results

Population characteristics

Of the 84 patients initially enrolled, we excluded 2 according to the exclusion criteria. Thus, a total of 82 patients were included in the analysis (Table 1). The mean age of the patients (44 men and 38 women) was 67.2 ± 17.3 years (median: 72.5 years, range: 21 to 93 years). Of all patients, 39 and 43 were diagnosed with non-sepsis and sepsis, respectively. In addition, 46 and 36 patients were classified into the non-DIC and DIC groups according to the JAAM DIC criteria, respectively. Furthermore, 26 patients with sepsis who met the JAAM DIC criteria were classified as having sepsis-induced DIC. The clinical characteristics of the 26 sepsis-induced DIC patients who met the sepsis and the JAAM DIC criteria were shown in Table 2.

### A multicenter, prospective validation study of the Japanese association for acute medicine disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring system in patients with severe sepsis [^115Xqi6X]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the critical care setting, the JAAM DIC scoring system exhibited superior prognostic value in predicting MODS and poor prognoses in patients with severe sepsis. The JAAM DIC scoring system is able to select more patients with DIC who require treatment and are near death than the ISTH overt DIC scoring system. In addition to conducting a static assessment of the DIC score, scoring should proceed daily in order to evaluate the severity and development of DIC and to predict the patient's prognosis. Dynamic scoring of platelet counts in the JAAM DIC scoring system in part contributes to the sensitivity of this system in the diagnosis of DIC.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^117S1D8M]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a major complication in sepsis. SIC is present in 24% of patients with sepsis and is associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality. SIC is characterized by systemic inflammation and coagulation activation leading to microvascular thrombi, impaired organ perfusion, and subsequent organ dysfunction. SIC is often used synonymously with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but in DIC, there is an overt or gross consumptive intravascular coagulopathy, meaning significant reductions in platelets, fibrinogen, and clotting factors with clinical evidence of thrombotic and/or bleeding diathesis. In comparison, SIC is a type of nonovert DIC, also described by a systemic intravascular coagulation, but without gross consumption of platelets, fibrinogen, and clotting factors, and often preempts the decompensated coagulopathy of DIC.

SIC is a complex condition triggered by pathological interactions between the innate immune and the coagulation systems. However, detailed understanding of the normal and dysregulated interactions of these systems and their components––to improve diagnostic accuracy and develop targeted therapeutics––represents a significant knowledge gap in SIC and is the goal of ongoing research. This article is a critical review of the literature on SIC in the following areas: (1) the experimental evidence of pathogen- and host-derived inflammatory molecules linked to hemostatic activation in sepsis, (2) the systemic impact of dysregulated immunothrombotic responses and the resultant clinical presentations, (3) the clinical diagnostic criteria for SIC, (4) the experimental therapies targeting imbalanced coagulation in SIC, and (5) the gaps in our knowledge of the pathophysiology, presentation, and management of SIC.

### A multicenter, prospective validation study of the Japanese association for acute medicine disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring system in patients with severe sepsis [^111YBn79]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a frequent complication of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Sepsis, defined as infection-induced SIRS, almost invariably leads to hemostatic abnormalities ranging from insignificant coagulopathy to severe DIC. DIC results in the widespread formation of fibrin thrombosis, microvascular occlusion and reduced oxygen delivery to cells and tissues, leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A prospective epidemiologic study clearly demonstrated that a clinical progression from SIRS to severe sepsis and septic shock increases the prevalence of DIC, organ dysfunction and the risk of death. DIC associated with sepsis is therefore a syndrome that should be diagnosed and treated early.

Scoring systems for DIC developed based on the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare scoring system have been independently proposed by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). These scoring systems have been prospectively validated in diverse patient populations. Three subgroup analyses of large randomized controlled phase 3 studies evaluating the treatment effects of anticoagulant drugs in patients with severe sepsis used the JAAM and ISTH DIC scoring systems for the diagnosis of DIC. Both the JAAM and ISTH scoring systems were effectively used to diagnose DIC and select proper patient groups who require DIC treatment, although some modifications were made to the latter system. Three recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of DIC variably recommend the JAAM and ISTH DIC scoring systems based on literature reviews and analyses.

DIC is not a disease in itself, but rather a syndrome that always develops secondary to various underlying disorders. DIC scoring systems are therefore usually validated in heterogeneous groups of patients, which may result in different evaluations of DIC diagnostic properties and recommendations in the scoring systems. In the present study, the JAAM Sepsis Registry Study Group prospectively validated the JAAM DIC scoring system in patients with severe sepsis, the leading cause of DIC, in a critical care setting.

### Evaluation of disseminated intravascular coagulation scores in critically ill pediatric patients [^1126xY1t]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a complex systemic thrombohemorrahgic disorder, which may contribute to organ failure. We aimed to compare the detection rate of the disseminated intravascular coagulation, early in the course of ICU admission, of the two disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring systems defined by International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine criteria and the prognostic value of disseminated intravascular coagulation scores in critically ill pediatric patients.

Design

Single-center retrospective observational study.

Setting

PICU in a tertiary care children's hospital.

Patients

Pediatric patients admitted in the PICU between January 2013 and December 2014.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 191 patients were included. Among them, 15.7% and 29.8% of the patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation by International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine criteria, respectively. The diagnostic concordance rate between the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine scoring systems was 52.6%. As the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III, the modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and the Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome scores increased, the percentage of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation increased stepwise. The disseminated intravascular coagulation scores correlated well with these severity scores. Overall, the 28-day mortality was 9.9%. There were significant differences in most variables consisting of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine scoring systems between survivor and nonsurvivors. Patients detected to have disseminated intravascular coagulation by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine scoring systems showed higher mortality than patients without disseminated intravascular coagulation. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine score and International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis score were 0.788 (95% CI, 0.675–0.900) and 0.716 (95% CI, 0.598–0.834), respectively.

Conclusions

Both the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine scoring systems are useful for detection of the disseminated intravascular coagulation in critically ill pediatric patients. These scores correlate well with other severity scores, including Pediatric Risk of Mortality III, modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation scores are also significantly associated with 28-day mortality, suggesting that these could be promising prognostic factors.

### Haemorrhage into chronic plaque psoriasis as a consequence of disseminated intravascular coagulation [^116UBa2j]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with chronic plaque psoriasis who developed haemorrhage into pre-existing lesions during an episode of disseminated intravascular coagulation secondary to sepsis. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a complex disorder characterized by widespread intravascular deposition of fibrin with consumption of coagulation factors and platelets and occurs as a consequence of many disorders that release procoagulant material into the circulation or cause widespread endothelial damage or platelet aggregation. As both disseminated intravascular coagulation and psoriasis occur relatively frequently in the general population we were surprised to find no previous reports of this phenomenon in the literature.
