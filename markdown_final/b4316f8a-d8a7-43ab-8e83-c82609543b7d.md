Psoriasis treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a practical approach to psoriasis treatment when no specific scenario is provided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define disease severity and phenotype to frame the treatment path. Then, I should verify the highest credibility guidelines and comparative evidence to anchor the algorithm. Next, I will examine first-line options for mild versus moderate-to-severe disease, integrate comorbidity-driven adjustments, consider combination strategies, and outline safety monitoring. After that, I should review shared decision-making, adherence, and special populations, plan for switching strategies, and finally synthesize a practical recommendation while acknowledging evidence limitations.

> Let me first confirm what clinical details I would usually need and what tools I should use. I need to check extent by body surface area, plaque burden by PASI, and impact by DLQI because these drive whether topical, phototherapy, or systemic treatment is appropriate, and I should remember to screen for psoriatic arthritis using a validated tool such as PEST while recognizing it may miss axial disease, and I also need to consider comorbidities including cardiometabolic risk, smoking, and obesity given their management implications [^113YFGwP] [^116R8xog] [^114L4AYj].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy so I do not jump to conclusions based on lower quality data. High-credibility anchors include AAD-NPF guidelines, EuroGuiDerm systemic recommendations, and BAD 2020 biologic guidance, and for comparative efficacy across systemic agents I should rely on living Cochrane network meta-analyses supplemented by recent meta-analyses and high-quality overviews, while keeping in mind the gap between RCT efficacy and real-world effectiveness and safety [^113YFGwP] [^114oZHA9] [^1148RSoM] [^113AKCSS] [^111GAuib] [^11389FTK] [^113WoLpq].

> For mild, localized plaque psoriasis, I need to ensure topical therapy is optimized first because potent corticosteroids and vitamin D analog combinations are consistently top-tier, with once-daily regimens often sufficient, and I should consider newer topicals such as tapinarof or roflumilast where accessible, while also remembering that targeted UVB or excimer can be used for localized recalcitrant sites and that broader NB-UVB is appropriate if topical therapy is inadequate in more extensive but still non-severe disease [^113YFGwP] [^113DP85b] [^112ZeB7A] [^115gJdBP] [^115fnvVK] [^115XXbEG].

> For moderate-to-severe disease or high-impact difficult sites, I should confirm the step to systemic therapy and select an initial agent based on guideline algorithms and comparative efficacy, with EuroGuiDerm endorsing methotrexate as first-line for most systemic candidates and BAD 2020 supporting progression to biologics when methotrexate and cyclosporine fail, are not tolerated, or are contraindicated, while network meta-analyses show very high short-term PASI90 rates with several biologics such as risankizumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab, and infliximab and clinical guidance acknowledges biologics as effective options for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [^114oZHA9] [^1148RSoM] [^113AKCSS] [^11389FTK] [^116p5YMy].

> Hold on, I should verify key comorbidity exclusions and preferences before committing to a class. I need to avoid TNF antagonists in severe heart failure and demyelinating disease and stop them if heart failure emerges, I should prefer agents with psoriatic arthritis indications when joint disease is present, and I must avoid teratogenic agents such as methotrexate and acitretin in pregnancy while considering short-term cyclosporine when urgently needed, and I should also counsel on obesity and smoking due to their impact on severity and cardiovascular risk [^11465PJu] [^114cgpZM] [^114iGzKE] [^116R8xog] [^114oZHA9] [^114L4AYj].

> Let me now examine combination strategies when monotherapy is insufficient, but wait, I should double-check which combinations are evidence-based. Adding topical calcipotriene to methotrexate can reduce cumulative dosing and extend time to relapse, topical corticosteroids can be safely combined with any biologic to manage residual plaques, NB-UVB can be paired with calcipotriene or acitretin to enhance clearance, and systemic combinations such as etanercept plus methotrexate or infliximab plus methotrexate improve efficacy albeit with more adverse events, while avoiding cyclosporine with PUVA due to carcinogenic risk remains important [^1131TKUS] [^1131HiQA] [^115XXbEG] [^112WSZJw] [^112TdHeN] [^113LfGrN] [^116Guva5].

> I should confirm the safety and monitoring plan before initiating or escalating systemic therapy. I need to screen for infections including TB and hepatitis, review cancer history and cardiovascular risk, and document risk factors before biologics, then assess initial response at drug-specific timepoints and continue regular reviews, while ensuring agent-specific laboratory monitoring for non-biologics such as methotrexate and recognizing that RCT safety profiles may not fully reflect real-world SAE patterns, underscoring the importance of ongoing vigilance and patient education using absolute risk explanations [^112zbut8] [^111XfJa8] [^113qjJTz] [^114oZHA9] [^113WoLpq] [^1174FLWd].

> Next, I should review adherence, goals, and shared decision-making so we do not misattribute suboptimal outcomes to drug failure. I will use PASI and DLQI to set targets, discuss vehicle preferences and routines to improve adherence to topicals, consider proactive maintenance with intermittent topical regimens after clearance to reduce relapse risk, and address lifestyle measures including caloric restriction in overweight patients while integrating patient values through a shared decision framework [^113YFGwP] [^112W42rR] [^1144P1Rw] [^113bhnnt] [^116ASsCd].

> I will now examine special populations so I do not overlook unique risks. In pediatric or young patients on biologics, I should seek dermatology expertise and consider optimization, switching, or adjunctive strategies if response is inadequate, in pregnancy I must avoid teratogens and individualize systemic choices, and for localized high-impact sites such as scalp or palms and soles I should remember targeted UVB or excimer options when appropriate [^113CRNhS] [^114oZHA9] [^115gJdBP] [^112zNach].

> Let me think about transition rules and what to do if response is unsatisfactory. If minimum response criteria are not achieved or secondary failure occurs, I should switch to an alternative agent, including a different class, consider earlier biologic initiation in persistent rapidly relapsing disease after methotrexate failure or intolerance, and note that intraclass switching within IL-17 inhibitors can still be effective after a prior IL-17 agent [^112DGzBf] [^114wAVDG] [^117KPVeC].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned plan while acknowledging the absence of patient-specific details. If disease is mild and localized, I would start a potent topical corticosteroid plus calcipotriene once daily for induction with clear instructions and adherence support, consider tapinarof or roflumilast if steroid sparing is desired and accessible, and escalate to targeted UVB or excimer for recalcitrant plaques, whereas if disease is moderate-to-severe or high impact, I would initiate systemic therapy with methotrexate when suitable, or move promptly to a biologic when conventional therapy fails or is contraindicated, selecting among IL-23, IL-17, or TNF inhibitors based on efficacy, comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis status, and patient preference, while embedding infection screening, periodic response assessment, and shared decision-making throughout [^113YFGwP] [^112ZeB7A] [^115gJdBP] [^114oZHA9] [^1148RSoM] [^113AKCSS] [^116R8xog] [^111XfJa8].

---

Psoriasis treatment is tailored to disease severity and patient factors, with **topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues** as first-line therapy for mild disease [^112ZeB7A] and **biologics (IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors)** or methotrexate for moderate-to-severe cases [^114oZHA9]. Phototherapy (**NB-UVB**) is effective for extensive or refractory disease [^115XXbEG], and combination therapy is commonly used to enhance control [^112TdHeN]. Biologics offer high efficacy and favorable safety profiles [^113AKCSS] but require infection screening and monitoring [^112zbut8]. TNF inhibitors are contraindicated in severe heart failure [^11465PJu] and demyelinating disease [^114cgpZM]. Lifestyle changes, especially **weight loss** and **smoking cessation** [^114L4AYj], improve outcomes [^113bhnnt], and treatment is individualized based on comorbidities, preferences, and response [^116ASsCd].

## Topical therapies

Topical therapies are the cornerstone for mild psoriasis [^113DP85b] and serve as adjuncts in moderate-to-severe disease, with **topical corticosteroids** as first-line due to efficacy and safety [^113YFGwP] [^112ZeB7A].

- **Topical corticosteroids**: First-line for mild psoriasis; effective and safe [^113DP85b].
- **Vitamin D analogues**: Calcipotriol and calcitriol are effective alone or with corticosteroids [^113DP85b].
- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus for sensitive areas (face, intertriginous) [^113YFGwP].
- **Keratolytics**: Salicylic acid and urea reduce scaling and enhance penetration [^116vtqMP].
- **Novel agents**: Tapinarof and roflumilast are effective options [^112ZeB7A].

---

## Phototherapy

Phototherapy is effective for extensive or refractory psoriasis, with **NB-UVB** as the preferred modality [^115XXbEG] [^115gJdBP]. Narrowband UVB is effective and safe for extensive disease [^115XXbEG]; the excimer laser is used for localized or scalp psoriasis [^112zNach] [^115fnvVK]; and PUVA remains effective but carries a higher long-term cancer risk and is therefore less favored.

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are indicated for moderate-to-severe psoriasis [^111GAuib] or when topical therapy or phototherapy fails, with **methotrexate** as first-line [^114oZHA9] and biologics reserved for refractory disease [^1148RSoM].

- **Methotrexate**: First-line systemic; effective and cost-efficient [^114oZHA9].
- **Cyclosporine**: Short-term for severe flares; monitor for nephrotoxicity/hypertension [^114f2FYn].
- **Acitretin**: For pustular/palmoplantar psoriasis; teratogenic [^114f2FYn].
- **Biologics**: Highly effective for moderate-to-severe disease [^11389FTK].

| **Biologic class** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TNF inhibitors | Etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab | High | Infection risk; contraindicated in severe HF/demyelinating disease [^11465PJu] [^114cgpZM] |
| IL-12/23 inhibitor | Ustekinumab | High | Infection risk; malignancy risk [^113AKCSS] [^115Nf397] |
| IL-17 inhibitors | Secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab | Very high | Infection risk; IBD exacerbation [^116w8yzv] |
| IL-23 inhibitors | Guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab | Very high | Infection risk [^111GAuib] |

---

## Combination therapies

Combination therapies are used to enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity, with **biologics plus methotrexate** or **phototherapy** as common strategies [^112WSZJw]. Adding methotrexate to biologics can improve efficacy and reduce immunogenicity [^112TdHeN]; combining biologics with phototherapy is effective for refractory disease [^114Yiynh]; and pairing topical agents with systemic therapies is commonly used to enhance control [^1131HiQA] [^113LfGrN].

---

## Lifestyle modifications and adjunctive therapies

Lifestyle changes and adjuncts improve outcomes [^116vtqMP], with **weight loss** and smoking cessation as key interventions [^114L4AYj] [^113bhnnt].

- **Weight loss**: Reduces severity and improves response [^113bhnnt].
- **Smoking cessation**: Lowers severity and cardiovascular risk [^114L4AYj].
- **Stress management**: May reduce flares [^116vtqMP].
- **Dietary supplements**: Limited evidence; omega-3s and vitamin D may help some [^113bhnnt].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment is **individualized** based on comorbidities, preferences, and response [^114oZHA9]. Comorbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and IBD influence selection [^116vtqMP] [^116R8xog]; patient preferences regarding route, dosing frequency, and side-effect profiles also matter [^116ASsCd]; and previous treatment response guides future choices [^112DGzBf].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess efficacy, safety, and adherence, with **PASI** and **DLQI** as standard tools [^113qjJTz] [^111XfJa8]. Clinical assessment should include PASI, DLQI, and patient-reported outcomes [^113qjJTz], and laboratory monitoring should include CBC, liver enzymes, renal function, and infection screening [^112zbut8]. Patient education should emphasize adherence and recognition of adverse effects [^1174FLWd] [^112W42rR].

---

Psoriasis treatment is individualized to disease severity and patient factors, with **topicals for mild disease** and systemic or biologic therapies for moderate-to-severe cases. Phototherapy and combination regimens enhance control, while lifestyle changes and regular monitoring optimize outcomes.

### Combination therapy in psoriasis: An evidence-based review [^114Yiynh]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory condition for which a variety of treatment modalities exist. Combinations of therapies are used often in clinical practice to enhance efficacy and reduce drug toxicities.

The purpose of this review is to assess the literature on the efficacy and safety of combination therapy in the treatment of psoriasis. MEDLINE was reviewed to identify English-language publications from 1966 to 2011 examining combination therapy in psoriasis. Fifty-three articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Randomized controlled trials addressing various combinations of treatment modalities for psoriasis were included. Data from these clinical studies were summarized and the outcomes were discussed.

Large-scale, randomized controlled trials investigating the use of various combination therapies in psoriasis are limited. The strongest data support the use of combinations of vitamin D derivatives and corticosteroids as topical combinations and, to a lesser extent, the combination of other topical agents. Phototherapy and topical vitamin D derivatives as well as phototherapy in combination with oral retinoids are well supported in the literature. Combinations of systemic medications, though often used clinically, have little data to support their efficacy or safety.

However, our data were limited by the small number of clinical trials examining the multiple available combinations that are used in clinical practice. The use of combination treatments falls within the standard.

### Nutrition and psoriasis [^113bhnnt]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Nutrition and dietary supplements are commonly used in the management of psoriasis; however, evidence of their efficacy is inconsistent. Although some dietary interventions have been shown to improve psoriasis consistently, others have little evidence supporting their use. We review common dietary interventions for the management of psoriasis and the evidence behind them. Caloric restriction, especially in overweight and obese individuals, has been shown to consistently diminish psoriatic activity. Evidence about other supplements and dietary interventions is inconsistent. Given the cost and side effects of pharmaceutical treatments for psoriasis, larger, long-term studies on the use of nutrition for the management of psoriasis are necessary.

### Ultraviolet B phototherapy for psoriasis: Review of practical guidelines [^115XXbEG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition that affects approximately 2% of people worldwide. Treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments, systemic treatments, biologic agents, and phototherapy. Ultraviolet (UV) B phototherapy is most appropriate for patients with more than 10% affected body surface area who have not responded to topical treatments. This review outlines the use, dosage, safety, and efficacy of narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) and targeted phototherapy.

NB-UVB and excimer laser are effective treatment options for psoriasis; they are administered two to three times weekly until clearance, followed by maintenance treatment before discontinuation. Long-term data on NB-UVB indicate that it has a good safety profile. NB-UVB is commonly used with adjunctive topical treatments such as emollients, calcipotriene, corticosteroids, retinoids, and tar. Additionally, NB-UVB can be used in selected patients with traditional systemic agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine, although the duration of the combined treatment should be kept to a minimum, and patients need to be closely monitored.

Acitretin can be safely used with phototherapy, but robust data on the combination use of biologic agents or phosphodiesterase inhibitors with phototherapy are lacking.

### An update on topical therapies for psoriasis [^112ZeB7A]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Topical therapies are a mainstay of treatment for mild psoriasis and may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. This review summarizes recent advances in topical therapies for psoriasis and currently available treatments.

- **Recent findings**: Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulators (tapinarof) and topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (roflumilast) have been proven effective in randomized controlled trials for psoriasis. Although topical JAK inhibitors have also been studied, none are currently licensed for the treatment of psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues remain the most commonly used and widely available topical treatments for psoriasis. Cost may limit the use of novel topical agents.

- **Summary**: Although the novel topical agents tapinarof and roflumilast are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis by the FDA in the United States, they have not yet been licensed in Europe, and it remains to be seen whether they will be limited by cost.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^113YFGwP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease that affects up to 3.2% of the United States population. This guideline addresses important clinical questions that arise in psoriasis management and care, providing recommendations based on the available evidence. The treatment of psoriasis with topical agents and alternative medicine is reviewed, emphasizing treatment recommendations and the role of dermatologists in monitoring and educating patients regarding benefits as well as associated risks. This guideline also addresses the severity assessment methods of psoriasis in adults.

### Topical therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: Systematic review and network meta-analyses [^113DP85b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of people with psoriasis have localized disease, where topical therapy forms the cornerstone of treatment. We set out to summarize evidence on the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of different topical treatments used in plaque psoriasis. A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trial data of U.K.-licensed topical therapies were undertaken. The primary outcome was clear or nearly clear status stratified for (i) trunk and limbs and (ii) scalp. Network meta-analyses allowed for the ranking of treatment efficacy. In total, 48 studies were available for trunk and limb psoriasis, and 17 for scalp psoriasis, involving 22,028 patients; the majority included people with at least moderate severity psoriasis.

- **Treatment hierarchy**: Strategies containing potent corticosteroids (alone or in combination with a vitamin D analogue) or very potent corticosteroids dominated the treatment hierarchy at both sites (trunk and limbs, scalp). Coal tar and retinoids were no better than placebo.

- **Application frequencies**: No significant differences in achieving clear or nearly clear status were observed between twice- and once-daily application of the same intervention.

- **Comparative interventions**: No significant differences were noticed between the following interventions: combined vitamin D analogue and potent corticosteroid (applied separately or in a single product), very potent corticosteroids, or potent corticosteroids (applied twice daily).

Investigator and patient assessment of response differed significantly for some interventions, particularly in response rates to very potent corticosteroids (78% for investigators and 39% for patients). No significant differences were noted for tolerability or steroid atrophy.

### Quantitative evaluation of biologic therapy options for psoriasis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114Jwmsj]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis over the last decade. The first monoclonal antibodies targeting the tumor necrosis factor-alpha pathway were licensed in 2004. More recently, antibodies to IL-12/23 and IL-17A have been introduced. Currently, six distinct biologic therapies are licensed for use in Europe and the United States: adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab, all of which perform significantly better than placebo. This variety offers real choice in treatment options for patients with psoriasis. The challenge now is deciding which treatment to use for which patients.

Patients and clinicians rely on extrapolating data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to help inform their decision-making process. While traditional pairwise meta-analyses of such trials are useful for summarizing data, their application to practical clinical decision-making is challenging when multiple treatments and multiple outcomes need consideration. This issue is compounded by the lack of direct head-to-head active-comparator RCTs required to inform such pairwise meta-analyses.

We aimed to summarize the available data on biologic therapies for psoriasis to assist decision-making by patients and clinicians. A systematic review of the evidence and a network meta-analysis (NMA), which connects a network of evidence, is a useful way to understand the differences between treatments.

### Biologic therapy with or without topical treatment in psoriasis: What does the current evidence say [^113LfGrN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Biologic therapy represents a relatively new class of drugs that have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis and are used with increasing frequency to control this chronic, systemic inflammatory disease. However, it is unclear what role combination therapy of biologics with traditional topical agents might play. This article aims to assess the literature on the role of topical agents as adjuvants to biological treatments in psoriasis and identify areas for further research. A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify English-language publications from 1996 to 2014 that examine combination biologic therapy with topical medications in psoriasis treatment. Data from these clinical studies are summarized, and the outcomes are discussed.

In general, the addition of adjuvant topical therapy to systemic biologic therapy allowed for a reduction in dosage and side effects of both agents, maintenance of the initial response to biologics, treatment of recalcitrant lesions in partial responders, and potential acceleration of response to biologic therapies. The data, though limited, suggest that using topical therapies as adjunct treatment to biologics is a well-tolerated and effective means of controlling psoriasis and improving the quality of life for patients. However, the treating physician should remain attentive to signs of adverse events and seek opportunities to reduce the dose or treatment frequency during chronic use.

### Quantitative evaluation of biologic therapy options for psoriasis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116MxJrt]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple biologic treatments are licensed for psoriasis. The lack of head-to-head randomized controlled trials makes choosing between them difficult for patients, clinicians, and guideline developers. To establish their relative efficacy and tolerability, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials of licensed biologic treatments for skin psoriasis.

We performed a network meta-analysis to identify direct and indirect evidence comparing biologics with one another, methotrexate, or placebo. We combined this with hierarchical cluster analysis to consider multiple outcomes related to efficacy and tolerability in combination for each treatment. Study quality, heterogeneity, and inconsistency were evaluated. Direct comparisons from 41 randomized controlled trials (20,561 participants) were included. All included biologics were efficacious compared with placebo or methotrexate at 3–4 months.

Overall, cluster analysis showed adalimumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab were comparable in terms of high efficacy and tolerability. Ixekizumab and infliximab were differentiated by very high efficacy but poorer tolerability. The lack of longer-term controlled data limited our analysis to short-term outcomes. Trial performance may not equate to real-world performance, and so results need to be considered alongside real-world, long-term safety and effectiveness data. These data suggest that it is possible to discriminate between biologics to inform clinical practice and decision making. (PROSPERO 2015:CRD42015017538)

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^1131TKUS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of psoriasis, particularly in relation to topical therapy combined with systemic therapy, the AAD/NPF 2021 guidelines recommend offering the addition of topical calcipotriene to the standard dose of methotrexate therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. This approach is recognized for its potential to lead to lower cumulative doses of methotrexate and increase the time to relapse following methotrexate discontinuation.

### Quantitative evaluation of biologic therapy options for psoriasis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113pJTfT]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

After deduplication, 5,915 studies were identified through searching. Forty-five studies were selected for inclusion (Supplementary Appendix S1 online), presenting data on direct comparisons from 41 RCTs consisting of 20,561 participants (see Figure 1). All trials involved patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Of the studies, 29 out of 41 (71%) included patients with a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) ≥ 12, 7 out of 41 (17%) included patients with a PASI ≥ 10, and 5 out of 41 (12%) included patients with "moderate to severe" disease, not otherwise specified. Detailed characteristics of the included studies are provided in Supplementary Table S1 (online). Excluded studies are detailed in Supplementary Table S2 (online). Most trials, 38 out of 41 (93%), were two-arm studies, while the remainder were three-arm studies. All studies included patients with previous conventional systemic therapy use. Only 12 out of 41 (29%) trials excluded patients with previous biologic therapy use. In trials that did allow previous biologic use, the percentages ranged from 1.6% to 64.3%. Five trials (12%) did not specify previous biologic therapy use.

Figure 1 illustrates the flow diagram showing the identification of literature in the PRISMA format.

Placebo-controlled comparisons were available for all treatments and outcomes. Direct active comparisons between biologics were limited to ixekizumab, ustekinumab, or secukinumab versus etanercept, and ustekinumab versus secukinumab. There were also direct comparisons between methotrexate and adalimumab or infliximab.

### Novel topical cream delivers safe and effective alternative to traditional psoriasis phototherapy [^1162rZyk]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014).

In today's environment of shrinking reimbursement and coverage for many health care procedures, phototherapy for psoriasis has experienced a major decline. Once hailed as the cornerstone of psoriasis therapy, the increasing cost and demanding treatment regimen have resulted in low compliance, limiting access to this safe and effective mode of treatment. We have previously reported on the development and in vitro evaluation of a topical cream that selectively filters solar radiation to deliver narrow-band ultraviolet B. Here, we present the results of a pilot study in psoriasis patients. After an average of 38 sessions, all patients in the treatment arm responded to therapy. In particular, 43% of the treatment group experienced complete clearance, and the remainder experienced at least 50% lesion clearance. In contrast, none of the patients in the placebo arm experienced more than 20% lesion clearance. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the novel topical cream could provide a safe, effective, and convenient alternative to artificial light phototherapy.

Approximately 125 million people worldwide have psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis experience substantial morbidity and increased rates of inflammatory arthritis, cardiometabolic diseases, and mental health disorders.

- **Observations**: Plaque psoriasis is the most common variant of psoriasis. The most rapid advancements addressing plaque psoriasis have been in its pathogenesis, genetics, comorbidities, and biologic treatments. Plaque psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis, cardiometabolic diseases, and depression. For patients with mild psoriasis, topical agents remain the mainstay of treatment, and they include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, calcineurin inhibitors, and keratolytics.

- **Guidelines**: The American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines recommend biologics as an option for first-line treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis because of their efficacy in treating it and acceptable safety profiles. Specifically, inhibitors to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) include etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, and infliximab. Other biologics inhibit cytokines such as the p40 subunit of the cytokines IL-12 and IL-13 (ustekinumab), IL-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab, and brodalumab), and the p19 subunit of IL-23 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab, and mirikizumab). Biologics that inhibit TNF-α, p40IL-12/23, and IL-17 are also approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

- **Oral Treatments**: Oral treatments include traditional agents such as methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine.

### Combining topical psoriasis treatment to enhance systemic and phototherapy: A review of the literature [^113GjQ11]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects millions of people in the United States and worldwide. While there is currently no cure for psoriasis, many treatment options are available. Topical therapies remain the mainstay for the majority of patients with limited or mild psoriasis. Among these medications, topical vitamin D analogs (e.g. calcipotriene) and corticosteroids (e.g. betamethasone), either alone or in combination, are the most widely prescribed and are the cornerstone of topical therapies.

For patients with more severe disease, phototherapy, conventional systemic agents, and biologics are often indicated. The current goal of treatment is to control clinical symptoms of the skin, reduce systemic disease potential, and improve the patient's quality of life. Despite the availability of various therapeutic options for psoriasis, many patients remain untreated, and even among those receiving treatment, many do not achieve complete resolution of the disease. The new consensus is to treat to a target of 1% or less body surface area involvement.

Innovative treatment strategies are needed to meet these goals and patients' desire to achieve clear skin. Combination therapies are widely used by physicians, and adjunctive topical therapies, when used alongside other antipsoriatic regimens, have demonstrated many clinical benefits. This article reviews the most recent clinical evidence concerning the adjunctive use of topical agents with biologics, conventional systemic agents, and phototherapy to better establish the role of topical treatments in comprehensive psoriasis management.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^111GAuib]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease presenting with either skin or joint manifestations, or both, and it significantly impacts quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. The relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, which prompted us to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for individuals with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis. Additionally, the aim is to provide a ranking of these treatments based on their efficacy and safety.

- **Search methods**: For this update of the living systematic review, searches were updated monthly to October 2021 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults over 18 years with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, were compared to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, defined as at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, and the proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) during the induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We conducted duplicate study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and analyses.

### Combined use of systemic agents for psoriasis: A systematic review [^112WSZJw]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Combined use of systemic agents may be necessary to achieve disease control in therapy-resistant patients. However, to our knowledge, an overview of evidence, including quality assessments, is not yet available, and no guidance on monitoring, contraindications, and interactions exists.

- **Objectives**: To summarize and critically appraise the evidence on the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with systemic agents in plaque-type psoriasis.

- **Evidence review**: Through March 2013, an electronic search limited to randomized clinical trials was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and ongoing trial registers. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

- **Findings**: The initial search retrieved 2,583 records, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies favored combination therapy, albeit with low significance and low quality of evidence. Etanercept plus methotrexate was the only combination therapy investigated with an adequate sample size (n = 478). In the short term, this combination had superior efficacy with a moderate quality of evidence compared with etanercept monotherapy (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, 75; relative risk, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14–1.45). Although this finding coincided with an increase in adverse events (relative risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10–1.42), the overall safety profile remained acceptable.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the validity of different systemic combination therapies.

Regarding the medical management of psoriasis, more specifically with respect to initiating biologic therapy, the 2020 British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) guidelines recommend initiating biologic therapy in patients requiring systemic therapy if methotrexate and cyclosporin have failed, are not tolerated, or are contraindicated. Additionally, the disease should have a significant impact on physical, psychological, or social functioning, indicated by a Dermatology Life Quality Index or Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index greater than 10, or clinically relevant depressive or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, one or more of the following disease severity criteria must apply:

- **Extensive psoriasis**: Defined as a body surface area greater than 10% or a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index of 10 or more.

- **Severe psoriasis at localized sites**: Associated with significant functional impairment and/or high levels of distress, such as nail disease or involvement of high-impact and difficult-to-treat sites, including the face, scalp, palms, soles, flexures, and genitals.

### A new era in the management of psoriasis? The biologics: facts and controversies [^113LtN92]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

During the last 30 years, the tremendous progress in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of psoriasis has led to the development of new agents, the so-called biologics, that have revolutionized the management of severe psoriasis. Dermatologists and patients see this emerging therapy as a new perspective in the state of the art in managing moderate to severe psoriasis. After a few years of use in daily practice, we may begin to analyze the power of the currently available biologic agents in the management of severe psoriasis from the perspective of facts.

### The best psoriasis medications emerge [^11389FTK]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

What are the most effective systemic medications to treat plaque psoriasis? The most effective drugs for psoriasis were infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab, and the clinical effectiveness was similar when these four drugs were compared against one another. No statistically significant differences in serious adverse events were identified in any of the drugs compared with placebo. The main limitations of this meta-analysis include the lack of assessment of clinical effectiveness beyond 52 weeks and the lack of safety assessments for nonserious adverse events.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^111q88H7]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

As the understanding of disease pathophysiology and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, improves, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind:

- **Educate providers**: Especially important in a changing therapeutic landscape.
- **Describe best care**: Through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus.
- **Clarify gaps in information**: Point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions.
- **Reduce inappropriate variation**: Set standards for quality control.
- **Promote efficient use of resources**: Support the effective allocation and use of healthcare resources.
- **Highlight research needs**: Identify what research needs to be done to inform future care.

### Factors affecting response to biologic treatment in psoriasis [^111MCCRF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, affecting approximately 2–4% of the population in Western countries. Patients with a more severe form of the disease are typically considered for systemic therapy, including biologics. In spite of the overall superiority of biologic agents, the treatment response may differ substantially among individual patients.

As with other medical conditions, a range of factors contribute to the response heterogeneity observed in psoriasis. Proper identification of these factors can significantly improve therapeutic decisions. This review focuses on potential genetic and nongenetic factors that may affect the treatment response and outcomes in patients with psoriasis.

### Use of biologic agents in combination with other therapies for the treatment of psoriasis [^111S7DnD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder associated with a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. Traditional therapies for psoriasis often do not meet desired treatment goals, and high-dose and/or long-term use can lead to toxicities resulting in end-organ damage. An improved understanding of the involvement of cytokines in the etiology of psoriasis has led to the development of biologic agents targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukins (ILs)-12/23. While biologic agents have improved treatment outcomes, they are not effective for all individuals with psoriasis.

The combination of biologic agents with traditional therapies may offer improved therapeutic options for patients who do not respond adequately to a single drug or when efficacy is increased with the supplementation of another treatment. Additionally, combination therapy may reduce safety concerns and cumulative toxicity, as lower doses of individual agents may be efficacious when used together. This article reviews the evidence available on the efficacy and safety of combining biologic agents with systemic therapies (methotrexate, cyclosporine, or retinoids) or with phototherapy, and the combination of biologic agents themselves. Guidance is provided to help physicians identify situations and characteristics of patients who would benefit from combination therapy with a biologic agent. Finally, the potential clinical impact of biologic therapies in development, such as those targeting IL-17A, IL-17RA, or IL-23 alone, is analyzed.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence- and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^116ASsCd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with psoriasis have mild disease in which topical therapy is sufficient to suppress the lesions. If necessary, different forms of phototherapy and/or conventional systemic therapy are considered with or without topical agents. With the arrival of biologics, treatment options have increased and the effects of treatments have improved drastically.

It can be challenging to choose a suitable therapy for an individual patient. However, we expect that if the treatment is in line with patients' expectations, preferences, and lifestyle, adherence to the treatment and increased treatment satisfaction are more likely. We recommend that treatment decisions should therefore be made by patients and physicians together ('shared decision making'). In our opinion, it is important that all agents remain equally accessible and available. A preferred policy for rigid application of one drug is undesirable.

### Use of biologic agents in combination with other therapies for the treatment of psoriasis [^115hbsH5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder associated with a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life.

### Psoriasis: Improving adherence to topical therapy [^112W42rR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical therapy plays an important role in psoriasis treatment. It is efficacious and has a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated in clinical trials. However, poor treatment outcomes from topical therapy regimens likely result from poor adherence and ineffective use of the medication. The International Psoriasis Council Topical Therapy Working Group has developed a new model to describe the complex interactions among patient, disease, and treatment characteristics, adherence behavior, and treatment outcomes. Recommendations are provided that may assist the health care provider in encouraging adherent behavior in their patients. By understanding and manipulating the factors that affect treatment adherence, improvement in adherence is possible, and better control and outcomes in the topical treatment of psoriasis are likely.

### Satisfaction of treatment with biologics is high in psoriasis: Results from the Bio-CAPTURE network [^116HB2pD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the effectiveness of biologics for psoriasis has been extensively measured with objective outcome measures, studies based on subjective, patient-reported outcome measures remain scarce.

- **Objectives**: To investigate satisfaction with medication, as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) for biologics in daily practice psoriasis care in the first six months of treatment; and to identify possible differences in satisfaction with medication between patients experienced (biologics-experienced) and inexperienced (biologics-inexperienced) in the use of biologics.

- **Methods**: TSQM baseline measurements were compared using measurements taken after six months, applying the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired comparisons. Intention-to-treat with last observation carried forward (ITT with LOCF) and as-treated analyses were performed. The difference between biologics-experienced and biologics-inexperienced patients for TSQM was analyzed using ITT with LOCF. At six months, outcomes for biologics-experienced and biologics-inexperienced patients were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Results**: One hundred and six patients were eligible for analysis and treated with etanercept (n = 34), adalimumab (n = 49), or ustekinumab (n = 23). Fifty-four percent of patients were biologics-inexperienced. A statistically significant improvement was observed in all domains of the TSQM ('effectiveness', 'side-effects', 'convenience', and 'global satisfaction') by comparing months three or six with baseline (all P ≤ 0.02). After six months, biologics-inexperienced…

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, more specifically with respect to initiating biologic therapy and choice of agent, the BAD 2020 guidelines recommend considering switching to an alternative therapy, including another biologic therapy, if any of the following applies:

- **The minimum response criteria are not achieved**: This indicates that the treatment is not effectively managing the condition.

- **Subsequent loss of response after initial response (secondary failure)**: This occurs when the treatment initially works but then loses effectiveness over time.

- **The biologic therapy cannot be tolerated or becomes contraindicated**: In these cases, continuing the current therapy may no longer be safe or feasible.

### Current systemic therapies for psoriasis: Where are we now [^115tByZj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Many systemic agents are used in the treatment of psoriasis and provide good control for the majority of patients, improving their quality of life indices. Frequently, combination therapy is utilized to enhance the efficacy of these medications. Many dermatologists are hesitant to prescribe systemic agents due to their adverse effects. However, such potential toxicities from these medications can largely be avoided with proper patient selection and close monitoring.

### Recent advances in small molecule and biological therapeutic approaches in the treatment of psoriasis [^113CDfs5]. Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2017). High credibility.

New treatments continue to be developed for psoriasis. In this review, we aim to summarize the results of the major published studies on biologic and small molecule drugs for the treatment of psoriasis. We emphasize the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of these treatment options. A review of the MEDLINE database was conducted for each class of medication. Randomized controlled trials were identified for each medication; data on efficacy, safety, and tolerability were reviewed.

Biologic and small molecule treatment options are more effective than placebo, although there were few head-to-head trials to assess relative efficacy between biologics and small molecule treatments. These drugs offer favorable safety profiles with only rare serious adverse events reported. Biologic and small molecule drugs offer diverse therapeutic regimens, particularly in patients with recalcitrant disease.

### Curing psoriasis [^111942xo]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

As medicine advances, cures are being found for diseases that were previously considered incurable, as is the case for some types of cancer. Traditionally, the term "cure" is reserved for resolution of disease at both a clinical and a molecular level, which continues after cessation of treatment. Biologic therapies have revolutionized the definition of remission in severe psoriasis, with some patients achieving long-lasting disease suppression. However, the disease nearly always relapses upon withdrawal of the drug. Our improved understanding of the pathomechanisms of psoriasis, coupled with anecdotal reports of long-term clearance of the disease after cell-based therapies, leads us to the hypothesis that psoriasis is curable. We propose that a cure for psoriasis can be achieved by restoring immune homeostasis through a combinatorial, personalized medicine approach. This encompasses early intervention, including biologics, advanced therapeutics, and lifestyle modification.

### A standardization approach to compare treatment safety and effectiveness outcomes between clinical trials and real-world populations in psoriasis [^113GM6pJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Biologic therapies are widely used for the management of patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that biologic therapies for psoriasis have high efficacy and a good safety profile. Although RCTs have high internal validity, they are not powered to investigate rare but potentially serious adverse events (SAEs). In addition, the exclusion criteria of RCTs limit generalizability. Studies across different specialties, such as cardiology, mental health, rheumatology, and oncology, indicate that RCT samples are often highly selected and have a lower risk profile than real‐world populations.

In dermatology, a previous study in a real-world Spanish psoriasis registry found a 2.6-fold increased risk of SAEs for those patients who would have been ineligible for entry into an RCT compared with those who would have been eligible. Our previous work using data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR) from the U.K. and Ireland corroborated these findings. We found a 1.9–2.8-fold increased risk of SAEs in those who would have been ineligible compared with those who would have been eligible for RCTs. In addition, we found that the ineligible patients also achieved a smaller improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), a measure of psoriasis disease severity.

These results suggest that there is a gap in the reported efficacy, which represents the effect of the biologic therapy tested under ideal conditions in an RCT, and the reported effectiveness, which represents…

### Efficacy of a second interleukin 17 inhibitor in patients with psoriasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KPVeC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple biologics for psoriasis exist, and interleukin (IL) 17 inhibitors are among those with the best efficacy. However, switching treatment is often required at some point, and intraclass switching of IL-17 inhibitors is not well investigated.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of a second IL-17 inhibitor in patients with psoriasis.

- **Methods**: Two authors independently searched the databases PubMed and EMBASE for studies reporting on the efficacy of IL-17 inhibitors in patients with psoriasis previously exposed to another IL-17 inhibitor. The study was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

- **Results**: In total, 14 publications comprising 655 patients were included. The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 75%, 90%, and 100% in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index were, respectively, 74.6% (95% confidence interval, 63.9–84.0), 69.4% (95% CI, 53.2–83.4), and 46.4% (95% CI, 30.5–62.7) after short-term treatment (weeks 9, 12, and 16 combined).

- **Limitations**: Most studies included were on ixekizumab and were retrospective chart reviews with no information on the response to the previous IL-17 inhibitor.

- **Conclusion**: Previous treatment with an IL-17 inhibitor does not appear to affect the efficacy of another IL-17 inhibitor in the treatment of psoriasis. However, further prospective studies are needed.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis 2020: a rapid update [^114wAVDG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, specifically related to initiating biologic therapy, the general considerations outlined in the BAD 2020 guidelines recommend considering the earlier initiation of biologic therapy in the treatment pathway. This is advised if methotrexate has failed, is not tolerated, or is contraindicated in patients with psoriasis who meet the disease severity criteria and have active psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis that is persistent. Psoriasis is considered persistent if it relapses rapidly, defined as a return to more than 50% of the baseline disease severity within three months after completion of any treatment, especially when off a therapy that cannot be continued long-term, such as NB-UVB and cyclosporin.

### Quantitative evaluation of biologic therapy options for psoriasis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116vJ1xv]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

**Risk of bias**: The risk of bias varied between individual studies, ranging from low to high. A total of 35 out of 41 (85%) RCTs had a low risk of selection bias, and 37 out of 41 (90%) had a low risk of performance bias. A total of 38 out of 41 RCTs (93%) had a low risk of detection bias and 35 of 41 RCTs (85%) had a low risk of attrition bias. All studies were financially sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. There was a low risk of reporting bias. Regarding publication bias, comparison-adjusted funnel plots suggested asymmetry between small studies for the outcomes of clear/nearly clear and PASI 75 at 12 to 16 weeks in relation to newer versus established treatments. There was no apparent asymmetry for the studies examining biologic therapies versus placebo at 12 to 16 weeks for any of the outcomes.

### Update on the mechanisms and efficacy of biological therapies for psoriasis [^115z4Ni3]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2005). Low credibility.

Biologically based agents, known as biologics, are novel therapeutic options for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Unlike traditional systemic anti-psoriatic drugs that are chemically synthesized, biologics are derived from living organisms. They represent the first group of "custom-designed" molecules that precisely target specific steps in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This specificity theoretically allows biologics to avoid the side effects, such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression, associated with prebiologically developed systemic agents. However, a more precisely targeted agent may have reduced overall efficacy. Due to the varying efficacies and high costs of biologic agents currently approved in the United States, their precise role in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis remains to be defined with future clinical experiences.

### Persistence and effectiveness of nonbiologic systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in adults: A systematic review [^114f2FYn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that impairs both physical and psychological health. Treatment options for patients with psoriasis depend on disease severity, comorbidities, and patient choice, and include topical therapies, phototherapy, and systemic therapies (including biologics and small molecules). More severe psoriasis frequently requires lifelong management; therefore, counseling patients on the likelihood of medium-to-long-term disease control is important when discussing treatment choice.

In the U.K., guidance provided by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests the use of nonbiologic, nonsmall-molecule systemic therapies for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis that cannot be controlled with topical therapies or phototherapies. Methotrexate is recommended as first-line therapy, with ciclosporin advised in the short term and for women considering conception. Acitretin may be considered if methotrexate and ciclosporin are contraindicated or ineffective.

Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23 inhibitors are both approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), as well as psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In the absence of head-to-head studies, it is not clear which agent is better suited to treat patients with moderate-to-severe PsO and mild PsA. During the 2022 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) conference, Dr. April Armstrong and Dr. Joseph Merola debated which of these two biologic classes should be used in this patient population. Armstrong argued in favor of IL-17 inhibition, whereas Merola presented reasons for IL-23 inhibition. An overview of their main arguments is described in this manuscript.

### Do biologic treatments for psoriasis lower the risk of psoriatic arthritis? A systematic review [^114DUuV9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The effectiveness of biologic treatments in slowing the progression of psoriatic arthritis is well established, but there is limited and conflicting evidence on their ability to prevent the development of psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis. The objective of this review was to evaluate the role of biologic treatment for psoriasis in preventing or delaying subsequent psoriatic arthritis.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for studies published in English from database inception to March 2022. These studies statistically compared the risk of psoriatic arthritis in patients aged over 16 years who were previously treated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or with other drugs for skin psoriasis.

- **Results**: Four articles were eligible for analysis, all retrospective cohort studies. Three were conducted in preselected patients attending dermatology or dermatology-rheumatology collaboration centers, and one was a large population-based study. In three studies, a primary two-step statistical analysis yielded a significantly lower risk of psoriatic arthritis in patients treated with biologic agents. These findings were not supported by the large retrospective electronic health record-based study.

- **Conclusions**: Biologic treatments may be effective in preventing the development of psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis. More research is needed, given the retrospective cohort design of all studies included in the review, which limits the generalizability of the results.

### Emerging paradigm shift toward proactive topical treatment of psoriasis: A narrative review [^1144P1Rw]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic remitting-relapsing disease that requires long-term management throughout an individual's lifetime. Despite this need, guidelines do not provide explicit recommendations on the ideal choice, frequency, and duration of topical agents for safe long-term disease control, nor when to transition from acute to maintenance therapy. As a result, a significant population of patients is unsatisfied with their treatment.

These unmet needs highlight the opportunity to reconsider our clinical practice regarding PsO maintenance therapy. Recent clinical trial evidence offers reassurance to clinicians that it is no longer necessary to discontinue topical TCS-containing therapies after an initial 4-week acute treatment phase. Instead, proactive maintenance treatment for up to one year, even when the skin is clear and clinical parameters indicate remission, is emerging as a new paradigm that may enhance long-term disease control. To maximize the potential benefits of such an approach, stepping down to a maintenance regimen should only occur once the skin is clear, as premature reduction in treatment frequency could hasten disease recurrence.

### Current and future management of psoriasis [^1179jpcs]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Management of psoriasis begins with identification of the extent of cutaneous disease. However, a holistic, contractual approach to treatment is encouraged, with particular reference to psychosocial disability and quality-of-life issues. The presence of psoriasis on palms, soles, body folds, genitals, face, or nails, and concomitant joint disease, are also important when considering treatment options. An evidence-based approach is essential in delineating differences between the many available treatments.

- **Archaic approaches**: Some clinicians routinely use outdated, especially combinational methods, with inadequate prospective or comparative evidence.
- **Current treatments available**:
	- Topical agents are used predominantly for mild disease and for recalcitrant lesions in more severe disease.
	- Phototherapy is employed for moderate disease.
	- Systemic agents, including photochemotherapy, oral agents, and newer injectable biological agents, have revolutionized the management of severe psoriasis.

Other innovative treatments are undergoing clinical studies, with the aim of maintaining safe, long-term control of the condition.

### Are ointments better than other vehicles for corticosteroid treatment of psoriasis [^116WeUEs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most common treatment agent for psoriasis in the United States (U.S.). Conventional dermatologic wisdom holds that ointment preparations provide the highest potency due to their occlusive nature and moisturizing ability and are best suited for psoriasis. This article presents evidence challenging the conventional belief that ointment vehicles are necessarily best for psoriasis. A previous systematic review of the efficacy of clinical trials of potent topical corticosteroids did not support greater efficacy or greater delivery of potent topical corticosteroids with ointment vehicles compared to other topical preparations. Moreover, preference studies demonstrate that psoriasis patients often find the application of ointments to be messy, raising concerns about both short-term and long-term adherence to treatment. Recent compliance studies demonstrate that poor compliance with topical treatment is common among psoriasis patients and contributes to poor psoriasis treatment outcomes. Non-ointment topical corticosteroid products exhibit excellent efficacy in clinical practice. Much of the poor outcomes in psoriasis, even tachyphylaxis, likely relate less to actual medication failure and more to failure to apply the medication. Topical psoriasis treatment is likely to be more successful when physicians and patients discuss what type of vehicle the patient will use and plan treatment accordingly.

### Meta-analysis results do not reflect the real safety of biologics in psoriasis [^113GPGt6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

In reported systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatments for psoriasis, the proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs) did not differ between treatments and placebo. Including cases of psoriasis worsening as SAEs may explain the lack of difference.

- **Objectives**: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore this possibility.

- **Methods**: Among the 140 RCTs included in the Living Network Cochrane Review (last search on 8 May 2019), we selected those comparing a biologic treatment against placebo. The primary outcome was the numbers of SAEs in the treatment and placebo arms after excluding cases of psoriasis worsening. Secondary outcomes were the number of adverse events (AEs) of special interest. The trial was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019124495).

- **Results**: We analyzed 51 RCTs. Of these, 21 included at least one anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α arm, 15 one anti-interleukin (IL)-17 arm, 11 one anti-IL-23 arm, and nine one anti-IL-12/23 arm. With cases of psoriasis worsening included, the risk of occurrence of SAEs between biologic treatments and placebo did not differ: risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88–1.36. After excluding cases of psoriasis worsening, the RR became significant (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02–1.65). By drug class, the RRs were: anti-TNF-α, 1.68 (95% CI 1.11–2.54; no missing data); anti-IL-17, 1.28 (95% CI 0.88–1.85; no missing data); anti-IL-23, 0.95 (95% CI 0.59–1.52; no missing data); and anti-IL-12/23, 1.18 (95% CI 0.72–1.94; no missing data).

### A standardization approach to compare treatment safety and effectiveness outcomes between clinical trials and real-world populations in psoriasis [^113WoLpq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients recruited in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for biologic therapies in psoriasis are not fully representative of the real-world psoriasis population.

- **Objectives**: Firstly, to investigate whether patient characteristics are associated with being included in a psoriasis RCT. Secondly, to estimate the differences in the incidence of severe adverse events (SAEs) and the response rate between RCT and real-world populations of patients on biologic therapies for psoriasis using a standardization method.

- **Methods**: Data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR) were appended to individual participant-level data from two RCTs assessing ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis. Baseline variables were assessed for association with being in an RCT using a multivariable logistic regression model. Propensity score weights were derived to reweigh the registry population so that variables had the distribution of the trial population. We measured the C-statistic of the model with trial status as the dependent variable, and the risk differences in the incidence rate of SAEs in the first year and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) after 6 months in the BADBIR cohort before and after weighting.

- **Results**: In total, 6790 registry and 2021 RCT participants were included. The multivariable logistic regression model had a C-statistic of 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.83]. The risk differences for the incidence rate of SAEs and the proportion of patients with PASI < 1.5 were 9.27 (95% CI -3.91–22.5) per 1000 patients.

### Comparison of biologics and oral treatments for plaque psoriasis: A meta-analysis [^115vdKo8]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical benefits of novel treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis are well established, but wide variations exist in patient response across different therapies. In the absence of head-to-head randomized trials, meta-analyses synthesizing data from multiple studies are needed to assess comparative efficacy among psoriasis treatments.

To estimate the relative short-term and long-term efficacy of biologics and oral agents for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, a systematic literature review was conducted on December 4, 2017, and updated on September 17, 2018. The Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register databases were included.

- **Study selection**: Phase 2, 3, or 4 randomized clinical trials of treatments licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis were selected. These trials provided data on Psoriasis Area and Severity Index assessment of 75%, 90%, and 100% reductions (PASI 75, 90, and 100) at 10 to 16 weeks (short-term efficacy) or 44 to 60 weeks (long-term efficacy) from baseline.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Data were extracted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to estimate short-term PASI response rates. To account for variation across trials, an ordinal model that adjusted for reference arm response was implemented. The long-term PASI rates were estimated via a traditional meta-analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: PASI 75, 90, and 100 response rates were assessed at both short-term and long-term intervals.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^113AKCSS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with manifestations in the skin, joints, or both, significantly impacting quality of life. Although there is no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies can lead to sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. The relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials directly comparing them, which prompted us to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for individuals with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis. Additionally, to provide a ranking of these treatments based on their benefits and harms.

- **Search methods**: For this update of the living systematic review, we updated our searches of the following databases monthly up to October 2022: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults over 18 years with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, compared to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, defined as at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, and the proportion of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) during the induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We conducted duplicate study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and analyses.

### Combination therapy to treat moderate to severe psoriasis [^116Guva5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, achieving and sustaining remission can be challenging. Both short-term and long-term maintenance agents are necessary for effective management. The speed and efficiency of available monotherapies often inversely correlate with safety. Therefore, combination, rotational, and sequential approaches tend to be more effective and safer than single-agent therapies.

Combining agents with complementary adverse effect profiles is preferable. Most paired combinations of the four major therapies — acitretin, phototherapy (ultraviolet B/psoralen plus ultraviolet A), cyclosporine, and methotrexate — demonstrate apparent synergistic enhancement. However, cyclosporine in combination with psoralen plus ultraviolet A is contraindicated due to an increased risk of cancer. Combinations of major therapies with topical agents such as retinoids, steroids, and vitamin D derivatives have been employed with varying levels of efficacy and safety. Immunomodulators like hydroxyurea and thioguanine have also shown success in combination therapies.

The introduction of new biologic agents with novel modes of action and adverse effect profiles may become important adjuncts in combination, rotational, or sequential approaches. In some scenarios, monotherapy with systemic agents or phototherapy can adequately control moderate to severe disease, offering benefits such as reduced cost and improved patient adherence. However, for several reasons, including the loss of efficacy, adverse effects, or cumulative or acute toxicity — particularly when clearing resistant plaques — combination therapies may be necessary.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis 2020: A rapid update [^116R8xog]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for psoriasis, specifically with respect to initiating biologic therapy and the choice of agent, the BAD 2020 guidelines recommend considering both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It is advised to manage treatment in consultation with a rheumatologist or a pediatric rheumatologist before initiating or making changes to biologic therapy. Be aware that the presence and phenotype of psoriatic arthritis (peripheral or axial disease) may influence the access to, choice, and dose of biologic therapy. Screen for psoriatic arthritis in patients without this diagnosis using a validated tool, such as the Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool. However, be aware that the Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool may not detect axial arthritis or inflammatory back pain.

### Targeting the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in psoriasis: The search for the good, the bad and the ugly [^116w8yzv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

New promising treatments have been developed for psoriasis that target different parts of the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 pathway. This approach is believed to be more disease-specific, and sparing the T helper 1 pathway might prevent serious long-term adverse events. Moreover, superior Psoriasis Area and Severity Index improvements are observed, which have redefined treatment goals in psoriasis.

The new molecules can be divided into different categories according to the target: blocking agents can target the upstream cytokine IL-23 or the downstream IL-17. In the latter, a variety of targets exist, such as the ligands IL-17A and IL-17F, or a combination thereof, or a subunit of the receptor, IL-17RA. Each target seems to have its own set of advantages and pitfalls, which will impact the treatment decision in clinical practice.

In this review, we summarize the knowledge on the different inhibitors of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the role of IL-17 in other diseases and comorbidities. Finally, we discuss how comprehensive knowledge is needed for the prescribing physician in order to make the most appropriate therapeutic choice for each individual patient.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis 2020: A rapid update [^113qjJTz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for psoriasis, especially in relation to monitoring during biologic therapy, the BAD 2020 guidelines recommend reviewing the response to biologic therapy by considering the following:

- **Psoriasis disease severity**: Comparing baseline measurements (e.g. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index baseline to endpoint score)
- **Agreed treatment goal**: Evaluating if the treatment goals have been met
- **Control of psoriatic arthritis disease activity and/or IBD**: In consultation with a rheumatologist and/or gastroenterologist
- **Impact of psoriasis**: Assessing the effect on the patient's physical, psychological, and social functioning
- **Benefits versus risks**: Weighing the continued treatment benefits against risks
- **Patient's views**: Considering the opinions of the patient and, if appropriate, their family or carers
- **Adherence to the treatment**: Monitoring the patient's compliance with the prescribed regimen

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis 2020: A rapid update [^113CRNhS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for psoriasis, specifically with respect to monitoring during biologic therapy, the BAD 2020 guidelines recommend seeking advice from a dermatologist experienced in using biologic therapy in pediatric patients. Consider using any of the following strategies if a pediatric or young patient with psoriasis responds inadequately to the first or subsequent biologic agent:

- **Reiterate advice about modifiable factors**: Contributing to poor response, such as obesity and poor adherence.

- **Optimize adjunctive therapy**: For example, switching from oral to subcutaneous methotrexate.

- **Switch to an alternative biologic agent**.

- **Advise alternative or supplementary non-biologic therapy approaches**: Such as inpatient topical therapy or systemic therapies.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: A network meta-analysis [^115F4PmE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with manifestations in the skin, the joints, or both, significantly impacting quality of life. While a cure for psoriasis remains elusive, various treatment strategies enable sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options, the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments remain unclear due to the limited number of direct comparisons. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis to comprehensively compare systemic treatments.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of non-targeted systemic agents, targeted synthetic agents, and biologic targeted treatments for individuals with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to rank these treatments by their benefits and harms.

- **Search methods**: For this update of the living systematic review, searches were updated monthly up to July 2024 in the following databases and trial registers: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of systemic pharmacological treatments in adults over 18 years of age with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, were compared to placebo or another active agent, irrespective of dose and duration.

- **Outcomes**: The critical outcomes were the proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin, defined as at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, and the proportion of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) during the induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation).

### Trends in systemic psoriasis treatment therapies from 1993 through 2010 [^112dJGBs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Moderate-to-severe psoriasis generally requires systemic therapy and is often undertreated. The objective of this study is to determine and analyze what courses of treatment and in what frequency are being utilized to combat psoriasis in the United States.

Methods involved the analysis of data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) of the National Center for Health Statistics. Data were analyzed to examine the prevalence of different therapy techniques to combat psoriasis from 1993 through 2010. The trends for phototherapy, methotrexate (MTX), retinoids, cyclosporine A (CSA), systemic steroids, and biologics were all analyzed over the entire 18-year period and independently before and after the introduction of biologics in 2002.

From 1993 to 2010, the trend for total systemic treatments has not significantly increased (P = 0.5). However, the frequency of phototherapy treatments significantly decreased during this period (P < 0.001). Since the introduction of biologics in 2002, their frequency has significantly increased, becoming the most frequently used treatment from 2008–2010 (P < 0.0001). The limitation noted is that the severity of psoriasis was not recorded in the NAMCS and NHAMCS.

In conclusion, the frequency of systemic treatments to treat psoriasis has not significantly increased from 1993 to 2010. Despite the introduction of biologics, it appears that little progress has been made in reducing under-treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

### Combining biologic therapies with other systemic treatments in psoriasis: Evidence-based, best-practice recommendations from the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation [^112TdHeN]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). High credibility.

While monotherapy with biologic agents is effective for many patients with psoriasis, some patients require combination therapy. Evidence-based recommendations on combination therapy provide guidance for treating appropriately selected patients with psoriasis.

- **Objective**: To make evidence-based, best-practice recommendations regarding combining biologics with other systemic treatments, including phototherapy, oral medications, or other biologics, for psoriasis treatment.

- **Evidence review**: We searched the MEDLINE database for studies from January 1, 1946, to June 18, 2013, that evaluated therapies combining biologics with phototherapy, oral medications, or other biologic agents. The Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation arrived at best-practice recommendations through group discussion and voting.

- **Findings**: Few trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of combination therapies in moderate to severe psoriasis. Combining biologics, such as etanercept or adalimumab, with phototherapy likely results in a greater reduction in disease severity than either alone. Etanercept and methotrexate combination is more effective than monotherapy with either medication. A combination of infliximab with methotrexate results in greater efficacy than infliximab alone. With the concomitant use of acitretin, the dosing of etanercept can be reduced to maintain similar levels of efficacy. Short-term cyclosporine use has been combined with etanercept or adalimumab to control psoriasis flares. Based on the expert opinion of the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation, the recommendations provide guidance for these therapeutic combinations.
