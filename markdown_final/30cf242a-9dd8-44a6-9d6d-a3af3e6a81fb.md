## Question

What is the efficacy of zorlimab for Crohn's disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the efficacy of zorlimab is for Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "zorlimab" appears in any of the supplied trials, guidelines, or reviews. Then, I should verify if "zorlimab" might be a misspelling, synonym, or early-phase code name of a known agent. Next, I will review which therapies are actually covered by the high-quality guidelines and pivotal RCTs in the packet. Finally, I'll interpret the implications and outline next steps, including clarifying the drug name and pointing to established options supported by the evidence base [^115rPu2L] [^114oKteH].

> Let me first confirm the presence of "zorlimab" in the provided documents. I systematically scanned the guideline summaries and the pivotal RCTs provided; repeated mentions center on ustekinumab, risankizumab, vedolizumab, guselkumab, mirikizumab, and anti-TNF agents, but I cannot find any occurrence of "zorlimab" in the guideline recommendations or trial acronyms summarized here, which strongly suggests that "zorlimab" is not covered in these materials.

> Wait, let me verify whether "zorlimab" could be a misspelling or alternate name of a known agent. I briefly considered whether it might refer to ontamalimab (SHP647), an anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody evaluated in Crohn's disease, but that agent is explicitly referred to as ontamalimab/SHP647 rather than "zorlimab", so that linkage would be incorrect on name grounds and mechanism, and I should not conflate them [^111L2fMQ]. I also asked myself if "zorlimab" might be intended to mean risankizumab, but the SEQUENCE program clearly uses the risankizumab name, and there is no "zorlimab" synonym listed in these summaries, so that seems unlikely as well [^116Hj8Af]. Could it be guselkumab or mirikizumab? The pipeline and recent guideline summaries name these explicitly, again with no "zorlimab" synonym noted, so that does not fit either [^1171PUQT] [^1158hCp5].

> Hold on, I should verify the pipeline overviews to ensure we are not overlooking an investigational codename. The included pipeline reviews and commentaries reference guselkumab programs like GRAVITI/GALAXI and discuss broader development issues in IBD trials, yet there is still no mention of "zorlimab", which supports the conclusion that this name is not present in the supplied corpus and likely not covered by these summaries of current or near-term agents [^1171PUQT] [^116ke6u9].

> Given that "zorlimab" does not appear in the provided documents, I need to ensure I do not over-interpret; without data here, I cannot estimate remission rates, comparative effectiveness, or safety for this drug, and I cannot position it versus established biologics or small molecules, so any efficacy claim would be speculative and not evidence-based from this packet [^115rPu2L] [^114oKteH]. In such circumstances, standard practice would be to default to therapies with guideline support and pivotal-trial evidence until and unless accurate identification and data for the queried agent can be confirmed [^1158hCp5].

> But wait, what if the user meant one of the agents actually summarized here; let me provide anchor efficacy figures to ground a likely intended comparison. For risankizumab versus ustekinumab in biologic-experienced Crohn's disease, SEQUENCE reported higher clinical remission at week 24 and higher endoscopic remission at week 48 with risankizumab using standard dosing, establishing at least noninferiority with signals of superiority on key endpoints in that study context [^116Hj8Af] [^113RTFGL]. For ustekinumab, the UNITI program demonstrated superiority over placebo for induction response and maintenance remission using weight-based IV induction followed by 90 mg SC maintenance, establishing its role across anti-TNF–experienced and –naïve populations within those trials [^112deWUJ] [^1148gU6m].

> Next, I should review safety context to avoid premature extrapolation. Vedolizumab's Cochrane analyses consistently show superiority over placebo for induction and maintenance with no excess in serious adverse events versus placebo in induction and with favorable maintenance profiles, whereas a meta-analysis highlights that even placebo exposure in IBD trials carries nontrivial risks such as serious adverse events and worsening disease activity, underscoring the importance of evidence-based choices and the pitfalls of using an uncharacterized agent without supportive data [^116nKqZV] [^1131zias] [^111mhG7t].

> I will now examine the guideline positioning to anchor clinical recommendations while I clarify the drug identity. Contemporary ACG, ECCO, and BSG guidance frame ustekinumab, risankizumab, vedolizumab, anti-TNF agents, and in some regions mirikizumab and guselkumab as appropriate options for induction and maintenance in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, with some preference signals depending on prior exposures and targets, but none of these summaries include "zorlimab", further reinforcing the need to confirm the intended agent name before offering efficacy advice specific to that molecule [^115rPu2L] [^114oKteH] [^116jrMxL].

> Let me think about next steps. I should double-check the name with the user to ensure accurate identification, because "zorlimab" could represent an early-phase compound, a regional nonproprietary name, a biosimilar naming variant, or simply a misspelling of a marketed IL-23, IL-12/23, anti-integrin, or anti-TNF agent; until clarified, I cannot responsibly quote efficacy or safety metrics for that specific drug from these materials, and I recommend proceeding with an evidence-based, treat-to-target approach using therapies supported by high-quality trials and guidelines while we verify the intended molecule [^114TXkii] [^1158hCp5].

I can't find a Crohn's disease therapy called "zorlimab". Please **confirm the exact drug name** or provide more details (mechanism, manufacturer, or a clinical trial identifier). If you meant one of the following agents, I can **summarize efficacy** with citations:

- **Risankizumab (IL-23 inhibitor)**: SEQUENCE trial [^116Hj8Af] showed noninferiority to ustekinumab for clinical remission and superiority for endoscopic remission; guidelines support use [^116jrMxL] in moderate-to-severe CD [^114oKteH], especially after anti-TNF exposure [^115rPu2L].
- **Ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor)**: UNITI/IM-UNITI demonstrated efficacy for induction [^112deWUJ] and maintenance; recommended [^114oKteH] in guidelines [^1162MQ16].
- **Guselkumab (IL-23 inhibitor)**: Phase 3 GRAVITI [^1171PUQT] reportedly met primary and secondary endpoints in moderate-to-severe CD [^1162MQ16] (results not yet published).
- **Vedolizumab (anti-integrin)**: Effective for induction and maintenance [^1131zias] in CD per Cochrane [^116nKqZV] and guidelines [^114oKteH].

Please confirm the **drug name** so I can provide precise efficacy data.

### Risankizumab versus ustekinumab for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^116Hj8Af]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The SEQUENCE study, published by Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med, explored the treatment of Crohn's disease. The trial aimed to determine if risankizumab is noninferior to ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. This multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial included a population of 520 patients, consisting of 253 females and 267 males. The inclusion criteria targeted patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response to or unacceptable side effects with anti-TNF therapy.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The key exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis, known complications of Crohn's disease, prior exposure to p19 and/or p40 inhibitors, and receipt of an approved biologic agent for Crohn's disease.

- **Interventions**: In the study, 255 patients received risankizumab at an intravenous induction dose of 600 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by a subcutaneous maintenance dose of 360 mg every 8 weeks from week 12 to week 48. Meanwhile, 265 patients were administered ustekinumab at a single weight-based intravenous induction dose of 260–520 mg at week 0, followed by a subcutaneous maintenance dose of 90 mg every 8 weeks, starting at week 8.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in clinical remission at week 24, with remission rates of 58.6% for risankizumab and 39.5% for ustekinumab (AD 18.4%, 95% CI 6.6 to 30.3).

- **Secondary outcome**: There was a significant increase in endoscopic remission at week 48 with rates of 31.8% for risankizumab compared to 16.2% for ustekinumab.

### Advancing therapeutic frontiers: A pipeline of novel drugs for luminal and perianal Crohn's disease management [^1171PUQT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

A Phase III trial, double-blind and placebo-controlled, named GRAVITI (NCT05197049), aims to assess the efficacy and safety of guselkumab solely SC therapy in individuals with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD). The study involves multiple arms, with participants receiving one of three doses of SC guselkumab or a placebo. The results are unpublished; however, Johnson & Johnson already announced that their Phase III GRAVITI met all primary and secondary endpoints, achieving significant clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 12. The study supports guselkumab's potential to be the only IL-23 inhibitor with both SC and IV induction options. Results were consistent with previous GALAXI studies; therefore, the pharmaceutical company has submitted an application for FDA approval of guselkumab for this indication. Of note, the pharmacokinetic (PK) findings indicate that there was no clear relationship between systemic exposure to guselkumab and clinical outcomes such as CDAI improvement, clinical remission, or endoscopic response at week 12.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^116nKqZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**

- **Summary of main results**: Four induction RCTs enrolling 1,126 participants and three maintenance RCTs enrolling 894 participants met the criteria for inclusion in this review.

- **Induction phase**

The evidence is very certain that vedolizumab is superior to placebo in inducing clinical remission in CD. The evidence is also very certain that vedolizumab is superior to placebo in inducing a clinical response (CDAI-100 response). There was no evidence of a difference in overall adverse events between vedolizumab and placebo during induction therapy; however, the evidence was of moderate certainty due to moderately narrow confidence intervals (CIs). There was no evidence of a difference in serious adverse events between vedolizumab and placebo during induction therapy; this evidence was of low certainty due to imprecision from wide CIs. No induction studies reported the rate of endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, or surgery.

- **Maintenance phase**

The evidence is very certain that vedolizumab is superior to placebo in maintaining clinical remission in CD. There was no evidence of a difference in overall adverse events between vedolizumab and placebo during maintenance therapy; however, the evidence was of moderate certainty due to moderately narrow CIs. There was no evidence of a difference in serious adverse events between vedolizumab and placebo during maintenance therapy; this evidence was of low certainty due to imprecision from sparse events. No maintenance studies reported the rate of endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, or surgery.

### Ustekinumab as induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease [^1148gU6m]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The study UNITI-1 investigated the role of a weight-based dose of ustekinumab in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Conducted by Brian G. Feagan and colleagues in 2016, this multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study involved 496 patients, comprising 277 females and 219 males.

The inclusion criteria required patients to have active moderate to severe Crohn's disease and previous unsatisfactory responses or unacceptable side effects from tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. The key exclusion criteria included gastrointestinal conditions possibly necessitating surgery, conditions impeding the use of the Crohn's Disease Activity Index, active infections such as tuberculosis, and a history of cancer.

- **Interventions**:
	- 249 patients received ustekinumab (an induction dose of approximately 6 mg/kg of body weight).
	- 247 patients received a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- The primary outcome was a significant increase in the 100-point clinical response at week 6, with 33.7% of patients in the ustekinumab group showing improvement compared to 21.5% in the placebo group (AD 12.3%, 95% CI 4.5 to 20.1).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- The study also reported a significant increase in clinical remission at week 8, with 20.9% in the ustekinumab group compared to 7.3% in the placebo group (AD 13.6%, 95% CI 7.6 to 19.6).

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline for the management of luminal Crohn's disease [^113569RY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong illness with substantial morbidity, although new therapies and treatment paradigms have been developed. We provide guidance for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active luminal CD.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review to identify published studies of the management of CD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a group of specialists.

- **Results**: The consensus includes 41 statements focused on six main drug classes: antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and other therapies. The group suggested against the use of antibiotics or 5-aminosalicylate as induction or maintenance therapies. Corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide) can be used as induction, but not maintenance therapies. Among immunosuppressants, thiopurines should not be used for induction but can be used for maintenance therapy for selected low-risk patients. Parenteral methotrexate was proposed for induction and maintenance therapy in patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD. Biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, were recommended for patients failed by conventional induction therapies and as maintenance therapy. The consensus group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressant therapy.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease [^112teDx5]? Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease remains a challenge for practitioners to treat, and top-down therapy will continue to be an area of research in the coming years. As advances are made in the field of monoclonal antibodies, the development of newer biologic immunosuppressing drugs will continue; however, given the costs and potential side effects of the long-term use of immunosuppression, care should be taken in designing trials to ensure that well-designed treatment regimens with appropriate disease stratification and objective outcome measures can provide good evidence for future treatment.

In its current state, nevertheless, the mainstay of therapy continues to be based largely on imprecise treatment using either "step-up" or newly proposed "top-down" approaches. Research and evidence supporting top-down therapy remain limited. Combined therapy showed promising results over both early biologic and early immunomodulatory treatment and may be a recommended area for further study. Drug combinations, timing, and dosage are all areas that should be addressed. Considering this, we recommend that the most desirable treatment for a newly diagnosed Crohn's disease patient should be a personalized and tailored approach. The disease should be stratified for each patient, taking into consideration the location, extent, previous disease course, and severity of their Crohn's disease, as well as their comorbidities and personal preferences. Combined ("top-down") therapy should be considered for patients with complicated disease with poor prognostic factors (e.g. diagnosis as pediatric patients).

### Targeting mucosal healing in Crohn's disease: What the clinician needs to know [^115xDVtv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

In recent years, mucosal healing has emerged as a key therapeutic goal in the clinical management of patients with Crohn's disease, as it has been associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes. With the vast improvements in endoscopic imaging techniques and the increase in available treatment options, which reportedly are able to induce mucosal healing, the practicing physician is left to wonder: how is endoscopic mucosal healing exactly defined in Crohn's disease, and how can it effectively be achieved and monitored in daily clinical practice? Within this review, we will give an overview of the ongoing debate about the definition of mucosal healing and the modalities to monitor inflammation, and finally present available therapies with the capacity to induce mucosal healing.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^112o7b4J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The primary outcome was the induction of clinical remission. In a meta-analysis of four studies involving 1,126 participants, 19.8% (126/635) of the vedolizumab group achieved clinical remission at six to ten weeks compared to 11.6% (57/491) of the placebo group (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.17; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13; Analysis 1.1).

- **Subgroup analysis**: We conducted a subgroup analysis among participants who had previously failed TNF inhibitor therapy and those who had not. The test for subgroup differences showed no evidence of a difference between the subgroups (P = 0.21). Among those who had previously failed TNF inhibitor therapy (613 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in the induction of clinical remission between the groups (12% with vedolizumab versus 10% with placebo; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.25; Analysis 1.1), although results were imprecise and showed some inconsistency (I² = 27%). Among those who had not failed anti-TNF alpha therapy (513 participants), induction of clinical remission may be more likely in the vedolizumab group compared to the placebo group (28% with vedolizumab versus 14% with placebo; RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.84; Analysis 1.1). However, given the absence of a difference between subgroups, certainty about any true difference between subgroups is lacking.

When employing a fixed-effect method of analysis, our conclusions remained consistent. All studies were at low risk of bias with less than 10% loss to follow-up, so predefined sensitivity analyses were not executed.

### Harms with placebo in trials of biological therapies and small molecules as induction therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mhG7t]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Randomised placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard to assess novel drugs in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. However, there might be risks associated with receiving placebo. We aimed to examine the harms associated with receiving placebo in trials of licensed biologics and small molecules for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis and luminal Crohn's disease in a meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Embase Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to May 30, 2024, for randomised placebo-controlled trials of licensed biologics and small molecules for induction of remission in adults (≥ 18 years) with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis or luminal Crohn's disease, reporting data on adverse events over a minimum treatment period of 4 weeks. There were no prespecified study exclusion criteria. We extracted summary data and pooled data using a random-effects model for any treatment-emergent adverse event, any drug-related adverse event, infection, worsening of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity, withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events, serious infection, serious worsening of IBD activity, or venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), reporting relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024527341).

- **Findings**: The search identified 10,826 citations, of which 47 trials included 20,987 patients (14,267 [68.0%] receiving active drug and 6,720 [32%] receiving placebo).

### Management of active Crohn disease [^111NWUCE]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of Crohn disease is rapidly evolving with the introduction of novel biologic therapies and newer, often more intensive treatment approaches. Understanding how to treat individual patients in this quickly changing environment can pose a challenge.

The objective of this study is to review the diagnosis and management of moderate to severe Crohn disease, focusing on newer treatments and goals of care.

- **Evidence review**: MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2011, and additional citations were procured from references of selected research and review articles. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association level-of-evidence guidelines.

- **Results**: Although mesalamines are still often used to treat Crohn disease, evidence for their efficacy is lacking. Corticosteroids can be effectively used to induce remission in moderate to severe Crohn disease, but they do not maintain remission. Immunomodulators and biologics, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor, are the mainstays of treatment.

- **Conclusion and relevance**: Immunomodulators and biologics are now the preferred treatment options for Crohn disease.

### Risankizumab versus ustekinumab for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^113RTFGL]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of risankizumab as compared with ustekinumab in patients with Crohn's disease are unknown. In this phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial with blinded assessment of endpoints, patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy or unacceptable side effects with such therapy were randomly assigned to receive risankizumab or ustekinumab at standard doses for 48 weeks.

- **Methods**: The two primary endpoints, tested sequentially, were clinical remission at week 24 (defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of 1 in any individual variable on the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease [range, 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating more severe disease]). These were analyzed for superiority in 100% of the patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of risankizumab or ustekinumab.

- **Results**: In the full intention-to-treat population for the efficacy analysis, 230 of 255 patients (90.2%) who received risankizumab and 193 of 265 patients (72.8%) who received ustekinumab completed all the assigned treatments. Both primary endpoints were met; risankizumab was noninferior.

### Advancing therapeutic frontiers: A pipeline of novel drugs for luminal and perianal Crohn's disease management [^116ke6u9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Use of placebo in clinical trials remains one of the most contentious issues in IBD clinical trials. The argument in favor of continuing placebo-controlled trials stems from several factors. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the EMA often require placebo-controlled trials for drug approval, especially for conditions where the disease fluctuates naturally, such as IBD. Placebos can help demonstrate the true efficacy of a new drug by providing a clear comparison against no treatment.

Additionally, the use of a placebo allows for smaller sample sizes because the expected effect size of the new drug compared to placebo is often larger than when comparing two active treatments. Moreover, placebo-controlled trials are considered more straightforward when it comes to demonstrating superiority, which is often a higher bar to meet. These practical and financial benefits encourage pharmaceutical companies to design trials with placebo groups.

However, there are strong ethical concerns against the continued use of placebos. Once there is moderate or high certainty about the efficacy of a treatment, it becomes questionable whether it is ethical to withhold that treatment from patients in a placebo group. In many cases, patients assigned to placebo are exposed to unnecessary risks, such as worsening symptoms, increased morbidity, and even mortality, which could have been prevented with active treatment. This concern is particularly acute in IBD, where placebo patients may suffer from severe disease exacerbations or complications like venous thromboembolism.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^114cBtLb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The overall body of evidence allows a robust conclusion regarding the objective of this review. We included four induction studies (1126 participants) and three maintenance studies (894 participants). The methodological basis for these conclusions is sound. All trials were randomized, placebo-controlled, and described as double-blinded.

The RoB 1 tool suggested a low risk of bias across most domains for induction and maintenance studies. There were several areas of unknown risk of bias, despite contacting the study authors for clarification. Nonetheless, these overall limitations were not serious, and the evidence was not downgraded for risk of bias for any of the outcomes within the summary of findings tables.

We did not downgrade for inconsistency for any outcomes across both induction and maintenance studies. The I² value was low (0% to 15%) across all outcomes. We did not downgrade for indirectness for any outcomes for either induction or maintenance studies. Specifically, there was no major indirectness concerning the population, intervention, and outcome measurement.

- **Adverse events**: We downgraded twice for serious adverse events for both induction and maintenance studies due to wide confidence intervals. We downgraded once for adverse events for both induction and maintenance studies due to moderately wide confidence intervals.

We did not downgrade for publication bias for any outcomes. All included studies were RCTs, and there were no observational data included in this review. There was an insufficient number of studies to construct a funnel plot.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease [^1166TNkC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Although it is beyond the scope of this review article's objectives and goals, it is important to note that a team of scientists recently reported the identification of genetic markers that determine the severity of Crohn's disease. These molecular biomarkers are potentially useful for predicting individual patient outcomes. The implication of these findings is extremely significant, as the prognosis in Crohn's disease could be governed by distinct genetic loci. By understanding the genes involved in determining outcomes for Crohn's patients, therapies could be developed that target specific biologic pathways. Furthermore, this knowledge would allow for the stratification of patients and the development of new personalized therapies based on their genetic profiles.

### Adalimumab for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^1151HQx1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Conventional medications for Crohn's disease (CD) include anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and corticosteroids. If an individual does not respond or loses response to first-line treatments, biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonists like adalimumab are considered for treating CD. Maintenance of remission in CD is a clinically important goal, as disease relapse can negatively affect quality of life.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab for the maintenance of remission in people with quiescent CD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to April 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered for inclusion randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing adalimumab to placebo or to an active comparator.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We analyzed data on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical remission, defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than 150. Secondary outcomes included failure to maintain clinical response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, histological remission, and adverse events (AEs). We assessed biases using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of evidence supporting the primary outcome.

- **Main results**: We included six RCTs with 1158 participants. We rated four…

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^114uXJA8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The risk of bias in the included studies is evaluated comprehensively in the research.

- **Induction studies**: All four induction studies were randomized. Two studies, Sandborn 2013 (Induction Phase) and Sands 2014, provided sufficient information within the study or protocol about randomization, allowing them to be judged at low risk of bias. However, Feagan 2008 and Watanabe 2020 (Induction Phase) did not mention the randomization method and were thus classified as having an unclear risk. Efforts to seek clarification from the study authors yielded no response.

	- Concerning allocation concealment, three induction studies — Sandborn 2013 (Induction Phase), Sands 2014, and Watanabe 2020 (Induction Phase) — were categorized as low risk due to the sufficient information provided. For Feagan 2008, attempts to contact the authors for details were unsuccessful, resulting in an unclear risk classification.

- **Maintenance studies**: All three maintenance studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Sandborn 2013 (Maintenance Phase) included a detailed randomization process in the protocol, indicating a low risk of bias. Vermeire 2021 confirmed that their randomization schedule was generated using interactive response technology, thus also indicating a low risk of bias. However, the specific randomization process for Watanabe 2020 (Maintenance Phase) was unclear, resulting in an unclear risk classification.

	- In terms of allocation concealment, Sandborn 2013 (Maintenance Phase) and Watanabe 2020 (Maintenance Phase) were considered low risk since investigators were blinded to the allocations, with the exception of unblinded pharmacists at the treatment sites. Attempts to confirm details about Vermeire 2021's allocation concealment revealed that only personnel from the vendor with access to the randomization schedule were involved.

### Early biological therapy in operated Crohn's disease patients is associated with a lower rate of endoscopic recurrence and improved long-term outcomes: A single-center experience [^1139ty7p]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Key messages:

- **What is already known**: Patients undergoing Crohn's disease-related surgery are treated with biological therapy if there are risk factors for recurrence or if there is an endoscopic recurrence of disease.

- **What is new here**: Crohn's disease patients treated with biological therapy postoperatively experience a reduced rate of hospitalization and surgery regardless of endoscopic disease recurrence and risk factors.

- **How can this study help patient care**: Early treatment with postoperative biological therapy may prevent disease recurrence and improve long-term outcomes for patients with Crohn's disease.

### First-line anti-TNF agents, ustekinumab and vedolizumab perform similarly in Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis [^1112etRq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

At the end of follow-up, 302 out of 587 (51.4%) patients with Crohn's disease and 173 out of 358 (48.3%) patients with ulcerative colitis were still receiving first-line therapy. For the great majority of these patients [Crohn's disease: 295 out of 302 patients (97.7%); ulcerative colitis: 172 out of 173 patients (99.4%)], data on disease control at the last patient visit (PRO-2 score) were available in the registry at the time of writing.

Most patients with ulcerative colitis were in clinical remission at the end of the follow-up. However, the proportion of patients in PRO-2 remission was higher in those treated with anti-TNF agents compared to those treated with vedolizumab (94.8% vs. 78.9%, P = 0.002). This was observed in both items of the PRO-2 score, for rectal bleeding score (RBS) and stool frequency score (SFS). The number of patients with SFS ≤ 1 was 96 out of 96 (100%) and 68 out of 76 (89.5%) for those treated with anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab, respectively (P = 0.0012). RBS 0 was recorded in 91 out of 96 (94.8%) and 63 out of 76 (82.9%) of patients treated with anti-TNF agents and vedolizumab, respectively (P = 0.011).

In Crohn's disease, no statistically significant differences in clinical remission rates between different therapeutic classes were observed (P = 0.95). Similarly, no significant differences in SFS between therapeutic classes were found (P = 0.98). However, mean abdominal pain score (APS) was higher in patients treated with vedolizumab (P = 0.03) than in those treated with anti-TNF agents and ustekinumab.

### Effectiveness of ustekinumab in patients with refractory Crohn's disease: A multicentre real-life study in Italy [^115mNam4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disease resulting from uncontrolled inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although several genetic, environmental, gut bacterial, and immune factors are thought to play a role in the development of CD, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain unknown.

The introduction of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-targeting biological agents, such as infliximab and adalimumab, has transformed the management of patients with moderately to severely active CD. Patients refractory to conventional treatments have been shown to achieve clinical remission with anti-TNF-α agents; however, a proportion of patients are either primary nonresponders, lose their response over time, or are intolerant to these agents and are thus a challenging group to treat.

Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, inhibiting their receptor binding on CD4+ T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and natural killer cells. The efficacy of ustekinumab in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with CD was demonstrated in the randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II CERTIFI clinical study and in the Phase III UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI clinical trials. Based on the results of these trials, ustekinumab has been approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration since 2016 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD who have had an inadequate response, lost their response, or been found to be intolerant.

### Biologic therapy in Crohn's disease: State of the art [^1123Xwbz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

This review is intended to appraise the evolution and latest developments in treatment strategies and management of patients with Crohn's disease.

Recent findings from the last 24 months have further established the role of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in Crohn's disease, with two new agents demonstrating efficacy in well-designed randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, other important strategies have been identified, including inhibition of leukocyte trafficking and blocking of interleukin-12 and 23. Alongside the evolution in drug therapies, there has been more extensive investigation on the best means to use these new agents.

Biologic therapy has changed and will continue to transform the way we treat patients with Crohn's disease. Treatment success has been redefined. The challenges will be to utilize these agents in the best algorithms possible to benefit not only short-term but also long-term outcomes.

### Personalised medicine in Crohn's disease [^115xA3TJ]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Similar to many immune-mediated diseases, Crohn's disease follows a relapsing-remitting pattern, with a variable disease course and heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Frequency of flare-ups, development of complications, and response to treatment collectively determine the effect on a patient's quality of life, which can vary from minimal disruption to profound disability or death. Despite recent advances in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis, including for Crohn's disease, management decisions are still typically made using a one-size-fits-all approach. Indeed, the inability to reliably predict clinical outcomes in a way that could guide future therapy represents a major unmet need.

Recently, several important insights have been made into the biology underlying outcomes in Crohn's disease. In this review, we will summarize these insights and discuss how greater understanding of these disease mechanisms can be used to develop clinically useful biomarkers, identify novel approaches to optimize disease control, and help deliver the goal of personalized medicine.

### Advances in the treatment of Crohn's disease [^1148BfH6]. Gastroenterology (2004). High credibility.

The medical therapy of Crohn's disease has improved considerably in recent years. In large part, this is due to the introduction of new efficacious agents, both "biologics" and traditional small molecules. Further study of older drugs has also advanced our ability to devise the optimum approach to individual Crohn's disease patients by better clarifying the benefits, adverse effects, and means to optimize doses of established medications.

In this review, we present an evidence-based approach to the medical management of active Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease in remission, and perianal Crohn's disease. The approach emphasizes recent advances that have come from the results of randomized controlled clinical trials.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^116xnRUD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vedolizumab blocks inflammatory activity within the gastrointestinal tract. Systematic reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of vedolizumab in ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease in general. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the evidence of vedolizumab in the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of vedolizumab versus placebo for the induction and maintenance of remission in people with Crohn's disease.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 30 November 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing vedolizumab to placebo for the induction or maintenance of remission in people with Crohn's disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. For induction studies, the primary outcome was clinical remission, and secondary outcomes were rates of clinical response, adverse events, serious adverse events, surgery, endoscopic remission, and endoscopic response. For maintenance studies, the primary outcome was maintenance of clinical remission, and secondary outcomes were rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, surgery, endoscopic remission, and endoscopic response. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

- **Main results**: We analyzed induction (4 trials, 1126 participants) and maintenance (3 trials, 894 participants) studies representing people across North America, Europe, and Asia.

### Comparative effectiveness of ustekinumab vs. vedolizumab for anti-TNF-naïve or anti-TNF-exposed Crohn's disease: A multicenter cohort study [^113Ehzmt]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Both UST and VDZ were administered at standard doses as per the label. UST was initiated with a weight-based intravenous infusion: 260 mg for patients weighing ≤ 55 kg, 390 mg for those between 55 kg and 85 kg, and 520 mg for individuals over 85 kg during the induction period. The maintenance dosage is a 90 mg subcutaneous dose given 8 weeks after the initial intravenous dose, followed by administration every 8 or 12 weeks thereafter.

VDZ was given intravenously at a dosage of 300 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 for induction, with maintenance every 8 weeks. Dose escalation during the maintenance phase, along with the use of concomitant steroids and immunosuppressants, was at the physician's discretion. Patients who experienced an inadequate response or loss of response to the standard dose of VDZ or UST had the option to undergo dose escalation.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^116Evs8Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

This review aims to highlight the efficacy and risks of vedolizumab in Crohn's disease (CD) compared to placebo. A prior systematic review in 2014 concluded that vedolizumab was more effective than placebo as an induction and maintenance therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) [Wang 2014]. Similarly, another systematic review and meta-analysis in 2014 found that vedolizumab was superior to placebo for inducing remission and response in UC [Bickston 2014].

Moćko 2016 previously published a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in CD, identifying two studies for quantitative analysis. This analysis was limited to outcomes within the induction phase of vedolizumab treatment, specifically induction of remission, clinical response, and safety.

This updated review and analysis includes outcomes in both the induction and maintenance phases of vedolizumab in CD.

### Positioning therapies in the management of Crohn's disease [^1124vbTx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

In the past decade, several new therapies with different mechanisms of action have been approved for the management of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. However, there is limited guidance on the optimal positioning of agents as first- or second-line therapies because of the absence of head-to-head trials. Furthermore, given the lack of comparative studies, treatment guidelines have provided limited insight. In this review, we discuss data on key treatment attributes, comparative efficacy and safety, factors predictive of response to each agent, and propose an algorithm for positioning therapies for the management of patients with low-risk and high-risk Crohn's disease.

### Practical application of anti-TNF therapy for luminal Crohn's disease [^116PveDX]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy to treat inflammatory bowel disease has been available for more than a decade. Although extensive data on the outcomes of anti-TNF therapy from individual clinical trials and patient cohorts are available, integrated guidance on the best use of such therapy to achieve optimal clinical outcomes when managing patients with luminal Crohn's disease is lacking. This review combines published data to establish practical strategies for anti-TNF therapy regarding effective and safe timing of introduction, use of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, dose escalation, managing relapse, changing drugs, pregnancy and breastfeeding, and stopping drug treatment.

### Clinical insights into IL-23 inhibition: Risankizumab for Crohn's disease through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115ExKkw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with a rising global prevalence, affecting approximately 1 million individuals in the United States alone. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnosis is typically established through clinical evaluation, imaging studies, endoscopic procedures, and histological analysis. Patients with Crohn's disease often experience significantly lower health-related quality of life compared to healthy individuals, driven by factors such as disease activity, work disability, and frequent hospitalizations. Despite advances in treatment, many patients experience inadequate responses or intolerance to therapies, highlighting the need for more effective and targeted treatment options.

Treatment options for Crohn's disease include advanced biological therapies. Anti-TNF agents (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) are widely used for moderate-to-severe cases. Anti-integrin therapies, such as vedolizumab, block the migration of inflammatory cells and are associated with favorable safety profiles. Recently, interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors have emerged as promising alternatives. IL-23, part of the IL-12 cytokine family, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease by promoting T helper 17 cell differentiation and survival. These cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A and IL-22, which drive intestinal inflammation. Structurally, IL-23 comprises a unique p19 subunit and a shared p40 subunit with IL-12.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: Evaluating response to empiric anti-TNF dose intensification for secondary loss of response in Crohn's disease [^114buuq5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Despite the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents in Crohn's disease, up to 30% of patients exhibit primary non-response, with a further 46% of anti-TNF responders demonstrating features of secondary loss of response (LOR) within 12 months of anti-TNF initiation. Several studies have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of anti-TNF dose intensification to overcome LOR using dosing strategies including one or more of the following: shortening the interval between anti-TNF doses, increasing the baseline anti-TNF dose while maintaining the dosing interval, and anti-TNF re-induction.

Two recent systematic reviews, one of which also undertook a meta-analysis, evaluated the clinical effectiveness of anti-TNF dose intensification to address LOR across Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While comprehensive in their approach, neither review distinguished between anti-TNF dose intensification undertaken to address secondary LOR and anti-TNF dose intensification undertaken to address pooled primary non-response and secondary LOR. It is, however, important to differentiate between both of these entities, given the disparate clinical effectiveness of anti-TNF dose intensification between primary responders and primary non-responders. Thus, targeted evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of anti-TNF dose intensification to address secondary LOR is needed.

Moreover, amid the growing use of intensified anti-TNF dosing to address LOR in Crohn's disease, it remains important that clinicians recognize that a subset of patients may not respond or fail to demonstrate improvement with this strategy.

### From historical perspectives to modern therapy: a review of current and future biological treatments for Crohn's disease [^114ukRvT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a debilitating, systemic inflammatory disorder with both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Its existence predates modern medicine, but its precise etiology remains incompletely understood. Most authorities suggest a multifactorial pathogenesis due to a mixture of genetic disorders, immunologic dysregulation, microbiota disequilibrium, and environmental influences. Of these factors, the overactive immunologic response seen in CD appears to be the most promising target of medical therapy. Biological agents comprise a relatively new class of drugs that can induce and maintain remission in moderate to severe CD, as well as in ulcerative colitis.

This review provides an overview of CD, its history, clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment options, focusing on future biological agents with an emphasis on drug development, dosage, and administration.

### Comparative effectiveness of immunosuppressants and biologics for inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn's disease: a network meta-analysis [^114d5JW2]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

There is controversy regarding the best treatment for patients with Crohn's disease because of the lack of direct comparative trials. We compared therapies for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease based on direct and indirect evidence.

- **Methods**: We performed systematic reviews of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases through June 2014. We identified 39 randomized controlled trials comparing methotrexate, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, vedolizumab, or combined therapies with placebo or an active agent for induction and maintenance of remission in adult patients with Crohn's disease. Pairwise treatment effects were estimated through a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis and reported as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% credible interval (CrI).

- **Results**: Infliximab, the combination of infliximab and azathioprine (infliximab + azathioprine), adalimumab, and vedolizumab were superior to placebo for induction of remission. In pair-wise comparisons of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, infliximab + azathioprine (OR, 3.1; 95% CrI, 1.4–7.7) and adalimumab (OR, 2.1; 95% CrI, 1.0–4.6) were superior to certolizumab for induction of remission. All treatments were superior to placebo for maintaining remission except for the combination of infliximab and methotrexate. Adalimumab, infliximab, and infliximab + azathioprine were superior to azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine: adalimumab (OR, 2.9; 95% CrI, 1.6–5.1) and infliximab (OR, 1.6; 95% CrI, 1.0–2.5).

The consistent superiority of these treatments offers insights into recommending immunosuppressive therapy for Crohn's disease patients to maintain remission.

### Role in calcineurin inhibitors for inflammatory bowel disease in the biologics era: when and how to use [^111vLa4q]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease, are chronic, relapsing, and remitting inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Over the last 30 years, therapy for patients with refractory inflammatory bowel diseases has remained challenging despite obvious reductions in morbidity and mortality rates. The conventional management with corticosteroids has been modified by the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors and biologics. This review focuses on the role of calcineurin inhibitors for patients with inflammatory bowel disease in current clinical practice.

### Characterizing unmet medical need and the potential role of new biologic treatment options in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and clinician surveys [^113k51HX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Clinician response to treatment failure

UK clinicians estimated that in patients with first-line treatment failure who showed signs of a reduced response, approximately 25% would receive an additional non-biologic treatment such as corticosteroids. The dose of the existing biologic therapy would be increased in 21–24% of cases, and the administration frequency would be increased in 17–25% of cases. Surgery would be offered as a treatment option in 20–22% of cases.

When treatment alternatives were limited to surgery or a switch to a second-line biologic, UK clinicians estimated that among UC patients failing IFX as a first-line anti-TNFα agent, approximately 50% would switch to ADA as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, while the other 50% would opt for surgery. Similarly, among ADA failures, around 50% would switch to IFX as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, and 50% would pursue surgery.

For CD patients failing IFX, clinicians estimated that around 70% would switch to ADA as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, with the remaining 30% opting for surgery. For ADA failures, around 50% would switch to IFX as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, and 50% would resort to surgery.

French clinicians estimated that among patients with first-line treatment failure or a reduced response, around 18–39% would receive an additional non-biologic treatment, such as corticosteroids. Approximately 12–33% would receive an increased dose of the existing anti-TNFα agent, and administration frequency would be increased in around 9–27% of patients.

### Update in medical treatment of Crohn's disease [^114ZfaTb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disorder that has no known cause. The goal of medical treatment is to control active disease, induce and maintain clinical remission, and treat complications. Anti-inflammatory medications and immunomodulatory therapies are the primary treatment modalities for Crohn's disease. The categories of standard treatment include 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and immunomodulators. New biologic therapy has been developed to better target the immune mediators that are active in Crohn's disease. Infliximab is the first of the biologic agents approved for the treatment of fistulizing and active Crohn's disease. Despite medical advances in treatment, there is still no cure for Crohn's disease.

### Treat to target: A proposed new paradigm for the management of Crohn's disease [^114TXkii]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The traditional management of Crohn's disease, based on progressive, step-wise treatment intensification with re-evaluation of response according to symptoms, does not improve long-term outcomes of the disease. It places patients at risk for bowel damage. The introduction of novel therapies and the development of new approaches to treatment in rheumatoid arthritis have led to better patient outcomes. Prominent among these is a "treat to target" strategy, which involves regular assessment of disease activity using objective clinical and biological outcome measures and the subsequent adjustment of treatments. This approach complements the concept of early intervention in high-risk patients. This review evaluates literature on this topic and proposes a definition for the concept of treating to targets for Crohn's disease.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of biologic therapies for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1133JYBs]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Data are needed to inform the positioning of biologic therapy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, both as a first-line treatment and after previous biologic exposure. We aimed to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of biologics in patients with Crohn's disease.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 randomized controlled trials done in adults (≥ 18 years) with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 220–450). These patients were treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, anti-integrin, anti-interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23p40, or anti-IL23p19 agents, either alone or in combination with immunosuppressants. They were used as a first-line biologic or after previous biologic exposure, compared with placebo or an active comparator. The minimum duration of therapy was 14 days for trials reporting induction of remission in active disease and 22 weeks in trials reporting maintenance of remission. We searched Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings, trial registries, and unpublished data from inception to June 3, 2021, without any language restrictions. Summary estimates of the primary and secondary outcomes were extracted from the published reports; individual patient-level data were not sought. The primary endpoint was the induction of clinical remission in patients with active disease (CDAI < 150) and maintenance of remission in patients with a response to induction therapy, with data extracted from published reports. A network meta-analysis with multivariate approaches provided the comparative assessment.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in Crohn's disease and the effect on surgery rates [^1177TUKi]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Previous studies have not unambiguously been able to show a reduction in surgery after therapy with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). To our knowledge, this is the largest study on the real-life use of TNFi and surgery in Crohn's disease. A majority of patients (62%) continued on TNFi for 12 months or more, and this was associated with a reduced rate of surgery compared to drug survival of TNFi less than 12 months.

### Anti-TNF treatment in Crohn's disease: Toward tailored therapy [^112yZM1F]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Infliximab is a potent therapy for the induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Unfortunately, many patients lose response and/or develop allergic reactions caused by the chimeric antibody. By measuring the presence of antibodies against infliximab and the trough levels of the drug, it seems easier to predict whether patients will respond to intensified dose regimens or will benefit from a switch to alternative agents.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^1131zias]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Maintenance of clinical remission: In this pooled analysis of three studies (894 participants), 42.5% (253/595) of participants receiving vedolizumab maintained clinical remission compared to 27.1% (81/299) of participants receiving placebo at one year among participants with Crohn's Disease (CD) who had developed a clinical response to vedolizumab induction therapy (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.87; NNTB 7; Analysis 2.1).

We performed subgroup analysis according to prior anti‐TNF alpha failure. There were no subgroup differences between groups (P = 0.26). In those who had previously failed TNF inhibitor therapy (462 participants), maintenance of remission may be more likely in participants receiving vedolizumab compared to those receiving placebo (36.8% with vedolizumab versus 18.8% with placebo; RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.58; NNTB 6; Analysis 2.1). In those who had not failed TNF inhibitor therapy (432 participants), vedolizumab may be superior to placebo in maintaining clinical remission (49.1% with vedolizumab versus 34.8% with placebo; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.80; NNTB 8; Analysis 2.1).

When we used a fixed-effect method of analysis, our conclusions remained the same. All studies were at low risk of bias and had less than 10% loss to follow-up, so these prespecified sensitivity analyses were not performed.

### Effects of ustekinumab on histologic disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease [^115qN1up]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Although ustekinumab is an effective therapy for moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD), its effects on the microscopic manifestations of CD are unknown.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the effects of ustekinumab on histologic CD activity in an analysis of data from 251 participants in phase 3 induction and maintenance studies. Two endoscopic biopsy samples were collected at weeks 0, 8, and 44 from the ileum, splenic flexure, and rectum, resulting in 18 biopsy samples from each patient. Histologic activity was assessed based on global histology activity scores (GHASs).

- **Results**: At week 8, the mean GHAS was significantly reduced after ustekinumab induction treatment (from 10.4 ± 7.0 to 7.1 ± 5.9; P < .001), but not in patients who received placebo (from 9.2 ± 6.4 to 7.8 ± 6.2). At week 44, in the randomized maintenance therapy population, the mean GHAS remained reduced from week 8 in patients who received subcutaneous ustekinumab (90 mg every 8 weeks; from 7.4 ± 7.7 to 6.1 ± 4.7), but not every 12 weeks (from 5.3 ± 3.9 to 8.7 ± 4.1) or placebo (from 9.2 ± 3.8 to 10.9 ± 7.1). In the pooled (randomized and non-randomized) maintenance therapy population, histologic improvement continued in patients given ustekinumab every 8 weeks (from 7.1 ± 6.2 to 5.2 ± 4.2; P < .0001), but not in those given ustekinumab every 12 weeks (from 6.1 ± 5.7 to 7.2 ± 5.1) or placebo (from 8.2 ± 4.2 to 8.9 ± 6.8). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved histologic response (≥ 50% decrease in GHAS from baseline) at week 44 if they received ustekinumab every 8 weeks.

### Vedolizumab for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^116fdTKV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Serious adverse events

All four studies recorded the proportion of participants who developed any serious adverse event. For the development of one or more serious adverse events during induction therapy, there was no evidence of a difference between groups (9.0% with vedolizumab versus 9.2% with placebo; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.33; 1126 participants; Analysis 1.4). When we used a fixed‐effect method of analysis, our conclusions remained the same. We did not perform other preplanned sensitivity analyses.

- **Surgery**: No studies reported the proportion of participants requiring surgery during the induction phase.

- **Endoscopic remission**: No studies reported endoscopic remission during the induction phase.

- **Endoscopic response**: No studies reported endoscopic response during the induction phase.

Maintenance studies

Three studies compared vedolizumab to a placebo for the maintenance of remission in CD (Sandborn 2013 – Maintenance Phase; Vermeire 2021; Watanabe 2020 – Maintenance Phase). Vermeire 2021 used subcutaneous vedolizumab whilst Sandborn 2013 – Maintenance Phase and Watanabe 2020 – Maintenance Phase used IV vedolizumab. Outcomes were recorded between weeks 52 and 60.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of the anti-mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 monoclonal antibody ontamalimab (SHP647) for the treatment of Crohn's disease: The OPERA II study [^111L2fMQ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Approved biologics for the treatment of CD include the anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol (in the United States only); the anti-integrin antibody vedolizumab; and the anti-IL12/23 antibody ustekinumab. These agents have provided a significant advance in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe CD that does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy and who are dependent on glucocorticoids. However, for a substantial proportion of patients, primary non-response to these agents and loss of response over time remain significant challenges. Because of this, and concerns regarding the safety of anti-TNF agents and conventional therapies, there is an unmet need for novel therapies with good safety profiles and durable efficacy.

### Vedolizumab versus ustekinumab in Crohn's disease with prior anti-tumor necrosis factor failure: An updated meta-analysis [^114QQZaH]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Ustekinumab and vedolizumab are key treatment options for Crohn's disease patients who fail anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. This updated meta-analysis aims to compare the efficacy and safety of these two drugs. We performed a systematic review in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, searching for randomized and nonrandomized studies comparing vedolizumab versus ustekinumab in patients with Crohn's disease with previous anti-TNF failure or intolerance.

The primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission (SFR) at the post-induction (12–16 weeks) and maintenance period (48–52 weeks). The odds ratio (OR) was used for binary outcomes with their respective 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I² statistics. This meta-analysis included 11 studies and 2,724 patients. There was a significant difference favoring ustekinumab in SFR at post-induction (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11–1.88; P = 0.006; I² = 27%) and maintenance periods (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.23–2.82; P = 0.003; I² = 80%), in clinical remission at the post-induction period (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.58–2.63; P < 0.001; I² = 3%), and in treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.16–0.60; P < 0.001; I² = 0%).

In patients with Crohn's disease with prior anti-TNF failure, ustekinumab showed higher SFR during both the post-induction and maintenance periods and a lower rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events.

### Ustekinumab dose escalation improves clinical responses in refractory Crohn's disease [^114yUT61]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Our results indicate that dose escalation to every 4 weeks should be considered for Crohn's disease patients who do not achieve remission by 16 weeks on the standard every 8 weeks dosing. Given the relative safety of this drug and its efficacy in anti-TNF-experienced patients, we propose that clinicians resist changing to alternative biologic therapies until a trial of every 4 weeks dosing is attempted.

### Reliability and responsiveness of clinical and endoscopic outcome measures in Crohn's disease [^116YSTuC]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Regulatory guidance for Crohn's disease trials recommends coprimary efficacy endpoints that evaluate both symptoms and mucosal inflammation. This study aimed to characterize the operating properties of commonly used disease activity assessments when used alone and in combination.

Endoscopic and clinical data were available for 129 participants from the Study of Biologic and Immunomodulator Naïve Patients in Crohn's Disease trial. Readers scored the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease and the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity using standardized conventions. Index reliability was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients, and index responsiveness was assessed using standardized effect sizes based on treatment assignment. Outcomes were evaluated in terms of their optimal sensitivity to the treatment effect.

Substantial inter-rater reliability was observed when the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease and Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity were used as continuous measures (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.50–0.73; and 0.62 95% CI, 0.36–0.77) compared with moderate reliability when dichotomized (0.46; 95% CI, 0.26–0.65; and 0.51; 95% CI, 0.00–0.78).

The Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease, Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity, patient-reported outcome-2, and Crohn's Disease Activity Index were similarly responsive (standardized effect size, 0.43, 95% CI, 0.05–0.81; 0.38, 95% CI, 0.0–0.76; 0.53, 95% CI, 0.15–0.91).

### Response to placebo, measured by endoscopic evaluation of Crohn's disease activity, in a pooled analysis of data from 5 randomized controlled induction trials [^1128Nm1P]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Endoscopy is used to measure the activity of Crohn's disease (CD) and determine the eligibility and outcomes of participants in randomized controlled trials of therapeutic agents. We aimed to estimate the rate of response to placebo in trials, based on the endoscopic evaluation of CD activity, and identify factors that affect this response.

Methods - **Patient-level data collection**: We collected patient-level data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of therapeutic agents for CD that included centrally-read endoscopic assessments with validated scoring indices. We analyzed data from induction trials of eldelumab, filgotinib, risankizumab, and ustekinumab (from 188 patients given placebo).

- **Primary and secondary outcomes**: The primary outcome was the rate of response to placebo, based on endoscopic assessment of CD activity (> 50% reduction in the simple endoscopic score for CD). Rate of remission, based on the endoscopic score, was a secondary outcome.

- **Statistical analysis**: Overall rates of response to placebo were calculated using the inverse variance-weighted average method and presented with 95% CIs. We performed a multi-variable meta-regression analysis to identify determinants of response to placebo, assessed endoscopically, using patient-level data from the filgotinib and ustekinumab trials.

Results - **Response and remission rates**: The pooled rate of response among patients given placebo was 16.2% (95% CI, 10.5%-22.0%) and the rate of remission in this group was 5.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-8.8%).

- **Determinants of response**: Prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10–0.93; p = 0.036) and increased concentration of C-reactive protein at baseline (odds ratio, 0.93).

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^1127Mtvy]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

- **Ustekinumab**

- **Statement 47**: We recommend that ustekinumab can be used in the induction and maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease, both in anti-TNF naïve patients and in those where anti-TNF treatment fails. No direct comparison data are available with other biological therapies (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.7%).

Ustekinumab is an anti-IL12/23 p40 antibody and has been evaluated in the UNITI and IM-UNITI studies in patients with Crohn's disease. UNITI-1 enrolled patients who had prior anti-TNF failure (primary or secondary loss of response or intolerance). Clinical response at week 8 was 37.8% in those receiving ustekinumab 6 mg/kg (p < 0.001 vs placebo), 33.5% with 130 mg (p = 0.001 vs placebo), and 20.2% with placebo. UNITI-2 enrolled patients who had no previous failure with anti-TNF drugs (mostly anti-TNF naïve, but a small number with previous successful use of anti-TNF therapy). Clinical response at week 8 was 57.9% for 6 mg/kg, 47.4% for 130 mg, and 32.1% for placebo (p < 0.001 vs both doses). Responders from both studies at week 8 were randomized to the IM-UNITI maintenance arm. Of these randomized responders, 53.1% treated with 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks (p = 0.005 vs placebo), 48.8% given 90 mg subcutaneously 12-weekly (p = 0.04 vs placebo), and 35.9% on placebo were in remission at 44 weeks. In total, 45% of those randomized to IM-UNITI were anti-TNF refractory. Of these, 41.1% were in remission at week 44 on ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously 8-weekly compared with 26.2% on placebo (p = 0.10).

### Ustekinumab induction and maintenance therapy in refractory Crohn's disease [^117EUb9G]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with Crohn's disease, the efficacy of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, is unknown.

- **Methods**: We evaluated ustekinumab in adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease that was resistant to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment. During induction, 526 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ustekinumab (at a dose of 1, 3, or 6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo at week 0. During the maintenance phase, 145 patients who had a response to ustekinumab at 6 weeks underwent a second randomization to receive subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab (90 mg) or placebo at weeks 8 and 16. The primary endpoint was a clinical response at 6 weeks.

- **Results**: The proportions of patients who reached the primary endpoint were 36.6%, 34.1%, and 39.7% for 1, 3, and 6 mg of ustekinumab per kilogram, respectively, as compared with 23.5% for placebo (P = 0.005 for the comparison with the 6-mg group). The rate of clinical remission with the 6-mg dose did not differ significantly from the rate with placebo at 6 weeks. Maintenance therapy with ustekinumab, as compared with placebo, resulted in significantly increased rates of clinical remission (41.7% vs. 27.4%, P = 0.03) and response (69.4% vs. 42.5%, P < 0.001) at 22 weeks. Serious infections occurred in 7 patients (6 receiving ustekinumab) during induction and 11 patients (4 receiving ustekinumab) during maintenance. Basal-cell carcinoma developed in 1 patient receiving ustekinumab.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease that was resistant to anti-TNF treatment showed variable clinical responses to ustekinumab.

### Higher ustekinumab levels in maintenance therapy are associated with greater mucosal healing and mucosal response in Crohn's disease: An experience of 2 IBD centers [^114GKfhc]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Studies indicate that 10% to 30% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have no initial response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, and over 50% of those who respond initially will lose response over time (secondary loss of response). Previously, research has shown that the serum concentration of anti-TNF biologic therapies is dose-proportionate; this suggests an association between serum anti-TNF concentration level or neutralizing antibodies and objective endoscopic mucosal response. Numerous studies report target trough levels of infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab to achieve mucosal healing (MH), and some data investigate the relationship between trough levels and outcomes with vedolizumab, an anti-integrin therapy. In contrast, there are few data supporting a correlation between serum ustekinumab levels and MH.

The STARDUST randomized control trial studies standard care compared with treat-to-target ustekinumab therapy. It has reported preliminary data at 1-year showing the superiority of treat-to-target therapy in achieving an endoscopic response. The aim of our study was to determine whether dose escalation and higher ustekinumab levels may benefit patients with Crohn's disease who have not achieved mucosal healing. In our observational cohort of patients with Crohn's disease on maintenance ustekinumab, 63.8% of patients (n = 30 of 47) had achieved MH at the time of the level assay, and 85.1% (n = 40 of 47) had achieved at least a mucosal response (MR). Seven patients exhibited nonresponse to ustekinumab dosing at the time of analysis. Our patient cohort was largely biologic-experienced, and a high proportion of patients with Crohn's disease exhibited advanced luminal disease.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease [^116S8kQ2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

We believe that, overall, there appears to be disagreement as to whether top-down therapy provides a benefit over step-up therapy in achieving clinical outcomes in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the lack of more rigorously conducted studies, using objective biomarkers and assessment of mucosal healing, makes it difficult to identify the efficacy of the three treatment paradigms. While there are differences in Crohn's disease in pediatric patients, this may be an extension of the evidence showing inconclusive results for top-down therapy in affecting the natural course of Crohn's disease in the pediatric population.

Even though this appraisal may be of some merit in providing insights into the evidence of top-down treatment regimens, it has its own limitations. Firstly, the lack of standardization between studies creates a challenge when one attempts to compare results. The differences in medication type, dosage, combination, and timing were all variable; therefore, only a limited comparison of the studies can be made as regards the broad concept of top-down therapy.

For instance, the variety of treatment regimens used by different health centers (early combined immunosuppression, early biologic, and early immunomodulatory therapy), as well as differences in endpoints for assessing treatment efficacy (inducing remission or reduction in surgical rates), limit the value of any comparisons. Other factors, such as the clinical heterogeneity of early- and late-onset disease (pediatric versus adult), may also have affected the responses to treatment.

### Characterizing unmet medical need and the potential role of new biologic treatment options in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and clinician surveys [^115DHr7T]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Rate and timing of therapy failure**: When asked to estimate treatment failure based on their own experience, UK clinicians estimated that 18–26% of patients fail and discontinue therapy with a first-line anti-TNFα agent during the induction phase (primary failure), and that 22–26% lose response and discontinue that anti-TNFα agent over time; this is termed secondary failure of the first-line anti-TNFα agent. Estimates of treatment failure were even higher for second-line treatment with an anti-TNFα agent: 28–37% of patients fail and discontinue treatment during the induction phase, and 31–41% lose response and discontinue their second-line anti-TNFα agent treatment over time. Among patients who lost response, it was estimated that 68–77% of patients discontinued treatment by the end of the first year, and 82–90% discontinued treatment by the end of the second year of treatment due to loss of response.

- **Figure 2 description**: Treatment failure during anti-TNFα therapy as estimated by UK clinicians. Estimates of treatment failure are consistently lower for first-line biologic therapy (black boxes) compared with second-line biologic therapy (grey boxes) in patients with UC and CD, based on the experience of UK gastroenterologists.
