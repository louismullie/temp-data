## Question

167. House Number. One person said that his friend's house is located on a long street (and on the side where the house is located, the houses are numbered in order: $1,2,3$ and so on) and that the sum of the house numbers from the beginning of the street to his friend's house is the same as the sum of the house numbers from his friend's house to the end of the street. It is also known that on the side of the street where the friend's house is located, there are more than 50 but fewer than 500 houses.

What is the house number where the friend of the storyteller lives?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the house number where the sum of house numbers from the beginning of the street to that house equals the sum of house numbers from that house to the end of the street, with the total number of houses between 50 and 500. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about translating the word problem into a mathematical equation. Then, I should simplify that equation to find a relationship between the house number and the total number of houses. Next, I will derive a general formula and check for constraints that make the solution unique. After that, I will test candidate values within the 50 to 500 house range to find the valid house number. Finally, I will verify the arithmetic to ensure correctness and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first translate the condition into math. If the friend's house number is k and the total number of houses is n, then the sum from 1 to k equals the sum from k to n, which I can write as 1 + 2 +… + k = k + (k+1) +… + n. Wait, let me verify the right-hand side: it should indeed start at k and go to n, inclusive, so the formulation is correct [^notfound].

> I will now simplify the left side using the formula for the sum of the first k integers, which is k(k+1)/2. For the right side, I can express it as the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to k-1, so that equals n(n+1)/2 − (k−1)k/2. Hold on, I should double-check that subtraction: yes, removing the first k−1 terms leaves the sum from k to n, so the equation becomes k(k+1)/2 = n(n+1)/2 − (k−1)k/2 [^notfound].

> Next, I should rearrange the equation to isolate k. Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear denominators gives k(k+1) = n(n+1) − (k−1)k. Expanding the right side yields k(k+1) = n(n+1) − k^2 + k. Bringing all terms to one side, I get k^2 + k + k^2 − k − n(n+1) = 0, which simplifies to 2k^2 − n(n+1) = 0. Wait, I initially thought I could factor this as a quadratic in k, but I should correct that: it's already a quadratic in k, so solving for k gives k^2 = n(n+1)/2, and therefore k = sqrt[n(n+1)/2]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify the algebra again: yes, 2k^2 = n(n+1) implies k = sqrt[n(n+1)/2], which is the correct relationship [^notfound].

> Now, I need to ensure k is an integer, because house numbers must be whole numbers. That means n(n+1)/2 must be a perfect square. Let me think about this constraint: n(n+1)/2 is the nth triangular number, so I am looking for a triangular number that is also a perfect square, with n strictly between 50 and 500. I should confirm that such numbers exist and then find the smallest one in range. The sequence of triangular squares begins with 1, 36, 1225, 41616, etc., so the corresponding n values are 1, 8, 49, 288, etc. Given the bound 50 < n < 500, the candidate is n = 288, which gives the triangular square 41616 [^notfound].

> Let me calculate k explicitly. With n = 288, I have k = sqrt[288 × 289 / 2] = sqrt[144 × 289] = 12 × 17 = 204. I should double-check that 288 × 289 / 2 equals 144 × 289, which is indeed 41616, and the square root of 41616 is 204, so k = 204 is correct [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the original condition with these numbers. The sum from 1 to 204 is 204 × 205 / 2 = 20910. The sum from 204 to 288 is the sum from 1 to 288 minus the sum from 1 to 203, which is 288 × 289 / 2 − 203 × 204 / 2 = 41616 − 20706 = 20910. The two sums match, so the condition is satisfied. I should also confirm that 50 < 288 < 500, which it is, so the solution is valid within the stated constraints [^notfound].

> Therefore, the house number where the friend lives is 204. I need to ensure there are no other solutions in the specified range; given the spacing of triangular squares, the next candidate n would be 1681, which is far beyond 500, so 204 is the unique answer in the given interval [^notfound].

The house number is **204**. This is the only solution where the sum of house numbers from 1 to 204 equals the sum from 204 to 288, and the total number of houses (288) is between 50 and 500 [^notfound].

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let:

- (n) = total number of houses on the street
- (k) = house number of the friend's house

The condition is that the sum of house numbers from 1 to (k) equals the sum from (k) to (n):

[
\\sum_{i = 1}^{k} i = \\sum_{i = k}^{n} i
]

Using the formula for the sum of the first (m) integers, (\\sum_{i = 1}^{m} i = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}), we rewrite the equation as:

[
\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \\frac{(k-1)k}{2}
]

Simplifying:

[
k(k+1) = n(n+1) - (k-1)k
]

[
k^2 + k = n^2 + n - k^2 + k
]

[
2k^2 = n^2 + n
]

[
k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
]

Thus, (k) is the square root of the (n)-th triangular number, and (n(n+1)/2) must be a perfect square.

---

## Finding the solution within the given range

We need (n) such that (50 < n < 500) and (n(n+1)/2) is a perfect square. Testing triangular numbers in this range, the only perfect square is **41616**, which corresponds to (n = 288):

[
\\frac{288 \\times 289}{2} = 41616 = 204^2
]

Therefore, (k = 204).

---

## Verification

- **Sum from 1 to 204**: (\\frac{204 \\times 205}{2} = 20910)
- **Sum from 204 to 288**: (\\frac{288 \\times 289}{2} - \\frac{203 \\times 204}{2} = 41616–20706 = 20910)

The sums are equal, confirming the solution.

The house number is **204**.

### Prevalence and causes of visual impairment in a Brazilian population: the botucatu eye study [^826a3fb5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

The IBGE divided the city into census sectors and households were identified within each block and enumerated in sequence to cover the entire urban area. The households were to be examined were selected using a random start point with a household cluster sampling technique. Households were identified systematically according to local census data: the first house was selected randomly; the next house was the seventh house on the even-numbered side of the street and so on, successively until the pre-determined number of households in each census sector had been reached. The number of households in each sector was determined based on the proportion of people in that sector compared to the total Botacatu population.

Each of the selected households received a letter of invitation to participate in the study, which was followed by a field worker visit. Those who agreed to participate were contacted by telephone to schedule an appointment at the Botucatu School of Medicine University Hospital, where all of the examinations were conducted. All persons of the household were eligible to participate in the study if it was their usual place of residence (by self-report) and they had attained the age of 1 year. If there was no answer when the examiners contacted the household or if people refused to participate in the research, the first house to the right was selected. If the next household refused to participate, the first house to the left of the initial house was selected, and so on, successively. After inviting 1,000 households to participate in the survey (approximately 3 300 people), 2 485 individuals or 75.3% of the potential sample participated. The demographics of the examined population were compared to those of the entire Botacatu population at the time of the census.

Data collection

The data were collected from participants during household visits. Study Executive Committee randomly selected streets for household visits in each city (country) applying stratified random cluster sampling procedure. Each city administrative district was divided into squares (on the map). 93 streets in each city were necessary to recruit 10 participants from a street (930 participants in total). The relevant number of streets in each district was determined proportionally to the district population. If the number of streets selected in a certain district was not a whole number, it was rounded down to the integer below, and additional number of streets (for the total number of 93) was obtained from the district(s), chosen randomly. A similar strategy was applied to map squares within districts, and the average number of streets per square to be sampled was determined. The streets within each map square for sampling were selected randomly by the Study Executive Committee.

Investigators (interviewers) performed household visits to collect the data. The interviewers visited households sequentially, starting with the 1st apartment of the 1st number of the house in the selected street, and continuing in ascending order. Data were collected from 10 subjects per street, and stratification by age was applied: 5 subjects aged 18–39 years old and 5 subjects aged ≥40 years old from the selected street were enrolled. When the potential participant was not available during the visit of interviewer, the interviewer performed up to three additional visits after 6 p.m. on working days and during all day on weekends.

At every household the interviewers assessed eligibility of all inhabitants. Participants who consented and were eligible for the study provided their socio-demographic information and medical history, underwent weight/height measurement and completed the study questionnaires, as described previously.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^02ccabf5]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Healthy Housing Reference Manual—19th-century tenement housing conditions are outlined, noting that children had a one in six chance of dying before the age of 1 year. In the report, 50 recommendations were made, including recommendations for protecting school children by ventilation and sanitation of school buildings, emphasizing town planning and controlling overcrowded tenements and cellar dwellings. The term “tenement house” was first used in America and dates from the mid-nineteenth century; the author noted that in the larger cities of the United States, the apartment house emerged in the 1830s as a housing unit of two to five stories, with each story containing apartments of two to four rooms, and the tenement house emerged in the 1830s when landlords converted warehouses into inexpensive housing. These rear houses, although new, were no healthier than the front house, often housing up to 10 families. By 1850 in New York and Boston, each tenement housed an average of 65 people. During the 1850s, the railroad house or railroad tenement was introduced; the structure was typically 90 feet long and had 12 to 16 rooms, each about 6 feet by 6 feet and holding around four people, and the facility allowed no direct light or air into rooms except those facing the street or alley.

### House modifications for preventing malaria [^fe54c79d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Malaria remains an important public health problem. Research in 1900 suggested house modifications may reduce malaria transmission. A previous version of this review concluded that house screening may be effective in reducing malaria. This update includes data from five new studies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of house modifications that aim to reduce exposure to mosquitoes on malaria disease and transmission.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) up to 25 May 2022. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry to identify ongoing trials up to 25 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross-over studies, and stepped-wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi-experimental trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non-randomized cross-over studies. We sought studies investigating primary construction and house modifications to existing homes reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We extracted any entomological outcomes that were also reported in these studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

One RCT and six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, with an additional six ongoing RCTs. We did not identify any eligible non-randomized studies. All included trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa since 2009; two randomized by household and four at the block or village level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings, or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with roof modification or eave tube installation (an insecticidal "lure and kill" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In one trial, the screening material was treated with 2% permethrin insecticide. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. A community-based approach was adopted in the other trial. Overall, the implementation of house modifications probably reduced malaria parasite prevalence (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82; 5 trials, 5183 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), although an inconsistent effect was observed in a subpopulation of children in one study. House modifications reduced moderate to severe anaemia prevalence (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89; 3 trials, 3643 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no consistent effect on clinical malaria incidence, with rate ratios ranging from 0.38 to 1.62 (3 trials, 3365 participants, 4126.6 person-years). House modifications may reduce indoor mosquito density (rate ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.30; 4 trials, 9894 household-nights; low-certainty evidence), although two studies showed little effect on this parameter.

Authors' Conclusions

House modifications - largely screening, sometimes combined with insecticide and lure and kill devices - were associated with a reduction in malaria parasite prevalence and a reduction in people with anaemia. Findings on malaria incidence were mixed. Modifications were also associated with lower indoor adult mosquito density, but this effect was not present in some studies.

### The Nigerian national blindness and visual impairment survey: rationale, objectives and detailed methodology [^a934246d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Enumeration protocol

Enumerators worked in pairs from the random start. Enumeration proceeded systematically wherein an advance team of supervisors first visited households where they interviewed family members to identify households with eligible individuals and allocated a survey house number. The core field investigators went house- to- house completing the enumeration details of each eligible individual after obtaining informed consent. In urban clusters, identification of the streets/blocks was derived from municipal maps provided by the State governments. If a house was locked at the first visit, information was given to the neighbours that the team would return later in the day. Repeat visits were made the same day to gather information about the locked house. If contact could not be established after two visits the household was categorised as a non- responding household.

The process of enumeration was continued until 50 subjects aged 40 years and above had been enrolled. If the last household had more than one eligible individual, all were included even if the total exceeded 50. At the central examination site, age was verified once again against an events calendar (Table 2), and if a person was thought to be below the age of 40 years, he/she was examined but not included in the survey sample.

Table 2 
Events calendar used to determine age of subjects in 2005

Typically 2–3 days were required for each cluster. When clusters were close to each other, an advanced team of enumerators started work in the next cluster on the 2 nd day of the clinical examination so that such cluster could be completed in two days. However, if clusters were far apart, the entire team stayed in the cluster which meant that 3 days were required.

Ethical Approval

The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Health.

Informed Consent

Informed consent was obtained from the head of the household and all adult respondents at the time of enumeration. The objectives of the survey and the examination process were explained to those eligible in the local dialect, in the presence of a witness. A subject was examined only after informed consent was obtained. In case of children, consent was obtained from a responsible adult household member.

Urban Sampling

In each of the two urban areas we obtained a listing of all wards, stratified by high and low density. Wards were selected based on density at a rate proportional to the relative density of the population within each ward. In Harare 29 % of wards are low density so we randomly selected 3 (30 %) of the wards from the population of all low density wards. The remaining 7 (70 %) were selected from the high density wards. Similarly, in Bulawayo 18 % of wards are low density so 2 (20 %) of the 10 wards were selected from low density wards while the remaining 8 (80 %) were selected from among the high density wards. Within each of the 10 selected wards in each urban study site, we selected two start points for sampling housing units. Wards were segmented into grid squares, two grid squares were randomly selected, a street was randomly selected within each selected grid, and a house was randomly selected on the street as a start point. After selecting the first house, every sixth house along the same side of the street was selected. If the end of the street or border of the ward was reached, interviewers went a block over and continued the selection of houses along another street, until the target numbers were achieved. The sampling was coordinated in order to select and interview approximately equal numbers of participants across the selected wards, with equal numbers originating from each start point.

### House modifications for preventing malaria [^dfdaa9d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites.

Objectives

To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross-over studies, and stepped-wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi-experimental trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non-randomized cross-over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub-Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a "lure and kill" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide-based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person-years; low-certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence). Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from -0.46 to 2.41; low-certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low-certainty evidence). Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.

### Evaluation of an Australian indigenous housing programme: community level impact on crowding, infrastructure function and hygiene [^f92d11af]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2011). Low credibility.

Results

At the time of the baseline surveys, 326 houses (51%) were identified from a total of 644 houses in the 10 communities as being the main place of residence of at least one child aged ≤7 years. The main householder in 285 (88%) of these houses was interviewed. In 10 (3%) houses the main householder declined to be interviewed and in 31 (11%) houses the main householder was away on each of three consecutive visits by the project team. A total of 618 children living in these 285 houses were recruited to the study.

At the follow-up surveys we were able to identify 208 houses where children recruited at baseline were now living. These houses were the main place of residence for 418 (68%) of the children originally recruited to the study. These 418 children make up the study cohort. They had been living in 185 houses at the time of the baseline surveys (figure 1).

Figure 1 
Crowding, house infrastructure and hygiene data at baseline and follow-up.

Of the 208 houses where these children were living at follow-up, 44 (21%) were new houses completed between the baseline and follow-up surveys.

Crowding data were available at baseline and follow-up for 327 (78%) children. At follow-up there was a small non-significant decrease in the mean number of people per bedroom sleeping in the house on the night before the survey (3.4, 95% CI 3.1 to 3.6 at baseline to 3.2, 95% CI 2.9 to 3.4 at follow-up; natural logarithm transformed t test, t=1.3, p=0.102). At baseline and follow-up surveys there was no significant change in the composition of households in terms of the numbers of younger and older children and adults.

### Falls and risk factors of falls for urban and rural community-dwelling older adults in China [^e68014b3]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data and sampling strategy

Data come from the 2010 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Survey on Urban and Rural Elderly, conducted by the Chinese Research Center on Aging (CRCA). Since 2000, the CRCA has started surveying community-dwelling rural and urban elders’ personal characteristics and a variety of issues including retirement and employment after retirement, social welfare and security, housing, community-based service programs and utilization, family networks and social participation, medical insurance and health programs, mental health and available psychological consulting services. The 2000 and 2006 waves did not include questions on older people’s fall related information. The 2010 wave is the first one that started collecting information on occurrences, incidence, circumstances, locations as well as consequences of elders’ falls. Based on the distribution of Chinese population aged 60 and over reported by the 2010 Census data, the survey applied multistage proportional random selection strategy to choose respondents from 20 (out of a total number of 31, excluding Hongkong, Macau and Taiwan areas) provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China. The 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities include Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi and Xinjiang. According to the 2010 Chinese Census data, 49.7% of the population lived in urban areas and the rest of 50.3% lived in rural areas. Thus, the 2010 Wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Survey on Urban and Rural Elderly sampled equivalent numbers of rural and urban elders. In each province, autonomous region and municipality, 500 rural and 500 urban respondents were interviewed. The sampling design is as follows: (1) Randomly choosing 4 cities or 4 counties in each province/autonomous region/municipality (in municipalities, districts are treated as equivalent to cities or counties); (2) In each city or county, randomly selecting 16 streets or villages; (3) In each street or village, randomly choosing 50 neighborhood or village committees; (4) In each neighborhood or village committee, randomly choosing 10 households with at least one senior aged 60 and over to participate the survey interview. Please see Fig. 1 for sampling scheme of the 2010 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Survey on Urban and Rural Elderly.

### The effect of eviction moratoria on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [^50df0e7f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Based on the eviction rate, a random sample of houses is chosen for eviction on the first day of each month, and these houses are then each “merged” with another randomly-chosen household that did not experience eviction. In a merged household, all members of the combined household are connected with edges of equal strength as they were to their original household members. A household can only be merged once.

Homelessness is another possible outcome of eviction. However, a number of studies of the homeless population show that doubling-up often precedes homelessness, with the vast majority of the homeless reporting being doubled-up prior to living in a shelter –. In the Fragile Families Study data described above, only ~17.4% reported having lived in a shelter, car, or abandoned building. We subsequently model the minority of evictions that result directly in homelessness. These evicted households instead enter a common pool with other homeless households, and, in addition to their existing household and external connections, are randomly connected to a subset of others in this pool, mimicking the high contact rates expected in shelters or encampments. We consider 10% of evicted households directly becoming homeless, and the other 90% doubling up. Individuals are assigned to ‘shelters’ of size drawn from a Poisson distribution with a mean of 20 and are connected to all other individuals in that shelter only. This number is estimated from considering both sheltered and unsheltered people, which each represent about half of the individuals experiencing homelessness. Data suggesting the average size of shelters is ~25 people, based on assuming ~half of the ~570 K homeless on any given night are distributed over 12 K US shelters, which is similar to a Lewer et al estimate for the UK (mean 34, median 21). Unsheltered individuals are expected to have less close, indoor contacts, bringing down the average, and the portion of unsheltered homeless may grow as shelters reach capacity. In the model, these connections get rewired each month, since the average duration of time spent in a single shelter is ~1 month. Contacts among homeless individuals are not reduced by social distancing policies. As a result, during the time evictions take place, the individual-level R 0 for the homeless is ~1.5-fold the pre-lockdown R 0 for the general population, similar to Lewer et al.

Definitions of terms related to chlorination—chlorine concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm), and in 1 million gallons of water a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm would require 8.34 pounds of 100% chlorine. For surface water systems, a contact time of 20 to 30 minutes is common. Parts per million is a weight-to-weight comparison in which 1 ppm equals 1 pound per million pounds and, because water weighs 8.34 pounds per gallon, it takes 8.34 pounds of any substance per million gallons to equal 1 ppm; in water chemistry, 1 ppm equals 1 mg/L. Residual is the amount of chlorine left after the demand is met and total available chlorine = free chlorine + combined chlorine. Breakpoint chlorination is described as a process sometimes used to ensure the presence of free chlorine in public water supplies by adding enough chlorine to satisfy the chlorine demand and to react with dissolved ammonia, and dosage is the total amount of chlorine added to water given in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).

### Healthy homes and communities: putting the pieces together [^b2c35099]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

This article reviews and updates the evidence base informing four recommendations of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission to Build a Healthier America (the commission) that address the creation of healthy, vital neighborhood and community environments.

Evidence Acquisition

Reviews of published research, consultation with experts in housing, community development policy, and site visits by the commission were conducted between 2006 and 2009. The literature reviews and national statistics were updated with publications appearing through the first half of 2010.

Evidence Synthesis

The physical, social, and economic environments of local communities affect residents' health and exacerbate health disparities. Public and private decision makers are increasingly recognizing the importance of investing in cross-cutting strategies to reduce exposures harmful to health and to establish conditions that support healthful daily practices. Pilot and demonstration projects that engage community members in identifying priorities and implementing interventions that improve health and quality of life show promise in terms of their overall impact and effect on health disparities.

Conclusions

Consistent with the broad policy directions outlined in the commission's recommendations, an effective population health improvement strategy requires enlisting new partners among public agencies including housing, transportation, recreation, community development, and planning, and joint efforts between private sector business and voluntary organizations. Evaluation research of community-based interventions is needed to generate strong evidence of impact in order to guide policy and secure future investments in such measures.

### Revised household-based microplanning in polio supplemental immunization activities in kano state, nigeria. 2013-2014 [^17405f0e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

There was an increase in the number of settlements in the master list from 20 388 to 28 084 (a 38% increase), a reduction in the number of households from 2 491 405 to 1 736 898 (a 30% reduction), and a reduction in target children from 6 087 511 to 2 807 551 (a 54% reduction) after the enumeration. The average number of households and target children allocated to the house to house teams after workload rationalization was reduced from 94 to 65 households (a 31% reduction) and from 231 to 106 target children (a 54% reduction) per team per day (Table 1).

Table 1. 
Key Process Output Before and After the Revised Household-Based Microplanning Process in Kano State, September 2013 and April 2014

Data from the validation process showed an increase in the numbers of households after revalidation from 21 653 to 22 138 (2% variance) and a reduction in the numbers of eligible children in the households from 33 788 to 33 201 (−2% variance) (Figure 1). The number of children vaccinated during the polio SIAs started declining in September 2013 when the revised microplanning intervention began, and this trend continued until March 2014. The trend stabilized in April 2014, with slight variations from one round of polio SIA to the next. A total of 6 499 164 children were vaccinated in September 2013, and this number decreased to 3 480 593 by April 2014 (46% reduction). During the April 2015 polio SIA, 3 525 562 children were vaccinated (Figure 2).

### Association of care environment with HIV incidence and death among orphaned, separated, and street-connected children and adolescents in Western Kenya [^5181bb39]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Table 1. 
Baseline Participant Characteristics

The median follow-up time was 6.2 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0-7.4 years) among all participants, 3.1 years (IQR, 1.0-7.0 years) among participants in institutional settings, 6.9 years (IQR, 2.3-7.4 years) among participants in family-based settings, and 6.5 years (IQR, 2.0-8.1 years) among participants in street settings. Details regarding participants unavailable for follow-up are summarized in eTable 2 in the Supplement.

At baseline, 77 participants (3.0%) had HIV-positive status, including 53 youths (4.3%) in institutional settings, 23 youths (1.9%) in family-based settings, and 1 youth (1.1%) in a street setting (Table 2). A total of 31 youths (1.2%) acquired HIV infection during the study, 28 youths (1.1%) died, and 51 youths (2.0%) acquired HIV infection or died during the study (Figure). The HIV incidence was 2.06 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 1.1-3.0 cases per 1000 person-years) for the total cohort, 2.2 cases per 1000 person years (95% CI, 0.5-3.8 cases per 1000 person-years) for youths in institutional settings, 1.2 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.2-2.1 cases per 1000 person-years) for youths in family-based settings, and 15.5 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 3.1-27.1 cases per 1000 person-years) for youths in street settings. The mortality rate was 1.7 deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.8-2.6 deaths per 1000 person-years) for the total cohort, 0.3 deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0-0.9 deaths per 1000 person-years) for youths in institutional settings, 2.2 deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.9-3.5 deaths per 1000 person-years) for youths in family-based settings, and 8.6 deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0-17.9 deaths per 1000 person-years) for youths in street settings. The time to incident HIV or death was 3.0 cases or deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 1.1-4.9 cases or deaths per 1000 person-years) for youths in institutional settings compared with 3.4 cases or deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 1.8-5.0 cases or deaths per 1000 person-years) for youths in family-based settings and 25.7 cases or deaths per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 10.1-40.1 cases or deaths per 1000 person-years) for youths in street settings.

Smoke alarm installation and maintenance—smoke alarms should be installed on every level of the home including the basement, both inside and outside the sleeping area, and should be installed on the ceiling or 6–8 inches below the ceiling on side walls. Battery replacement is imperative to ensuring proper operation; typically, batteries should be replaced at least once a year, some units are manufactured with a 10-year battery, a “chirping” noise indicates the need for replacement, and a battery-operated smoke alarm has a life expectancy of 8 to 10 years; battery replacement is not necessary in units connected to the household electrical system. Regardless of the type, it is crucial to test every smoke alarm monthly, yet only 83% of individuals with fire alarms test at least once a year and only 19% of households with at least one smoke alarm test them quarterly.

More than half of hand hygiene events occurred in the hallway, and once inside the room 75% of events involved dispensers just inside the doorway. In multipatient rooms, a threshold for accessibility was considered 1 dispenser for every 2 beds, and when patients cannot be housed in rooms, facilities should ensure that the patient zone is clearly defined and that hand hygiene supplies are within reach.

### Association of care environment with HIV incidence and death among orphaned, separated, and street-connected children and adolescents in Western Kenya [^47bcb49a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In 2015, there were nearly 140 million orphaned children globally, particularly in low- and middle-income regions, and millions more for whom the street is central to their everyday lives. A total of 16.6 million children were orphaned because of deaths associated with HIV/AIDS, of whom 90% live in sub-Saharan Africa. Although most orphaned and separated children and adolescents in this region are cared for by extended family, the large number of children requiring care has produced a proliferation of institutional care. Few studies have investigated the association between care environment and physical health among orphaned and separated youths in sub-Saharan Africa.

Objective

To examine the association of care environment with incident HIV and death among orphaned and separated children and adolescents who were living in charitable children's institutions, family-based settings, and street settings in western Kenya over almost 10 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Orphaned and Separated Children's Assessments Related to Their Health and Well-Being (OSCAR) project was an observational prospective cohort study conducted in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. The cohort comprised 2551 orphaned, separated, and street-connected children from communities within 8 administrative locations, which included 300 randomly selected households (family-based settings) caring for children who were orphaned from all causes, 19 charitable children's institutions (institutional settings), and a convenience sample of 100 children who were practicing self-care on the streets (street settings). Participants were enrolled from May 31, 2010, to April 24, 2013, and were followed up until November 30, 2019.

Exposures

Care environment (family-based, institutional, or street setting).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Survival regression models were used to investigate the association between care environment and incident HIV, death, and time to incident HIV or death.

Results

Among 2551 participants, 1230 youths were living in family-based settings, 1230 were living in institutional settings, and 91 were living in street settings. Overall, 1321 participants (51.8%) were male, with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 10.4 (4.8) years. Most participants who were living in institutional (1047 of 1230 youths [85.1%]) or street (71 of 91 youths [78.0%]) settings were double orphaned (ie, both parents had died). A total of 59 participants acquired HIV infection or died during the study period. After adjusting for sex, age, and baseline HIV status, living in a charitable children's institution was not associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-1.02) or incident HIV (AHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.46-4.83). Compared with living in a family-based setting, living in a street setting was associated with death (AHR, 5.46; 95% CI, 2.30-12.94), incident HIV (AHR, 17.31; 95% CI, 5.85-51.25), and time to incident HIV or death (AHR, 7.82; 95% CI, 3.48-17.55).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, after adjusting for potential confounders, no association was found between care environment and HIV incidence or death among youths living in institutional vs family-based settings. However, living in a street setting vs a family-based setting was associated with both HIV incidence and death. This study's findings suggest that strengthening of child protection systems and greater investment in evidence-based family support systems that improve child and adolescent health and prevent youth migration to the street are needed for safe and beneficial deinstitutionalization to be implemented at scale.

Pool content turnover rate—definition, 6-hour standard, and calculation are detailed. The turnover rate is the number of times a pool’s contents can be filtered though its filtration equipment in a 24-hour period, and a 6-hour turnover rate will result in 98% clarification if the pool is properly designed. A typical-use pool should have a pump and filtration system capable of pumping the entire contents of the pool though the filters every 6 hours; to determine compliance, use Turnover rate = pool volume (gallons)/flow rate×60 (minutes in hour). A sample calculation shows Turnover rate = 90,000 (gallons in pool)/ 180 gallons per minute×60 (minutes in hour), yielding an 8.3-hour turnover rate = 90,000 (pool volume in gallons)/10,800, which would not meet the required turnover rate of 6 hours.

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^56c6047d]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

1. DEFINE AND UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND ITS CAUSES

Our starting point is that a public health problem has already been identified as requiring intervention. Often this results from a needs assessment, for which there are several practical guides,or from a political process such as a manifesto commitment.

Clarifying the problem with stakeholders, using the existing research evidence, is the first step in intervention development. Some health problems are relatively easily defined and measured, such as the prevalence of a readily diagnosed disease, but others have several dimensions and may be perceived differently by different groups. For instance, ‘unhealthy housing’ could be attributed to poor construction, antisocial behaviour, overcrowding or lack of amenities. Definitions therefore need to be sufficiently clear and detailed to avoid ambiguity or confusion. Is ‘the problem’ a risk factor for a disease/condition (eg, smoking) or the disease/condition itself (eg, lung cancer)? If the former, it is important to be aware of the factor's importance relative to other risk factors. If this is modest even a successful intervention to change it might be insufficient to change the ultimate outcome.

Once defined one should try to establish how the problem is socially and spatially distributed, including who is currently most/least likely to benefit from an intervention. It is also important to consider what interventions or policies currently exist and why they are not deemed adequate.

Having defined the problem, one needs to understand, as far as possible, what are the immediate (proximal) and underlying (distal) influences that give rise to it. These are often suggested by the distribution of the problem, its history and relationship to the life course. It is only by understanding what shapes and perpetuates the problem (the causal pathways) that one can identify possible ways to intervene. Case study step 1 applies Funnell and Rogers’ useful questions for problem analysis to GBV (ref. p. 160). The main influences on the problem can also be classified according to the socioecological model.It can often be helpful to present the various causal pathways affecting the problem diagrammatically: figure 1 attempts to do this for GBV, distinguishing different levels of the socioecological model.

### Characteristics associated with household transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ontario, Canada: a cohort study [^40f1fadc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Population

We assembled a cohort of all individuals with confirmed COVID-19 reported in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province (14.6 million residents), among residents of private households from 1 January 2020 to 28 July 2020. We identified individuals with confirmed COVID-19 using surveillance data from provincial reportable disease systems, which is collected through public health follow-up of cases and entered by local public health units. We obtained ethics approval from Public Health Ontario’s Research Ethics Board.

Identification of Private Households

Private households were defined as any residences not identified as congregate in nature, such as homeless shelters or long-term-care homes. Individual houses and apartments/suites within multiunit dwellings (eg, apartment buildings) were considered private households. Details about the address-matching algorithm used to identify private households are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Outcomes

The primary outcome of interest was any secondary transmission within a household, defined as cases that occurred 1–14 days after the index case of the household. We used each case’s symptom-onset date as the date of comparison, or their specimen collection date if symptom-onset date was unavailable, and excluded the rare cases (0.5%) that lacked information on both dates. We excluded households with multiple index cases (ie, 2 or more cases occurring on the earliest case date of the household) from the cohort as they would present challenges for estimating the predictive value of individual-level index case characteristics. We also considered household transmission to older adults (≥60 years) as a secondary outcome of interest.

Healthy Housing Reference Manual—rodent management in housing emphasizes eliminating food sources and eliminating breeding and nesting places, with items stored above ground with 18 inches of clearance below them. For rat proofing, all openings more than ¾-inch wide should be closed, cracks around doors, gratings, windows, and similar openings should be covered if they are less than 4 feet above the ground, and suitable materials include sheet metal of at least 26-gauge, ¼-inch or ½-inch hardware cloth, and cement; however, ½-inch hardware cloth has little value against house mice. Design should account that rats can routinely jump 2 feet vertically, dig 4 feet or more to get under a foundation, and climb rough walls or smooth pipes up to 3 inches in diameter. The first three strategies—good sanitation techniques, habitat denial, and rat proofing—should be used initially in any rodent management program. If further control is required, a more effective alternative is trapping, with the two main groups of rat and mouse traps being live traps and kill traps, and to be effective, traps must be monitored and emptied or removed quickly.

### An education program for risk factor management after an acute coronary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^87e58c07]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Lifestyle improvements after an acute coronary syndrome reduce cardiovascular risk but are difficult to achieve.

Objective

To determine whether a nurse-led or dietician-led cardiovascular risk factor education program would improve risk factor reduction over the long term after an acute coronary syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Réseau Insuffisance Cardiaque (RESICARD) PREVENTION: study was a 2-arm, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 6 tertiary care hospitals in France. Patients hospitalized in a cardiac intensive care unit for an acute coronary syndrome with at least 1 lifestyle risk factor (current smoking, sedentary lifestyle, or overweight or obesity) were randomized according to a computer-generated list with sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes.

Intervention

Patients underwent an education program in a unique non-hospital setting (a House of Education) or were treated according to physicians' usual standard of care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite that included at least 1 of the following: smoking cessation, at least 3 hours per week of physical activity, at least 5% reduction in weight, and at least 4% reduction in waist circumference. Patients were followed up for 1 year. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS From June 21, 2006, to July 30, 2008, a total of 251 patients were randomized to the House of Education and 251 to conventional care. The 2 groups did not differ significantly at 12 months in the primary composite outcome (51.8% vs 49.8% success rate; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.11; 95% CI, 0.90-1.37) or with correction of all risk factors (aRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.89-1.66). Similarly, the 2 groups did not differ by physical activity (aRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.92-1.21), smoking cessation (aRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.13), and weight or waist reduction (aRR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.84-1.36).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with conventional care, the House of Education did not result in superior improvement in lifestyle-related cardiovascular risk factors after an acute coronary syndrome.

### Summary of guidance for public health strategies to address high levels of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related deaths, December 2020 [^14a65982]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

In the 10 months since the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020 (1), approximately 13.8 million cases and 272,525 deaths have been reported in the United States. On October 30, the number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000 for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227.* With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.

### Prevalence and determinants of chronic kidney disease in rural and urban Cameroonians: a cross-sectional study [^be9fb375]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Selection of participants

We used a multi-level cluster sampling including the health area (first level), the village (second level), the neighbourhood (third level) and the household (fourth level). The sequence below was followed to select the clusters and corresponding health areas. 1) We first assumed the number of clusters needed to be 30; 2) We then determined the sampling interval (SI) which corresponded to 10310, by dividing the population of Dschang health district by the number of clusters; 3) We determined the first cluster or random number (RN) by selecting the four last numbers of a randomly selected bank note which corresponded to 1399; 4) We next estimated the cluster number size (C (n)) from the formula C (n) = RN+(n-1)*SI where n is the cluster number; 5) The various health areas (with their corresponding population size) were then sorted in alphabetic order and progressive cumulative population size estimated (see Additional file 1 : Table S1); 6) The last step consisted of selecting the health areas. For a health area to be selected, the size of the corresponding cluster number had to be less than the health area population. This action was repeated until the size of the cluster number became superior to the health area population; we then moved to the following health area in the table. The selected health areas and corresponding clusters are presented in Additional file 1 : Table S1.

In a selected health area, one village/neighbourhood was randomly drawn when there was more than one regardless of the population size. The starting point was randomly selected from the market, church, health centre or school in the village/neighbourhood. Thereafter, we randomly selected the direction while the side of road was chosen with the aid of coin toss. We entered consecutively in the households where we randomly selected per household a maximum of two adults aged 20 years and above among those who had been living in the household for more than three months. For each household declining to participate, the next household was selected until the total number required for the cluster size was reached. The cluster size ranged between 14 and 15 subjects. In health areas with many clusters, the corresponding villages and/or neighbourhoods were randomly selected as previously described.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^0921c94f]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Smoke alarms—adoption, cost trends, and mortality benefit—by the mid-1980s, laws in 38 states and in thousands of municipalities required smoke alarms in all new and existing residences; by 1995, 93% of all single-family and multifamily homes, apartments, nursing homes, and dormitories were equipped with alarms; the cost decreased from $1,000 for a professionally installed unit to an owner-installed $10 unit; and a properly functioning smoke alarm diminishes the risk for dying in a fire by approximately 50%.

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^b341fec0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods: Randomisation

Item 8a: Sequence generation

Standard CONSORT item —Method used to generate the random allocation sequence.

CONSORT cluster extension —No modification suggested.

Extension for SW-CRTs —Method used to generate the random allocation to the sequences of treatments.

Example —“Eligible schools were randomly assigned to one of the four sequences (3 or 4 schools per sequence) for time of crossover from control to intervention using a computer-generated list of random numbers.”

Explanation —Random allocation in SW-CRTs takes a different form to that in parallel arm designs. Rather than each cluster being randomly allocated to one of two treatments, allocation is to one of several sequences which define the order with which clusters cross from the control condition to the intervention condition (the example). The term “sequence generation” in a SW-CRT therefore has a slightly different meaning to that of individually randomised trials. In an individually randomised trial “sequence” refers to a sequence of treatments to allocate all participants to either the intervention or control condition.

Furthermore, rather than the randomisation being performed as clusters or individuals present to the trial the randomisation in a SW-CRT is usually done at a single point in time before the trial starts.

Item 8b: Randomisation method

Standard CONSORT —Type of randomisation; details of any restriction (such as blocking and block size).

CONSORT cluster extension— Details of stratification or matching if used.

Extension for SW-CRTs —Type of randomisation; details of any constrained randomisation or stratification if used.

Example 1 (Unrestricted) —“Nursing-home units were the unit of randomisation… RL (not involved in recruitment) randomly allocated units to one of five groups with computer-generated random numbers…”

Example 2 (Stratification) — “ All schools are assigned a decile rating, which indicates the extent to which the school draws its students from a range of socioeconomic areas. Decile 1 schools are the 10% of schools with the highest proportion of students from low socioeconomic resource areas (defined according to residents' income, occupation, household crowding, educational qualifications and income support) and decile 10 are the 10% of schools with the highest proportion of students from high socioeconomic areas…. The order of switch-over is determined randomly for each group (decile) of clusters.”

### Evaluation of effectiveness of a community-based intervention for control of dengue virus vector, ouagadougou, Burkina Faso [^43f935d9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Population and Methods

Study Site and Participants

The study was conducted in 2 comparable neighborhoods of Ouagadougou, Tampouy and Juvenat, selected from a total of 5 areas in the city (Technical Appendix Figure 1). Both neighborhoods’ socio-economic profiles are highly diverse and include wealthy households in modern concrete individual houses with running water and electricity, households with a modest standard of living, and poor people living in fairly small houses in the same compound, sometimes without basic amenities. We defined a household as a person or a group of persons with the same head of household, living in a housing unit, who provide themselves with food or other essentials for living; in Burkina Faso, 1, 2, or more households living in different housing units sometimes share the same compound.

Tampouy (Figure 1), located in the northwest of Ouagadougou, was randomly chosen to receive the intervention, whereas Juvenat, on the east side of the city, was selected as the control neighborhood. In 2015, we estimated that 4,264 households were located within a 1-km radius around the primary healthcare center in Tampouy. In the similarly delimited area in the control neighborhood of Juvenat, we identified 3,294 households. We chose a 1-km radius to reduce the probability of contamination between the control and intervention areas while also having a sufficient number of households for the study. The number of households in the area were estimated by using data from Burkina Faso’s National Institute of Statistics and Demography and data collected through very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, which also enabled the distinction of dwellings from other types of buildings. To measure the study outcomes, we used the geographic coordinates of households to randomly sample without replacement 287 households in Tampouy and 289 households in Juvenat. In this study, we considered a compound as a delimited living space where > 1 household was found.

### Long-term air pollution exposure and COVID-19 mortality: a patient-level analysis from New York city [^f35bb2f7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Spatial Data

We estimated particulate matter (PM 2.5 in μg/m 3), BC (in μg/m 3), and NO 2 (in parts per billion) concentrations at the patient-level residential street address provided at the time of admission. Briefly, we leveraged the NYC Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) annual average data that integrate air pollution samples collected every 2 weeks from 93 monitoring sites located throughout the five NYC boroughs with land-use regression models to estimate exposure levels. The NYCCAS monitoring sites are at street level, with 80% of sites being chosen at random and 20% being strategically placed to ensure representation of all community districts and major roadways. As the response period of long-term air pollution exposure on COVID-19 outcomes is unknown, we examined associations between the most recently available, 1-year average exposure level for each pollutant and these outcomes. Analyses thus use the annual average concentration as predicted from the NYCCAS model and extracted for the 100-m grid of each residential address; for PM 2.5 and NO 2, the average from December 2018 to December 2019, the year that ended 3 months before the start of March 2020 NYC spring surge, was used, and for BC, the average from December 2017 to December 2018 was used, as the December 2018 to December 2019 estimates are not yet available. The accuracy of the final adjusted NYCCAS modeling approach was assessed in Clougherty and colleagues’ 2013 study, which reported R 2 values for the predicted versus measured PM 2.5 (R 2 = 0.86), BC (R 2 = 0.60), and NO 2 (R 2 = 0.65) concentrations.

We created 1-km radial buffers around the geographic centroid of each 2010 census block in NYC. We used census data to estimate the following for each buffer: the percentage of persons living below the poverty level, the number of housing units, and the percentage of persons aged ⩾25 years with at least a high school education. We used patient residential addresses to identify their census block of residence and then used the block of residence to link the patient to the corresponding 1-km radial buffer.

### Supported housing for people with severe mental disorders [^24ea280b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a significant reduction in the number of people with severe mental illness who spend extended periods in long-stay hospitals. Psychiatric and social services, both statutory and voluntary, aim to assist these people to stay in their local community. District health authorities, local authorities, housing associations and voluntary organisations are jointly expected to provide support for people with severe mental disorder/s. This 'support' may well involve some sort of special housing.

Objectives

To determine the effects of supported housing schemes compared with outreach support schemes or 'standard care' for people with severe mental disorder/s living in the community.

Search Strategy

Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (February 2001) and the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2001) were searched using relevant phrases. These databases are compiled by methodical searches of BIOSIS, CINAHL, Dissertation abstracts, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, Sociofile, supplemented with hand searching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings. Reference list screening of relevant papers was performed.

Selection Criteria

Relevant randomised, or quasi-randomised, trials dealing with people with 'severe mental disorder/s' allocated to supported housing, outreach support schemes or standard care focusing on outcomes of service utilisation, mental state, satisfaction with care, social functioning, quality of life, and economic data, were sought.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data, relative risks (RR) would have been estimated, with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was to have been calculated. Analysis would have been by intention-to-treat. Normal continuous data were to have been summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD). Scale data were to have been presented for only those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality. Tests of heterogeneity and for publication bias were to have been undertaken.

Main Results

No studies met the inclusion criteria although 139 citations were acquired from the searches.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Dedicated schemes whereby people with severe mental illness are located within one site or building with assistance from professional workers have potential for great benefit as they provide a 'safe haven' for people in need of stability and support. This, however, may be at the risk of increasing dependence on professionals and prolonging exclusion from the community. Whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks can only be a matter of opinion in the absence of reliable evidence. There is an urgent need to investigate the effects of supported housing on people with severe mental illness within a randomised trial.

### Environmental assessment and exposure control of dust mites: a practice parameter [^0ee1141f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Dust mite humidity control and dehumidification—experimental thresholds and outcomes indicate that when daily humidity was maintained below 50%, even brief increases above 50% for 2 to 8 hours daily still allowed decreased mite growth and allergen production, whereas complete prevention of D farinae growth required relative humidity (RH) below 35% for at least 22 hours per day; however, multiple field dehumidification trials did not consistently reduce exposure. Portable dehumidifiers in 6 homes versus 6 controls showed no difference in mite counts or Der p 1 at 1, 2, and 3 months. Whole-house dehumidification measured at 3-month intervals over 1 year in 18 houses also showed no differences in Der p 1 or mite counts and did not reduce indoor humidity enough to retard mite growth. Enhanced central dehumidification in 10 houses versus 10 controls decreased winter humidity from 50% to 37% and stayed below a 45% target yet failed to decrease mite exposure. In a humid temperate climate study, maintaining indoor humidity lower than 51% produced significant decreases, with low humidity homes decreasing from 401 live mites and 17 μg of Der 1 per gram of dust to 18 live mites per gram and 4 μg of Der per gram of dust after 17 months, while control homes did not show a decrease.

### Effect of two different house screening interventions on exposure to malaria vectors and on anaemia in children in the Gambia: a randomised controlled trial [^d8ff579b]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

House screening should protect people against malaria. We assessed whether two types of house screening--full screening of windows, doors, and closing eaves, or installation of screened ceilings--could reduce house entry of malaria vectors and frequency of anaemia in children in an area of seasonal malaria transmission.

Methods

During 2006 and 2007, 500 occupied houses in and near Farafenni town in The Gambia, an area with low use of insecticide-treated bednets, were randomly assigned to receive full screening, screened ceilings, or no screening (control). Randomisation was done by computer-generated list, in permuted blocks of five houses in the ratio 2:2:1. Screening was not treated with insecticide. Exposure to mosquitoes indoors was assessed by fortnightly light trap collections during the transmission season. Primary endpoints included the number of female Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected per trap per night. Secondary endpoints included frequency of anaemia (haemoglobin concentration <80 g/L) and parasitaemia at the end of the transmission season in children (aged 6 months to 10 years) who were living in the study houses. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (ITT), including all randomised houses for which there were some outcome data and all children from those houses who were sampled for haemoglobin and parasitaemia. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN51184253.

Findings

462 houses were included in the modified ITT analysis (full screening, n=188; screened ceilings, n=178; control, n=96). The mean number of A gambiae caught in houses without screening was 37.5 per trap per night (95% CI 31.6-43.3), compared with 15.2 (12.9-17.4) in houses with full screening (ratio of means 0.41, 95% CI 0.31-0.54; p<0.0001) and 19.1 (16.1-22.1) in houses with screened ceilings (ratio 0.53, 0.40-0.70; p<0.0001). 755 children completed the study, of whom 731 had complete clinical and covariate data and were used in the analysis of clinical outcomes. 30 (19%) of 158 children from control houses had anaemia, compared with 38 (12%) of 309 from houses with full screening (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.97; p=0.04), and 31 (12%) of 264 from houses with screened ceilings (OR 0.51, 0.27-0.96; p=0.04). Frequency of parasitaemia did not differ between intervention and control groups.

Interpretation

House screening substantially reduced the number of mosquitoes inside houses and could contribute to prevention of anaemia in children.

### Association between structural housing repairs for low-income homeowners and neighborhood crime [^ebae138f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

We identified a total of 20 515 unique block faces nested within 1334 census block groups and 383 census tracts in Philadelphia during the study period. When multiplied by 29 quarters, the total increased to 594 935 unique block faces per quarter for the entire study panel. Approximately 646 block faces had 0 crime during the entire study period and were excluded from the analysis, leaving a total of 576 201 block faces for inclusion. Of the block faces in the city, 6732 of 19 869 (33.8%) had homes that had received the BSRP intervention during the study period.

A total of 13 632 houses received the intervention. The mean time on the BSRP waiting list was 2.58 years. The owners of these homes had a mean (range) age of 56.5 (18-98) years, were predominantly Black (10 952 [78.6%]) or Latino (1658 [11.9%]) individuals, and had a mean monthly income of $993.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of homes that received the BSRP intervention in Philadelphia, demonstrating a clear clustering of services in lower-income Black neighborhoods. We evaluated the neighborhood-level sociodemographic characteristics of the census tracts that included at least 1 house with BSRP intervention (n = 307) (Table 1). In general, these neighborhoods compared with those without BSRP intervention had a substantially larger Black population (49.5% vs 12.2%; |D| = 0.406) and higher unemployment rate (17.3% vs 9.3%; |D| = 0.357), and they were located in tracts with a substantially higher percentage of homeowners with an income less than $25 000 per year (15.1% vs 4.8%; |D| = 0.501). Furthermore, these tracts had a Black home ownership rate that was more than 20 percentage points higher than the rate in tracts without BSRP intervention (25.1% vs 2.5%; |D| = 0.401).

### Recommendations for reporting on suicide [^6e5d1de4]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for reporting on suicide—coverage practices list “Instead of this” versus “Do this” actions. Under “Instead of this,” avoid “Big or sensationalist headlines, or prominent placement,” “Including photos/videos of the location or method of death, grieving family, friends, memorials or funerals,” “Describing recent suicides as an ‘epidemic,’ ‘skyrocketing,’ or other strong terms,” “Describing a suicide as inexplicable or ‘without warning,’” and “Referring to suicide as ‘successful,’ ‘unsuccessful’ or a ‘failed attempt.’” Under “Do this,” follow “Inform the audience without sensationalizing the suicide and minimize prominence,” “Use school/work or family photo; include hotline logo or local crisis phone numbers,” and “Carefully investigate the most recent CDC data and use non-sensational words like ‘rise’ or ‘higher.’” Additional directives include “Most, but not all, people who die by suicide exhibit warning signs. Include the ‘Warning Signs’ and ‘What to Do’ sidebar (from p. 2) in your article if possible,” “Report on suicide as a public health issue,” “Seek advice from suicide prevention experts,” and “Describe as ‘died by suicide’ or ‘completed’ or ‘killed him/herself.’”

### Day-to-day contact and help among neighbors measured in the natural environment [^ed1ff79d]. Innovation in Aging (2020). Medium credibility.

When contact with neighbors had taken place, the participants were asked (with multiple replies possible) where they had met their neighbors. Sorted by frequencies, the contact took place (a) in a shared laundry room (4.6%); (b) at a neighbor’s apartment/residence (13.2%); (c) at the participant’s apartment/residence (16.1%); (d) outside the participant’s neighborhood (20.9%); (e) in the hallway of the participant’s residential building (28.1%); (f) within the participant’s neighborhood (28.2%); and (g) in the outdoor area surrounding the residential complex (29.8%).

In 54.6% of cases, participants had randomly met their neighbors (i.e. by bumping into each other); in 36.7% of cases, they had sought contact with their neighbors; and in 29.8% of cases, the neighbors had sought contact with them. When no random contact with neighbors had taken place, participants were asked (again with multiple replies possible) what the reason for the meeting had been. Sorted by frequencies, participants reported (a) no direct reason for the contact (14.9%); (b) the neighbor had helped the participant (18.7%); (c) the neighbor had asked about the participant’s current condition (25.6%); (d) the participant had helped the neighbor (30.1%); (e) the participant had asked about the neighbor’s current condition (32.2%); and (f) the participant reported simply having had “a nice chat” (38.1%).

The calculated sum of giving help to one’s neighbors across the 60 measurement points ranged from 0 to 8, with an average of 1.12 (SD = 1.76). The calculated sum of receiving help from one’s neighbors ranged from 0 to 6, with an average of 0.70 (SD = 1.23). Overall, the participants evaluated receiving help from their neighbors positively: on a five-point scale from 1 = not helpful at all to 5 = very helpful, they reported an average of 4.30 (SD = 0.97).

### Characteristics of firearm injury by injury intent: the need for tailored interventions [^25bbd03e]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Hospital-Level Characteristics

Hospital characteristics were compared across participating and nonparticipating TQIP centers including hospital bed count, profit status, teaching status, and trauma center designation level.

Patient-Level Characteristics

Patients were categorized into four age groups: young child (0–15 years), adolescent/young adult (16–24 years), adult (25–64 years), and older adult (65 years or older). We considered a patient to have a comorbidity if they had any of the following diagnoses: bleeding disorders, current chemotherapy use, congestive heart failure, current smoking status, end stage renal disease, prior stroke, diabetes mellitus, disseminated cancer, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis, use of an anticoagulant, prior myocardial infarction, dementia, and peripheral arterial disease. The number of comorbidities present for each patient was then counted as follows: none, 1, 2, or ≥3. The type and severity of injuries were characterized by Abbreviated Injury Scores and were captured through chart abstraction by trauma registrars.

Context of Injury

The context of injury, including the injury setting and perpetrator (where relevant), was captured in addition to the location where the firearm injury occurred. Injury location was grouped by commonality: childcare or school locations (school bus, childcare center, elementary/middle/high school, colleges [including dormitory]), places of residence (house, apartment), commercial locations (bar/nightclub, service station, bank/ATM, liquor store, industrial/construction area, office building, sports arena, place of worship, medical facility, farm, hotel), locations based on traveling between other locations (street, highway, motor vehicles, parking lot/garage, public transit, railroad tracks, bridges), natural outdoor locations (parks, natural areas, burial grounds), and other (abandoned building, supervised residential facility, jail/detention facility). Relationship to shooter was defined as the person or individual responsible for injuring the patient and included the following: (1) self, (2) a known person (acquaintance, friend, intimate or ex-intimate partner, co-worker, family member, or other known individual with an undisclosed relationship), (3) an unknown person (or stranger), and (4) a law enforcement officer.

### Community paramedicine program in social housing and health service utilization: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^79b4b6b7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Community Paramedicine at Clinic (CP@clinic) is a chronic disease prevention program that decreases 911 calls for emergency medical services, but its wider system effects are unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of CP@clinic vs usual care on individual-level health service utilization outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This open-label, pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial evaluated all residents 55 years or older in 30 social housing buildings in Ontario, Canada, that had (1) a unique postal code, (2) at least 50 apartments, (3) 60% or more residents 55 years or older, and (4) a similar building for pairing (15 intervention and 15 control buildings, pair-matched randomization). The 12-month intervention had a staggered start date from January 1, 2015, to December 1, 2015, and ended between December 31, 2015, and November 30, 2016. Administrative health data analysis was conducted in May 2022.

Intervention

CP@clinic was a health promotion and disease prevention program led by specially trained community paramedics who held weekly drop-in sessions in social housing buildings. These paramedics conducted 1-on-1 risk assessments, provided health education and referrals to relevant community resources, and, with consent, sent assessments to family physicians. Control buildings received usual care (universal health care, including free primary and specialty medical care).

Main Outcome and Measures

Individual-level health service utilization was measured from administrative health data, with ED visits via ambulance as the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included ED visits for any reason, primary care visits, hospitalizations, length of hospital stay, laboratory tests, receipt of home care, transfer to long-term care, and medication initiation. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate intervention effects on individual-level health service utilization, accounting for trial design and individual-level baselines.

Results

The 30 social housing buildings had 3695 residents (1846 control and 1849 intervention participants; mean [SD] age, 72.8 [9.1] years; 2400 [65.0%] female). Intention-to-treat analysis found no significant difference in ED visits by ambulance (445 of 1849 [24.1%] vs 463 of 1846 [25.1%]; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.05) but found higher antihypertensive medication initiation (74 of 500 [14.8%] vs 47 of 552 [8.5%]; AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.19-2.53) and lower anticoagulant initiation (48 of 1481 [3.2%] vs 69 of 1442 [4.8%]; AOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.86) in the intervention arm vs the control arm. CP@clinic attendance was associated with higher incidence of primary care visits (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17), higher odds of receiving home care (AOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.13), and lower odds of long-term care transfers (AOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.81).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cluster randomized clinical trial of CP@clinic, the intervention did not affect the rate of ED visits by ambulance; however, there were increased primary care visits and connections to home care services, which may have increased antihypertensive medication initiation and reduced long-term care transfers from social housing. Health policymakers should consider CP@clinic's impact as an upstream approach to improve care for older adults with low income.

### Prevention of drowning [^651c11cf]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Residential pool fencing—effectiveness and implementation—reports that 4-sided fencing that isolates the pool from the house and yard was superior to 3-sided fencing, with “an odds ratio of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07–0.44).” In an Australian study, 3-sided fencing had higher drowning risk than 4-sided fencing with “(incidence rate ratio, 1.78; 95% CI: 1.40–1.79).” An Australian inspection program “raised the rate of compliance with pool fencing laws from approximately 50% to 97%,” and “in the 5 years after enactment of legislation to improve the effectiveness of pool fencing, the number of private swimming pool drowning deaths halved.” Design considerations note that “chain-link fences were easily scaled by children, whereas ornamental iron bar fences proved more difficult to climb,” and the text states “Fences should be at least 4 feet high, and no opening under the fence should be more than 4 inches (some building codes require a 5-foot fence…).”

### Mortality among unsheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, 2000-2009 [^877bd68a]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Previous studies have shown high mortality rates among homeless people in general, but little is known about the patterns of mortality among "rough sleepers," the subgroup of unsheltered urban homeless people who avoid emergency shelters and primarily sleep outside.

Objectives

To assess the mortality rates and causes of death for a cohort of unsheltered homeless adults from Boston, Massachusetts.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 10-year prospective cohort study (2000-2009) of 445 unsheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, who were seen during daytime street and overnight van clinical visits performed by the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program's Street Team during 2000. Data used to describe the unsheltered homeless cohort and to document causes of death were gathered from clinical encounters, medical records, the National Death Index, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health death occurrence files. The study data set was linked to the death occurrence files by using a probabilistic record linkage program to confirm the deaths. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2015, to September 6, 2016.

Exposure

Being unsheltered in an urban setting.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Age-standardized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and age-stratified incident rate ratios that were calculated for the unsheltered adult cohort using 2 comparison groups: the nonhomeless Massachusetts adult population and an adult homeless cohort from Boston who slept primarily in shelters.

Results

Of 445 unsheltered adults in the study cohort, the mean (SD) age at enrollment was 44 (11.4) years, 299 participants (67.2%) were non-Hispanic white, and 72.4% were men. Among the 134 individuals who died, the mean (SD) age at death was 53 (11.4) years. The all-cause mortality rate for the unsheltered cohort was almost 10 times higher than that of the Massachusetts population (standardized mortality rate, 9.8; 95% CI, 8.2-11.5) and nearly 3 times higher than that of the adult homeless cohort (standardized mortality rate, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.2). Non-Hispanic black individuals had more than half the rate of death compared with non-Hispanic white individuals, with a rate ratio of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P<.001). The most common causes of death were noncommunicable diseases (eg, cancer and heart disease), alcohol use disorder, and chronic liver disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mortality rates for unsheltered homeless adults in this study were higher than those for the Massachusetts adult population and a sheltered adult homeless cohort with equivalent services. This study suggests that this distinct subpopulation of homeless people merits special attention to meet their unique clinical and psychosocial needs.

### It's not home [^8fb8907e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

One day during construction, my next‐door neighbor sat beside me as we peered at the top. A few weeks earlier, there had been nothing, and now the new house was towering over us. “Kitzman,” he said, “You've done well. Someone else is going to enjoy living in that house someday.” It was startling to hear, but I realized he was reminding me that our time is fleeting and our hold on our possessions is tenuous.

I visited Lester and Ann frequently as they prepared for their move. They discussed the exhausting process of choosing from among the hundreds of precious possessions in their spacious home the few that they could take with them, and what they would do with all the rest. A profound sense of loss and finality hung in the air.

I gently encouraged them to envision the possibilities, the new friends they would meet, the wider range of activities, and of course, more security. This led Ann to remark how delighted she was to learn that the beauty shop was on the same floor as their apartment and that she looked forward to having her hair done more often. This lightened the mood.

Sometime after their move, I was glad to receive an invitation to Ann's 90th birthday party. Their new domicile is in one of the best senior living complexes, with a beautiful campus, attractive buildings, and an attentive staff. The meeting room was cheerfully decorated in a St. Patrick's Day theme, fitting for Ann's birthdate (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2 
Ann at her 90th birthday, with St. Patrick's Day theme to match her birthday

First, I sat with Ann and chatted; she seemed cheerful. When other guests came, I relinquished my seat and moved to sit next to Lester, who was subdued. He asked about the lake, the neighborhood, and my dog Daisy who used to play with Casey.

“Lester, you have a nice place here,” I commented. He waited a long time, and then said in a solemn, quiet voice, “It's not home.” Tears welled in my eyes. Even though it had been 7 months since their move, they were both still struggling with the loss.

### Environmental assessment and exposure control of dust mites: a practice parameter [^823f5c05]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Dust mite exposure and sensitization—epidemiologic and cohort data link exposure levels with sensitization and identify thresholds. Despite relocation to low-exposure homes, 31% of Puerto Rican women were sensitized to dust mites, and almost 35% of children from 8 inner-city areas in the United States had skin reactivity to dust mite allergen. In Los Alamos cohorts, 3 case–control studies combined 332 children (157 with asthmatic symptoms and 175 controls). In a middle school sample, concentrations were very low (mean 0.18 μg/g of Der p 1), and rates of mite sensitization were equally low. Prenatal exposure in the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project higher than 0.2 μg/g was associated with a 29% increase in cord blood total IgE. Longitudinal testing of 1,812 children found Der p 1 exposures correlated with sensitization starting at ≥ 2 μg/g, and the investigators suggested that this is a minimal avoidance level for primary prevention in children with sensitization to other allergens. A systematic review noted that in areas where most houses have higher than 2 μg of mite allergen per gram of dust, sensitization has consistently been found in a large proportion of children with asthma.

Field workers trained participants to complete a paper-based contact diary. Participants were randomly assigned a day of the week to begin two consecutive days of reporting contacts. Field workers returned to the household after this period and entered the contacts recorded by the participant into an electronic survey platform. Participants reported characteristics of the person with whom they had contact, such as their age, gender, and relationship to the participant, as well as the location (home, store/market, school, work, place of worship, and other country-specific options), duration (<5 min, 5–15 min, 16–30 min, 31 min–1 h, 1–4 h, and 4+ hours), environment (indoors/outdoors), and proximity (physical/non-physical) of the contact. For adults or children unable to complete the diary themselves, study staff assisted in selecting another person (a ‘shadow’) to record the participant’s contacts. Both participants and shadows received training in how to record contacts and field staff periodically checked in with participants over the two-day contact reporting period to ensure complete and accurate reporting by shadows.

We defined contact as a two-way conversation with three or more words exchanged at a physical distance of an arm’s length or less from another person. A subset of contacts were classified as physical, which we defined as a contact that involved directly touching someone’s skin or the clothes they were wearing.

### Selecting fitted models under epistemic uncertainty using a stochastic process on quantile functions [^658be462]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Interpreting the realisationsas PPFs also imposes a third constraint, more subtle but equally important:
The processmust be non-accumulating.

A process which is accumulating would start at one end of the domain, say Φ = 0, and sequentially accumulate increments until it reaches the other end. Brownian motion over the interval [0, T] is an example of such a process. In contrast, consider the process of constructing a PPF for the data in Fig. 2 : initially we have few data points and the PPF of their loss is very coarse. As the number of points increases, the PPF gets refined, but since loss values occur in no particular order, this happens simultaneously across the entire interval.

The accumulation of increments strongly influences the statistics of a process; most notably, the variance is usually larger further along the domain. This would not make sense for a PPF: ifis smaller than, that should be a consequence of δ EMD (Φ) being smaller than—not of Φ occurring “before”.

This idea that a realisationis generated simultaneously across the interval led us to defineas a sequence of refinements: starting from an initial incrementfor the entire Φ interval [0, 1], we partition [0, 1] into n subintervals, and sample a set of n subincrements in such a way that they sum to. This type of distribution, where n random variables are drawn under the constraint of a fixed sum, is called a compositional distribution. Note that the constraint reduces the number of dimensions by one, so a pair of increments would be drawn from a 1-d compositional distribution. A typical 1-d example is the beta distribution for x 1 ∈ [0, 1], with x 2 = (1 − x 1) and α, β > 0:

### Suicidal ideation and its related factors among older adults: a population-based study in southwestern iran [^0d2ed3e4]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study setting and participants

The present study was conducted in Shiraz, a city located in the Fras Province in Southwestern Iran which has a population of approximately 2 million inhabitants of which approximately 160,000 are aged over 60 years. Participants were recruited utilizing a household survey conducted through face-to-face interviews within urban neighbourhoods of the city using a multi-stage cluster sampling. The inclusion criteria were being Iranian, aged 60 years and older, and being able to understand and respond to the survey questions. All participants said they were cognitively capable of participating in an interview in Persian and no-one was excluded from participating in the study in relation to this criterion. Participation was voluntary and no financial remuneration was provided. The sampling approach was based on clusters from municipal areas, then neighborhoods. In the first stage, municipal areas were numbered and six (out of 11) regions were randomly selected. In the next stage, a total of 17 neighborhoods were randomly selected from municipal regions proportional to their population size. In the final stage, 50 participants were randomly selected from each neighborhood. Within the neighborhoods, a list of households who had eligible members according to age was prepared and a simple random selection procedure was applied. For each selected household, if there was more than one eligible person, one of them was randomly selected. A total of 850 older adults were invited to be interviewed and 803 participated in the study (response rate: 94.5%). The mean age of participants was 68.1 years (SD = 4.73). Participants provided verbal consent to participate prior to commencing the study. Data were collected from the 24 November to 20 December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. The survey took approximately 45 min for every participant to complete. Interviews were conducted outdoors while maintaining adequate physical distance (at least two meters) and wearing face masks. The protocol was approved by the Shiraz University’s Ethics Committee (Ref: IR.sums.med.rec.1399.518). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, after they had been informed of the study’s goals. Complete anonymity and data confidentiality was guaranteed. The research conducted in this study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Effects of breastfeeding education interventions during pregnancy on breastfeeding practices in rural south Ethiopia: a protocol for cluster randomized controlled trial [^3f505a43]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Sample size

The sample size was estimated using G*Power software version 3.1.9.2 by considering the proportion of early initiation of breastfeeding (within one hour) in Ethiopia of 73% (Ethiopia demographic and health survey, 2016), the expected difference between the intervention arms and the control arm of 20%, the power of 90%, an error probability of 5%, the possible withdrawal or loss of follow-up of participants of 20%, and an equal number of participants in the three arms and two-sided tail. This gives 88 participants in each arm. Considering a cluster sample size and the possibility to apply cluster-effect analysis for correlated data (cluster dependency) and an equal number of clusters in each arm, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) r = 0.1 and a cluster size of 10 were taken to be feasible. Using these parameters, we calculated a design effect of 1.9 and the number of clusters of 51; 17 clusters per arm, using the formulas in the literature. Thus, for 51 clusters with a cluster size of 10, the total sample size becomes 510, with 170 participants in each arm.

Sampling procedure

In this study, 51 clusters were selected from 98 clusters purposefully to avoid information contamination from adjacent clusters. Then study participants (pregnant women between the end of the first trimester and the early second trimester of pregnancy) from each cluster will be selected using a simple random sampling technique (random number generator in Open Epi software) after registration via house-to-house visits and preparing a sample frame. Additionally, when eligible participants refuse to participate in the study, other participants from the list will be substituted using the same simple random sampling technique. However, if participants refuse to continue in the study after intervention has already been initiated, they will be reported as withdrawing, and no participant will be substituted. The same sampling procedures will be applied to each arm.

### Texas lifestyle limits transmission of dengue virus [^517ab707]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Results

Surveys were completed in 622 households (309 in Laredo, 313 in Nuevo Laredo), and 516 persons (228 in Laredo, 288 in Nuevo Laredo) provided blood samples. IgM seropositivity (Table 1) was lower in Laredo (1.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 3%) than in Nuevo Laredo (16%; CI 12% to 20%). IgG seropositivity (Table 1) was also lower in Laredo (23%; CI 17% to 28% vs. 48%; CI 41% to 55%). Conversely, mosquito-infested containers were more abundant on the Texas side of the border: the Breteau Index (the number of infested containers per 100 houses) was 91 in Laredo versus 37 in Nuevo Laredo. Eighty-two percent of homes in Laredo had central or room air-conditioning versus 24% in Nuevo Laredo. In Laredo, evaporative coolers (a low-technology air-conditioning device that cools and humidifies air by drawing it from outdoors through a continually wetted screen) were less prevalent, a greater proportion of houses had intact screens, the average distance between houses was greater, and fewer persons lived in each house (Table 2).

Univariate analysis indicated a significant association between IgM seropositivity and five variables: absence of air-conditioning, fewer room air-conditioning units, the presence of an evaporative cooler, no travel outside the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo area, and shorter distances to neighboring houses (Table 3). IgG seropositivity was significantly associated with absence of central air-conditioning, fewer room air-conditioning units, smaller plot size, and a shorter distance to neighboring houses (Table 4).

### Reporting of stepped wedge cluster randomised trials: extension of the CONSORT 2010 statement with explanation and elaboration [^905ca873]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Example 3 (Intention-to-treat analysis) —“For the “intention-to-treat” analysis an indicator of whether an observation occurred pre- or post-randomisation was included in the regression model. To allow for delays in implementation a separate “per protocol” analysis was performed with the observations now placed into one of the three categories: “pre-randomisation,” “post-randomisation but pre-implementation” and “post-implementation…”

Explanation —The statistical methodology should be clearly reported to allow replication. Where possible, it can be helpful to provide a reference to the statistical methodology used. In a SW-CRT, clusters are randomised to sequentially initiate the intervention. Observations collected under the control condition are therefore, on average, from an earlier calendar time than observations collected under the intervention condition. Changes external to the trial may create underlying secular trends. Likewise, participants, if repeatedly measured over the duration of the study, may get sicker or recover over time. This means that time is a potential confounder. Analysis of a SW-CRT should adjust for time effects irrespective of their statistical significance;failure to do so risks biasing the estimate of the intervention effect, which could lead to declaring an intervention effective when it is ineffective or ineffective when it is effective.It is therefore essential to report if and how time effects were allowed for. If time is measured continuously, time can be modelled parametrically; if time is measured discretely then time can be modelled categorically. Furthermore, SW-CRTs typically include only a small number of clusters and so prespecification of important prognostic factors to use in a fully adjusted analysis (in mitigation of the likelihood of imbalance due to sampling variation) might be undertaken;and small sample corrections should be incorporated where appropriate.

In a parallel CRT, randomisation at the level of the cluster needs to be allowed for at the analysis stage (unless cluster level data are being analysed). In a SW-CRT, as clusters (and possibly individuals) are repeatedly measured over time, there may be some reduction in the strength of correlation between measurements within the same cluster over time.Failure to appropriately model the correlation structure can lead to incorrect estimation of the precision of treatment effects.It is therefore important to clearly describe the correlation structure used in the analysis.

The analysis should also describe how deviations from the randomisation schedule were accommodated (example 3). A more detailed consideration of this point is given under item 16 (numbers analysed).

### Epidemiologic characteristics of mpox among people experiencing homelessness, Los Angeles county, California, USA, 2022 [^0ed68f78]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Using data from healthcare provider reports and mpox case interviews, LACDPH was able to determine the primary residential situation in the 3 weeks before symptom onset for 112 (95%) PEH mpox case-patients; 55 (47%) were grouped in the sheltered–noncongregate category. Of these, 49 were couch surfing in private homes, 4 used temporary vouchers to stay in private rooms with bathrooms in hotels/motels, and 2 stayed in private rooms with bathrooms in hotels/motels used specifically for emergency housing. Of 37 (31%) PEH grouped as unsheltered–other, 18 were living outdoors but not associated with an encampment, 10 were unsheltered with details unknown, and 9 were living in vehicles. We grouped 12 (10%) in the unsheltered–encampment category, 8 (7%) as sheltered–congregate, and 6 (5%) as unknown (Table 1). Twenty-nine (25%) PEH mpox case-patients reported spending nights at >1 location within the 3-week incubation timeframe before onset of symptoms, among whom 14 spent most nights couch surfing (7 moved around from private home to private home), 5 spent some nights outdoors or in a vehicle, 4 spent time in a commercial hotel, 1 in an emergency shelter, 1 incarcerated, and 1 in a non-PEH setting; 1 additional location was unknown. No mpox case-patient was identified as sharing the same encampment or address with another case-patient.

Among the 21 PEH mpox case-patients who reported exposure to a person with known mpox or mpox symptoms, 10 couch surfed, 6 lived in encampments, 2 lived in emergency shelters, and 3 lived alone on the streets. One of the 21 case-patients who reported exposure to a known mpox case-patient reported exchanging sex for services. Of the 11 PEH mpox case-patients who reported exchanging sex for services, 5 were sheltered (3 couch surfing, 1 living in a group home, and 1 in a shelter) and 6 were unsheltered (1 in an encampment, 2 in vehicles, and 2 alone on the streets). There were no additional details for 1 of the unsheltered PEH mpox case-patients who exchanged sex for services.

### Environmental assessment and exposure control of dust mites: a practice parameter [^220f8273]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Dust mite allergen exposure—environmental reservoirs and concentration patterns demonstrate high household burdens and seasonality, with growth constrained by humidity and temperature. Most homes had mite densities of at least 500 mites per gram of dust, and very few mites can grow if the indoor RH is lower than 45% with an indoor temperature of 22°C. Dust mite allergens can display as much as a 20-fold seasonal variation. In a survey of 158 houses, mean Der p 1 concentrations were 1.9 µg/g in living rooms, 1.7 µg/g in bedrooms, and 2.0 µg/g in mattresses; concentrations higher than 10 µg/g were found in 25% of living rooms and mattresses and in more than 30% of bedrooms, and bed and floors contained a wide range from 0.1 to 100 µg/g of dust. Airborne levels are typically low without disturbance but during domestic activities that disturb dust, 1 to 3 µg can be detected; allergen is largely associated with fecal particles, with more than 95% in mite cultures, and in samples with more than 10 mites per 100 mg of dust Der p 1 concentrations correlate with mite counts. Hard-surface recovery is uncommon, with Dermatophagoides farinae detected by wall-wiping in only 20% of samples. In Brazil, 240 dust samples from 60 houses showed bedding had the highest Der f 1 and Der p 1 levels, and mattress bases (box springs) have significantly higher levels of mite allergen and mite bodies than mattresses. Personal clothing washed less frequently tends to carry more allergen than regularly washed items.

### Long-term change in the prevalence of intimate partner violence: a 20-year follow-up study in León, Nicaragua, 1995-2016 [^b81f3018]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Study population and sample

The study was carried out in the municipality of León, the second largest city in Nicaragua. In 1995 the population of León was 195 000 and by 2016 it was 206 264.Both samples were selected from the same master sample to ensure a self-weighted random sample representing León municipality. The 1995 study was nested in a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in León, which was created in 1992.It was set up by means of cluster sampling and represented approximately 30% of the population of León municipality. The 1995 sample was a random selection of 566 women aged 15 to 49 who were registered in the HDSS. If the selected woman had moved to a new home or town, efforts were made to locate and interview her.

In the 2016 study, the sample size was estimated at 1920, with the goal of obtaining 1500 completed interviews (the recommended sample size for WHO IPV studies), and allowing for non-response. The study used a multistage stratified sample design. The HDSS currently includes 12 163 houses and 662 enumeration areas (EA), stratified by the three administrative territories of León, each with urban and rural EAs. The EAs were subdivided into 2623 segments (1673 urban and 950 rural), each containing five houses in the urban areas and four houses in the rural areas. The difference in sampling intervals was a safety measure to reduce the likelihood of other household members learning about the subject of the interview in more densely populated areas.For the same reason, only one eligible woman was interviewed in each household. In the first stage, 1920 (600 rural and 1320 urban) segments were randomly selected using probability proportional to size. The enumeration maps were updated in person prior to data collection, and it was found that 39 intervals no longer existed, leaving a total of 1881 households in the sample. In each segment, one household was randomly selected. The questionnaire was administered in two parts. The first part was a household questionnaire which was administered to any adult member of the household. This included socio-economic data, as well as a listing of all eligible women (between 15 to 64) living in the household. If there was more than one eligible woman in a household, one woman was randomly selected to be interviewed in private using the individual questionnaire. The study was introduced to the household as a study on women’s health; only the selected woman was told about the true purpose of the study. No substitutions were made in the case of non-response or households with no eligible women. At least three attempts were made to contact eligible women, including at night and on weekends in both studies.

The following procedure was applied to get the households of the study subjects. First, a central point in each kebele; a place in the kebele where approximately an equal number of households were found in all of the four directions; was identified. Then, by spinning a pencil on a clipboard, a direction was identified and the first household out of the first ten households was selected as starting point. A direction was identified, and then the first household out of the first ten households was selected as starting point. Every tenth household was identified for inclusion into the study on an approximately straight line pattern in each kebele. Ten households on the selected direction were listed and a random start household number was identified by simple random sampling method. Then, every tenth household was selected and included into the study. This procedure was continued in all the selected kebeles until the required sample was gained for each of the kebeles. When there are no children aged 1–9 years in a sampled household, a substitute is taken from the nearest household. If there were two or more children in a household, one of them was selected by lottery method.

A total of 611 households were included and heads of households were interviewed for sociodemographic and economic information, housing and environmental condition, knowledge and practice about prevention of trachoma and child factors. A total of 611 children were examined for the trachoma status from the ten selected kebeles accordingly.

### Routine versus clinically driven laboratory monitoring and first-line antiretroviral therapy strategies in African children with HIV (ARROW): a 5-year open-label randomised factorial trial [^99178586]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

No trials have investigated routine laboratory monitoring for children with HIV, nor four-drug induction strategies to increase durability of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Methods

In this open-label parallel-group trial, Ugandan and Zimbabwean children or adolescents with HIV, aged 3 months to 17 years and eligible for ART, were randomly assigned in a factorial design. Randomisation was to either clinically driven monitoring or routine laboratory and clinical monitoring for toxicity (haematology and biochemistry) and efficacy (CD4 cell counts; non-inferiority monitoring randomisation); and simultaneously to standard three-drug or to four-drug induction first-line ART, in three groups: three-drug treatment (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], lamivudine, abacavir; group A) versus four-drug induction (NNRTI, lamivudine, abacavir, zidovudine; groups B and C), decreasing after week 36 to three-drug NNRTI, lamivudine, plus abacavir (group B) or lamivudine, abacavir, plus zidovudine (group C; superiority ART-strategy randomisation). For patients assigned to routine laboratory monitoring, results were returned every 12 weeks to clinicians; for clinically driven monitoring, toxicity results were only returned for requested clinical reasons or if grade 4. Children switched to second-line ART for WHO stage 3 or 4 events or (routine laboratory monitoring only) age-dependent WHO CD4 criteria. Randomisation used computer-generated sequentially numbered tables incorporated securely within the database. Primary efficacy endpoints were new WHO stage 4 events or death for monitoring and change in CD4 percentage at 72 and 144 weeks for ART-strategy randomisations; the co-primary toxicity endpoint was grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN24791884.

Findings

1206 children were randomly assigned to clinically driven (n=606) versus routine laboratory monitoring (n=600), and groups A (n=397), B (n=404), and C (n=405). 47 (8%) children on clinically driven monitoring versus 39 (7%) on routine laboratory monitoring had a new WHO stage 4 event or died (hazard ratio [HR] 1·13, 95% CI 0·73-1·73, p=0·59; non-inferiority criterion met). However, in years 2-5, rates were higher in children on clinically driven monitoring (1·3 vs 0·4 per 100 child-years, difference 0·99, 0·37-1·60, p=0·002). One or more grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 283 (47%) children on clinically driven versus 282 (47%) on routine laboratory monitoring (HR 0·98, 0·83-1·16, p=0·83). Mean CD4 percentage change did not differ between ART groups at week 72 (16·5% [SD 8·6] vs 17·1% [8·5] vs 17·3% [8·0], p=0·33) or week 144 (p=0·69), but four-drug groups (B, C) were superior to three-drug group A at week 36 (12·4% [7·2] vs 14·1% [7·1] vs 14·6% [7·3], p<0·0001). Excess grade 3 or 4 events in groups B (one or more events reported by 157 [40%] children in A, 190 [47%] in B; HR [B:A] 1·32, 1·07-1·63) and C (218 [54%] children in C; HR [C:A] 1·58, 1·29-1·94; global p=0·0001) were driven by asymptomatic neutropenia in zidovudine-containing groups (B, C; 86 group A, 133 group B, 184 group C), but resulted in drug substitutions in only zero versus two versus four children, respectively.

Interpretation

NNRTI plus NRTI-based three-drug or four-drug ART can be given across childhood without routine toxicity monitoring; CD4 monitoring provided clinical benefit after the first year on ART, but event rates were very low and long-term survival high, suggesting ART rollout should take priority. CD4 benefits from four-drug induction were not durable, but three-NRTI long-term maintenance was immunologically and clinically similar to NNRTI-based ART and could be valuable during tuberculosis co-treatment.

### The life and contribution of professor David sanders through his publications [^e24f0b13]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Professor David Sanders died in August 2019. He leaves a long legacy of analysis and teaching on global child health and public health particularly in relation to poverty and the roots of ill health, and how to tackle them. Sanders believed that the determinants of health lay in the social conditions of the population and that these had to be improved by social change and working at the grass roots rather than by top-down medical treatment with drugs; he was a strong proponent of primary healthcare as originally established by WHO and supported the appointment of community health workers who would be responsible to the local community. His work is covered in this article through a review of significant books of which the best known is The Struggle for Health and his research in the field.

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^98233cf2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Physical examination—frailty categories and definitions are provided for well, managing well, vulnerable, mildly frail, moderately frail, severely frail, very severely frail, and terminally ill. Well is defined as people who have no active disease symptoms but are less fit than category 1 and often exercise or are very active occasionally. Managing well refers to people whose medical problems are well controlled but are not regularly active beyond routine walking. Vulnerable indicates that although not dependent on others for daily help, symptoms often limit activities and a common complaint is being “slowed up” or being tired during the day. Mildly frail describes people who have more evident slowing and need help in high-order instrumental activities of daily living, with mild frailty progressively impairing shopping and walking outside alone, meal preparation, and housework. Moderately frail indicates people need help with all outside activities and with keeping house; inside, they often have problems with stairs and need help with bathing and might need minimal assistance with dressing. Severely frail means completely dependent for personal care, yet they seem stable and not at high risk of dying (within ~6 mo). Very severely frail describes people who are completely dependent, approaching the end of life, and typically could not recover even from a minor illness. Terminally ill is approaching the end of life and applies to people with a life expectancy <6 mo who are not otherwise evidently frail.

### The impact of a multi-component hospital avoidance programme in residential aged care homes: a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial [^840fc2b9]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

EDDIE+ was evaluated in 11 RAC homes over 60 weeks using a complete stepped wedge cluster randomised design (Figure 1, File S1). A single, not-for-profit aged care provider managed all RAC homes that participated in the study. The provider is Australia’s largest independent aged care provider with 99 RAC homes supporting 8718 resident places. RAC homes were purposively sampled to obtain a mix of metropolitan and non-metropolitan (‘regional’) sites, with a higher priority placed on homes without access to existing locally implemented hospital avoidance programmes and with higher bed capacity to ensure the trial was adequately powered.

Figure 1 
Stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design showing observed treatment sequences for implementing the EDDIE+ program. See ‘Study design’ for further details on observed treatment sequences for Clusters 5 and 10 and Control phase activities.

Each RAC home was defined as a cluster, and each cluster was randomly allocated to a unique treatment sequence. Treatment sequences were defined by four-weekly time steps covering three distinct study phases: a Control phase during which usual care processes took place, a 4-week Transition phase to allow for initial implementation activities to be completed, and an Intervention phase. The duration of the Control and Intervention phases varied by assigned treatment sequence, up to 46 and 48 weeks, respectively (Table S1). All clusters started in the Control phase for the first 6 weeks of the study; the first 2 weeks comprised preparation activities across all clusters. Clusters were scheduled to start the Transition phase every 4 weeks thereafter. Initial activities completed during the Transition phase included site-specific context assessments and the development of local implementation plans.

Twelve RAC homes were initially enrolled in the study; four in regionally located areas and eight in metropolitan areas. One regionally located home withdrew after randomisation due to limited staff capacity. The 11 participating homes ranged in size from 91 to 164 beds, with staff numbers at trial commencement ranging from 13 to 25 nursing staff and 42 to 74 personal care workers. The Transition phase was delayed by 2 weeks for one cluster, and the Intervention phase was delayed by 2 weeks for another cluster after the study start date. This deviation from planned treatment sequences was within the acceptable parameters in the study protocol for managing local RAC home issues that could impact trial participation. The Intervention phase was extended by 2 weeks for both impacted clusters to compensate for these unplanned delays.

Regarding patient education for obesity, more specifically with respect to general counseling, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to counsel adult patients with obesity or overweight with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia) that lifestyle changes producing even modest, sustained weight loss of 3-5% produce clinically meaningful health benefits and greater weight losses produce greater benefits. Counsel patients that sustained weight loss of 3-5% is likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and the risk of developing T2DM.

### Quantifying population contact patterns in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic [^140b281d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 1 
Reported interpersonal contact across four survey waves.

a, b Histograms of reported number of contacts (a) and non-household contacts (b) among respondents for each wave. Reported contacts are topcoded at 10 in these plots. The vertical lines show the median number of contacts. c, d Estimated average number of non-household contacts each person reported to have taken place by contact’s relationship (c) and location (d) based on n = 29,880 reports about detailed contacts (“Methods”). Uncertainty estimates are 95% intervals derived from the bootstrap. Each point shows estimated average numbers of non-household contacts in each category, per person. For example, Panel c shows that the average respondent reported almost 0.8 non-household contacts with family members in Wave 2. Avg. average.

For up to three contacts, respondents were asked to report detailed information, including the contact’s age, sex, relationship to the respondent, and the location of the contact event. Using this information, we estimated the composition of respondents’ contacts by relationship and by location (see “Methods”). Figure 1 shows the estimated average number of non-household contacts each person reported to have taken place by contact’s relationship (Fig. 1 c) and location (Fig. 1 d). These are contacts respondents reported with people who do not live in their household. It is therefore possible that some of these “home” contacts took place in the respondent’s household; this would happen if, for example, neighbors came over to visit. They could also have taken place in someone else’s household as would happen if, for example, the respondent had visited a friend at the friend’s house. Across Waves 0 to 3, the average number of interactions with family, friends, and work colleagues increases, and in Waves 1 to 3, these three relationships are responsible for most non-household interpersonal contact. In Wave 0, with contact levels uniformly very low, no single relationship stands out as explaining most non-household interaction. Across Waves 0 to 2, the most common location of reported contacts was someone’s home; by Wave 3, work and home had similar levels of reported contacts. Across Waves 0 to 3 we find increases in the number of work contacts and home contacts, and between Waves 0 and 1 we see increases in contacts at stores and businesses.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^b10f89ee]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Step 1: Initial contact and response—purpose and key actions focus on intake, early evaluation, and education. The purpose of Step 1 is to collect information from the inquirer to determine whether the inquiry’s concern warrants further follow-up, after which the health agency will need to decide whether to pursue the inquiry further, focusing on obtaining information the inquirer can provide as well as relevant data available to the health agency such as data from cancer registry, census, and environmental databases. The inquirer should be referred quickly to the responsible unit and the problem should not be dismissed prematurely, and although the majority of reports of potential clusters will be closed at the time of initial response because the inquirer’s concerns are not consistent with a potential cancer cluster, the first encounter is often the health agency’s best opportunity to educate about the nature of cancer and suspected cancer clusters. To be an effective initial responder, the health agency needs to understand the context of the inquirer’s concern, the nature of the perceived problem, and the history of how it has or has not been reported to authorities.

### Six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID) [^139a29a2]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2016). Low credibility.

Improving the effectiveness of public health interventions relies as much on the attention paid to their design and feasibility as to their evaluation. Yet, compared to the vast literature on how to evaluate interventions, there is little to guide researchers or practitioners on how best to develop such interventions in practical, logical, evidence based ways to maximise likely effectiveness. Existing models for the development of public health interventions tend to have a strong social-psychological, individual behaviour change orientation and some take years to implement. This paper presents a pragmatic guide to six essential Steps for Quality Intervention Development (6SQuID). The focus is on public health interventions but the model should have wider applicability. Once a problem has been identified as needing intervention, the process of designing an intervention can be broken down into six crucial steps: (1) defining and understanding the problem and its causes; (2) identifying which causal or contextual factors are modifiable: which have the greatest scope for change and who would benefit most; (3) deciding on the mechanisms of change; (4) clarifying how these will be delivered; (5) testing and adapting the intervention; and (6) collecting sufficient evidence of effectiveness to proceed to a rigorous evaluation. If each of these steps is carefully addressed, better use will be made of scarce public resources by avoiding the costly evaluation, or implementation, of unpromising interventions.
