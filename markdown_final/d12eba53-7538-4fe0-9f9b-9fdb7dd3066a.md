## Question

how to diagnose steroid myopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose steroid myopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing clinical suspicion from the history and exam. Then, I should verify the steroid exposure profile and dose–duration thresholds. Next, I will review the laboratory strategy, including when to check CK and why it can be misleading. After that, I will consider electrodiagnostics and imaging, and when to escalate to muscle biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize the differential diagnosis and outline a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm with monitoring and follow-up, making sure I double-check each step against guidelines and key reviews as I go [^117An9CZ] [^112fYynb].

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype that should trigger suspicion for steroid myopathy: symmetric proximal muscle weakness with difficulty rising from a squat or chair, climbing stairs, or lifting overhead, often accompanied by fatigue and reduced endurance, and sometimes involving neck flexors or even respiratory muscles in more severe cases; I should also look for atrophy of proximal muscle groups and remember that fluorinated steroids like dexamethasone carry higher myotoxic risk than non-fluorinated agents such as prednisone or prednisolone [^117An9CZ] [^115YBhQn] [^112uSsXV].

> Wait, let me verify the exposure thresholds before I anchor on the diagnosis: chronic systemic glucocorticoids at or above roughly 40 mg/day prednisone equivalent for at least one month are commonly associated with weakness, whereas doses at or below about 10 mg/day are less likely to cause myopathy; fluorinated agents increase risk, and prolonged inhaled or chronic systemic use can still contribute to muscle dysfunction even outside classic high-dose ranges, so I need to calculate cumulative exposure and account for agent selection and duration [^115YBhQn] [^111HxQ8E] [^116DM8vq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about labs; I initially thought to order CK, ALT, and AST reflexively, but I should double-check whether CK helps here because steroid myopathy is classically noninflammatory with normal or only mildly elevated CK, whereas inflammatory myopathies typically show CK elevations greater than five times the upper limit of normal; thus, a normal CK does not exclude steroid myopathy, and conversely, CK elevation should prompt me to reconsider inflammatory or necrotizing etiologies rather than pure steroid toxicity [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I am not missing endocrine or metabolic mimics, so I should check potassium, magnesium, and thyroid function, and screen for diabetes or hyperglycemia given steroid effects; if the phenotype suggests Cushing's syndrome, I should look for discriminatory features such as proximal myopathy, reddish-purple striae, facial plethora, unexplained bruising, and osteoporosis, and proceed with appropriate endocrine evaluation if suspected [^113Eoygh] [^116nn3Tj].

> Next, I should review electrodiagnostic testing; EMG can help distinguish myopathic from neuropathic patterns and may show low-amplitude motor unit potentials with early recruitment in steroid myopathy, but I must remember that EMG can be normal early or if sampling is suboptimal, so a normal study does not rule out steroid myopathy and should be interpreted in clinical context [^notfound].

> Let me consider imaging carefully; muscle MRI with STIR or T2 fat-suppressed sequences can detect edema and help localize active inflammation, which supports an inflammatory myopathy rather than pure steroid atrophy, and combining MRI with targeted biopsy can improve diagnostic yield when inflammatory myopathy is suspected; however, in steroid myopathy, MRI may be less informative unless there is coexisting inflammation, so I should use MRI selectively when the differential includes inflammatory mimics or when biopsy site selection is needed [^115pxPrM] [^114BH3Qe].

> I will now examine when to pursue muscle biopsy; if the diagnosis remains uncertain after clinical assessment, labs, EMG, and imaging, or if I suspect an inflammatory or necrotizing myopathy rather than pure steroid toxicity, a biopsy can show type II fiber atrophy without significant inflammation in steroid myopathy, whereas inflammatory myopathies demonstrate endomysial or perimysial inflammation, necrosis, or immune-mediated patterns; I should double-check that the sampled muscle is clinically involved to maximize diagnostic yield [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a statin or has statin exposure; I should actively consider statin-associated myopathy, including anti-HMGCR immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, which presents with severe proximal weakness and marked CK elevation and may persist despite statin withdrawal, requiring immunosuppression; I should also keep inclusion body myositis in mind in older adults with slowly progressive, treatment-resistant proximal and distal weakness, and remember critical illness myopathy in ICU settings where high-dose steroids, neuromuscular blockade, and sepsis converge [^112H5kji] [^114jX1Tz] [^112JBA3u] [^115FWiq5].

> Let me synthesize the diagnostic approach: in a patient with proximal weakness and compatible steroid exposure, normal or mildly elevated CK, and supportive EMG or MRI, steroid myopathy is likely; if CK is significantly elevated, I should reconsider inflammatory or necrotizing myopathies and pursue autoantibodies, MRI, and biopsy as indicated; if the patient is in the ICU with flaccid quadriparesis and ventilator dependence, I should evaluate for critical illness myopathy with electrophysiology and consider biopsy; throughout, I should correlate with the temporal relationship to steroid initiation and dose changes to avoid premature closure [^114BH3Qe] [^115FWiq5].

> I should confirm management implications that also inform diagnosis; early steroid dose reduction or taper, when clinically safe, often leads to measurable improvement in strength within 2 to 3 weeks, which can serve as a therapeutic corroboration of steroid myopathy, and concurrent initiation of structured resistance and aerobic exercise with physiatry support is recommended to mitigate further atrophy and restore function; if weakness persists despite dose reduction, I need to revisit the differential and re-evaluate for alternative or overlapping etiologies [^115YBhQn] [^112fYynb] [^117An9CZ].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric and oncology-specific nuances; in pediatric ALL and other malignancy contexts, steroid myopathy is a recognized toxicity and may present with proximal limb and neck flexor weakness, occasionally with respiratory muscle involvement, so I should proactively screen, document functional baselines, and plan dose-sparing strategies and rehabilitation early in high-risk regimens [^112uSsXV] [^117RN3gg].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal monitoring; for patients who must remain on steroids, I should track functional measures such as timed sit-to-stand or stair climbing, watch for falls, and periodically reassess CK only if symptoms evolve, while also addressing bone health, infection prophylaxis, and metabolic complications per consensus guidance, so that I do not miss evolving neuromuscular complications masked by multifactorial morbidity [^113sNSnQ] [^115Ezngk] [^111zR34f].

Steroid myopathy is diagnosed by a combination of **clinical features, exposure history, and exclusion of other causes** [^1124aDBs]. The hallmark is **proximal muscle weakness** (hip and shoulder girdles) with relative sparing of distal strength, often with atrophy and fatigue, developing after **≥ 4 weeks** of systemic glucocorticoids, especially at **≥ 40 mg/day prednisone equivalent** [^111HxQ8E] [^115YBhQn]. Creatine kinase is typically normal or mildly elevated, and EMG shows **myopathic changes** without denervation [^notfound]. Muscle biopsy, if performed, reveals type II fiber atrophy without inflammation [^116xL8LX]. Exclude inflammatory myopathies, metabolic myopathies, and neuromuscular junction disorders with clinical assessment, labs, and imaging [^116HjQQn]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by exposure history and exclusion of alternatives [^1124aDBs].

---

## Clinical features and history

- **Proximal muscle weakness**: Difficulty rising from a chair, climbing stairs, or lifting objects; neck flexors may be affected [^117An9CZ].

- **Atrophy**: Proximal muscle wasting, especially in the lower limbs [^116nn3Tj].

- **Fatigue and reduced endurance**: Common complaints [^117An9CZ].

- **Exposure history**: Systemic glucocorticoids (oral or IV) for ≥ 4 weeks, particularly ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone equivalent; fluorinated steroids (e.g. dexamethasone) increase risk [^111HxQ8E] [^115YBhQn].

- **Relative sparing**: Distal strength and sensation are usually preserved [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory tests

Creatine kinase (CK) is typically normal or mildly elevated (** ≤ 5× ULN**) [^notfound]. Routine labs (CBC, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function) are generally normal, helping exclude metabolic or systemic causes [^notfound].

---

## Electrophysiological studies

Electromyography (EMG) shows **myopathic changes** (short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials with early recruitment) without denervation [^notfound]. Nerve conduction studies are **normal**, excluding neuropathy [^notfound].

---

## Muscle biopsy

Muscle biopsy is **not routinely required** but may be used to exclude other myopathies. Typical findings include type II fiber atrophy without inflammation, distinguishing it from inflammatory myopathies [^117Kh2oR].

---

## Imaging studies

Muscle MRI is not routinely used but may show **muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration** in chronic cases, supporting the diagnosis [^112VY5C7].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Inflammatory myopathies**: Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) [^112gzmX1].

- **Metabolic myopathies**: Glycogen storage diseases, mitochondrial myopathies [^1175yoUF].

- **Neuromuscular junction disorders**: Myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome [^116HjQQn].

- **Other drug-induced myopathies**: Statins, colchicine, zidovudine [^1124aDBs].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

There are **no universally accepted diagnostic criteria**; diagnosis is clinical and supported by exposure history and exclusion of other causes [^117An9CZ]. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) emphasize clinical assessment, exposure history, and exclusion of other causes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical assessment tools

Manual muscle testing (MMT) is commonly used to **quantify weakness and monitor response** [^112VTcmV]. Functional tests such as the **timed up-and-go, stair-climbing, and chair-rise tests** assess functional impairment and treatment response [^notfound].

---

## Management and follow-up

Management centers on **reducing or tapering glucocorticoids** when feasible, with strength often improving within 2–3 weeks of dose reduction [^111HxQ8E]. Physical therapy with resistance and aerobic exercise helps maintain and restore muscle mass and function [^112fYynb]. Follow-up should include regular strength and functional assessments to track recovery and detect complications [^112fYynb].

---

Steroid myopathy is a **clinical diagnosis** characterized by proximal weakness, atrophy, and fatigue after systemic glucocorticoids, with normal or mildly elevated CK, myopathic EMG, and exclusion of other causes. Management includes dose reduction, exercise, and ongoing monitoring.

### Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy: a comprehensive review [^117An9CZ]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy (GIM) is a prevalent and often underdiagnosed condition that significantly impacts the quality of life and functional capabilities of affected individuals. This review summarises the current understanding of GIM, focussing on its pathophysiology, diagnostic challenges, and emerging therapeutic strategies.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant studies on GIM. Databases, such as PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, were searched using keywords related to GIM, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Studies were selected based on their relevance to the topic and the quality of their methodologies.

Results

GIM is characterised by proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, persistent fatigue, and reduced muscular endurance, predominantly affecting the lower limbs. The pathophysiology involves both catabolic and anti-anabolic mechanisms, leading to the degradation of muscle proteins and inhibiting protein synthesis. Diagnostic challenges include the nonspecific nature of symptoms and the lack of sensitive biomarkers. Emerging therapeutic strategies include the use of growth hormones, insulin-like growth factor-1, branched-chain amino acids, and creatine although their efficacy in humans requires further validation. Physical therapy, particularly resistance and aerobic exercise, has shown promise in managing GIM.

Conclusions

The diagnosis and management of GIM require a multifaceted approach, including early diagnosis, optimised corticosteroid use, and targeted therapies. Future research should focus on developing improved biomarkers for early detection, exploring genetic susceptibility, and validating the efficacy of emerging therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes for patients with GIM.

### Clinical and pathological aspects of toxic myopathies [^117Kh2oR]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

As the most frequent cause of acquired myopathy, toxic myopathies are characterised by clinicopathological features that vary depending on the mode of action of the drugs or toxins involved. Although a large number of substances can induce myotoxicity, the main culprits are statins, alcohol, and corticosteroids. A rigorous, well-organised diagnostic approach is necessary to obtain a rapid diagnosis. For early diagnosis and management, it is important for clinicians to be aware that most toxic myopathies are potentially reversible, and the goal of treatment should be to avoid serious muscle damage.

### Steroid myopathy in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease treated with high-dose steroid therapy [^116a2aFR]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

High-dose steroids are the first line of treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Steroid myopathy is a debilitating steroid-induced complication that significantly impairs a patient's performance status. To determine the frequency and severity of steroid myopathy and other steroid related complications in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who developed grade ≥ 2 aGVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), we performed a retrospective analysis. Patients were included in the analysis if they had a diagnosis of AML/MDS, underwent an allogeneic HSCT between January 1996 and December 2001 and developed grade ≥ 2 aGVHD that was treated with 2 mg/kg of methylprednisolone and survived at least 100 days post transplant. A total of 70 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Steroid myopathy was identified in 29 (41%) patients. Steroid myopathy was generally of moderate severity with severe debilitating steroid myopathy seen in only 3% of patients. We concluded that steroid myopathy is a common complication of high-dose steroid therapy after allogeneic HSCT in AML/MDS. Interventions aimed at preventing and treating this complication are warranted and need to be explored in prospective clinical trials.

### Persisting muscle dysfunction in Cushing's syndrome despite biochemical remission [^116nn3Tj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy with self-reported muscle weakness is present in up to 60% of patients with florid Cushing's syndrome (CS). It is reported to be more frequent in men than in women. The development of proximal muscle wasting and weakness is also a typical side effect of systemic glucocorticoid treatment. Based on the common use of steroids for the treatment of several medical conditions, exogenous glucocorticoids have become the most common reason for drug-induced myopathy.

Cushing's syndrome-associated myopathy particularly affects the proximal part of the limbs. The clinical management of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy is difficult, as patients typically experience relevant muscular impairment at the time of initial diagnosis. Quantitative muscle ultrasound is proposed to be a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of CS before the development of symptoms. A specific therapy is not available so far, and current treatment recommendations consist of adequate protein intake and moderate physical exercise. Given that endogenous CS is a rare disease, so far, associated myopathy has been studied only in small patient cohorts. Several characteristic clinical features of CS, including cognitive impairments, fatigue, and an increased cardiovascular risk, can persist even years after a successful cure. We and others have suggested that CS-associated myopathy and muscle damage may continue in the early recovery phase after successful treatment, but its long-term prognosis and outcome is unknown. In retrospective, cross-sectional studies, patients in long-term remission showed decreased muscle strength and a lower aerobic exercise capacity compared to controls. Whether this finding is due to a long-term change of muscle fibers in terms of an irreversible myopathy or due to a persisting cardiorespiratory dysfunction remains controversial. To analyze the long-term outcome of muscle dysfunction in CS, we evaluated the prospective data of the German Cushing's Registry.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: definition and management of refractory disease [^116HrhEJ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, commonly referred to as myositis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases with an autoimmune etiology. In this review, the authors are going to focus on myositis excluding inclusion body myositis. They will review the prognostic factors (for mortality and response to steroids), define refractory disease, introduce a new concept (presumed refractory disease), analyze definitions of active disease, damage and improvement criteria, and summarize therapeutic alternatives for refractory patients, based on different disease phenotypes.

### Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in people with asthma: a systematic review [^115esgWU]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review the current literature on the evidence and the underlying characteristics of glucocorticoids (type, dosage, and duration) associated with myopathy in asthma.

Data Sources

Four electronic databases were searched to October 19, 2020.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria: adults or adolescents with asthma, taking systemic glucocorticoids, and measures of muscle impairments.

Results

Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. The methodologic quality of most studies was fair or good. Two studies reported significantly lower inspiratory muscle function in outpatients taking daily oral glucocorticoids (≥ 10mg), but one study reported no such difference. No differences was found in limb muscle strength in one study. Only 11–36% patients with acute exacerbation taking glucocorticoids intravenously suffered from limb muscle weakness during/after critical care admissions. Two studies reported significant associations between dosage of oral glucocorticoid use and inspiratory and limb muscle function, whereas seven studies did not find any significant correlations among the characteristics of systemic glucocorticoids and myopathy. Two studies comparing people with non-glucocorticoid dependent asthma taking inhaled glucocorticoid and healthy people did not find any significant differences in their inspiratory muscle strength and endurance.

Conclusions

There were limited studies and inconsistent results on glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in people with asthma, and its association with the characteristics of glucocorticoids use. We recommended future studies should use a commonly accepted operational definition of myopathy, utilize a cohort study design, measure the cumulative dosage of glucocorticoids, and integrate possible confounding factors in the analysis.

### What to do with the weight while preparing for CAR-T? [^1139afn1]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cancer cachexia, malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty (Figure 1) have all been indicted as contributors to poor outcomes for those who are undergoing CAR-T. These 4 entities are intertwined yet distinct, both diagnostically and in their management, causing significant confusion for hematologists. Cancer cachexia is a catabolic inflammatory syndrome with complex metabolic changes to the host, which leads to weight loss and loss of skeletal muscle mass, driven by the underlying malignancy. The diagnostic criteria for cancer cachexia reflect manifestations of the syndrome rather than a deep understanding of the biologic processes that drive cancer cachexia, which are poorly described to date. The diagnostic criteria, currently use a combination of weight loss, BMI, symptoms (eg, fatigue, anorexia), inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, albumin), and phenotypic criteria (low muscle strength). Sarcopenia, defined as loss of muscle mass and function, is part of the normal aging process but is also frequently a complication of cancer through cancer cachexia and myotoxic chemotherapeutic or supportive care agents (eg, steroid-induced myopathy). Malnutrition is an imbalance between the growth and breakdown of body tissues and nutrient stores and leads to a loss of muscle and organ mass, either because of nutrient deficiencies or inflammation from an underlying disease. Finally, frailty, commonly diagnosed using the Fried Frailty phenotype, is a syndrome characterized by decreased physiological reserve and a heightened vulnerability to stressors. When considering how to intervene in a patient who meets the diagnostic criteria for these entities, clearly defining which limitation a patient has may have significant impact on their clinical improvement. For example, for a patient with cancer cachexia who are experiencing sarcopenia and malnutrition secondarily, management without targeting the underlying biologic mechanisms of cancer cachexia is unlikely to yield clinical benefit. In contrast, a patient with malnutrition and secondary sarcopenia owing to low nutrition intake only as a consequence of resource scarcity would likely rapidly improve with dietary intervention alone. Not surprisingly, a previous pilot report indicated the heterogeneous ability of body metric and laboratory-based criteria to predict cachexia-related clinical and functional outcomes after CAR-T, suggesting a possible avenue for the identification of subphenotypes of muscle wasting.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^112fYynb]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Musculoskeletal complications after HCT — glucocorticoid-related myopathy should be addressed by routine screening and activity guidance. Routinely evaluate patients on glucocorticoid treatment for glucocorticoid-induced myopathies, and patients with/ at risk for steroid myopathy should engage in physical activity and physical therapy. Practical points include to observe patient rising from a squatting position, note that physiatry referral may be helpful, and use low resistance exercise to prevent/ slow loss of muscle mass.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^112cts1E]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Recommendations are followed by parentheses detailing GRADE and SoA details (strength of recommendation, quality of body of evidence, SoA).

(i) How should skeletal muscle inflammation (myositis) be treated?

1 -High dose glucocorticoids should be used to treat active muscle inflammation at time of treatment induction (1, B, 100%).

1a - Adult-specific. Oral prednisolone at a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, usually 40–60 mg, is recommended (1, B, 100%).

1b - Paediatric-specific. Oral prednisolone at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day or intravenous methylprednisolone pulses 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g daily i.v. dose is recommended (1, B, 100%).

1c -Intravenous methylprednisolone is to be considered, especially when there are concerns about gastrointestinal absorption. Use of intravenous methylprednisolone may allow increased therapeutic effect and less toxicity compared with oral glucocorticoid (2, B, 96%).

2 -Oral prednisolone should be tapered according to clinical response (1, B, 100%).

3 -Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs should be used to reduce muscle inflammation, achieve clinical remission and reduce steroid burden (1, C, 100%).

3a - Paediatric-specific. Early, complete control of muscle weakness and inflammation should be sought in juvenile-onset IIM, with the aim of improving outcomes and reducing disease-related complications (1, B, 100%).

3b - Paediatric-specific. A combination of high dose glucocorticoid and methotrexate should be used as first-line treatment in most cases (1, B, 100%).

3c - Paediatric-specific. A combination of prednisolone and methotrexate, as opposed to prednisolone and ciclosporin, should be used for the treatment of juvenile-onset IIM as this has a more favourable side effect profile (1, B, 100%).

### Inclusion body myositis: an underdiagnosed myopathy of older people [^112JBA3u]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Inclusion body myositis (IBM), a condition characterised by progressive muscle weakness and inclusion bodies visible on muscle biopsy, is the most common type of myopathy in patients over 50 years of age. However, it is not only under diagnosed but frequently misdiagnosed as polymyositis and hence wrongly treated with steroids. In the evaluation of progressive weakness in older Caucasian males, IBM should be an important diagnostic consideration. Treatment-resistant 'polymyositis' in patients over 50 years of age is often IBM. If there is no histological confirmation, the diagnostic criteria allow for a category of 'possible IBM'. Sometimes, the diagnosis is missed because of the slow progression of the disease and a lack of suspicion on the part of physicians. The following case report and literature review will explore many of these issues.

### Necrotising myopathy, an unusual presentation of a steroid-responsive myopathy [^113oF6na]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical features, muscle pathology and response to treatment in patients with a necrotising myopathy, without mononuclear cell infiltrates.

Background

Mononuclear cell infiltrates in the muscle biopsy specimen are the diagnostic hallmark of the immune-mediated idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). In patients with the typical clinical features of IIM, absence of these infiltrates in the muscle biopsy specimen casts doubt on the diagnosis and leads to uncertainty about therapeutical strategies.

Methods

A detailed description is given of the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological features of eight patients suspected of having an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, in whom mononuclear cell infiltrates in their muscle biopsy specimens were lacking.

Results

Eight patients (five men, three women, age range 40–69 years) had severe, symmetrical proximal weakness with a subacute onset. There were no skin abnormalities suggesting dermatomyositis. Serum creatine kinase activity was more than 10 times elevated. Repeated muscle biopsy specimens, taken from a symptomatic muscle prior to immunosuppressive treatment showed widespread necrosis, regeneration, and atrophy of muscle fibres, but no mononuclear cell infiltrates. Known causes of necrotising myopathy were excluded. Three patients had a malignancy. Adequately dosed and sustained immunosuppressive treatment eventually resulted in normal or near normal muscle strength in seven patients. One patient showed marked improvement.

Conclusion

Occasionally, patients who clinically present as an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy may lack mononuclear cell infiltrates in their muscle biopsy specimens. This subacute-onset progressive necrotising myopathy should not deter the clinician from timely and appropriate treatment as we consider this myopathy to be steroid-responsive with a possible immune-mediated pathogenesis.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^113tYoWg]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

According to guidelines, glucocorticoids with an initial dose (prednisone equivalent) of 1 mg/kg body weight per day, combined with azathioprine or methotrexate, are sufficient in most cases on the new diagnosis of DM. As other cases with severe clinical courses benefitted from high-dose glucocorticoid regimens, we opted for the same approach, which later necessitated a second-line therapy with IVIG due to symptom exacerbation under first-line therapy.

Learning points

In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a comprehensive clinical evaluation — including diagnostic investigations such as laboratory parameters and antibody profiling — is essential for accurate diagnosis.
Both clinical and laboratory findings can provide valuable insights into the risk of an underlying malignancy.
Cancer screening should be guided by risk stratification to avoid missing a malignancy and to ensure appropriate causal treatment.
A thorough search for rarely associated malignancies is warranted.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^115kfMac]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Accurate case identification is key to IIM research and the recent publication of the EULAR/ACR classification criteria will potentially greatly improve IIM research through accurate case identification and standardization across studies. Clear diagnosis of the IIMs is important to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment instigation. Recent advances in knowledge of clinical features will aid the clinician in prognostication, treatment stratification and investigation for multisystem involvement.

### Advances in JDM: biomarker and MRI sensitivity, outcomes and steroid management in a Dutch national prospective cohort [^113XQf6L]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

JDM is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of childhood with an incidence of 2.0–4.0 per million children per year. It primarily affects muscles and skin but can involve other organs too. Both the traditional diagnostic criteria by Bohan and Peter (1975) and the more recent EULAR/ACR classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (2017) include muscle weakness, skin manifestations, elevated muscle enzymes and, if available, muscle biopsy features. However, recent advances such as use of MRI, myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) and IFN biomarkers as diagnostic tools have not yet been included in diagnostic and classification criteria, with the exception of anti-Jo-1 positivity.

With current treatment regimens, many patients experience a relapsing or chronic course. Prolonged immunosuppression, particularly corticosteroids, causes significant side effects, while persistent disease activity contributes to organ damage and complications such as calcinosis cutis. Evaluating patient outcomes and the role of diagnostic tools in clinical practice can help refine disease management and improve care.

This prospective study analyses JDM patient characteristics and outcomes across six Dutch academic hospitals over a total period of 16 years, providing insights into the effectiveness of biomarkers, diagnostic tools and treatment strategies.

### Steroid-induced myopathy in the ICU [^11541tX6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of steroid-induced myopathy resulting from prolonged administration of corticosteroids in an asthmatic patient in a medical intensive care unit.

Case Summary

A 30-year-old white man presented with status asthmaticus requiring intubation for respiratory failure. His hospital course was complicated by the need for reintubation and the development of "quadriplegia". Electromyography does not identify neuropathy. After rapid tapering of systemic steroids, the patient quickly regained muscle strength, was extubated, and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for prolonged physical therapy.

Discussion

Steroid-induced myopathy is a rare occurrence in the intensive care setting. Cases of myopathy that have been reported have been associated with prolonged and combined use of corticosteroids with neuromuscular blocking agents or aminoglycosides. Corticosteroids are thought to produce deleterious effects through 1 or all of 3 main pathways: altered electrical excitability of muscle fibers, loss of thick filaments, and/or inhibition of protein synthesis. All of these pathways are believed to increase the rate of muscle catabolism and result in loss of muscle movement.

Conclusions

Steroid-induced myopathy is a complication of high-dose steroid use. Unfortunately, in this patient, initial treatment of status asthmaticus required intravenous steroids in high doses to adequately treat the presenting illness. Clinicians should be aware of neuromuscular findings and act aggressively to appropriately eliminate systemic steroids from the treatment regimen.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain a thorough assessment of symptoms in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms, in addition to an evaluation for non-statin causes and predisposing factors.

### Pulmonary complications of inflammatory myopathy [^111sA6Xt]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications cause significant morbidity and mortality in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Advances in biomarker discovery have facilitated clinical phenotyping, allowing investigators to better define at-risk patient subsets and to potentially gauge disease activity. This serologic characterization has complemented more traditional assessment tools. Pharmacologic management continues to rely on the use of corticosteroids, often in combination with additional immunosuppressive agents. The rarity of myositis-associated interstitial lung disease and lack of controlled trials have limited analyses of treatment efficacy, mandating the development of standardized outcome measures and improvement of data sharing between disciplines.

### An overview of polymyositis and dermatomyositis [^1157Hdr8]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are inflammatory myopathies that differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. Treatment relies mainly upon empirical use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. A deeper understanding of the molecular pathways that drive pathogenesis, careful phenotyping, and accurate disease classification will aid clinical research and development of more efficacious treatments. In this review we address the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic evaluation, classification, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

### Steroid myopathy in patients with chronic respiratory diseases [^116DM8vq]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a well known clinical entity, and experimental studies showed decreased rate of protein synthesis and increased rate of protein breakdown in muscles of chronically treated animals.

Objective

The present observational study was aimed to evaluate skeletal muscle functions in asthmatics and patients with other chronic respiratory diseases treated by inhaled or oral corticosteroids.

Methods

Thirty six patients with respiratory diseases were included into the study. The physician-rated peripheral motor deficits scale, stepper test and ankle/wrist index were used for assessment of muscle functions. The effects of length of glucocorticoids intake on muscle functions were evaluated.

Results

Sixty five per cent of patients using corticosteroids daily during 1 year and longer reported weakness in legs, and 20% of these patients demonstrated objective signs of the muscle weakness. The performance on the stepper test was significantly worse in patients chronically using corticosteroids in comparison with the control group (10.9 ± 3.4 steps vs 16.1 ± 2.4 steps per 10s, respectively; F = 21.6, p < 0.001). In addition, a proportion of patients using corticosteroids for at least 18 months were characterized by muscle hypotrophy at a dominant leg.

Conclusion

Chronic intake of inhaled corticosteroids induces clinically significant decrease of muscle functions at least after 1-year of daily treatment.

### Outcomes in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myopathy and prolonged follow-up [^115LoGQv]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, yet they are associated with significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Neurologic irAEs are reported in 1%–5% of patients, with myopathy being the most common. While ICI-related myopathy has high mortality rates, patients who survive seem to have a favorable myopathy outcome.

Current treatment guidelines suggest discontinuation of ICI treatment, administration of high-dose corticosteroids with a gradual taper over 4–6 weeks, and consideration of additional immunosuppression/immunomodulation, depending on treatment response. However, despite recent data pointing to a chronic disease course in nearly 30% of patients, there are no consensus treatment guidelines for the long-term management of these patients and practices range from a short corticosteroid taper to prolonged maintenance immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments.

We reviewed the medical charts of all patients with ICI-related myopathy and available long-term follow-up data of ≥ 6 months treated at our institution, with the goal of characterizing their long-term outcomes and informing long-term treatment choices.

### Neurotoxicity of cancer treatment [^111uAQGR]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Cancer therapy — including brain-directed surgery, brain or spine irradiation, or chemotherapy — may affect the nervous system in a deleterious manner, affecting either the central or peripheral nervous systems. The causation of encephalopathy (eg, radiation, chemotherapy) is most relevant for the differential diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, as defining a specific cause determines further treatment and outcome. Peripheral nervous system disorders (ie, steroid myopathy, spindle poison, or platinum neuropathy) are predominantly treatment related and respond best to discontinuation of the neurotoxic agent.

### Recent developments in classification criteria and diagnosis guidelines for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^117GZhty]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

The newly developed classification criteria provide robust methods for identifying IIM cases for research purposes; however, their use is not designed nor recommended for use in clinical practice.

Accurate diagnosis of an IIM is key to appropriate treatment instigation, prognostication and prevention of complications. However, diagnosis and subtype identification in clinical settings can be challenging, in part due to potential multisystem involvement and wide variations between subtype manifestations. Currently, no clear diagnostic criteria for the IIMs exist. However, findings from clinically focused research studies can aid a clinician's diagnostic accuracy, identification of factors associated with prognosis and guide investigation of multisystem involvement.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — bone fractures, pancreatitis, and steroid myopathy: For bone fractures associated with steroids, hold steroids until fractures are healed (based on radiographic or symptomatic improvement), then resume without dose modification, and bisphosphonates for patients with recurrent fracture and severe osteopenia may be considered. For pancreatitis, dexamethasone may be held at discretion of treating oncologist. Steroid myopathy may present with proximal limb and neck flexor weakness and respiratory muscles may also become weak in more severe cases; consider holding or reducing the dose per treatment protocol and consider physical therapy referral. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Steroid-induced myopathy in patients intubated due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111aU2FV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine incidence, risk factors and impact on various outcome parameters of the development of acute quadriplegic myopathy in a selected population of critically ill patients.

Setting

A prospective cohort study carried out in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-level university hospital.

Patients

All patients admitted due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and received high doses of intravenous corticosteroids.

Interventions

A neurophysiological study was performed in all cases at the onset of weaning. Muscular biopsy was taken when the neurophysiological study revealed a myopathic pattern.

Measurements and Results

Twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study. Nine patients (34.6%) developed myopathy. Only seven patients were treated with muscle relaxants. Histology confirmed the diagnosis in the three patients who underwent muscle biopsy. APACHE II score at admission, the rate of sepsis and the total doses of corticosteroids were significantly higher in patients with myopathy compared with those patients that did not develop it. Myopathy is associated with an increase in the duration of mechanical ventilation [15.4 (9.2) versus 5.7 (3.9) days; p < 0.006], the length of ICU stay [23.6 (10.7) versus 11.4 (7.05) days; p < 0.003] and hospital stay [33.3 (19.2) versus 21.2 (16.1) days; p < 0.034)]. Myopathy was not associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

In the population under study, severity of illness at admission, the development of sepsis and the total dose of corticosteroids are factors associated with the occurrence of myopathy after the administration of corticosteroids. Myopathy was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and in-hospital stay.

### Critical illness myopathy [^115FWiq5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the incidence, major risk factors, and the clinical, electrophysiological, and histological features of critical illness myopathy (CIM). Major pathogenetic mechanisms and long-term consequences of CIM are also reviewed.

Recent Findings

CIM is frequently associated with critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), and may have a relevant impact on patients' outcome. CIM has an earlier onset than CIP, and recovery is faster. Loss of myosin filaments on muscle biopsy is important to diagnose CIM, and has a good prognosis. Critical illness, use of steroids, and immobility concur in causing CIM.

Summary

A rationale diagnostic approach to CIM using clinical, electrophysiological, and muscle biopsy investigations is important to plan adequate therapy and to predict recovery.

### Acute corticosteroid-responsive post-infection myositis in adults [^116QXMyN]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional disability myalgia is a common condition that frequently leads to significant disability, but its diagnosis is challenging because of its diverse etiologies. While hereditary myalgia has been wells tudied, infection-related myalgia, particularly post-infection forms, remains underrecognized. In this study, six adult patients with severe post-infection myalgia were described. The mean age of onset for these patients was 63.2 ± 16.2 years. All patients experienced myalgia and muscle weakness in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs, which occurred 1–4 weeks after the recovery from symptoms of suspected viral infection, resulting in a significant functional disability. Laboratory tests revealed that creatine kinase levels were not elevated, yet increases in C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6 levels were observed. Muscle MRI demonstrated significant edema in the lower limb muscles of 5 patients, while muscle biopsy indicated mild inflammatory myopathy changes in 5 patients. Severe muscle pain were unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but showed a significant response to steroids, and most patients had favorable prognoses. These clinical features differed from previously documented cases of post-infection myositis, suggesting a distinct subset of infection-related myalgia. Our findings highlighted the importance of recognizing this condition in adults and suggested the need for broader diagnostic criteria to better classify infection-related myopathies.

MUSCLE AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE COMPLICATIONS

Muscle and connective tissue complications after HCT are often associated with cGVHD and its treatment and include glucocorticoid-induced myopathy, fasciitis/deep sclerosis, polymyositis, and myasthenia gravis (Table 9, Supplementary Table S11). Steroid myopathy typically presents with proximal muscle weakness, difficulty rising from a squatting position, and atrophy of these muscle groups. Although an improvement in strength may occur by 2 to 3 weeks after steroid reduction, complete resolution can take longer. The use of fluorinated glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone) is associated with a higher risk of myopathy compared with nonfluorinated glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone). Although there is significant variability in individual susceptibility to myopathy, ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is unlikely to result in myopathy, but ≥ 40 mg/day for ≥ 1 month usually causes weakness.

Fasciitis and polymyositis are cGVHD manifestations. Fasciitis may cause tightness or restricted range of motion on a photographic range of motion scale, with various combinations of visibly tight tendons in volar forearms/palms and palpable deep tissue sclerosis with overlying hyperpigmentation and "groove" signs. Along with cGVHD treatment, patients with fasciitis may benefit from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to control edema and preserve range of motion. Polymyositis usually presents with moderate to severe proximal muscle weakness and myalgia. Myasthenia gravis is a rare cGVHD complication that may be due to donor-derived antibodies against recipient acetylcholine receptors and manifests similar to classical myasthenia gravis, with most cases occurring > 2 years post-HCT.

Steroid myopathy presents with proximal weakness and "an improvement in strength may occur by 2 to 3 weeks after steroid reduction", with dose effects such that " < 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is unlikely to result in myopathy, but ≥ 40 mg/day for ≥ 1 month usually causes weakness". For cGVHD-associated fasciitis, "patients with fasciitis may benefit from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to control edema and preserve range of motion", and polymyositis "usually presents with moderate to severe proximal muscle weakness and myalgia". Myasthenia gravis linked to cGVHD tends to be delayed, with "most cases occurring > 2 years post-HCT".

### Enzyme elevation in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis and steroid myopathy [^112VTcmV]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Steroid myopathy can occur in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) receiving chronic steroid therapy. We report an elevation of serum muscle enzymes, normal strength by manual muscle testing (MMT), and electromyographic (EMG) findings of steroid myopathy in children with JDM.

Methods

We prospectively studied children with JDM with a history of chronic steroid use (> 3 mo) and ongoing inflammatory myositis who were referred to our institution.

Results

We identified 5/9 children with JDM receiving longterm high dose steroids who had muscle enzyme elevation with no definable weakness and EMG findings consistent with steroid myopathy. All subjects improved after withdrawal of their steroid therapy.

Conclusion

Longterm high dose steroids may lead to steroid myopathy with muscle enzyme elevation, previously reported only with acute steroid myopathy. We recommend that muscle derived enzyme levels should not be used to differentiate steroid myopathy from inflammatory myopathies.

### Iatrogenic myopathies [^112pA98i]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent progress in understanding of myopathies induced by therapeutic agents, the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms and the management of iatrogenic muscle disorders, focussing on statin-associated myopathies.

Recent Findings

Recent reports from observational studies have provided further information on the frequency of statin-associated myalgia and myopathy, which is the most important group of iatrogenic muscle disorders in current clinical practice, and on the relative myotoxicity of different statins and interactions with other therapeutic agents. However, there is still a need for further prospective studies with more clearly defined diagnostic criteria for statin myopathy and comparative studies of patient cohorts treated with different statins to determine the true incidence of myopathy as an adverse effect. Other important advances include recognition that genetic variants and mutations in the SLCO1B1, CYP and COQ2 genes may determine individual susceptibility to statin myopathy, and that statins may also initiate immune-mediated forms of necrotizing and inflammatory myopathy and unmask or aggravate various metabolic myopathies and other neuromuscular disorders.

Summary

Recent reports have broadened the spectrum of iatrogenic myopathies and neuromuscular disorders associated with statins, and have thrown further light on the role of genetic predisposing factors, the mechanisms of myotoxicity and the management of such cases.

### Statin-induced debilitating weakness and myopathy [^1164QtMa]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A large percentage of the US population is either receiving or should be considered for statin therapy. Whether through primary or secondary prevention for atherosclerotic disease, statins remain one of the mainstay options available to physicians. Myalgias are the most commonly reported side effects, though largely self-limited and subjective in nature. Here, we report a case of drug-related myonecrosis following long-term use of atorvastatin. Prompt recognition of the condition and initiation of treatment is paramount to control the disease's progression. While high-dose steroids are first line, quick escalation to methotrexate, IVIG or rituximab should be considered in refractory cases. This decision is guided by monitoring of serum markers such as CK and transaminases. The goal is quick normalisation of these enzymes, signalling cessation of underlying muscle necrosis. Patients may never regain full function and treatment can last months to years.

### Up-to-date treatment and management of myositis [^115uBSPB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Myositis, or idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, is an overarching concept that includes dermatomyositis, polymyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and the antisynthetase syndrome. Glucocorticoids are still considered the mainstay of treatment of myositis but some patients require add-on immunosuppressive therapy because of insufficient response to glucocorticoids, relapses when glucocorticoids are tapered, or because they incur glucocorticoid-related side effects.

Recent Findings

The goal of this article was to review (PubMed search from January 2019 through June 2020) the efficacy and safety of standard and novel agents used in adult dermatomyositis, polymyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and the antisynthetase syndrome.

Summary

Established therapies beyond glucocorticoids continue to have a major role in managing patients with myositis. In addition, novel agents are being tried for refractory manifestations of myositis.

### Outcomes in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myopathy and prolonged follow-up [^116BMD4c]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Two-thirds of patients (70%, 16/23) had residual symptoms/signs at 6 months, and this number gradually declined to 40% (6/15) at 12 months (Figure 3B). Dissecting whether these symptoms/signs represent ongoing inflammation or simply residual damage to muscle tissue is challenging, but patients who stopped immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments at 3 months continued to improve over time from a neurologic perspective. This suggests that the gradual improvement noted over the span of 12 months may represent slow muscle recuperation and compensatory mechanisms rather than active persistent inflammation. Nevertheless, reports of patients with long-term corticosteroid dependency, including a patient in our cohort who experienced an exacerbation on corticosteroid taper 4 months from symptom onset, suggest that some patients may experience chronic inflammation. Future studies prospectively following patients treated with a prolonged vs short treatment course would be necessary to identify optimal treatment duration but may be limited by the relative rarity of this disease and the multiple concomitant comorbidities that these patients have, which may affect both morbidity and mortality.

### Late-onset myopathy responsive to immunomodulatory treatment: sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy without nemaline rods? [^113w1azr]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Late-onset sporadic nemaline myopathy (SLONM) is a rare, treatable or potentially life-threatening muscle disorder that typically manifests late in life and is characterised by the presence of nemaline rods within muscle fibres, serving as the hallmark of the disease and the key to diagnosis.

Methods

We report a case of an elderly patient with subacute onset of severe weakness affecting the upper and lower limbs, neck extensors and abdominal muscles. A comprehensive laboratory workup was performed.

Results

Muscle biopsies showed nonspecific myopathic changes without inflammation, and electron microscopy did not reveal rods or aggregates. The laboratory workup was unremarkable except for the detection of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Steroid treatment was ineffective; however, there was a notable positive response to intravenous immunoglobulins. The neurological findings, subacute course, normal creatine kinase levels, presence of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and responsiveness to immunoglobulin treatment but not to steroids align with the characteristics of SLONM.

Conclusion

We propose that the diagnosis of SLONM should be considered even in the absence of nemaline rods in muscle biopsy, and this should not impede the consideration of immunomodulatory treatment. Future progress in understanding the pathogenetic basis of SLONM may reduce reliance on pathological findings in muscle biopsies for establishing the diagnosis.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^116HjQQn]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Muscular — assess range of motion at each clinic visit for patients with chronic GVHD; ideally with medical photos for subsequent comparison, and encourage patients to also perform self-assessment. Routinely evaluate patients on glucocorticoid treatment for glucocorticoid-induced myopathies; observe patient rising from a squatting position. Patients with/at risk for steroid myopathy should engage in physical activity and physical therapy; physiatry referral may be beneficial, low resistance exercise to prevent/slow loss of muscle mass. For persistent or progressive myalgia/weakness, chronic GVHD–associated polymyositis, statin toxicity or myasthenia gravis should be included in differential diagnosis, and CPK (creatine phosphokinase), aldolase, anti-acetylcholine antibodies are a reasonable next step; if negative, muscle MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EMG (electromyography) or muscle biopsy may be considered.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112tBTNP]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Oral glucocorticoids — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), oral glucocorticoids have numerous side effects, including steroid myopathy which can contribute to muscle weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in people with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or during emergency department visits have been shown to reduce the rate of treatment failure, the rate of relapse and to improve lung function and breathlessness, whereas prospective studies on the long-term effects in stable COPD are limited. Therefore, while they play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.

### Inflammatory myopathies: management of steroid resistance [^117FcPMM]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The inflammatory myopathies include polymyositis, dermatomyositis, necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). On the basis of clinical experience, most patients respond to corticosterioids to some degree or for a time period. For patients insufficiently responding or for steroid-sparing, the treatment options vary among practitioners, generating a genuine uncertainty. This timely review highlights emerging new therapies and provides practical therapeutic algorithms.

Recent Findings

For patients insufficiently responding to corticosteroids, the commonly used immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate, or cyclosporine, may exert a nonevidence-based 'steroid-sparing' effect but provide minimal benefit on their own. The second line therapy is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) based on a controlled study conducted in dermatomyositis; the drug is also effective in many patients with polymyositis and NAM. Rituximab and tacrolimus may offer additional benefit. Anti-TNF agents are disappointing. IBM remains difficult to treat; although early on some patients may partially respond to steroids or IVIg, they soon become unresponsive and the disease progresses. Emerging agents against T cells, B cells, and transmigration molecules are discussed as promising therapeutic options.

Summary

New biological agents are in the offing for control trials. Appropriate outcome measures are however needed to assess and monitor responses.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-related adverse reactions and risks are commonly seen during the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory neuromuscular disorders, and the aim was to develop international consensus guidance on the management of GC-related complications in neuromuscular disorders. American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) consensus guidance was developed by an international task force of 15 experts using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM). Initial guidance statements were crafted after a thorough literature review and modified after anonymous panel input, with up to three rounds of voting via email to achieve consensus. Statements achieved consensus for general care, monitoring of patients while on GC, osteoporosis prevention, vaccinations, infection screening, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis, and a multidisciplinary approach was emphasized.

### Neuromuscular manifestations of critical illness [^1143sc2g]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

Critical illness, more precisely defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), occurs in 20%-50% of patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 1 week in an intensive care unit. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy (CIM), singly or in combination, occur commonly in these patients and present as limb weakness and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. Critical illness myopathy can be subdivided into thick-filament (myosin) loss, cachectic myopathy, acute rhabdomyolysis, and acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care. SIRS is the predominant underlying factor in CIP and is likely a factor in CIM even though the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids predominate in CIM. Identification and characterization of the polyneuropathy and myopathy depend upon neurological examination, electrophysiological studies, measurement of serum creatine kinase, and, if features suggest a myopathy, muscle biopsy. The information is valuable in deciding treatment and prognosis.

### Sarcoidosis, granulomas and myopathy syndromes: a clinical-pathology review [^113nVnSZ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Muscle involvement in sarcoidosis is common by pathologic analysis, but symptomatic disorders are less frequent. Sarcoidosis-related muscle pathology includes non-caseating granulomas, muscle fiber changes that are diffuse or anatomically related to granulomas, and perimysial connective tissue with histiocyte-associated damage. The mechanisms by which granulomas form, enlarge and damage muscle tissues are incompletely understood. Sarcoidosis-related clinical syndromes with muscle involvement include: chronic myopathies with proximal weakness; nodular disorders; subacute onset disorders involving proximal or eye muscles; myalgia or fatigue syndromes; and, possibly, inclusion body myositis-like disorders. Corticosteroid treatment may benefit some syndromes, but clinical trials are necessary.

### Combining MRI and muscle biopsy improves diagnostic accuracy in subacute-onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^114BH3Qe]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 10–20% of patients with subacute-onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), muscle biopsy is normal or shows nonspecific findings. MRI can be used as a triage test before muscle biopsy and as an add-on test if the biopsy is nondiagnostic.

Methods

MRI scans of skeletal muscles and muscle biopsies were evaluated prospectively in 48 patients suspected to have IIM. The interpretations of MRI and muscle biopsy were compared with the definite diagnosis (based on European Neuromuscular Centre criteria and response to corticosteroids).

Results

The false negative rate (FNR) of all muscle biopsies was 0.23. Biopsies of a muscle showing hyperintensity on MRI (as triage test) had an FNR of 0.19. The result of MRI as an add-on test in patients with a nondiagnostic muscle biopsy decreased the FNR from 0.23 to 0.06.

Conclusions

We recommend both MRI and muscle biopsy in patients suspected of having IIM.

### Late-onset myopathy responsive to immunomodulatory treatment: sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy without nemaline rods? [^111x1Ewz]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

If nemaline rods had been detected in the biopsy of our patient, there would have been no doubt regarding the diagnosis of SLONM. This certainty arises from the typical neurological findings with neck extensor weakness, subacute course, normal CK levels, presence of MGUS and responsiveness to immunoglobulin treatment but not to steroids.

The absence of rods in biopsy might stem from sampling errors, the potential occurrence of rods at later stages of the disease, or even their absence in some patients. Other diseases initially defined by specific pathological findings have been subsequently diagnosed even in the absence of those characteristic pathological hallmarks after the discovery of the underlying causes. Perhaps, future advancements in comprehending the pathogenetic basis of SLONM will diminish the dependence on pathological findings in muscle biopsies.

### Immunotherapies for immune-mediated myopathies: a current perspective [^11455GQD]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Until recently, the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies has largely been empirical with glucocorticoids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, a proportion of patients are only partially responsive to these therapies, and there has been a need to consider alternative treatment approaches. In particular, patients with inclusion body myositis are resistant to conventional immunotherapies or show only a transient response, and remain a major challenge. With increasing recognition of the different subtypes of immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies, and improved understanding of their pathogenesis, more targeted treatments are now being trialled. The overall approach to treatment, and novel therapies targeting B cells, T cells, and specific cytokines are discussed in this review.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^115Ezngk]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis prevention in neuromuscular disease (NMD) is supported by the finding that there is an increased risk of vertebral fracture with GC dosing as low as 2.5 mg/day of prednisone, with the highest risk of bone loss being within the first 3 to 6 months, and the task force statements recommend osteoporosis prevention strategies at any dose of GC used for greater than 3 months, with implementation at the onset of GC therapy when the likelihood of being on GC for over 3 months is high. At the start of treatment and during active treatment with GC at any dose for > 3 months, screening for GC-induced osteoporosis should be recommended, preventative management should be instituted at any dose of glucocorticoid when used for > 3 months, and lifestyle modifications (balanced diet, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake, and regular weight-bearing exercise) should be recommended. Vitamin D supplementation at 600–800 IU/day and calcium intake of 1000–1200 mg/day should be recommended to all patients on any dose of GC for > 3 months unless there are contraindications, and if necessary, input on prescription pharmacologic treatment for GC-induced osteoporosis should be obtained from the primary care clinician and/or other appropriate specialists.

### Implications of glucocorticoid therapy in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1113VN2x]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of therapy in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), despite adverse effects and suboptimal therapy success rates. Glucocorticoids are used in patients with IIM to suppress inflammatory and immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Nevertheless, potential inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on skeletal muscle mass, myogenesis and immune responses that promote skeletal muscle regeneration after muscle injury warrant attention. Glucocorticoids lead to skeletal muscle catabolism by modulating major pathways involved in regulating muscle mass. Glucocorticoids also inhibit muscle regeneration by decreasing myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, glucocorticoids might have inhibitory effects on immune cells that have been shown to be an important component of the muscle regenerative response. Better understanding of the signalling pathways involved in restorative versus adverse effects of glucocorticoids in IIM could yield additional insight into the aetiopathogenesis of persistent muscle weakness in patients with IIM after glucocorticoid treatment, and help in the development of novel, targeted treatment options with fewer adverse effects.

### The incidence of anti-HMGCR immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy: an Australian and UK retrospective multi-site cohort study [^114jX1Tz]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Anti-HMGCR IMNM has an incidence of 2.9/million person-years in the adult population, and 20.4–24.1/million person-years in the statin-user population. Although rare, anti-HMGCR IMNM caused persistent weakness and reliance on glucocorticoids in approximately half of patients in this study. Therefore, maintaining vigilance and undertaking investigations in patients with a suggestive clinical phenotype is important to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

Unique subgroups of anti-HMGCR IMNM include statin-naïve patients and individuals with self-limiting disease who do not require immunosuppression to recover. Although progress has been made in formulating treatment and cancer-screening guidelines, there remains a significant research need to refine, improve and personalise management of patients with anti-HMGCR IMNM. Ultimately, further international collaborations are needed to bring further light to patients developing anti-HMGCR IMNM, overshadowed by the importance of statins and obscured by rarity, but with great potential to grow our understanding of the complex interactions between statins, muscle and the immune system with focused translational research.

### Chronic corticosteroid administration causes mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle [^112ym3Zz]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid myopathy is a major clinical problem in patients undergoing chronic corticosteroid treatment and shows insidious and progressive muscle atrophy in proximal limbs. Although several mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of muscle injury have been postulated, precise pathogenesis is still not clear. We evaluated the mitochondrial functions in patients receiving corticosteroids compared with those in healthy controls or patients not receiving corticosteroids. The serum levels and total production of lactate were investigated by an aerobic exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Mitochondrial respiratory activities and oxidative damage in biopsied skeletal muscles were also studied. The results of aerobic exercise tests revealed a significant overproduction of lactate in patients treated with corticosteroids (p < 0.005), which was positively correlated with total corticosteroid doses administered (p < 0.0001). In these patients, mitochondrial enzyme activity in complex I was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) and oxidative damage of biopsied skeletal muscle was remarkable both in mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs (p < 0.001). The results suggest that chronic corticosteroid administration induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in skeletal muscles, which may be the pathogenesis, at least in part, of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.

### Risk factors in critical illness myopathy during the early course of critical illness: a prospective observational study [^114J5cU4]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are controversially discussed as aggravating factors of CIM. It is well established that high-dose application of corticosteroids, for example in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, results in selective loss of thick myosin filaments in skeletal muscle fibers, a so-called steroid-induced myopathy.

Nevertheless, these reports refer to steroid myopathy as a result of high-dose steroid application. A link between 'low-dose hydrocortisone' treatment as adjunctive therapy during septic shock and development of CIM has been postulated, but never proven. Several data indicate that moderate doses of steroids do not prolong mechanical ventilation due to muscle weakness but are related to significantly more ventilator-free days and earlier spontaneous breathing capacity. In an earlier study we did not observe an association between low-dose hydrocortisone application and development of paresis. In this study we were able to show that low-dose hydrocortisone application does not provoke impaired muscle membrane excitability, suggesting that steroid involvement in CIM development is dose dependent.

Furthermore, dosage of analgesics and sedatives was significantly associated with the development of non-excitable muscle membrane. Interpreting higher doses of analgesics and sedatives as higher degrees of immobilization, this finding is in line with recent studies describing that immobilization aggravated neuromuscular weakness in an experimental setting and that early physical mobilization resulted in a better clinical outcome of motor function.

For clinicians it is difficult to estimate patients at risk for the development of CIM. The APACHE-III score has been cited as being able to identify patients at risk for critical illness neuromyopathy. In our study we used the SOFA score because it is widely accepted in the ICU setting, and has been validated to monitor organ dysfunction-related to sepsis. Our results indicate that a SOFA score of 10 or above and/or IL-6 plasma levels of 230 pg/ml or more at the onset of critical illness disclose high-risk patients for the development of non-excitable muscle membrane.

The following limitations of this study need to be addressed. Although we observed a statistically significant effect for IL-6 as a main risk factor for non-excitable muscle membrane, it has to be stressed that the overall effect was small, which may be due to small sample size. It also needs to be mentioned that blood samples were collected at two different time points only and that the course of inflammatory parameters was not followed daily. However, this was designed as a pilot study for hypothesis generation. The clinical significance has to be addressed in further studies.

### Successful treatment of acute myocardial injury of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with steroids: a case report [^112hDPDa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked inherited myopathy that causes progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle disease. DMD's critical features are chronic cardiac muscle inflammation and subsequent fibrotic tissue deposition. Heart lesions were described in the earliest DMD reports, and cardiomyopathy is now the leading cause of death. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of cardiomyopathy in DMD patients are vital in improving overall outcomes. Acute chest pain attacks with elevated troponin in patients with DMD without coronary artery disease may indicate acute myocardial injury, a sign of progression to cardiomyopathy.

### A review of inflammatory idiopathic myopathy focusing on polymyositis [^113RbX3n]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Inflammatory idiopathic myopathies are a group of autoimmune diseases affecting predominantly the proximal skeletal muscles, with raised muscle enzymes, with or without skin involvement and extramuscular organ involvement. Autoantibodies help to characterize patients into different clinical phenotypes. Successful treatment necessitates controlling inflammation early with corticosteroids and invariably requires additional immunosuppressive therapy. This review focuses on the aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, investigations and management of patients presenting with inflammatory idiopathic myopathies, predominantly focusing on polymyositis and antisynthetase syndrome.

### Corticosteroid use in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders: empirical and evidence-based data [^116zBN5R]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have been used to treat neuromuscular disorders for many years. With few randomized, controlled trials, efficacy has been established primarily from empirical data. This has led to a range of treatment regimens varying in terms of initial dosing, dosing schedules, and taper rates. The goals of this review were to examine the literature for data concerning corticosteroid pharmacokinetics and for evidence-based treatment regimens in several prototypic neuromuscular disorders. The results provide a number of sound principles for corticosteroid use, but also indicate that corticosteroid regimens and patient management are largely based on empirical clinical experiences.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^114A3Z9J]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature search — scope and search strategy

Using key questions as a basis, a literature search was undertaken using Ovid (see 'Search terms' in Supplementary Material S1, available at Rheumatology online). Search results and additional manually identified references up to October 2020 were included. Evidence published after October 2020 was not included as this was the cut-off for eligibility. A potential limitation of this guideline is that relevant literature may have been published since October 2020; data or information from these studies could not be included in the recommendation formation process.

Eligibility criteria

Published peer reviewed clinical studies relating to any IIM subtype except inclusion body myositis were included. Case reports/series were limited to those describing outcomes for three or more subjects. Review articles, editorials, conference proceedings, and existing clinical guidelines were excluded. Non-English language papers were excluded unless a translation was published. Basic science studies without clear clinical applicability were excluded. Abstracts of papers were reviewed by two authors to determine eligibility against these criteria (PRISMA flow diagram shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Methods used to formulate recommendations

The full text of each eligible paper was reviewed by two assessors using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Each reference was categorized as high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) quality. A third assessor resolved disagreements.

A total of 213 papers were used to form recommendations. See Supplementary Table S1 (available at Rheumatology online) for details of evidence base contributing to recommendations.

Draft recommendations were created and categorized as applicable to all patients, adult-specific or paediatric-specific. The process outlined by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was used to summarize the quality of body of evidence for each recommendation: high (A), moderate (B), low (C) or very low (D), according to GRADE methodology.

Content, wording, strength of recommendation (strong = 1, conditional = 2), and quality of supporting evidence for each recommendation were subjected to a formal consensus building process using a combination of face-to-face meetings and online surveys. Strength of agreement (SoA) for finalized recommendations was determined using a simple binary voting system for each voter and is presented as a percentage. Authors were free to abstain from voting on areas where they did not feel clinically competent, with the percentage reflecting voters. Only recommendations with a SoA > 80% were included in the guideline.

### Immune-mediated necrotising myopathy: a rare cause of hyperCKaemia [^116JZaef]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM) is a type of inflammatory myopathy characterised by acute or subacute severe proximal muscle weakness, significantly elevated creatine kinase levels, and prominent myofibre necrosis and regeneration with little or no inflammation. A subtype of IMNM identified by anti-HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR)antibodies has been shown to be associated with statin exposure. Treatment of IMNM consists of immunosuppression with steroids, steroid-sparing agents, intravenous immune globulin and/or biologics. We present here a case of anti-HMCGR-associated IMNM and review the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment to increase physician awareness of this rare and debilitating condition.

International consensus guidance — definitions and scope for glucocorticoid use in neuromuscular disease defines chronic glucocorticoid (GC) treatment as > 2.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent for > 3 months; for alternate-day dosing, 40 mg prednisone every other day = 20 mg prednisone daily. Dosing refers to prednisone, but the recommendation applies to the equivalent dose of other GC (whether oral or intravenous), and recommendations assume systemic GC and do not apply to inhaled topical formulations. Topics investigated include Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis, vaccination, osteoporosis and bone health, ocular health, gastrointestinal prophylaxis, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Eoygh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of Cushing's syndrome — discriminatory signs versus common features are summarized: Few, if any, features of Cushing's syndrome are unique, but some are more discriminatory than others, including reddish purple striae, plethora, proximal muscle weakness, bruising with no obvious trauma, and unexplainable osteoporosis. Table 1 lists features that best discriminate Cushing's syndrome; most do not have a high sensitivity, including easy bruising, facial plethora, proximal myopathy (or proximal muscle weakness), and striae (especially if reddish purple and > 1 cm wide), with in children, weight gain with decreasing growth velocity. It also lists Cushing's syndrome features in the general population that are common and/or less discriminatory and overlapping conditions, including symptoms such as depression, fatigue, weight gain, and menstrual abnormalities, and conditions such as hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, vertebral osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, hypokalemia, kidney stones, incidental adrenal mass, and unusual infections; features marked b indicate Cushing's syndrome is more likely if onset is at a younger age. We encourage caregivers to consider Cushing's syndrome as a secondary cause of these conditions, particularly if additional features of the disorder are present.

### Autoimmune myopathies: updates on evaluation and treatment [^112gzmX1]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The major forms of autoimmune myopathies include dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), myositis associated with antisynthetase syndrome (ASS), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). While each of these conditions has unique clinical and histopathological features, they all share an immune-mediated component. These conditions can occur in isolation or can be associated with systemic malignancies or connective tissue disorders (overlap syndromes). As more has been learned about these conditions, it has become clear that traditional classification schemes do not adequately group patients according to shared clinical features and prognosis. Newer classifications are now utilizing myositis-specific autoantibodies which correlate with clinical and histopathological phenotypes and risk of malignancy, and help in offering prognostic information with regard to treatment response. Based on observational data and expert opinion, corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy for DM, PM, ASS, and IMNM, although intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is increasingly being used as initial therapy in IMNM related to statin use. Second-line agents are often required, but further prospective investigation is required regarding the optimal choice and timing of these agents.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — Strongyloides and tuberculosis: Patients from endemic regions or with unexplained eosinophilia should be screened for Strongyloides stercoralis infection with serum IgG antibody levels to Strongyloides before initiation of GC therapy. Screening for latent tuberculosis (TB) is recommended for all patients who will receive ≥ 15 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 4 weeks or more and are at highest risk for reactivation of TB (those born in or frequently traveling to countries with high TB rates, or residents/employees of homeless shelters or correctional facilities). Patients with a positive TB screen test should be referred for infectious disease consultation for treatment before GC is initiated.

### Levofloxacin-induced myopathy of the iliac and gluteal muscles [^1175yoUF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Table 1
Summary of reported cases of levofloxacin-Induced myopathy

Differential diagnoses for conditions with predominant proximal muscle involvement, as in our case, include drug-induced myopathy, autoimmune myopathies such as polymyositis/dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis and polymyalgia rheumatica, as well as infectious myopathies, metabolic myopathies and electrolyte disturbances. Diagnostic evaluations may involve testing for autoantibodies, electromyography and muscle biopsy.

In the present case, we considered the differential diagnoses noted above, but electromyography and muscle biopsy were unfeasible due to the anatomical location of the symptoms. Moreover, given the advanced age of the patient, it was challenging to exclude polymyalgia rheumatica. MRI was therefore performed to assess the affected area, which revealed findings highly suggestive of myopathy. Although the differential diagnosis of myopathy is broad, neither blood test results nor the pathophysiological mechanism in this case strongly supported alternative aetiologies, and the clinical course pointed towards a drug-induced myopathy.

Cefmetazole and metronidazole were also administered, so they too must be considered as potential causative agents. However, no musculoskeletal adverse effects have been reported in association with cefmetazole. Metronidazole, on the other hand, has been associated with side effects such as paraesthesia and myalgia, but these are typically attributed to neuropathic mechanisms rather than to direct myotoxicity. We therefore deemed levofloxacin to be the most likely causative agent responsible for the myopathy in this case.

When fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy is suspected, initial management should include immediate discontinuation of the causative agent, rest for the affected area, initiation of rehabilitation and avoidance of concurrent steroid use. Symptoms generally improve within 1–4 weeks after drug withdrawal, but there are cases where symptoms have persisted for up to 6 months. Early detection is thus critical to prevent a decline in activities of daily living.

### Myositis mimics: how to recognize them [^1166QPyJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To help clinicians to distinguish between myositis (and other immune-mediated and immunosuppressant-responsive disorders) and its many clinical mimics.

Recent Findings

Increasing experience has shown that findings from conventional investigations, such as muscle biopsy, can be misleading. More specialist investigations, notably autoantibody screening, immunocytochemical techniques, and evolving DNA technologies, are powerful tools but experience is currently largely limited to specialist centres - and even these techniques are open to misinterpretation.

Summary

Misdiagnosis is hazardous to the patient. Treatable conditions may be missed, or patients subjected inappropriately to potentially toxic drug treatments. Judicious use of clinical skills alone should help reduce these risks.

### Long-term follow-up and muscle imaging findings in brachio-cervical inflammatory myopathy [^112VY5C7]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite a consensus on therapy for IIMs is still lacking, steroids are commonly used as the first-line agent and are often associated with steroid-sparing immunosuppressants. A number of other additional therapies have been tried, including IVIg and plasma exchange or a combination of both, and the outcome was generally good in previously published BCIM cases. However, the heterogeneous treatment strategies make it difficult to select the best approach for a given patient, and the treatment choice is commonly guided by patients' comorbidities, side effects, and, finally, physicians' experience. In our population, this approach led to clinical and radiologic improvement in all but 1 patient. However, neck muscle weakness, especially of neck flexors, was relatively resistant to therapy. At the time of diagnostic evaluation, neck muscles showed severe fatty replacement and atrophy on MRI. This finding could be expression of a chronic irreversible process explaining the lack of treatment response of this muscle group.

5.11 Neuromuscular Effects

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

5.12 Kaposi's Sarcoma

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: an update on classification and treatment with special focus on juvenile forms [^115WGzVE]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Juvenile inflammatory myopathies represent a heterogeneous group of rare and potentially fatal disorders of unknown aetiology, characterised by inflammation and proximal and symmetric muscle weakness. Beyond many similarities, specific clinical, laboratoristic and histopathologic features underlie different subsets with distinguishing demographic, prognostic and therapeutic peculiarities. Over time, several forms of inflammatory idiopathic myopathies have been described, including macrophagic myofascitis, immune-mediated necrozing myopathy and the spectrum of amyopathic dermatomyositis that include hypomyopathic dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis and cancer-associated myositis occurring almost exclusively in adults. However, juvenile dermatomyositis is the most frequent in childhood, whereas polymyositis is relatively more frequent in adults. The aetiology is nowadays widely unclear; however, current theories contemplate a combination of environmental triggers, immune dysfunction and specific tissue responses involving muscle, skin and small vessels endothelium in genetically susceptible individuals. Myositis-specific autoantibodies, found almost exclusively in patients with myositis and myositis-associated autoantibodies, detectable both among patients with myositis and in subjects suffering from other autoimmune diseases, have an important clinical role because of their relation to specific clinical features, response to therapy and prognosis. The gold standard treatment for juvenile dermatomyositis is represented by corticosteroids, along with adjunctive steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapies, which are used to counteract disease activity, prevent mortality, and reduce long-term disability. Further treatment approach such as biologic agents and autologous stem cell transplantation are emerging during the last years, in particular in patients difficult to treat and with poor prognosis. Therefore, a highly medical specialised approach is required for diagnosis and management of these conditions. This review comprehensively examines juvenile inflammatory myopathies focusing on clinical and laboratory classifications as well as on the current treatment approaches, referring in particular on biologic agents and latest therapeutic opportunities.

### Toxic and drug-induced myopathies [^1124aDBs]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Drugs used for therapeutic interventions either alone or in combination may sometimes cause unexpected toxicity to the muscles, resulting in a varying degree of symptomatology, from mild discomfort and inconvenience to permanent damage and disability. The clinician should suspect a toxic myopathy when a patient without a pre-existing muscle disease develops myalgia, fatigue, weakness or myoglobinuria, temporally connected to the administration of a drug or exposure to a myotoxic substance. This review provides an update on the drugs with well-documented myocytoxicity and cautions the clinicians to be alert for the potential toxicity of newly marketed drugs; highlights the clinical features and pathomechanisms of the induced muscle disease; and offers guidance on how best to treat and distinguish toxic myopathies from other acquired or hereditary muscle disorders. Practical issues regarding the diagnosis and management of statin-induced myopathies are emphasized. Myotoxicity resulting from direct insertion of transgenes to the muscle, an exciting new tool currently tested for treatment of muscular dystrophies, is also discussed.

### Anti-HMGCR myopathy: a rare and serious side effect of statins [^114S1YRJ]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Since their initial discovery, statins have become the first-line treatment for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although they are typically well tolerated, side effects do occur and tend to affect the musculature. Most side effects are benign and resolve after discontinuing the statin. A subset of immune-mediated necrotizing myositis, anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) myopathy is a rare disease that occurs in 0.9 to 1.4 cases per 100,000 people. It causes significant muscle weakness that does not resolve with discontinuation of the statin. Unlike other known complications, it has a late onset, occurring years after the statin was initially prescribed. It can also present in patients previously treated with statins who have not taken them for several years. This case report details the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed anti-HMGCR myopathy after several years of uncomplicated statin use. Differences between other reported cases and this 1 are discussed, including the patient's strong response to steroid therapy which resulted in the normalization of her serum creatinine kinase and alleviation of her muscle weakness. This case highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of anti-HMGCR myopathy and to consider it as a potential cause of proximal muscle weakness and persistent serum creatinine kinase elevations in patients exposed to statins even if they were previously well tolerated by the patient.

### Atypical presentation of anti-HMGCR myopathy [^115ogvgd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Immune-mediated necrotising myopathy is a subtype of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterised by muscle fibre necrosis without significant inflammatory infiltrate. Anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) myopathy is seen in 6%-10% of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and is diagnosed in the context of elevated serum creatine kinase levels, proximal muscle weakness and anti-HMGCR autoantibodies. We recently encountered a 61-year-old man with anti-HMGCR myopathy with an atypical skin manifestation, partially responsive to triple therapy with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab. To our knowledge, there have been only four reported cases of skin rash associated with anti-HMGCR myopathy. Our case demonstrates the importance of recognising atypical manifestations of anti-HMGCR myopathy. Early addition of IVIG and rituximab is also critical in patients not responding to steroid monotherapy. Delay in achieving remission leads to prolonged steroid use, lower likelihood of beginning physical therapy and overall worse clinical outcomes.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to identify potential predisposing factors for statin-associated side effects, including new-onset diabetes mellitus and statin-associated muscle symptoms, before initiating statin therapy.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112H5kji]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Statin safety — myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are key considerations, with myopathy (incidence < 0.1%) defined as unexplained muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevation > 10 times the upper limits of normal (ULN); when CK is above 10 000 IU/L or greater than 40 times ULN, rhabdomyolysis should be considered. Myopathy is rare, with incidence < 0.1% for most statins and 1% for simvastatin 80 mg, a dose no longer used, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is even lower at < 0.01%. In patients with myopathy, discontinuation of the statin usually results in resolution of muscle symptoms within days and CK returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks, and if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, intensive hydration is usually effective in preventing renal failure. Possible risk factors include older age, female sex, diabetes, Chinese ancestry, renal insufficiency, pre-existing muscle disease, hypothyroidism, and drug interactions; in a patient with unexplained muscle symptoms, CK levels will distinguish nonserious muscle symptoms from myopathy. About 10% to 20% of statin-treated subjects in clinical trials report muscle symptoms that are usually not accompanied by CK increases, yet statin-associated muscle symptoms are caused by the statin in < 1% of patients. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 12 cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome studies in 97 000 subjects, myalgia or muscle ache occurred in 5162 (11.7%) on statins versus 5051 (11.4%) on placebo (P = 0.10), and in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials specifically querying muscle symptoms, none found a statistically significant difference between statin and placebo groups. Re-challenge data show 90% of statin-intolerant patients tolerated the same or a different statin, and in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) labeled statin intolerant, the vast majority could tolerate a statin under double-blind conditions.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^112XnGXX]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — viral hepatitis and HIV: Hepatitis B screening is recommended in patients with NMD who will receive GC at a dose of ≥ 10 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 4 weeks. If GC must start emergently or urgently, testing for hepatitis B and TB should be performed as soon as possible and, if abnormal, treatment should be instituted as early as possible with the involvement of appropriate specialists. Screening for Hepatitis C is universally recommended by the US CDC for all people born between 1945 and 1965; testing may be offered to patients with NMD who will receive GC for ≥ 4 weeks or more. Patients with positive hepatitis B/C screens should be referred for subspecialty consultation before starting chronic GC and should be comanaged for the duration of GC therapy. Screening for HIV may be considered for all patients with NMD who will receive GC at a dose of ≥ 10 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 4 weeks, with referral to Infectious Disease and comanagement for the duration of GC therapy if positive.

### Management of respiratory failure in immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced overlap syndrome: a case series and review of the literature [^116dsHyV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our case series, all patients were admitted into the ICU for ICI-induced OS and received pulse-dose steroids with a subsequent oral steroid tapering strategy, and PLEX. More specifically, Case 1 and 2 were treated empirically with pulse-dose steroids due to high clinical suspicion for OS, Case 3 and 4 were treated once a diagnosis of OS was confirmed. Initial therapy response was measured and subsequently followed by trending troponin T and CK after starting pulse-dose steroids. Since there is no current standardized treatment protocol, all patients were further treated with PLEX, and additional immunosuppression. Of note, electromyography was not able to confirm neuromuscular junction changes consistent with ICI-induced MG. Given our small sample size, this is consistent with other case studies as ICI-induced MG is much more difficult to diagnose with only 57% of patients having clear electrodiagnostic features of MG (41%) or MG and myopathy (16%). Although, OS has a high mortality rate approaching 60%; all our patients were discharged home or to long-term facilities. This could be due to early recognition and our aggressive treatment approach.

To identify efficacious treatment approaches towards ICI-induced MG, it is important to characterize the differences between ICI-induced MG and idiopathic MG (iMG). Cases of iMG typically have an insidious clinical course, taking 2–3 years to develop symptoms of NMRF requiring support with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or IMV. However, patients with ICI-induced MG can progress to NMRF in a median time of 7 days, as demonstrated in Case 3. Therefore, ICI-induced MG is associated with worse clinical outcomes than with iMG, including a higher risk of respiratory paralysis and death. ICI-MG is also increasingly difficult to diagnose, since there are lower positivity rates in electrodiagnostic testing and lower seropositivity of anti-AChR antibodies than there is in iMG. These differences in presentation and diagnosis could also lead to differences in management. While corticosteroids are a standard of care (in conjunction with IVIG and PLEX) and lead to more favorable outcomes of ICI-induced MG in OS, corticosteroid use can increase the progression of respiratory failure in iMG.

### Camptocormia as a presentation of generalized inflammatory myopathy [^116SrDk2]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Camptocormia is an abnormal truncal flexion posture that occurs while walking or standing. It is usually caused by various hypokinetic movement disorders such as Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy. Myopathy or motor neuron disease can also be infrequent causes of camptocormia. Paraspinous muscle biopsy usually reveals focal myositis, regardless of the etiology of camptocormia. We describe the first case of generalized inflammatory myopathy with prominent camptocormia and proximal muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy of the quadriceps confirmed the diagnosis of polymyositis, and the posture showed modest improvement in response to steroid treatment.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^114a7N3t]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: JDM and ADM have distinct clinical features: ADM is characterized by more severe organ involvement, particularly cardiac and respiratory, higher acute phase reactants, prolonged steroid rates, and poorer outcomes, including higher rates of malignancies, hospitalization, and mortality. In contrast, JDM is associated with more frequent calcinosis and joint involvement, along with a relatively better prognosis.

These differences emphasize that JDM should not be approached merely as the pediatric form of ADM, but as a distinct clinical entity requiring tailored management strategies.

### The role of steroids in the management of brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^112xeahu]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids have typically been used to assist in controlling cerebral edema in the early supportive care of the patient with newly diagnosed metastatic brain disease. Dexamethasone is generally considered the steroid of choice because of its minimal mineralocorticoid effect and long half-life, although any other corticosteroid can be effective if given in equipotent doses. Steroids have been used alone for palliation of symptoms and in combination with radiotherapy as an initial course of therapy. A review of the available literature indicates that the majority of these patients have been managed with starting doses of 4–8 mg/day and it has been stated that up to 75% of patients with brain metastases show marked neurological improvement within 24–72 h after beginning dexamethasone. However, side effects from chronic dexamethasone administration, including myopathy, are frequent and contribute to disability. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients may benefit little from the routine administration of steroid therapy and be exposed to these toxicities. Although successful clinical experience would lead to the conclusion that the role of steroids is firmly established in the management of brain metastases, even a cursory review of the literature will demonstrate significant variability in recommendations and a general lack of well-controlled studies addressing this specific issue.

This systematic review addresses the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of metastatic brain disease with the following overall objectives:
To systematically review the evidence available for the following treatment comparisons for patients diagnosed with brain metastases specifically addressing the following questions: Do steroids improve neurologic symptoms in patients with metastatic brain tumors compared to no treatment? If steroids are given, what dose should be used?
To make recommendations based on this evidence for the role of corticosteroids in the management of these patients.

### Use of methotrexate in inflammatory myopathies [^116tTUno]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The inflammatory myopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases including dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis. Few clinical trials have been reported in myositis, it is difficult to make definitive recommendations for the treatment of these potentially life threatening diseases. In addition to treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and immunomodulatory therapy are used to improve disease control and reduce the long-term side effects of corticosteroids. While these treatments are commonly used in routine clinical practice, the optimal therapeutic regimen remains unclear. However, most patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis are treated with oral high-dose prednisone combined with azathioprine or methotrexate to facilitate tapering of prednisone.

### Critical illness myopathy, steroids, and cytochrome P450… [^1166ZrYr]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Critical illness myopathy is a poorly understood, but increasingly recognized clinical syndrome that characteristically occurs in the intensive care unit among patients who have been treated with multiple drugs and high-dose steroids. 1–6 This rapidly progressive myopathy is characterized by muscle fiber atrophy and/or necrosis, often selectively affecting type 2 myofibers. Steroids are potent inducers of some forms of cytochrome P450. 7 Recent studies8 suggest that cytochrome P450 is associated with skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Induction of cytochrome P450 and the consequent formation of reactive intermediates in the metabolism of some compounds result in the activation of calcium-release channels. 9 Critical illness myopathy may result from steroid induction of cytochrome P450 associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The consequent production of reactive intermediate metabolites of other drugs given in the setting of critical illness then causes pathologic activation of calcium-release channels in sarcoplasmic reticulum and consequent muscle injury. The differences between muscle fiber types in calcium handling may account for the preferential involvement of type 2 muscle fibers in both steroid myopathy8 and critical illness myopathy.

### Myocarditis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy after changing steroids… [^111BGLyh]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Myocardial edema in septal and lateral walls with elevated T2 values and the presence of late gadolinium enhancement in the septum and basal to midlateral walls are consistent with acute myocarditis. Cardiac MRI 4 months later showed improved myocardial function. Redemonstration of LGE in the basal to midlateral walls consistent with fibrosis and T2 values normalized to 42–49 milliseconds, indicating resolution of edema. Objective To recognize the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation, or dystrophinitis, in DMD, which presents as myocarditis and to treat the myocardial inflammation and dilated cardiomyopathy associated with DMD through guideline-directed medical therapy, steroids, and serial surveillance for cardiac dysfunction. Design, Setting, and Participant.

Conclusions and Relevance This case highlights adverse effects associated with changing between corticosteroid classes in DMD cardiomyopathy and also demonstrates the utility of CMR in detecting myocardial inflammation and monitoring response to treatment. The initial 12-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, with significant inferior ST elevations. Initial serum troponin I level was 39 ng/mL and peaked at greater than the laboratory upper limit of 73 ng/mL. He was taken emergently for coronary angiography, which revealed normal coronary anatomy without disease. A subsequent echocardiogram measured an LVEF of 46%, with global hypokinesis that was most severe in the basal to mid inferolateral and anterolateral walls.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed septal and lateral wall myocardial edema with elevated T2 values and the presence of late gadolinium enhancement in the basal to midlateral walls consistent with acute myocarditis. patients with DMD without inflammation. 7 A hallmark of cardiac disease in DMD is lateral wall fibrosis owing to ongoing inflammation, which can be delayed with the use of steroids. 2 This fibrosis is often best characterized using CMR, which shows LGE as the result of replacement fibrosis. 1, 9 At age 18 years, this patient showed LGE/myocardial fibrosis of his lateral wall on CMR.

### Effect of cortisone on the structure and strength of skeletal muscle… [^111vJjrK]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

MUSCLE weakness, a prominent feature in Cushing's syndrome whether primary or secondary, was described in roughly half of Cushing's original cases. 1 Müllen2 also described proximal muscle weakness in six patients with Cushing's syndrome; in several it was an early symptom. More recently, a myopathy has been observed in some patients on prolonged adrenocortical therapy. Perkoff3 reported seven patients who developed weakness, especially of proximal leg muscles, during steroid therapy of blood dyscrasias. Byers4 noted myopathy in five out of 250 children on steroids for rheumatic fever. Steroids given for polyarteritis, asthma, scleroderma, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and as replacement therapy following hypophysectomy also have resulted in myopathy. 5–9 It has been thought that the weakness was not due to the basic disease. Serum potassium levels were normal. The incidence of this complication is said to be greater with fluorinated steroids.

### STIR magnetic resonance imaging: a noninvasive method for detection and follow-up of dermatomyositis… [^115pxPrM]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Yosipovitch G, Beniaminov O, Rousso I, David M. STIR Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Noninvasive Method for Detection and Follow-up of Dermatomyositis. Arch Dermatol. 1999; 135: 721–723. doi: 10–1001/pubs. Arch Dermatol. -ISSN-0003–987x-135–6-dlt0699. The diagnosis of dermatomyositis can be problematic. Serum levels of muscle enzymes are not elevated in every case, electromyography presents with sampling errors and even findings of muscle biopsy specimens may be normal due to patchy muscle involvement. Moreover, the classic muscle findings are not present in all patients — the term amyopathic DM has been used to describe patients diagnosed as having DM with skin disease and no muscle findings. 1 Particularly difficult is the detection of steroid myopathy in the follow-up of patients with DM. A muscle biopsy is not always helpful since type II atrophy and patches of inflammation may coexist.
