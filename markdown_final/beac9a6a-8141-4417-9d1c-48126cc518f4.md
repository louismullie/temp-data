## Question

Which research studies remain to be conducted on PSMA PET scan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which research studies remain to be conducted on PSMA PET scanning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about trials that link PSMA PET to patient-centered outcomes like survival. Then, I should verify comparative effectiveness questions against other advanced imaging and across tracers. Next, I will examine response assessment standardization, reader reliability, and AI validation. After that, I need to consider application-specific gaps such as active surveillance, biochemical recurrence, and oligometastatic disease. Finally, I should review health economics, implementation, theranostics optimization, and non-prostate applications, prioritizing by clinical impact and evidence strength [^116F1rhb] [^113YzGg7] [^114tcK4o].

> Let me first confirm the overarching evidence gap. Despite superior diagnostic accuracy, whether PSMA PET improves hard outcomes such as overall or cancer-specific survival remains largely unproven; stage migration complicates trial design and endpoint interpretation, demanding prospective randomization and careful statistical handling in primary staging and recurrence settings [^116F1rhb] [^113YzGg7]. Wait, I almost conflated imaging trials with therapeutic evidence; the VISION trial established survival benefit for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy, not for diagnostic PSMA PET itself, and proPSMA focused on diagnostic accuracy rather than survival, so randomized trials testing PSMA PET–guided management versus conventional pathways with survival endpoints are still needed, especially in high-risk primary staging and oligometastatic settings [^112tHrEy] [^112qYPvv] [^1131MB7E].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness versus other advanced imaging and among tracers. Prospective, randomized, multicenter head-to-head studies comparing PSMA PET/CT with whole-body MRI for pelvic nodal and metastatic detection are explicitly called for, and I need to ensure these studies incorporate standardized protocols and blinded central review to mitigate bias [^113Vi6tC]. Hold on, I should verify tracer-specific questions too; rigorous comparative studies across 68Ga-PSMA-11, 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-PSMA-1007, and rhPSMA-7 are needed to quantify pharmacokinetic differences, urinary excretion effects, and unspecific bone uptake implications, ideally in prospective designs with histopathologic or long-term clinical reference standards and harmonized acquisition parameters [^113m3hez] [^115zT8gv] [^112fvyuD].

> I will now examine response assessment standardization. I need to check whether RECIP 1.0 has been validated broadly; current data suggest that RECIP requires international prospective validation, including test–retest studies to define measurement variability and consensus on optimal timing of scans relative to therapy, before routine trial use in mCRPC and earlier disease is justified [^111gBdJe] [^115EaFda]. Hold on, I should verify that guidance statements recommend analyzing available real-world and trial datasets to refine criteria and endpoints before designing new prospective response-assessment trials, which they do, but execution is still pending [^115EaFda].

> Let me consider structured reporting and reader reliability. Although PSMA-RADS 1.0 shows excellent inter- and intrareader agreement overall, I should confirm gaps around intrareader agreement without clinical data and workflow feasibility in high-volume centers; targeted studies are needed to test reproducibility under real-world constraints and to quantify how clinical information availability modifies interpretation and downstream decisions [^116ppqZP]. Wait, let me verify concordance in the absence of clinical data; multicenter work demonstrates high agreement even when readers are blinded, but prospective implementation studies should still evaluate impacts on turnaround time, training curves, and clinical outcomes when PSMA-RADS is adopted at scale [^113SfU8b] [^111hQx5t] [^115ZdMv9] [^115wwEAw].

> I need to check application-specific gaps in active surveillance. Larger, prospective studies are required to determine whether PSMA PET can safely refine selection for active surveillance and predict upgrading, ideally with radical prostatectomy correlation, long-term outcomes, and integration with mpMRI to avoid over-reliance on PET alone [^113NyLgZ] [^1116ixAe]. Hold on, let me verify whether current evidence is mostly retrospective and single-center; that's correct, so multicenter prospective cohorts or randomized imaging strategies comparing standard AS workflows with or without PSMA PET are still needed to assess changes in biopsy rates, treatment deferral, and quality of life [^112x1QtZ] [^113VF3Nd].

> Next, I should review biochemical recurrence and salvage radiotherapy planning. Current literature shows substantial management change from PSMA PET–informed planning, but I need to confirm that survival endpoints remain insufficient; prospective trials linking PSMA PET–directed salvage fields to metastasis-free and overall survival are required, with standardized timing at low PSA and harmonized interpretation criteria [^115XNgAP] [^111fuGGw]. Wait, I should verify whether non-classical restaging indications show management impact; yes, but prospective outcome data remain limited outside classical BCR and presurgical staging, reinforcing the need for protocolized studies in these scenarios [^111ap93g].

> I will now examine oligometastatic disease. Studies must define a biologically and clinically "true" oligometastatic state detectable by PSMA PET that predicts benefit from metastasis-directed therapy, including long-term progression-free and overall survival, and should incorporate biomarkers and repeat imaging to monitor disease evolution and avoid overtreatment based on micro-metastatic disease below PET resolution [^111yx7wT]. Hold on, let me verify preliminary signals; early data suggest PFS benefit after treating PET-positive lesions, but rigorous randomized trials with durable endpoints and standardized lesion thresholds are still needed [^114tcK4o].

> But wait, what about biologic and mechanistic questions. I need to check the effects of androgen deprivation therapy on PSMA expression, including the short-term flare phenomenon and longer-term downregulation, to optimize scan timing relative to therapy initiation and avoid misclassification of response or progression; prospective longitudinal imaging-biopsy correlation studies are warranted [^113Vi6tC]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also verify older clinical observations that short-term ADT can increase PSMA uptake; further controlled studies should delineate magnitude, timing, and clinical significance across disease states [^111F3Tdc].

> I should confirm technical pitfalls such as unspecific bone uptake. Prospective studies that quantify UBU incidence by tracer, define SUV thresholds and morphologic correlates to separate UBU from true metastases, and model the impact on staging accuracy and downstream treatment are needed, particularly for 18F-PSMA-1007, which has higher UBU rates but less urinary confounding [^115zT8gv]. Hold on, I should verify that tracer comparison data already flag this issue; yes, but future work needs harmonized protocols, per-lesion reference standards, and predefined adjudication algorithms to minimize false positives [^113m3hez].

> I will now examine artificial intelligence integration. Let me verify the current limitations; most AI tools lack external validation, are retrospective, and do not demonstrate clinical impact over expert human readers, so prospective, multi-scanner, multi-tracer trials with patient-centered outcomes are required to justify adoption and regulatory approval [^1139oU8S]. Hold on, I should ensure these studies also address calibration drift, domain shift, and assistive workflow metrics like reading time and interobserver variability reduction, which remain largely untested prospectively [^1139oU8S].

> Next, I should review health economics and implementation. Cost-effectiveness models require phase 3 and multicountry resource data, plus operational studies on cost-reduction strategies (lower dose, single-bed acquisitions) and their diagnostic non-inferiority, to support earlier adoption in the diagnostic pathway [^112fvyuD]. I need to ensure equity and access questions are not overlooked; implementation studies should quantify disparities in availability and outcomes in resource-limited settings and evaluate standardized reporting templates and training curricula to improve consistency and clinical integration [^111fuGGw] [^116Zxa5F] [^116ppqZP].

> Let me consider novel and expanded indications. Prospective studies in non–prostate cancer indications such as renal cell carcinoma should determine whether PSMA PET meaningfully changes management and outcomes compared with CT/MRI, with rigorous histopathologic correlation and standardized thresholds for positivity, and similar prospective work is needed to validate PSMA PET in neuro-oncology where early data suggest diagnostic promise [^116BAhrF] [^11434H7G] [^113L4qMS]. Hold on, I should verify that current RCC data are retrospective and multi-institutional without survival endpoints; that is correct and underscores the need for prospective designs [^116BAhrF].

> I should review theranostics optimization. Although radioligand therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617 confers survival benefit, I need to check that imaging-based selection biomarkers, quantitative thresholds, dose personalization, sequencing, and rational combinations with systemic agents still require prospective validation to improve efficacy and minimize toxicity across disease states [^115whfLz]. Wait, let me verify that stakeholders also call for system-level readiness and access expansion for PSMA theranostics; this remains a recognized gap alongside trials integrating imaging biomarkers into selection algorithms [^113BRcTg] [^115rC7Ay].

> Finally, I need to prioritize. Tier 1 priorities include randomized trials measuring survival impact of PSMA PET–guided management in primary staging and recurrence, rigorous validation of response assessment criteria such as RECIP with test–retest and timing standards, and large prospective studies testing PSMA PET's utility in active surveillance with pathological and long-term outcome correlation; Tier 2 priorities include head-to-head studies versus whole-body MRI, tracer-comparison trials addressing UBU and urinary excretion effects, AI prospective validation, and implementation-cost studies with equity endpoints [^116F1rhb] [^114tcK4o] [^111gBdJe] [^113NyLgZ]. Hold on, I should double-check that these align with consensus and guideline gaps; they do, and they directly target the translation of diagnostic superiority into validated clinical benefit while ensuring safe, standardized, and equitable adoption [^115EaFda] [^116Zxa5F].

Key research gaps for PSMA PET include: **prospective trials on survival and quality of life** to confirm outcome benefits [^113YzGg7] [^117UgZrP], and **standardized response criteria** (e.g. RECIP 1.0) validated in large cohorts [^111gBdJe] [^115EaFda]. Additional priorities are head-to-head comparisons with WB MRI [^113Vi6tC], cost-effectiveness across healthcare systems [^112fvyuD], and studies on ADT timing effects [^111F3Tdc] [^113Vi6tC] and unspecific bone uptakes [^114mMTS4]. Research is also needed on PSMA PET's role in active surveillance [^113NyLgZ], **AI-assisted interpretation** [^1139oU8S], and integration into clinical trials and guidelines [^116F1rhb] [^114tcK4o].

---

## Clinical impact and patient outcomes

Prospective trials on **survival and quality of life** remain lacking [^113YzGg7] to determine how PSMA PET-guided management affects overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life in prostate cancer patients [^112qYPvv] [^111yx7wT]. In addition, **active surveillance** requires larger-scale prospective studies [^113NyLgZ] to define how PSMA PET can aid in selecting and monitoring patients within surveillance protocols [^1116ixAe].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and comparative studies

Head-to-head comparisons are still needed — specifically **prospective, randomized, multicenter trials comparing PSMA PET/CT with whole-body MRI (WB MRI)** [^113Vi6tC] for pelvic nodal and metastatic disease detection. In addition, **unspecific bone uptakes (UBUs)** warrant research to clarify their pathophysiology and to establish strategies for distinguishing them from true metastases [^114mMTS4].

---

## Standardization and response assessment

Standardized response criteria such as **RECIP 1.0** [^111gBdJe] [^115EaFda] should be validated in larger prospective cohorts to enable consistent interpretation and clinical decision-making. Additionally, **interobserver variability** needs further study to measure the reproducibility of PSMA PET interpretations across varied clinical settings and experience levels [^116ppqZP].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and healthcare integration

Cost-effectiveness analyses across diverse healthcare systems are required to justify **widespread adoption and reimbursement** of PSMA PET imaging [^112fvyuD]. Research on **integration into clinical trials** [^116F1rhb] should address stage migration, response assessment, and statistical considerations when incorporating PSMA PET.

---

## Technological advancements and artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) requires prospective studies to evaluate the **clinical impact, utility, and external validation** of AI tools in PSMA PET interpretation [^1139oU8S]. In parallel, **novel tracers and radiopharmaceuticals** need continued investigation to improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes [^113m3hez] [^116QQk4G].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and patient populations

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) merits studies to determine the **optimal timing** of PSMA PET imaging relative to ADT initiation or cessation [^111F3Tdc], including consideration of the potential "flare" phenomenon [^113Vi6tC]. Additionally, **non-prostatic malignancies** require further research to define PSMA PET's role in cancers such as renal cell carcinoma [^116BAhrF] and its impact on clinical management [^11434H7G].

### Considerations on integrating prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography imaging into clinical prostate cancer trials by National Clinical Trials Network Cooperative Groups [^116F1rhb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

As prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) becomes increasingly available in the United States, the greater sensitivity of the technology compared to conventional imaging poses challenges for clinical trials. The NCI Clinical Imaging Steering Committee (CISC) PSMA PET Working Group was convened to coordinate the identification of these challenges in various clinical scenarios and to develop consensus recommendations on how best to integrate PSMA PET into ongoing and upcoming National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) trials.

NCI CISC and NCI Genitourinary Steering Committee members and leadership nominated clinicians, biostatisticians, patient advocates, and other imaging experts for inclusion in the PSMA PET Working Group. From April to July 2021, the working group met independently and in conjunction with the CISC to frame challenges, including stage migration, response assessment, trial logistics, and statistical challenges, and to discuss proposed solutions. An anonymous, open-ended survey was distributed to members to collect feedback on challenges faced. Representatives from each NCTN group were invited to present an overview of affected trials. From these discussions, the consensus document was developed and circulated for the inclusion of multiple rounds of feedback from both the Working Group and the CISC.

The consensus document outlines the key challenges for clinical prostate cancer trials resulting from the increasing availability of PSMA PET. We discuss implications for patient selection and response assessment.

### The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer [^113Vi6tC]. Nature Reviews. Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Radiolabelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based PET-CT has been shown in numerous studies to be superior to conventional imaging in the detection of nodal or distant metastatic lesions. 68 Ga-PSMA PET-CT is now recommended by many guidelines for the detection of biochemically relapsed disease after radical local therapy. PSMA radioligands can also function as radiotheranostics, and Lu-PSMA has been shown to be a potential new line of treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

- **Whole-body MRI**: WB MRI has been shown to have a high diagnostic performance in the detection and monitoring of metastatic bone disease. Prospective, randomized, multicentre studies comparing 68 Ga-PSMA PET-CT and WB MRI for pelvic nodal and metastatic disease detection are yet to be performed.

- **Challenges in interpretation of PSMA**: Tracer trapping in non-target tissues and urinary excretion of tracers confounds image interpretation at the vesicoureteral junction. Additionally, studies have shown how long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) affects PSMA expression and could reduce tracer uptake and visibility of PSMA+ lesions. Furthermore, ADT of short duration might increase PSMA expression, leading to the PSMA flare phenomenon, which makes accurate monitoring of treatment response to ADT with PSMA PET challenging.

- **Challenges with WB MRI**: Scan duration, detection of incidentalomas, and presence of metallic implants are some of the major challenges.

Emerging data support the wider adoption of PSMA PET and WB MRI for diagnosis, staging, and disease management.

### A cost-effectiveness study of PSMA-PET/CT for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer [^112fvyuD]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, despite utilizing different input models, the PSMA-PET/CT outcomes are based on a limited patient sample; therefore, the exact numbers may change with a larger cohort. The phase 3 data is highly anticipated to support the present findings. Second, our initial study and the external PRIMARY1 trial used different tracers ([18 F]PSMA-1007 vs. [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11), which could lead to different scan results. Third, the model used Dutch healthcare costs, and since intervention costs vary by country, this can impact cost-effectiveness outcomes. Moreover, at €1129 per PSMA-PET/CT, the price is at the lower range. To expand PSMA-PET/CT use in earlier settings, strategies to further reduce costs, such as using one bed position scans and lower injected activities, are needed.

### Impact of long-term androgen deprivation therapy on PSMA ligand PET/CT in patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer [^111F3Tdc]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The detection of recurring prostate cancer (PC) has always been challenging using conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Consequently, there has been a need for new imaging tools with improved sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis. In this context, nuclear imaging targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has received increased attention. PSMA is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in the majority of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinomas.

In May 2011, the PSMA ligand 68 Ga-PSMA-11 was introduced for the clinical imaging of PC at our institution. Since then, positron emission tomography (PET) using 68 Ga-PSMA-11 and alternative PSMA ligands has been regarded as a significant step forward in the diagnosis of recurring PC. The first studies indicated that this novel method is superior to alternative imaging modalities used for the detection of recurring PC. Later studies, including larger patient cohorts, confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.

- **Role of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)**: One of the most important questions in PSMA imaging concerns the role of ADT. It is known from preclinical experiments that short-term ADT can quantitatively increase PSMA expression in castration-sensitive PC cells. This effect was shown with analogues of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) as well as with antiandrogen agents such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide. In addition, Hope et al. demonstrated in one patient that PSMA ligand uptake in PC lesions significantly increased.

### Applications of artificial intelligence in PSMA PET/CT for prostate cancer imaging [^1139oU8S]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as an important imaging technique for prostate cancer. The use of PSMA PET/CT is rapidly increasing, while the number of nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists to interpret these scans is limited. Additionally, there is variability in interpretation among readers. Artificial intelligence techniques, including traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms, are being used to address these challenges and provide additional insights from the images.

The aim of this scoping review was to summarize the available research on the development and applications of AI in PSMA PET/CT for prostate cancer imaging. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 26 publications were included in the synthesis.

The included studies focus on different aspects of artificial intelligence in PSMA PET/CT, including detection of primary tumors, local recurrence, metastatic lesions, lesion classification, tumor quantification, and prediction/prognostication. Several studies show similar performances of artificial intelligence algorithms compared to human interpretation. Few artificial intelligence tools are approved for use in clinical practice. Major limitations include the lack of external validation and prospective design. Demonstrating the clinical impact and utility of artificial intelligence tools is crucial for their adoption.

### Novel framework for treatment response evaluation using PSMA PET/CT in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (RECIP 1.0): An international multicenter study [^111gBdJe]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In metastatic prostate cancer, treatment response is typically evaluated using conventional imaging, such as CT and bone scanning, according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3) guidelines. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)–targeted PET/CT is a novel imaging technique that has shown greater detection accuracy than conventional imaging in patients with high-risk primary prostate cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for different clinical settings in men with prostate cancer. However, there is little evidence for the prognostic value of PSMA PET/CT for response assessment in men with advanced prostate cancer.

In our clinical experience using PSMA PET/CT for response evaluation of systemic metastatic castration-specific prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatments, a decrease in total disease burden can coincide with the appearance of new lesions. This scenario, referred to as heterogeneous response, often leaves the treating physician in a clinical dilemma. Considering the rapidly evolving era of targeted treatments for mCRPC, accurate and early response assessment is urgently needed. However, standardized response evaluation criteria for PSMA PET imaging have not been developed yet.

- **177 Lu-PSMA**: 177 Lu-PSMA is a small-molecule inhibitor that binds with high affinity to PSMA and delivers β-radiation. The randomized TheraP trial demonstrated superior prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and progression-free survival for 177 Lu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel. In the phase III VISION trial, 177 Lu-PSMA-617 prolonged overall survival.

### Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance [^113NyLgZ]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

The role of PSMA PET/CT in the diagnostic pathway for men with localized prostate cancer continues to emerge. Larger scale studies are needed to assess the role of PSMA PET in select men prior to being considered for active surveillance.

### The homunculus of unspecific bone uptakes associated with PSMA-targeted tracers: A systematic review-based definition [^114mMTS4]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-targeted Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has revolutionized prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and treatment, offering superior diagnostic accuracy over traditional methods and enabling theragnostic applications. However, a significant diagnostic challenge has emerged with identifying unspecific bone uptakes (UBUs), which could lead to over-staging and inappropriate treatment decisions if misinterpreted. This systematic review explores the phenomenon of UBUs in PCa patients undergoing PSMA-PET imaging.

- **Methods**: Studies assessing the prevalence, topographical distribution, and potential clinical implications of UBUs were selected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method and evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool.

- **Results**: The percentage of PCa patients with UBUs on PSMA-PET scans ranged from 0 to 71.7%, depending on the radiopharmaceutical used, with [¹⁸F]PSMA-1007 showing the highest incidence. The ribs are the primary site of UBUs across all PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals. The spine is the second most frequent UBU site for [⁶⁸Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [¹⁸F]DCFPyL, and [¹⁸F]rhPSMA-7, while the pelvic girdle represents the second most frequent site for [¹⁸F]PSMA-1007. The average maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUV max) of UBUs varied from 3.4 to 7.7 and was generally lower than bone metastases.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings underscore the need for heightened awareness and precise interpretation of UBUs to avoid over-treatment and misdiagnosis in PCa management.

### Reliability and practicability of PSMA-RADS 1.0 for structured reporting of PSMA-PET/CT scans in prostate cancer patients [^116ppqZP]. European Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Several reporting frameworks have been proposed for PSMA-PET/CT examinations to support image interpretation, including therapy response evaluation, and their use is generally recommended by international guidelines. When interpreting PSMA-directed PET/CT scans, the reader must navigate around certain pitfalls, including the normal biodistribution of different PSMA-directed PET radiotracers, the varying uptake of radiotracers in numerous types of both benign and malignant lesions, and resulting false-positive and false-negative findings. Therefore, Rowe et al. introduced a reporting and data system (RADS) for PSMA-PET/CT imaging, termed PSMA-RADS version 1.0, which uses a 5-point scale for the classification of every single lesion and the overall report: PSMA-RADS-1 (benign), PSMA-RADS-2 (likely benign), PSMA-RADS-3 (equivocal), PSMA-RADS-4 (prostate cancer highly likely), and PSMA-RADS-5 (prostate cancer almost certainly).

PSMA-RADS 1.0 has shown promising results as a simple and effective way to interpret PSMA-targeted PET imaging findings with high interreader agreement rates, even for readers with less experience in reading scans. Considering that in the future more PSMA-PET/CT scans will be performed in clinical routine and the reporting burden will increase significantly, there is still a lack of knowledge about certain interesting sub-issues of PSMA-RADS, such as the intrareader agreement of IR, especially in the absence of clinical data which corresponds to the real clinical workflow in a high-volume imaging center.

### Current and emerging clinical applications of PSMA PET diagnostic imaging for prostate cancer [^114tcK4o]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed on most prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and several PSMA ligands for PET imaging are now available worldwide. 68 Ga-PSMA-11 has already received U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval, and the use of PSMA PET is currently suggested by several international guidelines for investigating PCa in different clinical settings.

In primary PCa, PSMA PET has been shown to be superior to cross-sectional imaging for the detection of pelvic lymph nodes and distant metastases, leading to subsequent clinical management changes. Additionally, it might also have a role in intraprostatic tumor localization, especially when combined with multiparametric MRI. In the setting of PCa recurrence, higher detection rates have been observed than for any other available imaging techniques, especially at low prostate-specific antigen values. Furthermore, PSMA PET consistently led to a shift in clinical management, thus increasing the proportion of radiotherapy, surgery, or other focal therapies at the expense of systemic options or no treatment.

In oligometastatic disease after radical surgery, PSMA PET may be relevant in guiding a metastasis-directed therapy approach, as preliminary data suggest a benefit in terms of progression-free survival after the treatment of PSMA PET-positive lesions. As a staging and gatekeeping technique, PSMA PET represents a reliable whole-body imaging procedure in combination with second-line therapy for castration-resistant PCa, as well as being pivotal when assessing patients eligible for further intervention.

### Promise of PET imaging in prostate cancer: Improvement or waste of money [^114SttK2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is a high-prevalence malignancy whose management is a major challenge for clinicians worldwide. Molecular imaging, particularly PET with computed tomography (PET/CT), is increasingly gaining importance in the work-up and management of all prostate cancer patients. PET/CT remains, however, an expensive imaging modality and is currently not reimbursed.

Although other PET tracers are available and have gained institutional recognition from regulatory agencies, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based PET/CT tracers have demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer, outperforming any other PET radioligand at the time of writing. Regardless of the clinical scenario — staging, biochemical recurrence, or therapy response assessment in advanced prostate cancer — PSMA PET/CT scans have become common practice in countries allowing for use outside of controlled clinical trials because of the overwhelming evidence demonstrating the extremely high sensitivity of this imaging modality in identifying prostate cancer lesions. This evidence can make PSMA PET/CT appealing for clinicians and lead to unnecessary scanning with limited supporting evidence.

Our aim is to provide an update on the most recent literature available on PET-based imaging for prostate cancer, particularly PSMA PET/CT. We offer an expert opinion on the data collected to provide clinicians with guidance on the appropriateness and efficacy of PET-based imaging in order to maximize clinical benefits and avoid waste of resources.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: could we ask for more [^112qYPvv]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

PSMA PET/CT imaging has rapidly become a fundamental tool for staging and restaging prostate cancer. Its unprecedented sensitivity allows for better customization of treatment for each patient at any stage of the disease. The potential to guide therapy and to identify relapses early is also being explored, although further studies are needed to assess its impact on overall survival. For advanced metastatic prostate cancer, PSMA imaging is critical for selecting patients suitable for RLT, and promising data suggest a possible role as a predictor of response.

### Beyond fluorodeoxyglucose: Molecular imaging of cancer in precision medicine [^112tHrEy]. CA (2025). Low credibility.

PSMA-based imaging is a pivotal advancement in the molecular imaging of prostate cancer. PSMA is a transmembrane protein expressed by prostatic tissue and has been identified as an excellent biological target for molecular imaging of prostate cancer. Specific probes target PSMA using inhibitor peptides that bind to the extracellular domain of the antigen. These are labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides, such as the FDA-approved⁶⁸Ga-PSMA-11,¹⁸F-radiohybrid (rh)PSMA-7.3, and¹⁸F-DCFPyL, with others pending FDA approval. Both⁶⁸Ga-PSMA-11 and¹⁸F-DCFPyL also have European Medicines Agency approval.

The clinical value of PSMA-targeting PET in diagnosing and managing prostate cancer has been thoroughly investigated. This has led to the incorporation of this imaging modality into updated clinical guidelines on prostate cancer management, such as those from the European Association of Urology, European Association of Nuclear Medicine, European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, European Society of Urogenital Radiology, International Society of Urological Pathology, International Society of Geriatric Oncology, and the NCCN guidelines. PSMA PET/CT is commonly used in the routine initial staging of prostate cancer in patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk features (Gleason score 4 + 3, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 10–20 ng/mL, and/or T2b–T2c clinical stage) or high-risk features (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 4, PSA > 20 ng/mL, and/or T3–T4 clinical stage).

In the randomized controlled proPSMA trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ANZCTR12617000005358), greater diagnostic accuracy was reported.

### Incorporating prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in management decisions for men with newly diagnosed or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [^111yx7wT]. European Urology (2023). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising molecular target for prostate cancer (PCa). It has allowed the development of a novel diagnostic approach to PCa in the primary and recurrent settings. This narrative review aims to summarize available data and recommendations regarding the use of PSMA in newly diagnosed and recurrent PCa.

A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Scopus. The search strategy included meta-analyses, reviews, and original studies on staging and restaging with 68 Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).

Studies comparing PSMA-targeted imaging and conventional imaging suggest superior performance of PSMA-targeted imaging in primary and recurrent PCa, albeit with several clinically relevant limitations. Pretreatment 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT allowed more accurate PCa staging compared to routine practice for high-risk cases and identified a number of otherwise unknown metastatic lesions. In biochemically recurrent PCa, PSMA PET can reveal sites of recurrence with greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional imaging, potentially detecting a major proportion of occult disease. This review will help providers apply the most up-to-date and relevant literature to determine which patients truly have oligometastatic disease and ascertain who is most likely to experience a meaningful response to local consolidation in the biochemical recurrence setting.

Data on PSMA diagnostic studies in primary and recurrent settings underscore the utility of this imaging modality.

### Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance [^1116ixAe]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death after lung cancer. A variety of treatment options are now available for men with localised disease. Active surveillance (AS) has become a widely used strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer. It aims to avoid overtreatment but carries an acceptable risk associated with treatment delay should their cancer necessitate intervention. Patients remain under close surveillance through structured programmes with regular follow-up consisting of PSA testing, clinical examinations, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and repeat prostate biopsies, with curative treatment being prompted by predefined thresholds.

Accurate grading at the time of diagnosis is fundamental to risk stratification and treatment decision-making, particularly for men being considered for AS. With the introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), there has been a considerable improvement in sensitivity and specificity for the detection and staging of primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that tumour uptake, represented by PSMA expression, is strongly correlated with the Gleason Score of the primary prostatic tumour. This emerging imaging modality is a useful diagnostic tool to help identify men with clinically significant prostate cancer, and therefore, it has the potential to improve patient selection of men suitable for active surveillance.

Multiple studies have investigated cohorts of men on active surveillance, with encouraging findings.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^112s9VdC]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

PSMA-PET/CT imaging has revolutionized the approach to diagnosing and staging prostate cancer. Traditional imaging modalities, such as bone scans and CT scans, have limitations in sensitivity, particularly for detecting metastatic disease. For example, PSMA-PET/CT can more accurately identify locoregional lymph node metastases and distant metastases, thereby optimizing clinical staging and treatment planning for patients. PSMA-PET/CT utilizes a radioligand that specifically targets the PSMA, which is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, thereby enhancing the detection of both local and distant metastases.

Studies have shown that PSMA-PET/CT can identify metastatic lesions that may be missed by conventional imaging techniques, leading to changes in treatment strategies for a significant proportion of patients. PSMA-PET/CT achieves high-sensitivity imaging through radioligands targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a mechanism widely supported in the literature. PSMA is highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells, and radioligands (e.g. 68 Ga- or 18 F-labeled PSMA inhibitors) specifically bind to this antigen, thereby enhancing the detection of both local and distant metastatic lesions.

For example, a study in high-risk prostate cancer patients demonstrated that [18 F] PSMA-PET/CT exhibited superior sensitivity compared to conventional bone scans (BS) in detecting bone metastases, altering the CHAARTED risk stratification in 12.8% of patients and subsequently influencing treatment decisions.

### Lu-PSMA (r)evolution in cancer care: Is it really happening [^113BRcTg]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The field of theranostics holds enormous promise for the future of cancer management. The significant growth seen in the global theranostics market can be attributed to multiple factors, including the proven clinical value of approved RPT agents and their impact on patients' lives, alongside their successful commercialization. The investigation of different therapeutic targets across multiple disease areas, the use of combination therapies, and the exploration of different nuclides are only some of the areas that could lead to further advancements. Several challenges have been mentioned, including improving education and awareness, implementing successful referral systems, harmonizing regulations, and expanding infrastructure. To conclude, in the background of continued strategic investment due to the striking potential for patients, the 177 Lu-PSMA (r)evolution in cancer care must happen and will happen, but key stakeholders must closely collaborate to ensure that HCSs can allow timely and equitable access to treatment.

### Comparison of F-based PSMA radiotracers with [Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m3hez]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Studies were assessed for quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The risk of bias in patient selection was generally acceptable; however, it was high in a few studies. These studies were retrospective head-to-head analyses where non-consecutive patients with specific clinical indications required scans with two types of tracers. Furthermore, several studies were matched pair comparisons, raising concerns regarding applicability.

The risk of bias for the index test was high in some studies due to the absence of blinding of the tracer type. There is also a high risk of application concerns in studies that did not encourage voiding before imaging. Concerning the reference standard, the risk of bias was high in studies that did not verify all suspicious lesions with histology. The risk of bias related to timing and flow was high in several studies that did not adequately follow up on suspicious lesions over time. Summary findings for the QUADAS-2 appraisal are illustrated in the supplementary material (Supplementary Fig. 1). The quality of each article was assessed by two independent evaluators (S.H. and S.O.), with any discrepancies resolved by a third evaluator (N.L.).

The basic information extracted from the studies included the study nature and design, year of the study, country of the study's conduct, the indication for the scan, the sample size, and imaging protocols, including time to acquisition and injection dose. Patient characteristics were extracted when available.

### PSMA as a target for radiolabelled small molecules [^1149UXSm]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men in Europe. When detected early and localized to the prostate gland, the 5-year survival rate is nearly 100%. However, survival rates fall dramatically once cancer spreads beyond the prostate. In recent years, there has been a significant decrease in mortality mainly due to early detection. Nevertheless, this early detection has led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, impacting the quality of life of men with PCa. These challenges are due to the variability of the clinical course of the disease and the high prevalence of microscopic disease. Therefore, a risk-adapted strategy is needed to choose among a wide variety of treatment options, from active surveillance to aggressive treatment.

In light of such diverse options that affect survival and quality of life, patient-specific staging is essential for optimizing individual outcomes. Patient-specific staging drives the demand for sensitive and specific imaging of PCa, including intraprostatic disease and local and distant metastases. Furthermore, as active surveillance becomes a more widely considered management option in low-grade disease, a sensitive method for monitoring changes in tumor volume and location would potentially eliminate the need for repetitive biopsies and enable a more advanced temporal evaluation.

### Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance [^112x1QtZ]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Accurate grading at the time of diagnosis is fundamental to risk stratification and treatment decision-making, particularly for men being considered for active surveillance (AS). With the introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), there has been considerable improvement in sensitivity and specificity for detecting and staging clinically significant prostate cancer. Our study aims to determine the role of PSMA PET/CT in men with newly diagnosed low or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer to better select men for AS.

- **Method**: This is a retrospective single-center study performed from January 2019 to October 2022. The study includes men identified from an electronic medical record system who had undergone a PSMA PET/CT following a newly diagnosed low or favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The primary outcome was to assess the change in management for men being considered for AS following PSMA PET/CT results based on PSMA PET characteristics.

- **Results**: In total, there were 11 of 30 men (36.67%) who were assigned management by AS, and 19 of 30 men (63.33%) who had definitive treatment. Fifteen of the 19 men that needed treatment had concerning features on PSMA PET/CT results. Of the 15 men with concerning features on PSMA PET, 9 (60%) men were found to have adverse pathological features on final prostatectomy specimens.

- **Conclusion**: This retrospective study suggests that PSMA PET/CT has the potential to influence the management of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer that would otherwise be appropriate for AS based on initial risk assessment.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^117WX3Ha]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: This study explores the application of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients. PSMA PET/CT has emerged as a valuable imaging modality, providing enhanced detection capabilities in prostate cancer staging and recurrence assessment.

- **Advantages**: The main advantages of PSMA PET/CT include its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting prostate cancer lesions. This technology surpasses traditional imaging techniques, enabling clinicians to visualize metastatic sites with greater accuracy.

- **Clinical implications**: Incorporating PSMA PET/CT into clinical practice could improve decision-making and patient management, ultimately leading to better outcomes for prostate cancer patients.

The inclusion of PSMA PET/CT in clinical protocols shows promise; however, further research is necessary to fully understand its limitations and potential benefits.

### Beyond fluorodeoxyglucose: Molecular imaging of cancer in precision medicine [^111fuGGw]. CA (2025). High credibility.

Another important application of PSMA PET/CT is assessing eligibility before RLT with 177 Lu‐PSMA‐617 for metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer. This new treatment was recently approved by the FDA after the phase 3 VISION trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03511664) demonstrated that 177 Lu‐PSMA‐617 prolonged PFS and OS when added to standard‐of‐care management of these patients.

Additional applications of PSMA PET that are not yet part of the routine management of prostate cancer include its use for radiotherapy planning. In a clinical trial by Armstrong et al, PSMA PET using 68 Ga‐PSMA‐11 changed management in 45% of patients before salvage radiotherapy for biochemical recurrence compared with a 22% change in those who did not undergo PSMA PET (p = .002). Zamboglou et al. retrospectively demonstrated the ability of PSMA PET‐guided salvage radiotherapy to improve biochemical recurrence‐free survival versus radiotherapy not informed by PSMA PET (p = .01). Prospective studies assessing the survival impact of using PSMA PET in this setting are needed. PSMA PET may also be used for response assessment after systemic treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

In the United States, Australia, and most of Europe, PSMA PET and other forms of molecular prostate cancer imaging, such as 18 F‐fluciclovine PET, are accessible for routine clinical use. However, PET in general is not readily accessible in many developing countries, unlike traditional gamma cameras that can be used to image 99m Tc‐based tracers.

### Utility of PET to appropriately select patients for PSMA-targeted theranostics [^115rC7Ay]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The majority of aggressive prostate cancers overexpress the transmembrane protein prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA is, therefore, an attractive target for drug development. Over the last decade, numerous PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and therapy have been developed and investigated in theranostic combination. PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for imaging have been primarily developed for PET. PSMA PET provides whole-body evaluation of the degree of PSMA expression on tumors and potentially provides a method to better select patients for PSMA-targeted therapy.

Numerous PSMA-targeted therapeutic agents using β- or α-particle emitters are under study in clinical trials. In particular, the β-particle-emitting radioisotope 177Lu bound to PSMA-targeted small molecules have ongoing and completed late-stage clinical trials in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. To define the most appropriate patient group for PSMA-targeted therapeutics, multiple studies have investigated PSMA and FDG PET/CT to establish PET parameters as predictive and prognostic biomarkers.

This article discusses recent clinical trials that examine the optimal use of PET for the selection of patients for PSMA-targeted therapeutics and provides an integrative overview of the choice of PET tracer(s), targeting molecule, therapeutic radioisotope, nonradioactive therapy, and cancer type (prostate or nonprostate).

### Psma PET/CT for primary staging of prostate cancer - an updated overview [^115zT8gv]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT for primary staging of prostate cancer is gaining popularity due to its ability to assess whole-body disease burden with superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastases compared to conventional imaging. PSMA PET, in combination with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), enhances the sensitivity of assessing extra-prostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion compared to mpMRI alone. It may serve as a second-line modality for image-guided biopsies in patients with negative mpMRI and/or negative primary biopsies.

The superior diagnostic accuracy of PSMA PET/CT influences clinical decision-making, resulting in a change of clinical management in one-fourth of patients compared to conventional imaging. However, the impact of implementing PSMA PET/CT for primary staging on patient outcomes remains unclear, necessitating prospective studies. Various PSMA tracers exist with similar performance but exhibit minor pharmacokinetic differences, such as a higher rate of unspecific bone uptake with 18F-PSMA-1007, which, conversely, has lower urinary excretion, potentially favoring the detection of local recurrence.

Proper training of reporting physicians and understanding of the specific PSMA tracer's pitfalls are crucial for high-quality interpretation. This overview aims to provide insights into the literature and update the status of PSMA PET/CT for the primary staging of prostate cancer.

### Update on PSMA-based prostate cancer imaging [^117HrACB]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The increased use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) based PET imaging for prostate cancer (Pca) detection has revolutionized the clinical management of Pca, providing higher diagnostic sensitivity for extraprostatic disease and increasing clinical utility across different stages of the disease. The integration of PSMA PET imaging into clinical guidelines and consensus documents reflects its growing importance in the personalized management of Pca. This review of recent literature highlights the rapid evolution of PSMA PET into the mainstream of staging and restaging, with a decreasing reliance on conventional imaging modalities. This comprehensive review serves as a resource for clinicians and researchers involved in the domains of Pca diagnosis and management.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^113vKUuH]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the advantages of PSMA-PET/CT, challenges remain in its widespread adoption in clinical practice. Variability in access to this advanced imaging modality, along with the need for standardized protocols for interpretation and reporting, can hinder its implementation. Studies highlight significant disparities in accessibility to PSMA-PET/CT across healthcare institutions, particularly in resource-limited regions where this technology has not yet been incorporated into routine clinical pathways. This study reports the review of 26 studies, revealing substantial heterogeneity in defining PSMA-PET/CT-positive lesions, with interobserver variability reaching 15–30% for small lesions (< 5 mm) and those with low PSMA expression. Furthermore, the interpretation of PSMA-PET/CT results can be complicated by the potential for false positives due to PSMA expression in non-prostatic tissues, necessitating careful consideration and additional diagnostic workup in certain cases. To address these challenges, ongoing efforts to develop standardized reporting frameworks, such as the PSMA Reporting and Data System (PSMA-RADS), aim to improve communication between radiologists and referring physicians, ensuring that the information derived from PSMA-PET/CT is utilized effectively in clinical decision-making.

The integration of PSMA-PET/CT into clinical pathways for prostate cancer is not merely a diagnostic advancement; it represents a paradigm shift in how patients are managed throughout their treatment journey. By facilitating more accurate staging and guiding treatment selection, it enhances the overall management strategy.

### Reliability and practicability of PSMA-RADS 1.0 for structured reporting of PSMA-PET/CT scans in prostate cancer patients [^113SfU8b]. European Radiology (2024). High credibility.

As structured reporting is increasingly used in the evaluation of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT) for prostate cancer, there is a need to assess the reliability of these frameworks. This study aimed to evaluate the intra- and interreader agreement among readers with varying levels of experience using PSMA-RADS 1.0 for interpreting PSMA-PET/CT scans, even when blinded to clinical data, and therefore to determine the feasibility of implementing this reporting system in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: PSMA-PET/CT scans of 103 patients were independently evaluated by 4 readers with different levels of experience according to the reporting and data system (RADS) for PSMA-PET/CT imaging PSMA-RADS 1.0 at 2 time points within 6 weeks. For each scan, a maximum of five target lesions were freely chosen and stratified according to PSMA-RADS 1.0. Overall scan score and compartment-based scores were assessed. Intra- and interreader agreement was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

- **Results**: PSMA-RADS 1.0 demonstrated excellent interreader agreement for both overall scan scores (ICC ≥ 0.91) and compartment-based scores (ICC ≥ 0.93) across all four readers. The framework showed excellent intrareader agreement for overall scan scores (ICC ≥ 0.86) and compartment-based scores (ICC ≥ 0.95), even among readers with varying levels of experience.

- **Conclusions**: PSMA-RADS 1.0 is a reliable method for assessing PSMA-PET/CT with strong consistency and agreement among readers, showing great potential for clinical practice implementation.

### Sensitivity, specificity, and predictors of positive Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in advanced prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Dun8T]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography (PET) of 68 Ga-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) is an emerging imaging modality introduced to assess the burden of prostate cancer, typically in biochemically reor advanced disease. 68 Ga-PSMA PET provides the ability to selectively identify and localize metastatic prostate cancer cells and subsequently change patient management. Owing to its limited history, robust sensitivity and specificity data are not available for 68 Ga-PSMA PET-positive scans.

- **Objective**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of reported predictors of positive 68 Ga-PSMA PET and corresponding sensitivity and specificity profiles.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We performed critical reviews of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases in April 2016 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment if Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of proportions were performed using a random-effects model with pre-PET prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as the dependent variable. Summary sensitivity and specificity values were obtained by fitting bivariate hierarchical regression models.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Sixteen articles involving 1309 patients were analysed. The overall percentage of positive 68 Ga-PSMA PET among patients was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19–64%) for primary staging and 76% (95% CI 66–85%) for biochemical recurrence (BCR). Positive 68 Ga-PSMA PET scans

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^115nS3A4]? Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Up until recent years, conventional imaging modalities such as bone scan, CT, and mpMRI were considered the standard of care for the primary staging of prostate cancer. These methods revealed poor sensitivity and specificity and were gradually overtaken by PET/CT with PSMA tracers. PSMA is a type II trans-membrane glycoprotein normally expressed in some epithelia, such as the salivary and lacrimal glands, duodenum, liver, and spleen, and is highly expressed on the cell surface of almost 90% of prostate cancer. Moreover, PSMA expression is also correlated with tumor grade, higher PSA values, and prognosis. PET/CT with Ga or F-labeled PSMA tracers provides a significant increase in the accuracy of primary staging of prostate cancer.

A recent study by Szigeti et al. compared mpMRI and PSMA PET/CT in staging primary index lesions and pelvic lymph node metastasis in intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer patients. A total of 81 patients were included. The index lesion was detected by PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI in 87% and 98% of them, respectively. However, regarding N staging, 60% of patients with histology-proven pelvic lymph node metastasis were detected by PSMA PET/CT, whereas only 50% were detected by mpMRI. Bone and distant lymph node metastasis were found by PSMA PET/CT in 17% of patients, with 39% of bone metastasis appearing without any morphological correlation on CT.

### Prostate cancer radioligand therapy: PSMA and beyond, current landscape and future directions [^115whfLz]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

There has been a rapid increase in the use and investigation of radioligand therapies for prostate cancer. This review summarizes and synthesizes the landscape of prostate cancer radioligand therapies. It highlights the challenges facing optimal radioligand use and outlines approaches to improve the efficacy of this therapeutic class.

Recent findings indicate that the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed radioligand 177 Lu-PSMA-617 improves survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after chemotherapy and is now a standard-of-care treatment option for these patients. Published and ongoing trials promise to expand the use of radioligand therapies in prostate cancer. These trials highlight the potential of novel radioligand targets, alternate radioisotopes, and combination therapy approaches to improve radioligand efficacy. Emerging radioligands, novel combination therapies, optimized patient selection, and dose personalization promise to improve outcomes and expand the use of radioligand therapies in prostate cancer.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^117RNrQ5]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

- **Comparison with traditional imaging techniques**: When compared to traditional imaging techniques such as bone scans, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PSMA-PET/CT offers superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer. Conventional imaging techniques often face challenges in differentiating benign from malignant prostatic lesions, particularly under conditions of low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. For instance, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences (e.g. T2-weighted imaging), while valuable in detecting prostate cancer, exhibit limited specificity in distinguishing benign hyperplasia from malignant lesions, especially when PSA levels are low.

	- Studies have indicated that at PSA levels < 0.2 ng/mL, the sensitivity of conventional imaging modalities (e.g. bone scans or CT) decreases significantly, whereas prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based PET/CT maintains a high positive detection rate (75–100%). Further analysis demonstrated that the lesion detection rate of PSMA-PET/CT under low PSA conditions (e.g. PSA < 0.01 ng/mL) was 55.6%, while this rate increased to 98.8% when PSA exceeded 0.2 ng/mL.

	- In contrast, PSMA-PET/CT demonstrates significantly higher detection rates for lymph node and distant metastases. For example, the prospective randomized controlled proPSMA trial revealed that PSMA-PET/CT achieved 85% sensitivity and 98% specificity for detecting pelvic lymph node metastases, whereas conventional imaging (CT combined with bone scan) showed only 38% sensitivity and 91% specificity.

### PET imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer: Current state of the art and future challenges [^1123Gmq7]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell surface enzyme that is highly expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and is currently being extensively explored as a promising target for molecular imaging in a variety of clinical contexts. Novel antibody and small-molecule PSMA radiotracers, labeled with a variety of radionuclides for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging applications, have been developed and explored in recent studies.

- **Methods**: A great deal of progress has been made in defining the clinical utility of this class of PET agents through predominantly small and retrospective clinical studies. The most compelling data, at the time of writing, has been in the setting of biochemically recurrent PCa, where PSMA-targeted radiotracers have been found to be superior to conventional imaging and other molecular imaging agents for the detection of locally recurrent and metastatic PCa.

- **Results**: Early data, however, suggest that initial lymph node staging before definitive therapy in high-risk primary PCa patients may be limited, although intraoperative guidance may still hold promise. Other examples of potential promising applications for PSMA PET imaging include non-invasive characterization of primary PCa, staging and treatment planning for PSMA-targeted radiotherapeutics, and guidance of focal therapy for oligometastatic disease.

- **Conclusions**: However, all of these indications and applications for PCa PSMA PET imaging are still lacking validated data and require large, prospective, systematic clinical trials for validation. Such validation trials are needed and are hopefully forthcoming.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: an umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^111z5VL9]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The timing of intervention in prostate cancer management is critical, as early treatment has been associated with improved patient prognosis. Evidence suggests that survival benefits from early intervention are primarily observed in intermediate- to high-risk patient subgroups, with limited overall strength of evidence and potential treatment-related risks. The latest clinical decision aids (e.g. the Navigate platform) recommend integrating personalized risk assessments (such as PSA kinetics and genetic testing) and patient quality-of-life preferences, rather than relying solely on early treatment timing.

Large-scale randomized trials (e.g. the ProtecT trial) have shown comparable 10-year overall survival rates (~98–99%) between active surveillance and immediate treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) for localized prostate cancer. However, in high-risk patients (e.g. PSA > 20 ng/ml or Gleason score ≥ 8), radical therapies may reduce cancer-specific mortality by 5–10%. Early intervention strategies, particularly in high-risk populations identified through PSMA-PET/CT imaging, can lead to favorable outcomes by addressing the disease before it progresses to advanced stages where treatment options become limited and less effective.

Studies have shown that early treatment can reduce the risk of metastasis and improve the likelihood of achieving long-term remission. For instance, patients with high-risk features detected via PSMA-PET/CT may benefit from immediate systemic therapy, which can prevent the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer.

### Standardized template for clinical reporting of PSMA PET/CT scans [^116Zxa5F]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). High credibility.

An independent, multidisciplinary panel of global expert physicians involved in prostate cancer (PCa) patient care, including radiologists, medical oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, radiation oncologists, and urologists from both academic institutions and community practices, convened throughout several meetings to discuss reporting practices across institutions and countries. Panel participants identified gaps and the implementation of PSMA PET guidelines to aid the understanding of practices across settings.

Common themes, data elements, and their relationship to prognostication and relevance to treatment consideration were identified. From these, a concise set of reporting criteria deemed most relevant across a multidisciplinary platform intended to aid patient management decisions was agreed upon in the context of PSMA PET/CT imaging. The main output was the development of an easily implementable, user-friendly, standard PSMA PET/CT reporting template with the minimum necessary information for radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians to provide to referring physicians. Results from panel participant discussions are presented.

### Using PSMA imaging for prognostication in localized and advanced prostate cancer [^117UgZrP]. Nature Reviews Urology (2023). High credibility.

Use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed applications in modern prostate cancer management has evolved rapidly over the past few years, helping to establish new treatment pathways and provide further insights into prostate cancer biology. However, the prognostic implications of PSMA-PET have not been studied systematically, owing to rapid clinical implementation without long follow-up periods to determine intermediate-term and long-term oncological outcomes. Currently available data suggest that traditional prognostic factors and survival outcomes are associated with high PSMA expression (both according to immunohistochemistry and PET uptake) in men with localized and biochemically relapsed disease. Treatment with curative intent (primary and/or salvage) often fails when PSMA-positive metastases are present; however, the sensitivity of PSMA-PET in detecting all metastases is poor. Low PSMA-PET uptake in relapsed disease is a favorable prognostic factor; however, it can be associated with poor prognosis in conjunction with high 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Clinical trials embedding PSMA-PET for guiding management with reliable oncological outcomes are needed to support ongoing clinical use.

### Is 18f-PSMA PET/CT a reliable imaging modality to evaluate the status of recurrent/residual brain tumors in post-treatment patients [^113L4qMS]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Brain tumors are among the most challenging malignancies. Existing investigational and treatment modalities have several drawbacks, including a high rate of recurrence and residual tumoral tissue. Positron Emission Tomography combined with computed tomography (PET-CT) is a widely used imaging modality for both oncological and non-oncological purposes, with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) being the most familiar radiotracer. The physiological uptake of FDG in brain parenchyma makes it challenging to delineate residual or recurrent brain tumors, prompting the investigation of new radiotracers.

- **Objective**: The purpose of the present study is to identify the role of 18 fluoride-labeled Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in detecting residual or recurrent brain malignancies. The study compares the PSMA PET-CT scan with standard conventional imaging for this purpose.

- **Methods**: This prospective study enrolled patients who had undergone treatment, including surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy. To detect residual disease, 18F-PSMA PET-CT and conventional imaging modalities were performed. We calculated the diagnostic performance of the PSMA PET-CT and compared it with standard conventional imaging modalities.

- **Results**: Thirty-one patients were included in the study. Out of these, 23 patients (approximately 74.2%) were positive on the PSMA PET-CT scan, while 18 patients (approximately 58.06%) were positive on conventional imaging for residual mitotic disease. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic yields for PSMA PET-CT and conventional imaging were 96% and 88%, respectively.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^111vUGB6]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Thanks to the development of novel PSMA-based peptides, molecular imaging such as PET/CT paired with theranostic-based approaches have recently been proposed for the treatment of prostate cancer. Patient selection, however, remains challenging because of the absence of strong prospective data to interpret and translate imaging scans into effective and well-tolerated treatment regimens.

- **Recent findings**: In this review, we discuss the latest findings in PSMA imaging in prostate cancer patients, particularly focusing on the impact of PSMA imaging on treatment management in primary staging, biochemical recurrence, and advanced prostate cancer.

- **Summary**: For primary prostate cancer staging, PSMA PET/CT seems crucial for primary therapy assessment. It is able, in some cases, to detect lesions outside the surgical template, thus permitting a change in management. Moreover, N+ condition at PSMA has been correlated with worse biochemical recurrence-free and therapy-free survival. The early detection of PSMA-positive findings in reProstate cancer is associated with better time to relapse survival. Similarly, for advanced prostate cancer patients, accurate restaging with PSMA imaging is gaining importance for early prediction of response to systemic therapies and to assure the best outcome possible. With regards to theranostics, appropriate selection of patients eligible for 177 Lu-PSMA requires PSMA imaging, whereas the role of added FDG-PET for discriminating those with PSMA/FDG discordance needs to be further evaluated.

### Evolving paradigms in prostate cancer: The integral role of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography in primary staging and therapeutic decision-making [^1131MB7E]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2025). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography or computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as a superior imaging option compared to conventional imaging for prostate cancer. Early evidence and prospective trials primarily evaluated PSMA PET/CT in biochemical recurrence or metastatic settings. However, an increasing number of prospective trials have focused on the primary setting.

This narrative review aims to describe the role of PSMA PET/CT in localized primary prostate cancer, focusing on the prospective evidence available in this setting. The practice and future potential for PSMA PET/CT in multiple stages of localized primary prostate cancer are detailed.

The most common application of PSMA PET/CT is in the primary nodal and metastatic staging of high-risk prostate cancer. We also explore other roles of PSMA PET/CT, including its use in intermediate-risk prostate cancer, local staging, and its impact on radiation therapy and surgical management.

Further discussion includes potential future roles of PSMA PET/CT in prediagnosis such as risk stratification for biopsy, prognostication, and specific surgical applications. Potential pitfalls of PSMA PET/CT are also addressed. PSMA PET/CT has already significantly impacted prostate cancer management and is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in localized primary prostate cancer.

### Bridging the imaging gap: PSMA PET/CT has a high impact on treatment planning in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence-a narrative review of the literature [^115XNgAP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

68 Ga- and 18 F-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) molecules have created new opportunities for the unmet diagnostic needs in prostate cancer. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of studies that have examined the role of PSMA PET in treatment planning for prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR).

- **Methods**: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central were searched for relevant articles. After excluding the articles that did not fulfill the required criteria, we included in this review 12 publications that reported the impact of PSMA PET on the treatment plan for prostate cancer patients with BCR.

- **Results**: All studies in our review emphasized the impact of PSMA PET images on therapy management in prostate cancer patients with BCR. Overall, the impact of PSMA PET/CT on therapy management varied between 30% and 76% among the 1,346 patients included in the review. Upstaging was reported in 32%-67% of the patients. Patients with low prostate-specific antigen values (< 0.5 ng/mL) also demonstrated positive lesions, which could not have been detected by means of conventional imaging techniques. Important modifications to the original treatment plan included avoidance of systemic therapy (17%-40%) and PET-directed local therapy (in ≤ 60% of the patients). PSMA imaging demonstrated a high clinical impact in patients with BCR, with modifications to the original treatment plan occurring among half the patients. Detecting recurrence in BCR can prevent unnecessary toxicity and lead to individualized therapy.

### Clinical impact of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PET) on intensification or deintensification of advanced renal cell carcinoma management [^11434H7G]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

There is an emerging role in the use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) in renal cell carcinoma. Herein, we report our experience in the use of PSMA PET in recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent PSMA PET for suspected recurrent or de novo metastatic RCC between 2015 and 2020 at three institutions was performed. The primary outcome was change in management (intensification or deintensification) following PSMA PET scan. Secondary outcomes included histopathological correlation of PSMA avid sites, comparison of sites of disease on PSMA PET to diagnostic CT, and time to systemic treatment.

### Consensus statements on PSMA PET/CT response assessment criteria in prostate cancer [^115EaFda]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Within the scope of each thematic topic, statements were developed by the panelists during the one-day meeting concerning how to interpret PSMA PET/CT to define response and progression in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and when to use it. These thematic topics and statements, along with the corresponding median agreement scores (MAS), interpercentile ranges (IPR), and interpercentile ranges adjusted for symmetry (IPRAS) from the voting, are reported.

The statements covered the best timing for performing PSMA PET/CT, the criteria that should be used to evaluate the PSMA PET/CT response, the patients who could benefit from such evaluation from a clinical perspective, and how the various PSMA-targeting PET tracers should be handled.

- **Consensus statements on PSMA PET/CT response assessment criteria**: Available real-world data and/or trial data should be analyzed for response assessment with PSMA PET/CT before designing future prospective trials. Criteria for treatment assessment should be evaluated in test-retest trials to assess normal variability in the measurement. In every instance, the MAS fell in the 7–9 category and IPR was lower than IPRAS, indicating "agreement" and "consensus".

### High interobserver agreement on PSMA PET/CT even in the absence of clinical data [^115ZdMv9]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

We observed high concordance rates among multiple observers when applying a structured framework for interpreting 68 Ga-labeled PSMA PET. Of note, scan findings remained nearly identical when clinical data were not presented, supporting the notion that even in the absence of relevant patient characteristics, expert readers still achieve a high concordance rate when interpreting PSMA-targeted scans. These observations may be relevant in a busy PET practice with a high volume of men scanned with PSMA PET/CT or in the context of central imaging review in clinical trials with readers who are blinded to clinical data. Nonetheless, in clinical routine, readers should ensure that patient's data are available at the time of scan interpretation.

### Impact of Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on staging and management of prostate cancer patients in various clinical settings: A prospective single-center study [^111ap93g]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The impact of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT on the management of prostate cancer (PCa) patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) is well established. However, whether and how PSMA PET/CT affects the management of patients undergoing scans for other clinical indications remains unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on initial and subsequent management decisions in a cohort of PCa patients referred for various indications, excluding the two main classic indications: BCR and presurgical staging.

This was a prospective study of 197 patients that aimed to determine the impact of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on PCa stage and management. The indications for PSMA PET/CT were initial staging of nonsurgical candidates (30 patients) and restaging after definitive treatment (167 patients). The restaging cohort comprised patients restaged with known advanced metastatic disease (n = 103), after androgen deprivation therapy only (n = 16), after surgery with serum prostate-specific antigen levels lower than 0.2 ng/mL (n = 13), after radiation therapy not meeting the Phoenix criteria (n = 22), and after other primary local treatments such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, focal laser ablation, cryoablation, hyperthermia, or irreversible electroporation (n = 13). Patients with BCR and candidates for curative surgery were excluded. The impact on management was assessed using pre- and post-PET questionnaires completed by referring physicians, electronic chart review, or patient telephone calls.

### Highlights of the 30th annual congress of the EANM, Vienna 2017: "Yes we can - make nuclear medicine great again" [^112ZGYTi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer imaging and therapy, driven by the success of PSMA ligands, has been a well-represented topic throughout all EANM meetings over recent years. The high interest and scientific focus is exemplified by a number of excellent presentations dealing with RT planning, the use of PET/MRI, and novel prostate cancer-targeting radiopharmaceuticals.

- **Calais et al. study**: The first excellent study was presented by Calais et al. This was a collaboration between the US and Germany. The authors reviewed 252 patients with early biochemical relapse after prostatectomy who had been scanned with 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to define the impact on RT planning. 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT affected salvage radiation therapy planning in 55% of patients with early biochemical recurrence (PSA < 1 ng/ml) after radical prostatectomy.

	- **68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT mapping**: Mapping of early biochemical recurrence after primary surgery in 270 patients with PSA < 1.0 ng/ml, indicating the high potential clinical impact of PSMA PET on salvage radiotherapy planning.

- **Schwarzenboeck et al. study**: Schwarzenboeck et al. (Rostock, Germany) analyzed the use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in 38 patients with prostate cancer with a high risk or persistence of biochemical recurrence who were candidates for radiation therapy. In about 70% of these patients, there was a clear direct impact on radiation therapy in terms of a change in the planning target volume and the addition of booster doses.

- **Freitag et al. study**: Another interesting study was presented by Freitag et al. (Munich, Germany) on the use of 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/MRI combined with integrated multiparametric PET/MRI for imaging prostate.

### High interobserver agreement on PSMA PET/CT even in the absence of clinical data [^111hQx5t]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Recommended by guidelines, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed PET/CT is increasingly used in men with prostate cancer (PC). We aimed to provide concordance rates using the PSMA reporting and data system (RADS) for scan interpretation and also determine whether such agreement rates are affected by available patient characteristics at the time of the scan.

- **Patients and methods**: Sixty men with PC, who all underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, were included. Three independent, experienced readers indicated general scan parameters, including overall scan result, organ or lymph node (LN) involvement, and appropriateness of radioligand therapy. Applying PSMA-RADS 1.0, observers also had to conduct RADS scoring on a target lesion (TL) and overall scan level. During the first read, observers were masked to all relevant clinical information, whereas on a second read, relevant patient characteristics were displayed, thereby allowing for determination of the impact of available clinical information for scan interpretation. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]), which were then rated according to Cicchetti (0.4–0.59 fair, 0.6–0.74 good, and 0.75–1 excellent agreement).

- **Results**: For general parameters, agreement rates were excellent, including an overall scan result (ICC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.90), LN metastases (ICC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93), organ involvement (ICC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.89), and indication for radioligand therapy (ICC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.96). Overall RADS scoring was also excellent with an ICC of 0.9.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: an umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^116ED864]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

Although standardized reporting systems for PSMA-PET/CT remain under development, its high specificity (> 95%) in staging, recurrence monitoring, and treatment response assessment has progressively established it as the cornerstone of clinical practice, replacing conventional imaging. These findings collectively underscore PSMA-PET/CT's pivotal role in enhancing therapeutic precision and reducing unnecessary interventions.

- **Clinical application examples and data analysis**: Clinical applications of PSMA-PET/CT have been extensively documented, showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios. For instance, in primary staging, PSMA-PET/CT exhibits superior sensitivity (78%) and specificity compared to conventional imaging (e.g. CT or bone scans), particularly in high-risk prostate cancer patients. Studies indicate that modifying treatment strategies based on PSMA-PET/CT findings (e.g. avoiding unnecessary extended lymph node dissection) can reduce healthcare costs, averaging €674 savings in European countries, though clinicians must consider risks of false-positive misinterpretations (e.g. misclassifying localized lymph node metastases as widespread disease, leading to inappropriate palliative care). However, its limited sensitivity for seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) assessment (42.29%) underscores the need for complementary imaging or pathological confirmation. Furthermore, the study revealed that among patients who were N0/M0 based on conventional imaging, PSMA-PET/CT identified metastatic disease in a significant percentage, emphasizing its role in refining staging.

### High interobserver agreement on PSMA PET/CT even in the absence of clinical data [^115wwEAw]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In 60 men with prostate cancer (PC) who were imaged with PSMA PET/CT, we observed excellent agreement rates when investigating general parameters such as the overall scan result or indication for radioligand therapy. Overall, the PSMA-RADS score also achieved excellent concordance, whereas on a TL-based level, agreement rates ranged from fair to excellent. When comparing the first blinded read with the second interpretation (with available clinical information), changes were minimal (up to 5%). These modifications on PSMA-RADS were mainly triggered by provided PSA levels. Therefore, in a busy PET practice where clinical information may be missing at the time of scan interpretation, PSMA-RADS still showed high concordance rates. Additionally, the high agreement rate in the absence of clinical information may be important for clinical trials with blinded reads. Taken together, PSMA-RADS may have the potential to facilitate scan interpretation in a busy PET practice, which could positively impact the clinical workflow. The high interobserver agreement rate using PSMA-RADS may also be useful for larger therapeutic trials, for example, to assess molecular image-based response after initiation of novel targeted therapies.

PSMA-targeted molecular imaging has become the diagnostic standard for men with PC in recent years, and both 68 Ga- and 18 F-labeled radiotracers have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. As such, a steady increase in PSMA-targeted scans can be anticipated.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^111CVtSU]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

In summary, the advent of PSMA-PET/CT imaging for patients with high-risk prostate cancer marks a noteworthy evolution in staging, treatment modification, and associated survival advantages. This review emphasizes the clinical significance of PSMA-PET/CT, highlighting its capacity to refine the management of prostate cancer through precise detection of disease dissemination and informed treatment planning. This pioneering imaging technique supports a more tailored therapeutic approach, increasingly crucial in an era characterized by personalized medicine.

Nonetheless, in light of these encouraging results, it is vital to recognize the limitations and barriers to the integration of PSMA-PET/CT into everyday clinical practice. Challenges such as the necessity for standardized imaging protocols, discrepancies in the availability of radiotracers, and the urgent need for thorough training of healthcare professionals in interpreting these sophisticated imaging findings must be addressed. Furthermore, while the existing evidence is compelling, further validation through expansive, multicenter trials is needed to offer a more profound insight into the long-term survival benefits linked to PSMA-PET/CT-guided management.

From a professional standpoint, it is essential to strike a balance among the varied research findings and viewpoints regarding PSMA-PET/CT. While the technology presents significant benefits, it is equally important to contextualize these results within the broader framework of prostate cancer treatment.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: could we ask for more [^115yhCqf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address recent progress in the use of novel PSMA-based peptides and molecular imaging, such as PET/CT paired with theranostic-based approaches, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Though promising, patient selection remains challenging due to the lack of strong prospective data necessary for interpreting and translating imaging scans into effective and well-tolerated treatment regimens.

In this review, the latest findings in PSMA imaging in prostate cancer patients are discussed in detail. Specifically, the impact of PSMA imaging on treatment management is examined, focusing on primary staging, biochemical recurrence, and advanced prostate cancer.

For primary prostate cancer staging, PSMA PET/CT appears crucial for primary therapy assessment. It has the potential to detect lesions outside the surgical template, allowing for modifications in management. Additionally, the presence of N+ condition at PSMA is associated with significantly worse biochemical recurrence-free and therapy-free survival. Early detection of PSMA-positive findings in recurrent prostate cancer is linked to improved time to relapse survival. Similarly, for advanced prostate cancer, accurate restaging using PSMA imaging is increasingly important for early prediction of response to systemic therapies and to ensure the best possible outcomes. In the context of theranostics, selecting patients eligible for 177Lu-PSMA therapy requires PSMA imaging, and the role of additional FDG-PET in identifying individuals with PSMA/FDG discordance remains to be further clarified.

### PSMA PET and radionuclide therapy in prostate cancer [^112Qfxoz]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men and a major cause of cancer death. Accurate imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, staging, restaging, detection of biochemical recurrence, and therapy for patients with PCa. As no effective treatment is available for advanced PCa, there is an urgent need to develop new and more effective therapeutic strategies. To optimize treatment outcomes, especially in high-risk patients, therapy is rapidly moving toward personalization.

Medical imaging, including positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), plays a crucial role in personalized medicine in oncology. In recent years, much focus has been on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a promising target for imaging and therapy with radionuclides since it is upregulated in most PCa cases. In the prostate, one potential role for PSMA PET imaging is to guide focal therapy. Several studies have demonstrated PSMA PET/CT's great potential for initial staging, lymph node staging, and recurrence detection of PCa, even at very low prostate-specific antigen values after primary therapy. Furthermore, studies have indicated that PSMA PET/CT has a higher detection rate than choline PET/CT.

Radiolabeled PSMA ligands for therapy show promise in several studies with metastatic PCa and are an area of active investigation. The "image and treat" strategy with radiolabeled PSMA ligands has the potential to improve the treatment outcome for patients with PCa and is paving the way for precision medicine in PCa. The aim of this review is to explore these developments.
