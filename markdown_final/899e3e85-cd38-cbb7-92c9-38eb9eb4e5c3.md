## Question

Antifungal nail laquer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antifungal nail lacquer for onychomycosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and confirming the diagnostic approach. Then, I should verify which topical agents are FDA-approved and how they are used. Next, I will review efficacy data and quality of evidence, followed by safety and tolerability. After that, I need to consider special populations and when topical therapy is preferred. Finally, I will integrate combination strategies, practical application details, and a bottom-line recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and diagnostic standard. Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most often due to dermatophytes, and diagnosis should be confirmed mycologically with KOH microscopy, culture, or histology before committing to prolonged therapy, especially when oral agents are contemplated, to avoid overtreatment and ensure accurate outcomes assessment [^112YLKrj] [^117XxeYW].

> I need to check which topical agents are actually approved and available. In the U.S., three topical therapies are FDA-approved for onychomycosis: ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, efinaconazole 10% solution, and tavaborole 5% solution; amorolfine 5% lacquer is available in many countries but is not FDA-approved in the U.S., though it appears in international guidelines and studies [^117SAvvE] [^117FtDr9].

> Now, let me review efficacy, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. High-quality randomized trials and Cochrane analyses show efinaconazole 10% once daily for 48 weeks achieves significantly higher complete cure than vehicle, with mycologic cure around 53–55% and complete cure around 15–18% at 52 weeks; tavaborole 5% once daily shows superiority to vehicle for complete cure and mycologic outcomes, though absolute complete cure rates remain modest; ciclopirox 8% lacquer shows a smaller benefit signal and is generally less effective than the newer agents, with complete cure rates often in the single digits in rigorous trials, though it may still help mycologic clearance and can be considered when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^112C3YoG] [^1127Qx9o] [^1145rgCL].

> Wait, let me verify the role of combination therapy because I initially thought ciclopirox plus oral therapy might be standard; hold on, I should verify guideline positions. The FDA label for ciclopirox advises against combining with systemic antifungals for onychomycosis due to lack of supportive data, whereas multiple randomized studies and meta-analyses suggest that adding a topical lacquer such as amorolfine to oral terbinafine or itraconazole improves outcomes in severe or matrix-involved disease; guidelines also endorse combination therapy when response to topical monotherapy is likely to be poor, so I need to reconcile this by noting that ciclopirox-specific combination data are limited, whereas amorolfine-based combinations have stronger supportive evidence and guideline endorsement in selected cases [^111hpNKT] [^115zhYmo] [^116PFJ43] [^1147QjSw].

> I should confirm safety and tolerability next. Topical agents generally have favorable safety profiles, with local application-site reactions such as dermatitis, vesicles, erythema, and burning being most common; efinaconazole and tavaborole have slightly higher rates of local adverse events than vehicle but these are usually mild and rarely lead to discontinuation; ciclopirox has minimal systemic absorption, with mean absorption less than 5% of the applied dose and low serum levels in clinical use, supporting its safety in patients who cannot take systemic therapy [^1127Qx9o] [^116oaAwg].

> Let me consider special populations, and I need to ensure age-appropriate approvals. For pediatric patients, efinaconazole and tavaborole are FDA-approved down to age 6, and ciclopirox is approved from age 12; children often respond better to topical monotherapy due to thinner, faster-growing nails, and pediatric data for efinaconazole show meaningful complete and mycologic cure rates with excellent tolerability, making topical therapy a reasonable first-line option in many children with mild to moderate disease [^11481Mie] [^112B36bU].

> For patients with diabetes or other comorbidities where systemic therapy is risky, I should confirm that topical therapy is appropriate. Topical efinaconazole or tavaborole are preferred when liver disease, drug interactions, or patient preference limit oral options; ciclopirox remains an alternative, though less effective, and all topical regimens benefit from concurrent nail care and debridement to reduce fungal burden and improve drug access to the nail unit [^112YLKrj] [^111EXHnf].

> Next, I should review practical application details to avoid common pitfalls. Efinaconazole and tavaborole are applied once daily to the entire nail plate and hyponychium for 48 weeks; ciclopirox 8% is applied daily with weekly removal using alcohol and monthly professional debridement of unattached nail as part of a comprehensive program; patients should avoid nail polish and harsh chemicals on treated nails, and adherence over the long course is critical to outcomes [^111EXHnf] [^112C3YoG].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of debridement and mechanical measures. Professional debridement reduces fungal biomass and improves topical drug penetration, and guidelines advise against debridement alone as treatment but support it as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy; in a randomized trial, debridement plus ciclopirox achieved substantially higher mycologic cure than debridement alone, reinforcing the value of combined mechanical and medical therapy in appropriate patients [^116yweLU] [^114BpkbX].

> I will now examine duration and expectations, and I need to ensure I set realistic goals. Complete cure with topicals is generally lower than with oral terbinafine, and treatment duration is long, typically 48 weeks, with additional improvement sometimes seen up to 72 weeks in severe cases; partial improvement and mycologic clearance are meaningful endpoints, and patients should be counseled accordingly to maintain adherence and prevent premature discontinuation [^1127Qx9o] [^111euFbn].

> But wait, what if the infection is severe or there is matrix involvement. In those scenarios, I should reconsider and discuss systemic therapy, as oral terbinafine remains first-line for dermatophyte onychomycosis with significantly higher complete and mycologic cure rates than topicals; if oral therapy is contraindicated, prolonged topical therapy with efinaconazole or tavaborole is reasonable, and in select cases, combination with a topical lacquer may be considered off-label, acknowledging the stronger evidence base for amorolfine combinations than for ciclopirox combinations [^112YLKrj] [^114oMws9] [^115zhYmo].

> Let me synthesize a bottom-line recommendation, and I should double-check that it aligns with evidence and guidelines. For mild to moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement, efinaconazole 10% solution once daily for 48 weeks is the preferred topical option given its highest-quality efficacy data and favorable safety; tavaborole 5% solution is a reasonable alternative with moderate-quality evidence; ciclopirox 8% lacquer is less effective but may be used when systemic therapy is contraindicated or as part of a comprehensive program with monthly debridement; in severe disease or when response to topical monotherapy is poor, consider oral terbinafine or itraconazole, and in matrix-involved or refractory cases, consider combination therapy with oral plus topical agents, preferably amorolfine-based combinations where available and appropriate [^1127Qx9o] [^112CywgH] [^1147QjSw] [^115zhYmo].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and prevention are addressed. Recurrence is common, so patients should be counseled on foot hygiene, shoe and sock disinfection, and prompt treatment of tinea pedis; for those with repeated failures or atypical presentations, confirm the diagnosis again and consider non-dermatophyte molds or resistance patterns, adjusting therapy accordingly and documenting outcomes with standardized criteria to guide retreatment decisions [^112YLKrj] [^111gQyth].

Antifungal nail lacquers are **topical treatments** for onychomycosis, most commonly ciclopirox 8% [^111hpNKT], efinaconazole 10% [^112C3YoG], and tavaborole 5% [^1127Qx9o]. They are best for **mild to moderate disease** [^112YLKrj] without matrix involvement, with efinaconazole and tavaborole offering the highest-quality evidence for complete and mycologic cure [^1127Qx9o]. Ciclopirox is less effective [^1127Qx9o] but useful when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^114q5VLm]. Adverse effects are usually mild local reactions [^1127Qx9o]; systemic absorption is minimal [^116oaAwg], making them safe for many patients, including children and those with comorbidities [^11481Mie]. Combination with oral therapy or debridement can improve outcomes [^115zhYmo] [^114BpkbX], and treatment duration is typically 48–52 weeks [^112C3YoG] with regular nail care [^111t4LNS].

## Types of antifungal nail lacquers

Several **antifungal nail lacquers** are available, each with distinct pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy:

| **Agent** | **Formulation** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ciclopirox | 8% nail lacquer | Chelates iron, disrupts DNA/RNA synthesis | Moderate efficacy; mycologic cure ~29–36% [^notfound] |
| Efinaconazole | 10% solution | Inhibits lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase | High efficacy; complete cure ~15–18% [^112C3YoG], mycologic cure ~53–55% [^112C3YoG] |
| Tavaborole | 5% solution | Inhibits leucyl-tRNA synthetase | Moderate-high efficacy; complete cure ~6–9% [^notfound], mycologic cure ~31–35% [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Antifungal nail lacquers have **demonstrated efficacy** in clinical trials, though cure rates vary by agent and disease severity:

- **Efinaconazole 10%**: Two phase III trials showed complete cure in 15.2–17.8% and mycologic cure in 53.4–55.2% at 52 weeks, significantly outperforming vehicle [^112C3YoG].
- **Tavaborole 5%**: Complete cure in 6.5–9.1% and mycologic cure in 31.1–35.9% at 48 weeks, also superior to vehicle [^notfound].
- **Ciclopirox 8%**: Lower efficacy, with complete cure ~5.5–8.5% and mycologic cure ~29–36% at 48 weeks [^116DXcSj].

These agents are most effective in **mild to moderate onychomycosis** without matrix involvement [^112YLKrj]; efficacy declines with greater nail involvement or matrix disease [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Antifungal nail lacquers are **generally well tolerated**, with minimal systemic absorption [^116oaAwg] and predominantly local adverse effects:

- **Common adverse effects**: Mild local irritation, erythema, burning, and application-site dermatitis [^1127Qx9o].
- **Systemic absorption**: Minimal (< 5% of applied dose), reducing risk of systemic adverse effects [^116oaAwg].
- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or formulation components.

---

## Patient populations and clinical considerations

Antifungal nail lacquers are **particularly suitable** for certain patient populations:

- **Elderly patients**: Favorable safety profile and minimal systemic absorption make them suitable for older adults [^notfound].
- **Patients with comorbidities**: Suitable for patients with liver disease, diabetes, or immunocompromised states where systemic therapy may pose risks [^117MY5gB].
- **Pediatric patients**: Efinaconazole and tavaborole are FDA-approved for children aged ≥ 6 years, offering safe alternatives to systemic therapy [^11481Mie].

---

## Combination therapies and adjunctive measures

Combination therapies and adjunctive measures can **enhance efficacy**:

- **Combination with oral therapy**: Combining topical lacquers with oral terbinafine or itraconazole improves cure rates, especially in severe or matrix-involved disease [^115zhYmo] [^116PFJ43].
- **Nail debridement**: Regular removal of infected nail material improves drug penetration and clinical outcomes [^114BpkbX] [^112YLKrj].
- **Patient education**: Emphasizing adherence, proper application techniques, and nail care is critical for success [^111t4LNS].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their benefits, antifungal nail lacquers have **limitations**:

- **Lower efficacy than oral therapy**: Oral terbinafine remains the gold standard with higher complete cure rates [^113UMTeu] [^112YLKrj].
- **Long treatment duration**: Typically 48–52 weeks, requiring sustained adherence [^112C3YoG].
- **Limited penetration**: Nail plate thickness and severity can limit drug delivery, reducing efficacy in advanced disease [^115uG4C3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend antifungal nail lacquers for **mild to moderate onychomycosis** without matrix involvement, with efinaconazole and tavaborole preferred due to superior efficacy [^112YLKrj]. Ciclopirox is recommended when systemic therapy is contraindicated or as an adjunct to combination therapy [^114q5VLm] [^1147QjSw].

---

Antifungal nail lacquers are **effective, safe, and convenient** for mild to moderate onychomycosis, especially when systemic therapy is unsuitable. Efinaconazole and tavaborole offer the best efficacy, while ciclopirox remains a useful option in selected patients. Combination strategies and adherence support are key to optimizing outcomes.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^1127Qx9o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

Main Results

We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty-five studies specifically examined dermatophyte-caused onychomycosis. Forty-three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high-risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate-quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low-quality evidence). Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high-quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high-quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate-quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low-quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low-quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low-quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly-reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Assessing complete cure, high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate-quality evidence supports P-3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low-quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low-quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. We are uncertain if 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P-3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low-quality evidence). High- to moderate-quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device-based treatments, which were under-represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. Future studies of topical and device-based therapies should be blinded, with patient-centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.

### Efficacy of debridement alone versus debridement combined with topical antifungal nail lacquer for the treatment of pedal onychomycosis: a randomized, controlled trial [^114BpkbX]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pedal onychomycosis is a common malady caused by dermatophytes, saprophytes, and yeasts. Traditional treatment options for this condition include toenail debridement, and pharmacological therapies that range from the application of topical agents to the oral administration of antifungal medications. In this study, 55 patients (289 toenails) were randomly allocated to either nail debridement (27 [49.09%] patients) or debridement plus application of topical antifungal nail lacquer (28 [50.91%] patients). The primary outcome was mycological cure, and secondary outcomes included foot-related quality of life, and a number of clinically important toenail characteristics. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range, 3.25–14.25) months), patients in the antifungal nail lacquer group improved statistically significantly more than did those in the debridement alone group, and displayed a 76.74% rate of mycological cure. None of the patients in the debridement-only group experienced mycological cure. Variables that statistically significantly decreased the likelihood of cure included yeast on culture, pedal hyperhidrosis, cigarette smoking, involvement of the lunula, and involvement of > 50% of the transverse width of the nail. Variables statistically significantly associated with an increased likelihood of cure included intervention before 6 months' duration, treatment at a large, urban practice, black race, and loss of protective sensation.

### A randomized trial of amorolfine 5% solution nail lacquer in association with itraconazole pulse therapy compared with itraconazole alone in the treatment of Candida fingernail onychomycosis [^1117CGs7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment failures and relapses are not uncommon in onychomycosis. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider the combination of systemic and topical antifungals to improve the cure rates further and to reduce the duration of systemic treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate and compare itraconazole pulse therapy combined with amorolfine with itraconazole alone in the treatment of Candida fingernail onychomycosis.

Methods

Ninety patients with moderate to severe Candida fingernail onychomycosis were randomized into two treatment groups of 45 subjects each. Group 1 received itraconazole pulse therapy for 2 months and applied amorolfine 5% solution nail lacquer for 6 months, while group 2 received monotherapy with three pulses of itraconazole. The primary efficacy criterion was the result of mycological examination at 3 months. The secondary criterion was the combined mycological and clinical response at 9 months. A pharmacoeconomic analysis was also performed to compare the cost-effectiveness of combined therapy vs. monotherapy.

Results

Eighty-five patients were analysed (73 women and 12 men, mean ± SD age 44.2 ± 12.9 years). Patients had a mean ± SD of 3.64 ± 2.0 nails involved and 228.6 ± 148.0 mm² of their nail surface diseased. The mean duration of onychomycosis was 11 months. Paronychial involvement was evident in 71 patients. C. albicans was isolated in 85 cases, C. parapsilosis in three and other Candida species in two cases. Side-effects were uncommon and in only one case led to withdrawal. At the 3-month visit, mycological cure was seen in 32 (74%) of 43 patients in group 1 and in 25 (60%) of 42 patients in group 2. At the 9-month visit, a global cure was seen in 40 patients (93%) in group 1 and in 34 patients (81%) in group 2. Statistical analysis showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.1) between the two treatment groups. The cost per cure ratio was 1.63 and 1.70euro for groups 1 and 2, respectively.

Conclusions

The combination of amorolfine and oral itraconazole, which interfere with different steps of ergosterol synthesis, exhibited substantial synergy. Compared with oral itraconazole alone, the combination achieved greater mycological cure and increased total cure rate. However, no statistically significant difference was documented for this number of observations. Combination treatment with amorolfine and two pulses of itraconazole is at least as safe and effective as three pulses of itraconazole, with a lower cost per patient. In our opinion, the addition of amorolfine to oral itraconazole pulse therapy is of value in the treatment of moderate to severe Candida fingernail onychomycosis.

### A multicentre, randomized, controlled study of the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of a combination therapy with amorolfine nail lacquer and oral terbinafine compared with oral terbinafine alone for the treatment of onychomycosis with matrix involvement [^115zhYmo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is common, accounting for up to 50% of all nail disorders. Toenail onychomycosis can cause nail deformity, embarrassment, pain and walking difficulties. Some populations, such as individuals with diabetes, are at higher risk for developing secondary complications such as infections. Treatment takes many months and therapeutic choices can increase clinical effectiveness, lower toxicity and minimize healthcare costs.

Objectives

Based on the results of a previous pilot study, the objective of the present study was to show, in a larger population, the enhanced efficacy of a combination of amorolfine nail lacquer and oral terbinafine in the treatment of onychomycosis with matrix involvement. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel group study, patients were randomized to receive either a combination of amorolfine hydrochloride 5% nail lacquer once weekly for 12 months plus terbinafine 250 mg once daily for 3 months (AT group) or terbinafine alone once daily for 3 months (T group). The study duration was 18 months including a 6-month treatment-free phase following the 12-month active treatment phase for the AT group and a 15-month treatment-free phase following the 3-month active treatment phase for the T group. The primary efficacy criterion was overall response, dichotomized into success or failure, success being the combination of clinical cure and negative mycology at month 18. This criterion was used as the effectiveness measure in the pharmacoeconomic analysis, conducted from a payer perspective.

Results

In total, 249 patients were included into the study: 120 in the AT group and 129 in the T group. A significantly higher success rate was observed for patients in the AT group relative to those in the T group at 18 months (59.2% vs. 45.0%; P = 0.03). Both treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated. Treatment cost per cured patient was lower for the combination than for terbinafine alone in all countries.

Conclusions

Study results confirmed that, in the treatment of dermatophytic toenail onychomycosis with matrix involvement, amorolfine nail lacquer in combination with oral terbinafine enhances clinical efficacy and is more cost-effective than terbinafine alone.

### Ciclopirox nail lacquer for the treatment of onychomycosis: an open non-comparative study [^111pd8ME]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a relatively common disease accounting for up to 50% of all nail disorders. Topical treatment, although less effective than systemic, is usually preferred by patients. Topical antifungal nail lacquers have been formulated to provide better delivery of the antifungal agent to the nail unit. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclopirox nail lacquer in the treatment of onychomycosis. Patients suffering from distal and lateral subungual toenail onychomycosis (DLSO) and lateral subungual onychomycosis (LSO) were treated by ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 9 months. Every week the nail lacquer was removed using acetone. Clinical nail status, KOH examination and mycological culture were recorded by the same investigator at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Thirty-six patients completed the 9-month regimen. Trichophyton rubrum was the most common pathogen. At the end of the study, good improvement to complete cure was observed in 13 patients (36%), 12 patients showed only mild to moderate improvement and 11 patients (31%) had no clinical improvement. No adverse effects were noted throughout the treatment period. Ciclopirox nail lacquer seems to be slightly more effective than other topical modalities and could be used in patients who cannot or do not want systemic treatment.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^115XnbG5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

### Update: medical treatment of onychomycosis [^113JgRFT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be made clinically and mycologically: clinically, by one of seven subtypes of onychomycosis, and mycologically, by evidence of dermatophytes or verified presence of molds and/or yeasts. Dermatophytes are usually considered as pathogens, whereas non-dermatophyte molds and yeasts are saprophytes. Basic anamnesis and close inspection should be performed to eliminate combined diseases (e.g., onychomycosis and trauma). The gold standard treatment for onychomycosis is basically systemic. Combination with topical agents, such as nail lacquer and/or chemical nail avulsion, produces better results than systemic treatment alone. Topical treatment as monotherapy is not efficient, excluding minor cases. Terbinafine is superior to itraconazole for dermatophyte onychomycosis. Evaluation of the outcome of clinical cure, mycological cure and total cure should be based on the well-defined worldwide criteria; otherwise, comparison of results is impossible due to lack of uniformity in different studies. In case of treatment failure, the reasons for each failure should be carefully considered.

### Efficacy and tolerability of amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in combination with systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^116PFJ43]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in combination with systemic antifungal agents in the treatment of the onychomycosis were evaluated. According to our meta-analysis, combination treatment of amorolfine 5% nail lacquer and systemic antifungals can result in higher percentage of complete clearance of onychomycosis. It showed that the experimental combination group was more effective than monotherapy of the systemic antifungals [OR (odds ratio) = 1.97, 95%CI (95% confidence interval) = 1.44–2.69], and no more adverse events happened with the addition of amorolfine 5% nail lacquer (OR = .96, 95%CI = .56–1.63, p = .95). This effect strengthens the fact that amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in combination with systemic antifungal agents was better than the monotherapy of systemic antifungals like itraconazole and terbinafine.

### The use of topical therapies to treat onychomycosis [^115AHcEn]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

The management of onychomycosis using topical agents has improved with the introduction of ciclopirox and amorolfine nail lacquers; other topical agents may be less effective. The combination of a nail lacquer with an oral antifungal agent may further improve efficacy rates in certain clinical presentations (eg, among those individuals with severe onychomycosis). Topical agents have a favorable adverse events profile. Further studies are required on the treatment of onychomycosis with nail lacquers.

### Treatment of onychomycosis in the diabetic patient population [^113Q1Jm2]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common medical condition in patients with diabetes. Conflicting data exist as to whether diabetes predisposes patients to the disease. Controversy notwithstanding, patients with diabetes have several medical conditions (obesity, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy) that can inhibit the identification or mask the progression of fungal nail infections. In addition, vascular insufficiency, impaired wound healing, and compromised immunologic status associated with diabetic foot increase the risk of secondary infections in diabetic patients with onychomycosis. Such factors contribute to an increased morbidity and decreased quality of life in these patients and underscore the need for effective antifungal treatment. Oral antifungal agents are generally well tolerated, but serious adverse events independent of or associated with a number of significant drug interactions have been reported. The availability of a topical therapy, ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (Penlac Nail Lacquer), provides clinicians with an additional effective and well-tolerated treatment option. In order to further increase the efficacy of topical or oral treatment, mechanical intervention (e.g., debridement) may be combined with either of these options. Choice of appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of fungal nail infections can prevent significant morbidity in patients with diabetes.

### The use of oral antifungal agents to treat onychomycosis [^112Si8a7]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis has been treated for years with oral antifungal agents, and more recently in the United States with a topical nail lacquer. Griseofulvin was the first significant oral agent available to manage onychomycosis. The introduction of the azoles (ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole) and the allylamine, terbinafine, led to improved cure rates and a broad spectrum of activity. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the newer oral agents penetrate the nail within approximately one to two weeks after the start of therapy and remain for several months after the end of treatment. This article reviews the oral antifungal agents used to treat onychomycosis.

### Onychomycosis does not always require systemic treatment for cure: a trial using topical therapy [^114Sn8RQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Standard teaching dictates that systemic therapy is required for treatment of onychomycosis. It is unknown whether topical antifungal therapy is effective for pediatric nail infections. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Unit at Rady Children's Hospital to determine whether topical antifungal therapy is efficacious for pediatric onychomycosis. Forty patients ages 2 to 16 years with nonmatrix onychomycosis were randomized 1:3 to ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle lacquer. Ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle was applied daily for 32 weeks, with weekly removal of the lacquer and mechanical trimming. Those with poor response were crossed over to active drug at week 12. Thirty-seven patients completed the 32-week study, and follow-up data were collected 1 year after completion of the study from 24 patients. Mycologic cure, effective treatment, and complete cure were assessed, as well as adverse events and effect on quality of life. Mycologic cure was 70% in the treated group and 20% in the vehicle arm (p = 0.03) at week 12. At end of the study (week 32), 77% of treated patients achieved mycologic cure and 71% effective treatment, compared with 22% of the control group. Ninety-two percent of those who were cured and followed for 1 year remained clear. Topical antifungal lacquer (ciclopirox) can be an effective option for children with nonmatrix onychomycosis. Pediatric onychomycosis does not always require systemic therapy and responds better to topical therapy than does adult disease.

### Efinaconazole 10% solution in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: two phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies [^112C3YoG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail infection, often resulting in nail plate damage and deformity. Topical lacquer treatments have negligible efficacy. Oral treatments, although more efficacious, are limited by drug interactions and potential hepatotoxicity.

Objective

We investigated the safety and efficacy of efinaconazole 10% solution (efinaconazole), the first triazole antifungal developed for distal lateral subungual onychomycosis.

Methods

Two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies were conducted in patients with toenail distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (20%-50% clinical involvement [study 1: N = 870, study 2: N = 785]). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole or vehicle, once daily for 48 weeks, with 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Debridement was not performed. The primary end point was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at week 52.

Results

Mycologic cure rates were significantly greater with efinaconazole (study 1: 55.2%, study 2: 53.4%) compared with vehicle (P < .001). The primary end point, complete cure, was also significantly greater for efinaconazole (study 1: 17.8% vs 3.3%, study 2: 15.2% vs 5.5%, P < .001). Treatment success (percent affected target toenail [0%- ≤ 10%]) for efinaconazole ranged from 21.3% to 44.8% in study 1 and from 17.9% to 40.2% in study 2, compared with 5.6% to 16.8% and 7.0% to 15.4%, respectively, with vehicle. Adverse events associated with efinaconazole were local site reactions (2%) and clinically similar to vehicle.

Limitations

A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis.

Conclusions

Once daily topical efinaconazole appears to be a viable alternative to oral treatment options for onychomycosis.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### How should fungal nail infection be treated? [^112NwjGH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Many people consulting dermatologists for nail problems have a fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). This may be asymptomatic and not merit prolonged treatment, particularly since relapse after such intervention is common. On the other hand, fungal nail infection is sometimes a treatable risk factor for more serious bacterial infections including cellulitis. Here we discuss the management of adults with fungal nail infection.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^111AwtXi]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials Data

The results of use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### Onychomycosis [^1122ymMh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a frequent nail disease caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte molds. Trichophyton rubrum, T mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum are the most common etiologic agents worldwide. Candida spp are the most frequent among the yeasts. Diagnosis is corroborated by direct microscopic examination, culture, and histomycology with periodic acid-Schiff stain. Other new methods of diagnosis are discussed. Treatment is based on oral antifungals: terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole, including other emerging triazole drugs. Therapeutic outcome with ciclopirox and amorolfine lacquers alone and combined with systemic therapy are also reviewed, as well as the new nail enhancers and physical and chemical removal of the diseased nails.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^1146vjAy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable. The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25–40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures. Clinical indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for use in patients at risk of failure/relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Ciclopirox topical solution, 8% combined with oral terbinafine to treat onychomycosis: a randomized, evaluator-blinded study [^113A8xmL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This randomized, evaluator-blind, 3-arm parallel, comparator controlled, multicenter pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox nail lacquer topical solution, 8% in combination with oral terbinafine for the treatment of moderate to severe toenail onychomycosis (≥ 60% disease involvement of target nail and/or lunula/matrix involvement) (N = 73). Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day, followed by 4 weeks of rest (no terbinafine), then another 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day (PLs); ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (PL12); or terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (L12). At week 48, mycological cure (negative microscopy and culture) occurred in 66.7% (14/21) (PL8), 70.4% (19/27) (PL12), and 56.0% (14/25) (L12) of patients confirmed dermatophyte positive, respectively (P: not significant). At this time point, effective cure (simultaneous mycological cure and ≥ 90% reduction in the disease area) was observed in 40.0% (8/20), 33.3% (8/24), and 34.8% (8/23) of patients, respectively (P: not significant). The PLs regimen was well-tolerated and had high compliance. The data suggest that combination therapy (PL8) may be an alternative regimen to continuous terbinafine (L12) in the treatment of moderate to severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.

### Onychomycosis in children: a brief overview with treatment strategies [^114iBM46]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis in children is uncommon. In those children that are affected, a family history of onychomycosis is not uncommon, giving importance to the examination of the entire family for fungal nail infections. In the United States, the newer oral antifungal agents itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine, and the topical nail lacquers ciclopirox and amorolfine are not approved for this indication. More data are needed on the use of these antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis in children.

Onychomycosis treatments include nail avulsion and debridement by chemical or surgical procedures, topical and oral antifungals, and device-based therapies. The advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different types of treatments — including the most commonly prescribed topical (ciclopirox) and oral (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole) treatments for onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts — are reviewed. Safety and efficacy data for the healthy adult population and for special populations such as children and diabetic patients have confirmed the importance of proper mycological diagnosis before the initiation of therapy as well as the evaluation of the risks and benefits of the different treatments.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^116DXcSj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Once onychomycosis occurs, it is generally a chronic disease requiring specialized and long‐term therapy to cure. Treatment includes oral therapy, topical therapy and surgical treatment (e.g. cutting of the nail plate, laser therapy and nail ablation), but topical therapy has an insufficient therapeutic effect due to the low concentration of the fungal agent and the low permeability of the nail plate. No topical drug has been approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in Japan for this reason. Although nail lacquers are available overseas, the complete cure rate ranges 5.5–8.5% for ciclopirox at 48 weeks and 0.96% for amorolfine at 52 weeks of treatment, indicating limited efficacies. 11, 12 Therefore, the development of a topical product with adequate efficacy as monotherapy is expected.

Under such circumstances, the first topical triazole antifungals solution exclusively formulated for onychomycosis, 10% efinaconazole, was approved in Japan in July 2014. Efinaconazole is an ingredient discovered in Japan that has low affinity to keratin, the main component of nails. This means that EFCZ has superior nail permeability and antifungal activity in the nail plate and nail bed. 13, 14 In a multinational phase III study conducted in subjects with mild to moderate onychomycosis having a 20–50% area of nail involvement, the complete cure rate was significantly greater than that in the vehicle group (study 1, 17.8% vs 3.3%; study 2, 15.2% vs 5.5%; P < 0.001). 4

### Onychomycosis in children: an overview [^117N7pFx]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis in children is relatively uncommon, with a prevalence of approximately 0.3% worldwide. The most common etiologic organism in Trichophyton rubrum. The oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole, and the topical nail lacquers ciclopirox and amorolfine, are not approved for use in treating onychomycosis in children. However, these agents appear to be effective and safe in this indication.

### Systematic review of nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis: diagnosis, clinical types, epidemiology, and treatment [^111gQyth]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Nondermatophyte mold (NDM) onychomycosis is difficult to diagnose given that NDMs are common contaminants of the nails and of the mycology laboratory. Diagnostic criteria and definition of cure are inconsistent between studies, which may affect the quality of published data. We identified 6 major criteria used in the literature: identification of the NDM in the nail by microscopy (using potassium hydroxide preparation), isolation in culture, repeated isolation in culture, inoculum counting, failure to isolate a dermatophyte in culture, and histology. Most studies used 3 or more of these (range = 1–5). We recommend using at least 3 of the criteria to rule out contamination; these should include potassium hydroxide preparation for direct microscopy and isolation of the organism in culture. We review geographic distribution and clinical presentations associated with different NDMs. The treatment with the greatest quantity of data and highest reported cure rates is terbinafine, for the treatment of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Aspergillus species infections. Topicals such as ciclopirox nail lacquer may also be effective (data originating from Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Acremonium species infections), especially when combined with chemical or surgical avulsion of the nail. We recommend that future studies use (and clearly indicate) at least 3 of the main criteria for diagnosis, and report the clinical type of onychomycosis and the isolated organism. When evaluating different treatments, we suggest that authors clearly define their efficacy outcomes.

### Onychomycosis: current trends in diagnosis and treatment [^117XxeYW]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails that causes discoloration, thickening, and separation from the nail bed. Onychomycosis occurs in 10% of the general population, 20% of persons older than 60 years, and 50% of those older than 70 years. It is caused by a variety of organisms, but most cases are caused by dermatophytes. Accurate diagnosis involves physical and microscopic examination and culture. Histologic evaluation using periodic acid-Schiff staining increases sensitivity for detecting infection. Treatment is aimed at eradication of the causative organism and return to a normal appearance of the nail. Systemic antifungals are the most effective treatment, with meta-analyses showing mycotic cure rates of 76% for terbinafine, 63% for itraconazole with pulse dosing, 59% for itraconazole with continuous dosing, and 48% for fluconazole. Concomitant nail debridement further increases cure rates. Topical therapy with ciclopirox is less effective; it has a failure rate exceeding 60%. Several nonprescription treatments have also been evaluated. Laser and photodynamic therapies show promise based on in-vitro evaluation, but more clinical studies are needed. Despite treatment, the recurrence rate of onychomycosis is 10% to 50% as a result of reinfection or lack of mycotic cure.

### Treatment of nondermatophyte mold and Candida onychomycosis [^111uS3Bu]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Mold onychomycosis often can be clinically suspected because of the presence of periungual inflammation. Treatment with systemic antifungals is very effective in onychomycosis caused by Aspergillus sp. Scopulariopsis brevicaulis and Fusarium sp. infection are difficult to eradicate and treatment with systemic antifungals should always be associated with topical treatment with nail lacquers. Candida onychomycosis is always a sign of immunodepression. Systemic treatment with itraconazole or fluconazole is usually effective, but relapses are very common.

### Dermatophyte infections [^111wddq7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are fungi that require keratin for growth. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytes are spread by direct contact from other people (anthropophilic organisms), animals (zoophilic organisms), and soil (geophilic organisms), as well as indirectly from fomites. Dermatophyte infections can be readily diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Diagnosis occasionally requires Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture or histologic examination. Topical therapy is used for most dermatophyte infections. Cure rates are higher and treatment courses are shorter with topical fungicidal allylamines than with fungistatic azoles. Oral therapy is preferred for tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and onychomycosis. Orally administered griseofulvin remains the standard treatment for tinea capitis. Topical treatment of onychomycosis with ciclopirox nail lacquer has a low cure rate. For onychomycosis, "pulse" oral therapy with the newer imidazoles (itraconazole or fluconazole) or allylamines (terbinafine) is considerably less expensive than continuous treatment but has a somewhat lower mycologic cure rate. The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be confirmed by KOH microscopy, culture, or histologic examination before therapy is initiated, because of the expense, duration, and potential adverse effects of treatment.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Improved efficacy in onychomycosis therapy [^113MfTo1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The success rate of onychomycosis treatment is limited by several factors, including the access of the therapeutic agent to the fungal mass, the presence of conidia, and the susceptibility of the different infectious agents to the antifungals. Different strategies used to improve efficacy of the currently available antifungal treatments, their rationale, and the published evidence of their beneficial effects are reviewed. An improved efficacy was demonstrated for some of these strategies, such as combined oral and topical antifungal therapies, whereas most of them lack clear and direct evidence of an increase in therapeutic success.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: a consensus [^113z5Tm2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

Methods

This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

Results

The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

Conclusions

The current treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):253–262. </em>.

### Labeled use of efinaconazole topical solution 10% in treating onychomycosis in children and a review of the management of pediatric onychomycosis [^11481Mie]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a difficult to treat condition whose prevalence is increasing. Until recently, there was no FDA approved antifungal agent for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. Although systemic antifungal agents are effective, their use is restricted by the potential adverse events and drug-drug interactions. There is evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of topical antifungal agents for pediatric onychomycosis. We have summarized the results of a recently published study using efinaconazole topical solution 10% to treat onychomycosis in children and discuss management of pediatric onychomycosis. In a multicenter, open-label phase 4 study, efinaconazole 10% solution was applied topically once daily in children aged 6 to 16years with mild to severe, culture positive, distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis. Treatment was for 48weeks with a follow-up at week 52. Pharmacokinetics was performed in a subset of patients. There were 62 patients enrolled in the study. At week 52, the efficacy was mycological cure rate 65% and complete cure rate 40%. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were mild to moderate in severity with none resulting in study discontinuation. The only treatment-related TEAE was ingrown toenail. Efinaconazole was detected at low levels in plasma. Efinaconazole topical solution 10% is effective and safe in treating onychomycosis in children age 6 to 16years and was recently FDA-approved for this indication. The on-label use of other topical agents, tavaborole solution 5% and ciclopirox nail lacquer solution 8% is reviewed. We also briefly discuss the use of oral agents, terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole in pediatric onychomycosis.

### Systematic review of the prevalence of onychomycosis in children [^112B36bU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fungal infection of the nails accounts for 15%–40% of all nail disease and is one of the most common nail diseases in adults. The prevalence of onychomycosis increases with age and is reported to be infrequent in children. It has nevertheless been suggested that the incidence of onychomycosis in children may have increased over the last three decades. However, most studies are retrospective and based on information from medical records or laboratory data.

Pediatric onychomycosis is important to diagnose and treat for several reasons. Early detection and treatment of onychomycosis is crucial to prevent disease progression. In addition, early treatment of onychomycosis can result in higher cure rates. Mild onychomycosis can be treated topically with good clearance in children. Few antifungal therapies are licensed to onychomycosis treatment in children. Topical therapy is used as monotherapy for milder cases and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from the age of ≥ 12 years (ciclopirox), and ≥ 6 years (efinaconazole, tavaborole). Treatment with topical therapy is reported to be more effective in children than in adults, with low risk of side effects and low systemic exposure. Systemic treatment is added when the disease is more severe but has a larger risk of drug interaction and adverse events. No systemic antifungal therapy is licensed for treatment of onychomycosis in children.

The aim of this systematic review is to explore the worldwide prevalence of onychomycosis in children.

### Long-term follow-up of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes after successful treatment with systemic antifungal agents [^113WfwEo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrences (relapse or reinfection) of onychomycosis are not uncommon, with percentages reported in various studies ranging from 10% to 53%.

Objective

We sought to determine the prevalence of long-term recurrences of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes cured after systemic antifungal treatment with terbinafine (T) or itraconazole (I) and identify risk factors for recurrences.

Methods

This 7-year prospective study, started in 2000 and ended in 2007, included 73 patients periodically followed after successful treatment of toenail onychomycosis using either T, 250 mg daily (59 patients), or I, 400 mg daily, for 1 week per month (14 patients). Patients were evaluated every 6 months, with clinical and mycological evaluations being performed.

Results

Twelve of 73 patients (16.4%) developed a recurrence of onychomycosis a mean time of 36 months after successful treatment. These included 5 of the 14 patients (35.7%) who had taken I and 7 of the 59 (11.9%) who had taken T (P = 0.046).

Limitations

The number of patients treated with T (59 patients) was more than that for I (14 patients).

Conclusion

The administration of systemic T to treat the first episode of onychomycosis may provide better long-term success than I in those patients with a complete response. Other factors including the presence of predisposing factors, use of nail lacquer as a prophylactic treatment, and the dermatophyte strain isolated were not significantly related to relapse.

### Amorolfine and itraconazole combination for severe toenail onychomycosis; results of an open randomized trial in Spain [^1175iRo1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

In an open, randomized, clinical study of toenail onychomycosis with matrix area involvement, two alternative regimens of topical amorolfine/oral itraconazole therapy were compared with itraconazole monotherapy.

Patients/Methods

A total of 131 patients were randomized to treatment. Patients in the combination groups were treated with amorolfine 5% nail lacquer (Loceryl, Galderma Laboratories) once weekly for 24 weeks and 200 mg itraconazole once daily for 6 weeks (Group AI-6) or 12 weeks (Group AI-12). A control group received itraconazole monotherapy for 12 weeks (Group 1–12). Strict inclusion criteria specified that subjects had to have onychomycosis of the toenails with matrix area involvement and/or > 80% total nail surface involvement. Mycological evaluations using both microscopic examination and culture of nail samples were performed at weeks 12 and 24. A stringent assessment of outcome at study end combined the results of mycological and clinical outcomes into a global cure rate. Safety was also assessed.

Results

At week 12, mycological cure was attained in 42 of 45 patients (93.3%) in group AI-6, 29 of 35 patients (82.9%) in group AI-12, and 14 of 34 patients in group 1–12. The difference between both combination groups and the control group were significant (P < 0.001). The global cure rate at week 24 was 83.7% (36 patients) in group AI-6, 93.9% (31 patients) in group AI-12, and 68.8% (22 patients) in group I-12. The difference between the AI-12 group and itraconazole monotherapy was significant (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

These results indicate that amorolfine combination therapy represents an improved treatment strategy for patients with severe onychomycosis.

### Treating onychomycosis [^111mjgYN]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis accounts for one third of fungal skin infections. Because only about one half of nail dystrophies are caused by fungus, the diagnosis should be confirmed by potassium hydroxide preparation, culture or histology before treatment is started. Newer, more effective antifungal agents have made treating onychomycosis easier. Terbinafine and itraconazole are the therapeutic agents of choice. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not labeled fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis, early efficacy data are promising. Continuous oral terbinafine therapy is most effective against dermatophytes, which are responsible for the majority of onychomycosis cases. Intermittent pulse dosing with itraconazole is as safe and effective as short-term continuous therapy but more economical and convenient. With careful monitoring, patients treated with the newer antifungal agents have a good chance of achieving relief from onychomycosis and its complications.

### Antifungal therapy for onychomycosis in children [^111W1gFR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic infection of the nail unit, and its prevalence increases with age. Treatment options for children are similar to those for adults and include both oral and topical therapies. Oral agents, such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole have been reported to have good efficacy and a low rate of side effects in children. Topical therapies, such as amorolfine and ciclopirox, can also be used as monotherapy or combined with oral agents to treat onychomycosis. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults. There is currently insufficient data comparing emerging medical devices, such as laser therapy, with standard therapeutic options to recommend their use in children.

### Topical amorolfine for 15 months combined with 12 weeks of oral terbinafine, a cost-effective treatment for onychomycosis [^113BNeHc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This open randomized study examined the efficacy of a combination of oral terbinafine and topical amorolfine in the treatment of severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis with matrix area involvement.

Patients/Methods

A total of 147 patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 15 months of once-weekly topical amorolfine lacquer in combination with 6 weeks (Group AT6) or 12 weeks (Group AT12) of oral terbinafine, 250 mg once daily: or terbinafine monotherapy for 12 weeks (Group T12). Patients were followed for a total of 18 months. The primary efficacy variable was the result of mycological examination after 3 months of therapy; secondary efficacy variables were mycological and clinical examination at 3-monthly intervals, with an additional clinical evaluation at 18 months. Safety and tolerance were also assessed.

Results

Negative mycological results, assessed at 3 months, were recorded for 14 of 40 patients (35%) in Group AT6, 11 of 44 (27.5%) in Group AT12 and 7 of 41 (17.1%) in Group T12. At 18 months, the global response (mycological and clinical cure) was seen in 22 of 50 patients (44%), 34 of 47 (72.3% and 18 of 48 (37.5%) in the AT6, AT12 and T12 groups, respectively.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a combination therapy regime with oral and systemic treatment is superior in efficacy to monotherapy with a systemic drug alone in the treatment of severe onychomycosis. In addition, the cost per cure ratio was better in the combination groups.

Information for Patients

Patients should have detailed instructions regarding the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.

The patient should be told to:

Use Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), as directed by a health care professional. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Contact with skin other than skin immediately surrounding the treated nail(s) should be avoided. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is for external use only.
Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis). Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild, transient irritation (redness).
Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication. Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in your toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program.
Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, oozing).
Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), and professional removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail (defined as 10% or less residual nail involvement).
Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached, infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed.
A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication. In clinical studies less than 12% of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail.
Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.
Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails.
Avoid use near heat or open flame, because product is flammable.

### Drug synergies and the potential for combination therapy in onychomycosis [^115R2qjp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Synergy between antifungal drugs is well recognized. However, combinations of antifungals are yet to be widely adopted to treat onychomycosis. The rationale for the combination of topical and oral therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis is that the systemic antifungal reaches the infection area via the nail bed and the topical agent is absorbed through the nail surface. The combination of antifungals used should ideally be synergistic in their mode of action. Synergy between amorolfine and other antifungals has been demonstrated in vitro. This is presumably due to differences in the precise point of action of the drugs on the fungal cell membrane, where they inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol. Thus, combinations can result in increased antifungal activity at lower concentrations of both drugs. The potential exists therefore for combinations of antifungals to achieve higher cure rates in onychomycosis, in a shorter time than is currently possible. This approach warrants further investigation.

### Hydrosoluble medicated nail lacquers: in vitro drug permeation and corresponding antimycotic activity [^116xTkxp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Two nail lacquers, containing ciclopirox (CPX) or amorolfine (MRF), based on water-insoluble polymers are currently considered mainstays of topical treatment of onychomycosis. The present study aimed at evaluating the antimycotic activity of a new water-soluble nail lacquer containing CPX (CPX/sol), easily removable by washing with water and applicable to periungual skin.

Objectives

To compare transungual permeation of CPX with that of MRF in the same hydroxypropyl chitosan-based nail lacquer (MRF/sol) and with a nonwater-soluble reference (Loceryl); Galderma International, La Défense, France), and to evaluate the antimycotic activity of CPX/sol and Loceryl against the most common fungal strains that cause onychomycosis. Methods In vitro drug permeation experiments with CPX/sol, MRF/sol and Loceryl were carried out through bovine hoof slices. Experimental permeates from CPX/sol and Loceryl underwent in vitro susceptibility testing against clinical isolates of dermatophytes, moulds and yeast. Results MRF transungual flux from MRF/sol lacquer was significantly higher when compared with Loceryl. CPX was able to permeate hoof membranes more easily compared with MRF. CPX and MRF concentrations in the subungual fluids collected after application of CPX/sol or Loceryl were sufficient to inhibit fungal growth, with the exception of Candida parapsilosis. Smaller amounts of fluid containing CPX were required for complete inhibition of fungal growth. Efficacy index values were significantly higher for CPX/sol. Conclusions Application of the CPX/sol nail lacquer allows rapid nail penetration of CPX, providing CPX levels sufficient to inhibit fungal growth for a prolonged period of time (30 h) after application of lacquer dose. CPX/sol nail lacquer appeared superior to the market reference Loceryl in terms of both vehicle (hydroxypropyl chitosan) and active ingredient (CPX) as witnessed by its higher efficacy on all nail pathogens.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^112rKjrb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

Method

A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was done with adult subjects that met the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. Primary efficacy endpoint was clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

Results

Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1) were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

Limitations

This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

Conclusion

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis drug treatments.

### Topical and device-based treatment of toenail onychomycosis… [^1145rgCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are topical and device-based therapies safe and effective in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Evidence-Based Answer Topical antifungal drugs, including efinaconazole 10% solution, tavaborole 5% solution, and ciclopirox 8% lacquer and hydrolacquer, are beneficial in treating mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis. 1, 2 Potential adverse effects are mild and include dermatitis and vesicles.

1. Moderate-quality evidence demonstrated that efinaconazole 10% solution produced mycologic cure. Finally, ciclopirox 8% lacquer was superior to placebo at achieving mycologic cure and complete cure.

When compared with ciclopirox 8% lacquer and amorolfine 5% lacquer, ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer was more effective at achieving complete cure. However, there was no difference between these treatments in mycologic cure or risk of adverse effects, including erythema, rash, and burning. 1 Adverse effects such as dermatitis and vesicles were associated with use of efinaconazole, and adverse effects at the application site occurred in studies of tavaborole. Use of ciclopirox 8% lacquer did not seem to increase the risk of rash or nail alteration.

- Medications may be creams/ointments or pills.
- Do not use steroid creams or ointments to treat ringworm or a rash that may be ringworm.
- Use antifungal medications exactly as directed for as long as directed. Overview Treatment for ringworm depends on symptom severity and the part of the body infected. Antifungal medications for ringworm come in the form of creams, ointments, lotions, powders, and pills. Some forms of ringworm can be treated with non-prescription antifungal medications. Ringworm infections may need to be treated with prescription antifungal medications. Treatment types Ringworm on the skin Ringworm on the skin like athlete's foot and jock itch are usually treated with non-prescription antifungal medications.

Antifungal creams, ointments, lotions, or powders are usually applied to the skin for 2 to 4 weeks. Follow product instructions and apply the antifungal for as long as directed even if symptoms start to improve. There are many non-prescription products available to treat ringworm, including:

- Clotrimazole
- MiconazoleA
- Terbinafine
- Ketoconazole. Ringworm on the scalp Ringworm on the scalp usually needs to be treated with prescription antifungal medication taken by mouth for 1 to 3 months.

Blood investigations such as complete blood count, liver function test, renal function test, random blood sugar and routine urinalysis were within normal limits. The child was treated with fluconazole syrup 6 mg/kg/week and 5% amorolfine nail lacquer once/week. After three months of therapy, the patient completely recovered with the development of a healthy nail plate.

### Fungal toenail infections [^116kvvbB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 5% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mechanical debridement, terbinafine, and tioconazole.

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: an evidence-based review [^115uG4C3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients, because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

Objective

This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale. These were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates. Treatments were generally applied daily for 24–48 weeks, with longer treatment and follow-up showing better outcomes.

Conclusion

Topical treatment with amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, or efinaconazole is appropriate for cases of mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte or mixed dermatophyte/Candida infection.

### Ciclopirox vs amorolfine: in vitro penetration into and permeation through human healthy nails of commercial nail lacquers [^1112Xv18]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

One of the pre-requisite for a successful topical antifungal drug indicated for onychomycosis is its bioavailability into the nail unit for achieving fungal eradication and clinical benefit. The aim of this study was to compare in vitro permeation/penetration through and into human nails of amorolfine (MRF) from a 5% anhydrous commercial formulation (Loceryl®) and ciclopirox (CPX) from the 8% aqueous formulation in hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH) technology (Onytec®). The ability of the active ingredient to reach efficacious concentrations to inhibit nail pathogens was also evaluated. The amounts of drug permeated and retained in human healthy nails were determined using a suitably modified diffusion apparatus. HPLC analysis of the samples was performed. The HPCH-based CPX formulation demonstrated an efficient penetration into and permeation through the nail plates. Conversely, Loceryl® produced an amount of MRF permeated through and penetrated into the human toenails significantly lower than CPX. The evaluation of the efficacy index showed a higher potential efficacy of Onytec® with respect to Loceryl® on nail pathogens. The present work not only reinforced the previous results on different experimental substrates, but pointed out the superiority of HPCH-based Onytec® formulation containing CPX with respect to Loceryl® commercial product with MRF, both in terms of higher permeation through and penetration into the human nail, and for the efficacy towards the most common ungual pathogens.

### Antifungal activity, experimental infections and nail permeation of an innovative ciclopirox nail lacquer based on a water-soluble biopolymer [^116C2qoX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

P-3051 is an innovative 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, based on hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH) as a film-forming agent. The authors' aim was to investigate P-3051's in vitro antifungal activity, as well as its in vitro and in vivo nail permeation. The dilution susceptibility tests performed for Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) and Candida parapsilosis (C. parapsilosis) showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of P-3051, as percent of ciclopirox, was for both fungi ≤ 0.0015% (equivalent to a concentration of 15.6 mg/ ml). In the biological assay of in vitro nail permeation and fungal inhibition, the authors observed that P-3051 permeated well through bovine hoof membranes and produced dose-dependent inhibitory effects on dermatophyte, yeast and mold strains. Moreover, the inhibition effects were higher than those obtained by equal amounts of the ciclopirox reference nail lacquer. P-3051 and the reference showed the same protective activity in experimental infections with strains of dermatophytes isolated from clinical samples. The amount of ciclopirox remained in cut fingernails washed six hours after in vivo application of P-3051 ranged between 18 and 35% of the applied dose. After in vitro application to cut human nails, 40–50% of the applied ciclopirox penetrated during the first six hours, independent of nails being infected or uninfected, intact or filed. In both experiments, the concentration of ciclopirox is largely higher (three to four orders of magnitude) than the MICs for nail pathogens.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^117BJe2v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The study clarifies the new efficacy of EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis and warrants higher safety. These properties may possibly expand the potentiality of EFCZ as a good treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds.

On the other hand, a certain number of patients are resistant to treatment with EFCZ; thus, combination therapy with oral drugs or other surgical treatments would be considered. In fact, reports have described improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement, 20, 21, 22 and that EFCZ in combination with laser therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy. 23 Further studies on such cases will be expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may be currently at a turning point in the world. From the results of this study, we predict EFCZ to become a practical option for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^111t4LNS]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be used as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis. Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional, weekly trimming by the patient, and daily application of the medication are all integral parts of this therapy. Careful consideration of the appropriate nail management program should be given to patients with diabetes (see PRECAUTIONS).

Nail Care By Health Care Professionals

Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, trimming of onycholytic nail, and filing of excess horny material should be performed by professionals trained in treatment of nail disorders.

Nail Care By Patient

Patients should file away (with emery board) loose nail material and trim nails, as required, or as directed by the health care professional, every seven days after Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), is removed with alcohol.

Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied once daily (preferably at bedtime or eight hours before washing) to all affected nails with the applicator brush provided. The Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate.

If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis).

The Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), should not be removed on a daily basis. Daily applications should be made over the previous coat and removed with alcohol every seven days. This cycle should be repeated throughout the duration of therapy.

### Access of efinaconazole topical solution, 10%, to the infection site by spreading through the subungual space [^11232MpL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the ability of efinaconazole vehicle to reach the site of toenail onychomycosis by spreading through the subungual space between the nail plate and nail bed. Lacquer-based vehicles are primarily limited to application on the nail plate and dependent on nail plate permeation.

Methods

11 patients (mean age 48.5 years) were entered with clinically determined onychomycosis. Presence of fungal infection was confirmed by KOH testing in eight patients. Two separate applications of vehicle (with fluorescein incorporated for better visualization) were applied at the hyponychium, avoiding application to the exterior nail plate surface. Affected nails were later clipped to allow examination of the nail bed and further examination of the underside of the nail. Spread of formulation was assessed under visible and UV light conditions by photographing target toenails after vehicle application, and after nail clipping.

Results

Assessments under both visible and UV light indicated that the vehicle had spread into the subungual space, with deposition of flourescein wherever vehicle had reached, including in the nail bed. Nail clippings also indicated deposition to the underside of the nail plate.

Limitations

The relative contributions of spreading into the subungual space, or permeation through the nail plate to the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in treating onychomycosis were not assessed.

Conclusions

This study suggests that the vehicle developed for efinaconazole topical solution, 10%, when applied at the hyponychium, spreads into the subungual space between the nail plate and nail bed, reaching the site of infection.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^112CJ9jv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review [^112YLKrj]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed leading to brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. Untreated onychomycosis can cause pain, discomfort, and physical impairment, negatively impacting quality of life. Onychomycosis should be suspected in patients with discolored nails, nail plate thickening, nail separation, and foul-smelling nails. Accurate diagnosis is important before initiating treatment because therapy is lengthy and can cause adverse effects. A potassium hydroxide preparation with confirmatory fungal culture, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic approach if confirmative testing is cost prohibitive or not available. Treatment decisions should be based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Oral terbinafine is preferred over topical therapy because of better effectiveness and shorter treatment duration. Patients taking terbinafine in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, or tamoxifen should be monitored for drug-drug interactions. Topical therapy, including ciclopirox 8%, efinaconazole 10%, and tavaborole 5%, is less effective than oral agents but can be used to treat mild to moderate onychomycosis, with fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Nail trimming and debridement used concurrently with pharmacologic therapy improve treatment response. Although photodynamic and plasma therapies are newer treatment options that have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed. Preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot in public places and disinfecting shoes and socks are thought to reduce the 25% relapse rate.

### Pulse versus continuous terbinafine for onychomycosis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^111DaRFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails.

Results

Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; P = 0.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; P = 0.007, RR = 1.52 [95% CI, 1.11–2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; P = 0.02, RR = 1.45 [95% CI, 1.04–2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; P = 0.03, RR = 1.71 [95% CI, 1.05–2.79). Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups (chi2 = 1.63; P = 0.65).

Limitations

The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine. We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed, particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to offer terbinafine (250 mg/day for 6 weeks in fingernail and 12–16 weeks in toenail infection) as first-line therapy in patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Obtain baseline LFTs and a CBC in adult patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

### Enhancing transungual delivery and spreading of efinaconazole under the nail plate through a unique formulation approach [^112atKqE]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a very common nail disorder seen in dermatological practice. It is difficult to treat successfully for a multitude of reasons, and although topical antifungal therapy might be considered ideal for mild to moderate onychomycosis, efficacy has been limited by poor nail penetration of active ingredient through the nail plate into the nail bed and nail matrix to the site of infection. The intrinsic properties of an antifungal and its vehicle formulation are both considered important contributors to effective treatment. Here we review the formulation approach to efinaconazole topical solution, 10% an effective and well-tolerated treatment for onychomycosis. We demonstrate that the low surface tension formulation affords better penetration of efinaconazole through the nail plate, and also to the site of infection by spreading into the space between the nail and nail bed.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^117MY5gB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### A second look at efficacy criteria for onychomycosis: clinical and mycological cure [^111vC2mj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approval of topical onychomycosis drugs by regulatory agencies may be negatively impacted by an overly stringent definition of complete cure, which includes nail clearing plus mycological cure.

Objectives

In this position paper, we discuss interpretation of mycological outcome and clinical trial length.

Methods

We reviewed data from seven international onychomycosis trials that enrolled subjects with positive KOH and dermatophyte-positive culture at screening followed by 48 weeks of treatment. Further, we examined 94 KOH-positive/culture-negative week 52 follow-up samples for morphological hyphal damage.

Results

From 3054 samples collected at week 52 follow-up visits, 2360 were culture-negative. However, a significant percentage (78.7%) of these subungual samples (n = 1857) remained KOH-positive. From the subset of follow-up samples examined for morphological changes, we identified hyphal breakage or distortion in 56 direct smears (60%), which may indicate nonviability.

Conclusions

Reassessment of the definition of onychomycosis cure is critical. For clinical trials of topical agents, length of treatment should be re-examined. Further, in our experience, a high rate of subungual debris samples remained direct smear-positive while converting to negative culture. Evidence of morphological hyphal damage suggests that late-visit microscopic results may be false-positives. Therefore, the absence of clinical signs following an adequate washout period, coupled with a negative culture, with or without negative microscopy, should be considered the definition of onychomycosis cure.

Onychomycosis is a prevalent condition affecting the United States and global population. Treatment options are limited, with only 3 topical anti-fungal medications garnering approval in the US within the last 25 years: ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole. The economic impact and quality of life burden due to onychomycosis are high. Here we provide an up-to-date review of all approved topical anti-fungal therapies for toenail onychomycosis. We discuss treatment efficacies, pharmacology, and use in special populations, as well as current evidence for complementary and alternative medicine.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22:9(Suppl 1):s5-10.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^115RVFiD]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

However, in clinical practise, EFCZ may be used in cases exceeding the study criteria, namely more severe cases with more than 50% clinical involvement or with long‐term use for over 1 year. 6 Therefore, it is meaningful to obtain information on the efficacy and safety of EFCZ when used in severe cases or applied for over 48 weeks to provide findings for clinical medicine.

Our study was conducted to examine the efficacy of EFCZ by daily application for up to 72 weeks in patients with onychomycosis with 20% or more clinical involvement of the nails, including severe cases. As for the impact of EFCZ on patient QOL, only one report so far has used OnyCOE‐tTM, 7 which is a QOL questionnaire regarding onychomycosis. So far, no similar study has been conducted in the Japanese population, and thus we decided to include this as one of the aims of our study.

### Opportunities to improve guideline adherence for the diagnosis and treatment of onychomycosis: analysis of commercial insurance claims data, United States [^1128ihJj]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

We found a lower onychomycosis prevalence (1.6%) than previous European and North American studies (2% to 14%), potentially reflecting underreporting, lack of clinical nail examination and testing, or differences in study design. Compared with other oral antifungals, terbinafine was more commonly prescribed, likely because it is of low cost and generally covered by health insurance without a requirement for laboratory testing. Compared with an urban academic medical center, patients in our study less frequently received confirmatory diagnostic testing (15.3% vs 39.3%), possibly because fewer providers in our study were dermatologists (13.1% vs 62.1%) and practices at an academic institution likely differ from other settings.

Despite the limitations inherent to administrative data, including potential disease misclassification and undercoding, our study provides an update regarding US onychomycosis epidemiology and a concerning assessment of adherence to AAD guidelines for onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment. Confirming the diagnosis of onychomycosis with laboratory testing is important for ensuring appropriate therapy and avoiding unnecessary antifungal exposure. In the era of antifungal-resistant dermatophytosis, a renewed, cross-specialty emphasis on guideline-based onychomycosis treatment is needed, emphasizing antifungal stewardship to preserve available treatment options.

### Pediatric onychomycosis: the emerging role of topical therapy [^115r22BB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Fungal infection of the nails is an increasingly recognized disease in infants and children. However, it can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other nail dystrophies. In addition, many mistakenly believe that onychomycosis does not occur in childhood. Under-recognition of this infectious disorder therefore occurs. Although many consider "nail fungus" a trivial cosmetic concern, it can lead to discomfort, risk of secondary infection, and a more significant health threat in immunocompromised or diabetic individuals. It should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of nail plate disorders in children as it is one of the more common causes. Here we review the latest data on prevalence of the disease, reasons for its relatively low incidence compared with adults, and important predisposing factors. It is important to confirm the clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis in children, and affected individuals should be examined for concomitant tinea pedis. As familial disease often occurs, it is important to check parents and siblings as well for onychomycosis and tinea pedis. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, and recurrence appears to be more common in children than in adults. Prolonged systemic antifungal therapy is commonly required. However, pediatric practitioners and parents alike hesitate when asked to treat young children with a systemic drug that requires laboratory monitoring and can have systemic toxicities. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are theoretically more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults, and therefore good candidates for topical antifungal therapy. The clinical data on the use of topical antifungals in pediatric onychomycosis is scarce. We review data that exist from case reports and small clinical trials. New topical antifungals are now available that afford better nail penetration and additional delivery routes to the site of infection. Pediatric trials are now on-going, and should clarify the usefulness of these agents in children.

### Combination of surgical avulsion and topical therapy for single nail onychomycosis: a randomized controlled trial [^112jTDPo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional therapy of onychomycosis is prolonged and often frustrating, which is why combination therapy involving topical, oral and surgical measures has been advocated as the treatment of choice. There are no controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of nail avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of combined surgical and topical therapy for onychomycosis.

Methods

Forty patients with single nail onychomycosis [28 with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, seven with total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO) and five with proximal subungual onychomycosis] were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. Each group received avulsion of the involved nail, followed by ketoconazole 2% cream without (group I) or with occlusion (group II), or oxiconazole 1% cream without (group III) or with occlusion (group IV). Topical therapies were applied twice daily. The patients were reviewed monthly and treatment was continued until the regrowth of completely normal nail (mycologically negative). In cured cases, further monthly review was carried out for at least 6 months, without any form of therapy. At each visit direct microscopic examination was repeated.

Results

There was a high dropout rate, with seven patients (group I), six patients (group II), six patients (group III) and eight patients (group IV) completing the treatment protocol. Out of these, mycological cure was achieved in three (43%) patients in group I, four (67%) in group II, two (33%) in group III and six (75%) in group IV. All the cases of TDO failed to respond to this therapy. Overall, 15 of 27 (56%) patients were cured with this approach. On further follow up, recurrence of onychomycosis was recorded in two patients in group I. No side-effects or long-term complications of the nail avulsion were encountered. Important limitations encountered in the present study included a small sample size, a high dropout rate (32%) and poor patient compliance.

Conclusions

Contrary to earlier reports, surgical nail avulsion with topical antifungal agents was not found to be a very encouraging modality for the treatment of onychomycosis. Both oxiconazole and ketoconazole delivered comparable results. Occlusion improved the treatment outcome, although the difference was not statistically significant. As a subtype, TDO showed poorest response. Surgical nail avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy cannot be generally recommended for the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^112reb1J]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In our study, the treatment success rate in terms of the primary end‐point (≤ 10% clinical involvement) was 56.6% in the eligible patients after applying EFCZ for up to 72 weeks. In the multinational phase III study for EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis who had 20–50% area of nail involvement, the treatment success rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with less than 10% area of nail involvement. Treatment success rate was 31.0%, and in the subgroup analysis in the Japanese population, this rate was 46.7% (48 weeks of application and assessed at week 52). 4, 5 Considering that the definitions of treatment success are slightly different in a precise sense and that our study included not only patients with DLSO but also those with SWO, an equable comparison is not possible. However, when comparing only with the population with an affected area of 20–50%, a similar trend of 57.6% (at week 48) was obtained in our study.

Methods

Study design

The study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2018 as a multicenter, open‐label, single‐arm study in 36 facilities nationwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients with severe (> 50% clinical involvement) onychomycosis and the efficacy of long‐term use of EFCZ for more than 1 year. We also obtained information on patient QOL with EFCZ therapy. The study was conducted in accordance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects, with the approval of the appropriate ethics committee. Upon participating in the research, all the patients were given a written explanation of the study before they provided written informed consent.

Subjects

The subjects included in the study were male or female patients aged 20 years or older (at the time of informed consent) who provided written consent and were diagnosed with onychomycosis in either the left or right great toenail (target nail). The lesion should be definitely diagnosed using a potassium hydroxide examination, with 20% or more clinical involvement of the affected great toenail (not reaching the proximal nail fold), and the growth of the target nail (requiring nail clipping at least once a month) should be confirmed by consultation (regardless of the nail thickness). If both the left and right great toenails were affected, the target nail with the larger clinical involvement was selected. In case the clinical involvement was of the same size, then the right nail was chosen.

The following subjects were excluded: (i) patients with either proximal subungual onychomycosis or total dystrophic onychomycosis; (ii) patients with nail psoriasis, lichen planus of the nails, palmoplantar pustulosis of the nails, and complicated nail deformation due to causes other than onychomycosis such as dystrophia unguium; (iii) patients who received EFCZ, oral antifungals or any topical therapeutic drug for onychomycosis within 3 months before the date of informed consent; (iv) patients scheduled to use concomitant medications or combination therapies (oral antifungals, topical therapeutic medicine for onychomycosis other than EFCZ, laser irradiation, occlusive dressing therapy such as urea ointment; removal of nail thickening is allowed) during the period of participation in this study; and (v) patients with negative fungal culture (confirmed at the time of research enrollment after informed consent).

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^116oaAwg]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

As demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man, ciclopirox olamine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and completely eliminated in all species via feces and urine. Most of the compound is excreted either unchanged or as glucuronide. After oral administration of 10 mg of radiolabeled drug (¹⁴C-ciclopirox) to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the radioactivity was excreted renally within 12 hours of administration. Ninety-four percent of the renally excreted radioactivity was in the form of glucuronides. Thus, glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway of this compound.

Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in 5 patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses, after application of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months. Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and 4 weeks post-treatment. In this study, ciclopirox serum levels ranged from 12–80 ng/mL. Based on urinary data, mean absorption of ciclopirox from the dosage form was < 5% of the applied dose. One month after cessation of treatment, serum and urine levels of ciclopirox were below the limit of detection.

In two vehicle-controlled trials, patients applied Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), to all toenails and affected fingernails. Out of a total of 66 randomly selected patients on active treatment, 24 had detectable serum ciclopirox concentrations at some point during the dosing interval (range 10.0–24.6 ng/mL). It should be noted that eleven of these 24 patients took concomitant medication containing ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine cream, 0.77%.

The penetration of the Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), was evaluated in an in vitro investigation. Radiolabeled ciclopirox applied once to onychomycotic toenails that were avulsed demonstrated penetration up to a depth of approximately 0.4 mm. As expected, nail plate concentrations decreased as a function of nail depth. The clinical significance of these findings in nail plates is unknown. Nail bed concentrations were not determined.

### Efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate, a novel oral triazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of onychomycosis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study [^112igAHQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Subjects

Of 213 consenting patients with onychomycosis, 153 (101 F‐RVCZ and 52 placebo) were randomized (Fig. 1). All randomized subjects were included in the FAS and SAF, while 139 subjects (89 F‐RVCZ and 50 placebo) were included in the PPS. The baseline characteristics of the randomized subjects (FAS) are shown in Table 1. Those receiving F‐RVCZ and the placebo were comparable in terms of age, sex, causative fungal species and the nail involvement ratio of the target toenail. Ninety and 51 subjects treated with F‐RVCZ and placebo, respectively, completed the 12‐week treatment with the study drug, of whom 89 and 50 completed the final follow‐up observation at week 48.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^112n8UzX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We evaluated the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in long‐term use, for up to 72 weeks, for onychomycosis, including severe cases. Among 605 participants, 219 patients diagnosed as having onychomycosis were evaluated for the efficacy of efinaconazole. The treatment success rate (< 10% clinical involvement of the target toenail) at the final assessment time point was 56.6%, the complete cure rate was 31.1% and the mycological cure rate was 61.6%, all of which increased over time, demonstrating that continuous application contributed to the improvement of cure rate. Even in severe cases, reduction of the affected nail area was observed, showing the potential efficacy of the treatment. Responses to a quality of life questionnaire among patients with onychomycosis, OnyCOE‐t, suggested that efinaconazole treatment improved the patients' quality of life. The incidence of adverse drug reaction in the patients eligible for the assessment was 6.3%, and this developed only in the administration site in all cases. No systemic adverse event was observed. In addition, no increase in the incidence of adverse drug reaction due to long‐term use was found. Efinaconazole therapy was proved to exhibit excellent balance between efficacy and safety, and thus may serve as a useful treatment option for onychomycosis.

### Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot [^111khEPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.

Main Results

Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12–0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least 1 year). The 6 trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: a multicenter, single-arm study [^111euFbn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

One of the new findings of our study is the evaluation of the complete cure rate in patients with long‐term treatment for more than 48 weeks. Severe cases have been reported to require a longer treatment duration, but the evaluation of EFCZ use for more than 48 weeks had been unclear. 15, 16 Considering that the treatment success rate increased until week 72 after starting EFCZ application, the clinical significance of continuing the application beyond 1 year was indicated. The complete cure rates at weeks 48 and 52 in the Japanese group in the multinational phase III study were 20.1% and 28.8%, respectively, which were almost the same as our results of 19.6% and 26.5% at weeks 48 and 60, respectively. Moreover, the rate in our study increased to 31.1% at week 72, indicating the benefit of continuing EFCZ application for more than 1 year. In fact, 121 subjects (55.3%), more than half of the enrolled subjects, continued EFCZ application to week 72, of whom 10 achieved complete cure. Generally, the factors associated with complete cure included not only fungal infection in the nail but also the growth rate of the nail. Considering that the duration until toenails are completely replaced with new growth is mostly 1 year or even longer for elderly or thickened nails, it is not an easy goal to achieve. Nevertheless, we observed many patients who attained cure after using EFCZ for over 1 year, which suggests that more patients would achieve complete cure with longer therapy. Improvement of the mycological cure rate was observed earlier than that of the treatment success rate, reaching 50.7% at week 36 and even 55.3% at week 72. In the patient population with an affected area of more than 50%, mycological cure was obtained in 47.5% of the subjects at week 72, which is expected for high antifungal activity, even in severe cases. Mycological cure in severe cases was newly achieved even at week 72, suggesting the possible efficacy by further long‐term treatment. However, outcomes from our study are limited and thus future reports are expected.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering fluconazole (3–6 mg/kg once weekly for 12–16 weeks for fingernail infection and 18–26 weeks for toenail infection) as second-line therapy if itraconazole and terbinafine contraindicated or not tolerated in pediatric (aged 1–12 years) patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Obtain baseline LFTs and CBC. Monitor LFTs in high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk because of concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

Efficacy

Before the first administration of the study drug, either the left or right great toenail was designated as the target toenail for the efficacy evaluation. The nail involvement ratio was calculated as the percentage of nail involvement to the total nail area of the target toenail, based on nail photographs taken at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48.

Primary end‐point

Complete cure rate at week 48: The rate of complete cure (clinical cure [0% clinical involvement of the target toenail] plus mycological cure [negative potassium hydroxide examination]) at week 48 was determined.

Secondary end‐points

Change over time in complete cure rate

Complete cure rates at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 were determined.

Efficacy rating

The efficacy of the study drug on the target toenail was rated at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48, based on the percent decrease in the area of nail involvement, as follows: marked improvement, 60% or more; improvement, 30% or more to less than 60%; and failure, less than 30%.

Percent decrease in the area of nail involvement

The percent decreases in the area of nail involvement of the target toenail from those at screening were determined at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48. These percent decreases in the area of nail involvement were calculated by the following formula:

Mycological cure rate

The mycological cure rate of the target toenail was determined at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48.

Subgroup analysis of complete cure rate

The complete cure rate at week 48 was determined for each subgroup according to sex, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), causative fungal species detected at screening (T. rubrum or T. mentagrophytes) and the nail involvement ratio at screening (< 50% or ≥ 50%).

Safety

For the safety evaluation, we determined whether the subjects had any subjective symptoms/objective findings, and monitored abnormal changes in laboratory test values to identify the occurrence of any adverse events (AE) during the study period.

Onychomycosis of the fingernail

Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 73 total; 37 given SPORANOX®Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of SPORANOX®Capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without SPORANOX®, which was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of SPORANOX®Capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent (56%) of patients were considered an overall success and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.
