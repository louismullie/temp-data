Community acquired pneumonia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about community-acquired pneumonia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and severity stratification. Then, I should verify site-of-care decisions and the role of clinical prediction rules. Next, I will review microbiologic testing indications. After that, I need to select empiric antibiotics by setting and risk factors, including MRSA and Pseudomonas coverage. I will then consider special populations and scenarios, confirm duration and IV-to-PO switch criteria, and finally address prevention, follow-up, and stewardship, making sure I double-check areas where guidelines conflict or where evidence is mixed.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity framework. CAP is defined by compatible clinical features (cough, fever, dyspnea, pleuritic pain) plus radiographic evidence of a new infiltrate, with chest radiography as the initial imaging modality and CT reserved for equivocal cases or complications, and I should remember that clinical signs alone are insufficient for diagnosis, so I need to ensure imaging is obtained when pneumonia is suspected [^11331Ns8] [^115Q4PaA]. I should also verify severity using validated tools such as PSI and CURB-65 to guide site of care, while acknowledging that these tools complement, not replace, clinical judgment, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^112KyGo7] [^115qUt4N].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disposition; I need to check how severity scoring informs site-of-care decisions. For low-risk PSI classes I–III, outpatient care is generally safe, whereas higher-risk classes or CURB-65 ≥ 2 favor hospitalization, and ICU admission is warranted for severe CAP defined by septic shock, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or persistent respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation, with the caveat that some patients with severe CAP may be managed on general wards due to resource constraints, which still warrants guideline-concordant therapy [^112KyGo7] [^113MzA3i] [^112DLpKn]. I should double-check that the ED policy supports early antibiotics and disposition tools, which it does, while cautioning against premature antibiotics before imaging confirmation to avoid overtreatment [^111AsKbs] [^115qUt4N].

> Next, I should review microbiologic testing indications and not over-order low-yield tests. Routine sputum Gram stain and culture are not recommended for outpatients, but I need to obtain blood cultures and respiratory cultures in severe CAP, in patients with risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, or when expanding empiric coverage to these pathogens, ideally before antibiotics when feasible, and I should send endotracheal aspirates promptly after intubation for severe disease [^115hg7iB] [^112NDtjT] [^112nw1MB]. Wait, let me verify the role of procalcitonin; I initially thought it might help decide whether to start antibiotics, but the 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommends starting empiric antibiotics regardless of initial procalcitonin in radiographically confirmed CAP, so I should correct that assumption and use procalcitonin, if at all, to support early discontinuation in select contexts rather than to withhold therapy [^1129tjB2] [^115YVDN7].

> I will now examine empiric therapy for outpatients without comorbidities. The preferred first-line options are amoxicillin 1 g three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, with macrolide monotherapy reserved only where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25% and alternatives are contraindicated, given high resistance rates in many U.S. settings, so I should confirm local antibiograms before choosing a macrolide [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline nuances change this; the 2019 guideline explicitly deprioritizes routine macrolide monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients due to resistance, reinforcing the preference for amoxicillin or doxycycline when appropriate [^116R7qqa].

> For outpatients with comorbidities, I need to ensure broader coverage. Acceptable regimens include amoxicillin/clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin combined with doxycycline or a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, chosen based on comorbidities, recent antibiotic exposure, and local resistance patterns, and I should avoid fluoroquinolones in patients with QT risk or other contraindications [^111GDt9s]. Hold on, I should verify that stewardship principles are emphasized here; yes, the guideline encourages selecting the narrowest effective agent and de-escalating when possible, which I should apply at discharge planning and follow-up [^114VuhzV].

> For nonsevere inpatients without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk, I should confirm that the recommended regimens are a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with beta-lactam plus doxycycline as an alternative when macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, and I should avoid beta-lactam monotherapy routinely in this setting [^117DLH1Y] [^116FdSvq]. Wait, let me verify the evidence base; randomized and observational data show conflicting signals for beta-lactam monotherapy versus combination therapy, so guideline preferences reflect mortality signals from observational studies and mechanistic considerations, which I should communicate when discussing options [^116oDx2e].

> For severe CAP, I need to ensure combination therapy is used. The preferred regimens are a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and I should avoid fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline for severe disease, given inferior outcomes in observational analyses and guideline recommendations [^111VxjWa] [^112LnUKE]. But wait, what if macrolide resistance is high locally; the mortality benefit associated with macrolide-containing regimens appears robust across observational syntheses, though I should still align with local epidemiology and consider pathogen-directed narrowing once cultures return [^112LnUKE].

> I should confirm how to handle MRSA and Pseudomonas risk. The 2019 guideline explicitly abandons the HCAP category and recommends empiric MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage only when locally validated risk factors are present, such as prior respiratory isolation of these organisms, recent hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics, or other institutional risk models, and if I start such broad therapy, I should obtain cultures and de-escalate promptly if results are negative [^114uuCmt] [^112NDtjT]. Hold on, I should verify that stewardship frameworks endorse this approach; yes, contemporary stewardship perspectives support replacing HCAP with targeted risk-factor models to reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum use [^117EdGWu].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In immunocompromised adults, standard CAP guidelines do not apply, and I should broaden initial therapy and diagnostics per consensus statements, often including coverage for Pseudomonas, MRSA, and atypicals, with early involvement of infectious diseases consultation [^117F8r49]. In pediatrics, amoxicillin is first-line for most outpatient cases, with broader-spectrum IV agents for severe disease, and duration should be minimized to the shortest effective course to limit resistance, which I need to ensure is reflected in discharge plans [^115h6tNF] [^111kEy8f]. For aspiration pneumonia, I should avoid routine anaerobic coverage unless there is clinical failure or specific risk factors, and I will plan a standard 5-day course with reassessment if the patient does not improve [^116N89Kk]. If influenza is detected, I should start antiviral therapy regardless of illness duration in inpatients and consider it in outpatients, and I should still initiate standard antibacterial therapy because bacterial co-infection is common, with consideration of early discontinuation if the patient stabilizes and no bacterial pathogen is identified [^116xYNzB] [^113tR9LR].

> I need to ensure duration and IV-to-PO switch criteria are precise. The minimum duration is 5 days for most patients, guided by achievement of clinical stability defined by normalization of vital signs, ability to eat, and normal mentation, with extension to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas, and I should switch to oral therapy using the same class or agent when feasible to maintain pharmacokinetic continuity [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF]. Wait, let me verify the evidence for short-course therapy; randomized trials support 5-day courses as noninferior to longer regimens when clinical stability is achieved, reinforcing this approach for stewardship and shorter length of stay [^112RuRoF].

> Next, I should review prevention, follow-up, and imaging. Vaccination for pneumococcus, influenza, COVID-19, and RSV where indicated should be offered, along with smoking cessation counseling, and I should avoid routine follow-up chest imaging in patients who are clinically improved, reserving imaging for those with persistent symptoms or high-risk features, while ensuring that eligible patients are directed to appropriate lung cancer screening pathways separately from CAP care [^1173MLCC] [^114VuhzV]. I should double-check that this aligns with primary care guidance; yes, recent reviews emphasize vaccination and selective imaging rather than routine follow-up films [^1173MLCC] [^114VuhzV].

> Finally, I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is embedded throughout. That means using the narrowest effective spectrum, obtaining cultures before expanding coverage when possible, reassessing at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or stop antibiotics if clinically appropriate, and applying local antibiograms to guide empiric choices, with explicit documentation of the rationale for MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage to support audit and feedback [^116NEoCU] [^117EdGWu]. Hold on, I should verify that the guidelines explicitly support de-escalation; they do, particularly after negative cultures or clinical stabilization, which I should reinforce in order sets and discharge summaries [^114VuhzV].

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lung infection acquired outside healthcare settings, most often due to **Streptococcus pneumoniae** [^notfound]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features plus chest radiography [^11331Ns8]; severity is stratified using validated tools (PSI, CURB-65) to guide site of care [^115qUt4N]. Empiric antibiotics are selected by setting and comorbidities: outpatients without comorbidities receive amoxicillin or doxycycline [^113g1GAS]; with comorbidities, amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is used [^111GDt9s]. Inpatients with severe CAP require a β-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^111VxjWa]; add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage only with specific risk factors [^114uuCmt]. Treat for a minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability before stopping [^11422hz5] [^1137eJC4]. Early recognition, appropriate antibiotics, and supportive care reduce mortality and complications [^116oDx2e] [^114cq6uM].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

CAP has a **broad microbial spectrum**, with bacteria predominating but viruses and fungi also implicated [^111wTGxs] [^117Ai97M]:

- **Bacterial pathogens**: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, atypicals (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), and Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [^115TSttT] [^114uuCmt].

- **Viral pathogens**: Influenza, RSV, COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses [^117Ai97M].

- **Fungal pathogens**: Less common, typically in immunocompromised hosts (e.g. Histoplasma, Pneumocystis jirovecii) [^117Ai97M].

Risk factors include **age ≥ 65 years, chronic lung disease, smoking, immunosuppression, diabetes, alcoholism, and recent respiratory infections** [^115Q4PaA] [^1173MLCC].

---

## Clinical presentation

CAP typically presents with:

- **Respiratory symptoms**: Cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, sputum production [^112ZbpHr].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, anorexia [^notfound].

- **Physical examination**: Crackles, bronchial breath sounds, egophony, increased fremitus [^notfound].

- **Severe cases**: Respiratory failure, septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction [^114cq6uM].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis combines clinical features with **radiographic confirmation** [^11331Ns8]:

- **Chest radiography**: Gold standard for confirming pneumonia; infiltrates consistent with pneumonia [^11331Ns8].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, blood cultures (especially in severe cases) [^114VuhzV].

- **Microbiological testing**: Sputum cultures, urinary antigens for Legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and molecular testing for respiratory viruses [^112NDtjT].

- **Severity assessment**: Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 to guide site of care and management [^112KyGo7].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **severity, comorbidities, and patient-specific factors**:

| **Setting** | **Empiric antibiotic therapy** |
|-|-|
| Outpatient, no comorbidities | Amoxicillin or doxycycline [^113g1GAS] |
| Outpatient, comorbidities | Amoxicillin/clavulanate or cephalosporin + macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone [^111GDt9s] |
| Inpatient, non-severe | β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone [^117DLH1Y] |
| Inpatient, severe | β-lactam + macrolide or β-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^111VxjWa] |
| MRSA or Pseudomonas risk | Add MRSA (vancomycin or linezolid) or Pseudomonas coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or meropenem) [^114uuCmt] |

---

Duration is a **minimum of 5 days**, ensuring clinical stability before discontinuation [^11422hz5] [^1137eJC4]. Supportive care includes oxygen therapy, fluids, and ventilatory support as needed [^115H81B7] [^113MzA3i].

---

## Complications

CAP can lead to **significant complications**, particularly in high-risk patients:

- **Respiratory failure**: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring mechanical ventilation [^112SDUK2].

- **Sepsis**: Systemic inflammatory response leading to multi-organ dysfunction [^114cq6uM].

- **Pleural effusion and empyema**: Fluid accumulation in the pleural space, potentially requiring drainage [^notfound].

- **Long-term sequelae**: Chronic lung disease, recurrent infections, and increased mortality risk [^114cq6uM].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **vaccination and risk-factor modification**:

- **Vaccinations**: Pneumococcal, influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines significantly reduce CAP incidence and severity [^1173MLCC].

- **Smoking cessation**: Reduces risk and severity of CAP [^notfound].

- **Hand hygiene and infection control**: Limit transmission of respiratory pathogens [^notfound].

---

Community-acquired pneumonia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, requiring prompt recognition, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate empiric therapy. Early initiation of guideline-concordant antibiotics, severity-based site-of-care decisions, and supportive care are essential to **optimize outcomes** [^116oDx2e].

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^11331Ns8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging because of the broad range of clinical presentations, potential life-threatening nature of the illness, and associated high costs of care. The initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is important in determining the need for antibiotic therapy, and the prognosis is important in determining the site of care. This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk for death from the infection. In addition, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, but the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of the infection. Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis; however, we do not know its sensitivity and specificity, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph needs to rely on expert opinion in seeking strategies to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory items can help estimate the short-term risk for death and, along with the patient's psychosocial characteristics, determine the appropriate site of treatment.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^115qUt4N]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is a revision of the 2009 "Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Adult Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Community-Acquired Pneumonia". A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, what clinical decision aids can inform the determination of patient disposition? (2) In the adult emergency department patient with community-acquired pneumonia, what biomarkers can be used to direct initial antimicrobial therapy? (3) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, does a single dose of parenteral antibiotics in the emergency department followed by oral treatment versus oral treatment alone improve outcomes? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### Choosing antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^113HbCQx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is known as a major worldwide health concern considering it has been shown to account for 78% of infection-related deaths in the United States. It is a common cause for hospitalization with a continued incidence rise in the elderly, high mortality rate and long-term sequelae in critically ill patients. Severe CAP (sCAP) is an accepted terminology used to describe ICU admitted patients with CAP. The aim of this review is to further report on the major advances in treatment for patients with sCAP including new antibiotic treatments despite macrolide resistance as seen in the ICU, and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship interventions that may lead to the reduction broad-spectrum antibiotic use in CAP.

Recent Findings

We aim to examine the most recent findings in order to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic choices, timing regimens and evidence for clinical effectiveness. This will be addressed by focusing on the use combination therapies, the usefulness of severity scores and the difficulty to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens, including gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Relevant reports referenced within included randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews and international guidelines where applicable.

Summary

New antibiotics have been recently launched with direct agent-specific properties that have been shown to avoid the overuse of previous broad-spectrum antibiotics when treating patients sCAP. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are now recommended and imperative in improving a patients' prognosis, there are also some considerations when prescribing antibiotics that are beyond the spectrum. There is a need to implement effective policies of de-escalation to avoid antibiotic resistance and the risk for developing subsequent infections by combining informed clinical judgement and the application of biomarkers. Reaching clinical stability and avoidance of treatment failure are the most important pillars in treatment success.

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^115iwg2w]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the current literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and reasons for admitting the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

Recent Findings

Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP. The guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern, and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

The cost, morbidity and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These are heterogeneous groups of patients, so it is important to use risk-stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients. In particular, it is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy, so that the risks of treatment failure and the morbidity of CAP may be minimized.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^113aEzsS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^112N586C]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek emergency care. It is a challenging infection in that the spectrum of illness ranges from the nontoxic patient appropriate for outpatient antibiotics to the critically ill patient requiring intensive care hospitalization. Current data and diagnostic technology provide the emergency physician with the tools for an appropriately rapid evaluation and consideration of the differential diagnosis. Key critical thinking and application of published findings allow for intelligent empirical antibiotic treatment and risk stratification for the best disposition. Although antibiotic-resistant organisms increasingly are being identified, patients continue to benefit from early institution of standard ED treatment. Coverage for atypical organisms improves patient response and outcome. Finally, identification and treatment of the complications of pneumonia and accompanying sepsis must be considered by the ED physician when evaluating critically ill patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^114pR1bB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine both direct and indirect evidence to compare initial antibiotic options for patients with SCAP. Our analysis provides important insights to guide clinical decision-making regarding antibiotic choice for these patients. From our analysis, we derived several key findings: β-lactam plus macrolide emerged as the best choice for patients with SCAP, in alignment with international guidelines Fluoroquinolone monotherapy can be considered a reasonable alternative when β-lactam plus macrolide is not appropriate. However, β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone should be avoided.

Early antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SCAP. Although atypical microorganisms are responsible for 8–20% of SCAP cases, their role in the disease process is significant. Therefore, empiric antibiotic treatment targeting atypical pathogens is associated with a reduction in clinical failure rates among hospitalized adults with CAP. In addition to their antibacterial effects, macrolides possess broad anti-inflammatory properties. When combined with β-lactams, macrolides improve early clinical responses, reduce inflammation, enhance gas exchange, alleviate sepsis and organ failure, and lower mortality risk. Consistent with the result of a previous study, we recommend β-lactam plus macrolide as the preferred empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients with SCAP.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: do we know when, what and for how long to treat? [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

To assess the associations between 3 key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Evidence Review

Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

Findings

Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among 8 observational studies identified, the 4 largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the 4 smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6% (1-sided 90% CI upper limit, 13.0%) in attainment of clinical stability on hospital day 7 favoring β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy. Six of 8 observational studies (study populations of 1188 to 24,780) found that β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy was associated with relative reductions of 26% to 68% in short-term mortality and all 3 observational studies (study populations of 2068 to 24,780) reported that fluoroquinolone monotherapy was associated with relative reductions of 30% to 43% in mortality compared with β-lactam monotherapy. One randomized trial (n = 302) reported significantly reduced hospital length of stay (absolute difference, 1.9 days; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.2 days), but no differences in treatment failure when objective clinical criteria were used to decide when to transition patients from intravenous to oral therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotic therapy consisting of β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy initiated within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality, supported predominantly by low-quality observational studies. One randomized trial supports the use of objective clinical criteria to guide the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: current outcomes, epidemiology, etiology, and therapy [^113MzA3i]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis with a significant impact on healthcare management around the world, with the highest morbidity and mortality of all of the forms of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with severe pneumonia usually require intensive care unit management, including vasopressors or mechanical ventilation. Early clinical suspicion and prompt empiric antimicrobial therapies are mandatory in patients with severe pneumonia. A number of recent studies and guidelines addressing these issues have been published, and they will be reviewed in this article.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: what's in a name? [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Formerly, patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit were considered as having the severe form of the disease. Recently, guidelines have distinguished severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical definitions. In this review, we describe the different definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and whether a differentiation based on these definitions reflects variation in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic approaches and treatment.

Recent Findings

New definitions do not seem to accurately identify patients with high risks of mortality; patients not admitted to an intensive care unit could also be diagnosed as having severe community-acquired pneumonia. Host-factors, such as genetic factors and underlying diseases, can influence severity of presentation of community-acquired pneumonia. Distribution of pathogens in severe and non-severe disease forms is comparable. Initial antibiotic therapy in patients with severe disease should provide coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delay is associated with worse outcomes. However, recent studies also suggested an additional benefit of atypical coverage in non-severe disease. As a result, initial therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone is recommended for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the value of vaccination against pneumococci to prevent episodes of severe disease is yet unknown.

Summary

As current guidelines do not adequately identify patients with high risk of mortality and intensive care unit admittance, clinical judgment remains important. Based on distribution of pathogens, investigational procedures and therapy recommended in recent guidelines, differentiation between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia does not seem useful. Whether atypical coverage indeed has additional value in non-severe or pneumococcal CAP, however, remains to be determined. In addition, the preventive benefit of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for development of SCAP awaits further evidence.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^11314Sjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### Approaches to treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department and the appropriate role of fluoroquinolones [^115rmUvX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The Emergency Department is a critical point of care for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The initial diagnosis, the decision to admit or discharge, the timing of initiating treatment, and appropriateness of the empirical therapy are key factors in successful management. Rising resistance rates to commonly used CAP antibiotics has complicated empirical treatment. Respiratory fluoroquinolones represent an important therapeutic option for patients with co-morbidities and risk factors for penicillin-, macrolide-, and multi-drug-resistant S. pneumoniae infections. Ensuring appropriate use is required to maintain their high level of effectiveness in key respiratory pathogens. Treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are available to assist emergency physicians in developing clinical pathways to ensure appropriate use of available therapies.

Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can be prevented through vaccination with pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Diagnosis requires suggestive history and physical findings in conjunction with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. Laboratory testing can help guide therapy. Important issues in treatment include choosing the proper venue, timely initiation of the appropriate antibiotic or antiviral, appropriate respiratory support, deescalation after negative culture results, switching to oral therapy, and short treatment duration.

### Strategies for prediction of drug-resistant pathogens and empiric antibiotic selection in community-acquired pneumonia [^117EdGWu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are appropriately treated with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, predicting which patients require coverage of drug-resistant pathogens (DRP) remains a challenge. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America CAP guidelines endorse using locally validated prediction models for DRP. Here we review risk factors for DRP and provide a summary of available risk prediction models.

Recent Findings

Both inadequate initial empiric spectrum as well as unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use are associated with poor outcomes in CAP. Multiple prediction models for DRP-based patient-level risk factors have been published, with some variation in included predictor variables and test performance characteristics. Seven models have been robustly externally validated, and implementation data have been published for two of these models. All models demonstrated better performance than the healthcare-associated pneumonia criteria, with most favoring sensitivity over specificity. We also report validation of the novel, risk factor-based treatment algorithm proposed in the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines which strongly favors specificity over sensitivity, especially in nonsevere pneumonia.

Summary

Using patient-level risk factors to guide the decision whether to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics is a rational approach to treatment. Several viable candidate prediction models are available. Hospitals should evaluate the local performance of existing scores before implementing in routine clinical practice.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^112SDUK2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is the most life-threatening form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and often necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to invasive mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors. The overall mortality rate for SCAP exceeds 20%, and it is a leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Studies indicate that early administration of antibiotics can reduce hospital mortality and ICU admission rates, so an appropriate initial antibiotic regimen is important for patients with SCAP.

The most frequently identified pathogens causing SCAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and atypical pathogens. Understanding these pathogens is critical, as it informs the selection of appropriate initial empirical antibiotic regimens, which are essential for reducing mortality and ICU admissions in SCAP patients. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) and the latest European community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines recommend a β-lactam antibiotics plus a macrolides for patients with SCAP. The combination of a β-lactam antibiotics and a respiratory fluoroquinolones, however, remains controversial and lacks definitive evidence to support its superiority. Moreover, recent retrospective cohort studies have suggested that β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides, fluoroquinolones monotherapy, and β-lactam antibiotics plus doxycycline may yield similar outcomes in non-severe CAP. However, few studies have directly compared fluoroquinolones monotherapy and β-lactam antibiotics plus tetracycline in SCAP. Despite the recommendations provided by guidelines, the optimal antibiotic regimen for SCAP remains a subject of ongoing debate. Questions persist regarding whether a β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides combination is superior to a β-lactam antibiotics plus fluoroquinolones, and the efficacy of fluoroquinolones monotherapy and β-lactam antibiotics plus doxycycline as potentially suboptimal options is still unclear. Conventional pairwise meta-analyses, which rely on direct comparisons, are relatively limited and pose challenges in evaluating these antibiotic regimens. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the outcomes associated with different antibiotic treatments.

Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice for empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP to be initiated without microbiologic studies. Clinicians carefully should observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and should be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^1131ADAR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment and CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side-effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

Objectives

Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Sanofi, and Yamanouchi. No language restrictions were applied in any of the search strategies.

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one or more antibiotics were tested for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory adolescent or adult patients. Studies testing one or more antibiotic and reporting the diagnostic criteria used in selecting patients as well as the clinical outcomes achieved were included. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and study reports assessed by two independent reviewers (LMB and TJMV). Authors of studies were contacted as needed to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. The data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2.2 Software. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 622 patients aged 12 years and older diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included. The quality of the studies and of the reporting was variable. A variety of clinical, radiological and bacteriological diagnostic criteria and outcomes were reported. Overall there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics under study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in ambulatory patients. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^115H81B7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is one of the most common infections seen in emergency department patients. There is a wide spectrum of disease severity and viral pathogens are common. After a careful history and physical examination, chest radiographs may be the only diagnostic test required. The first step in management is risk stratification, using a validated clinical decision rule and serum lactate, followed by early antibiotics and fluid resuscitation when indicated. Antibiotics should be selected with attention to risk factors for multidrug-resistant respiratory pathogens. Broad use of pneumococcal vaccine in adults and children can prevent severe community-acquired pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^112KyGo7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2–3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

### Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia [^1176jSt6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are treated as outpatients, the majority of data regarding CAP management is provided by hospitals, either from emergency department or inpatients. This was already noted in the first CAP guidelines, published in 1993, and the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist nowadays. These include the uncertainty of the initial diagnosis and risk stratification, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the overgrowing of antibiotic resistance bacteria and the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics.

Recent Findings

New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, unveiling the role of virus. Diagnostic uncertainty may lead to antibiotic overuse and bacteria resistance. Novel antibiotics along with diagnostic improvement, related to the use of lung ultrasound and point-of-care biomarkers testing, may help to improve CAP treatment. Prevention, especially the use of antipneumococcal vaccine, is instrumental in reducing the burden of disease.

Summary

Most of CAP cases are managed in the outpatient setting. However, most research is focused on hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in improving outcomes, as well as to the execution of stewardship programs that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^11737JPS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) — burden, core measures, and early antibiotics — is characterized by high impact and variable practices: CAP is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 1.7 million hospital admissions per year, and CAP-related hospitalizations cost an estimated $9 billion annually. Core ED measures for CAP include blood culture collection prior to first antibiotic administration, administration of initial antibiotics within 6 hours of ED arrival (previously within 4 hours), and appropriate antibiotic selection. Attempts to increase the proportion treated in less than 4 hours resulted in an additional 17% of patients being unnecessarily treated with antibiotics; among ED patients with respiratory complaints, 1,948 were evaluated and only 198 were ultimately diagnosed with CAP, such that if half received empiric antibiotics at least 40% would have received them unnecessarily. Reported practice patterns include that 37% of academic EDs administer antibiotics before obtaining chest radiograph.

### Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia [^112fnaDL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The first guidelines on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were published in 1993, but since then many of the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist. These include the difficulty in establishing the initial clinical diagnosis, its risk stratification, which will dictate the place of treatment, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics and the importance of knowing local microbiological susceptibility patterns.

Recent Findings

New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, especially the contribution of virus. Lung ultrasound and biomarkers might aid diagnosis and severity stratification in the outpatient setting. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem that reinforces the importance of novel antibiotics. And finally, prevention and the use of anti-pneumococcal vaccine are instrumental in reducing the burden of disease.

Summary

Most of CAP cases are managed in the community; however, most research comes from hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in the execution of stewardship programmes that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Conclusions

A substantial number of patients with severe CAP were managed in general wards with a high rate of unfavorable outcome. Adherence to the IDSA/ATS guidelines for initial antibiotic treatment of severe CAP in the ICU may contribute to a lower rate of unfavorable outcome, and a higher number of hospital-free days. Severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

### Clinical experience in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: lessons from the use of fluoroquinolones [^1171TV3A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The treatment of CAP has been complicated by several factors, including the expanding spectrum of causative organisms and the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance among respiratory pathogens. Initial antimicrobial treatment for patients with CAP is usually selected empirically and should provide appropriate coverage against the most common causative organisms, including resistant strains. Respiratory fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are the only antimicrobials that are highly active against the pathogens most frequently implicated in CAP, including macrolide-resistant and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., and atypical agents. This paper reviews recent studies involving adult patients with CAP that suggest that levofloxacin, as compared with other conventional antibiotic treatments, may be associated with better clinical outcomes.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^115HC8Uh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided to 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. To date, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance and expense.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and need of adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2007); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

Main Results

Twenty five trials were included, encompassing 5244 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend toward clinical success and a significant advantage to bacteriological eradication, which disappeared when evaluating methodologically high-quality studies alone. Clinical success for the atypical arm was significantly higher for Legionella pneumophilae (L. pneumophilae) and non-significantly lower for pneumococcal pneumonia. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of (total) adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were more common in the non-atypical arm (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99). All but two included trials compared a single atypical antibiotic to a beta-lactam, while no trials assessing the addition of an atypical antibiotic to a beta-lactam were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

No benefit of survival or clinical efficacy was shown to empirical atypical coverage in hospitalized patients with CAP. This conclusion relates mostly to the comparison of quinolone monotherapy to beta-lactams (BL) or cephalosporins. Further trials, comparing BL or cephalosporins therapy to BL or cephalosporins combined with a macrolide in this population, using mortality as its primary outcome, should be performed.

Sputum Gram stain and culture in CAP — We recommend obtaining sputum for Gram stain and culture in situations when risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa are present, both when initial empiric therapy is expanded to cover these pathogens and when it is not expanded, and patients who have severe CAP requiring intubation should have lower respiratory tract samples, such as endotracheal aspirates, sent for Gram stain and culture promptly after intubation. The most consistently strong risk factor to consider is prior infection with either MRSA or P. aeruginosa, and hospitalization and treatment with parenteral antibiotics in the last 90 days is associated with an increased risk of these pathogens, and so we recommend sputum culture in this situation.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^112ZbpHr]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^112DLpKn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to be based on site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed or because of unrecognition of the pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managing in general wards.

Methods

This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 h were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcome (composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study.

Results

There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood culture than patients with non-severe CAP (24% VS 4.5%; p = .008). Initial antibiotic treatment were discordant with the IDSA/ATS guidelines in 42% of all patients hospitalized with CAP, and 52% of patients with severe CAP. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.01–1.1) and initial antibiotic treatment discordant to guidelines for severe CAP in ICU (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.3–17.1) were independent risk factors of the unfavorable outcome of patients with severe CAP. Patients with unfavorable outcome had lower number of hospital-free days than patients with favorable outcome (5.2 ± 8 days VS 18 ± 7.1 days; p < .001).

Conclusions

Patients with severe CAP outside ICU should be recognized for appropriate initial antibiotic selection to improve outcomes.

2024. 14796 Importance Community-acquired pneumonia results in approximately

1. 4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually. Observations Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs or symptoms of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.

Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment and infection prevention strategies. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality. Conclusions Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology.

Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

### Patient information: community-acquired pneumonia… [^1173MLCC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the US, CAP results in about 1. 4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 108 deaths each year. Mortality after hospitalization for CAP is 2. 8% for adults younger than 60 years and
26. 8% for those aged 60 years or older who have multiple medical conditions.

1. Risk factors for CAP include older age, cigarette smoking, chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions, such as HIV, cancer, diabetes, and heavy alcohol use. CAP can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, although the pathogen is often not identified. Among hospitalized patients with CAP, the most common causes are viruses and the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. All patients with suspected CAP should have chest imaging. Chest x-ray is often the initial type of imaging, and if it does not reveal CAP, chest computed tomography should be considered.

All patients with CAP should be tested for influenza and COVID-19 if these viruses are circulating in the community. Additional testing of sputum and blood cultures should be performed only in patients with severe CAP or those with risk factors for resistant bacteria. For outpatients, suspected bacterial CAP is typically treated with a 3-day course of oral antibiotics or combination oral antibiotics for those with multiple medical conditions. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP should receive intravenous antibiotics for at least 3 days. Hospitalized patients with severe CAP should also receive steroids. Patients with severe CAP should be closely monitored and treated in an intensive care unit. Those who develop respiratory failure may need mechanical ventilation. Medications to increase blood pressure should be used for patients with CAP who develop shock.

People with a prior episode of CAP are at increased risk of CAP and should be advised about smoking and alcohol cessation and relevant vaccinations. Vaccination for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus can help prevent or decrease the severity of CAP, especially in older adults or those with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, asthma, COPD, HIV, or cancer.

Key points
- Bacteria and viruses are common causes of pneumonia.
- Fungi and parasites are less common causes.
- Germs that commonly cause pneumonia in the community are different from those in healthcare settings.
- Clinicians aren't always able to find out which germ caused someone to get sick with pneumonia. Overview Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. Many germs can cause pneumonia. Types People in the community and people in healthcare settings may be exposed to different types of bacteria and viruses. Defining types of pneumonia Community-acquired pneumonia is when someone develops pneumonia in the community. Healthcare-acquired pneumonia is when someone develops pneumonia during or following a stay in a healthcare setting. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is when someone gets pneumonia after being on a ventilator, a machine that supports breathing.

Causes Bacterial infections Bacterial infections that are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia include: The following bacterial infections can cause pneumonia, but are less common causes: Chlamydia pneumoniaeinfection Haemophilus influenzaedisease Legionellainfection
- Pertussis
- Psittacosis. Fungal infections In general, fungal infections are a less common cause of pneumonia. Keep Reading: Fungal Diseases Viral infections Viral infections that commonly cause pneumonia include

All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection — or resistant infection — and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs.

Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.
