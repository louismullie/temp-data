## Question

does abilify have antidepressive effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Abilify (aripiprazole) has antidepressive effects. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about FDA-labeled indications and dosing to anchor whether depression is an approved target. Then, I should review randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses quantifying efficacy, and clarify that the signal pertains to adjunctive therapy rather than monotherapy. Next, I will examine special populations and symptom dimensions, assess bipolar depression evidence to avoid overgeneralization, consider pharmacologic mechanisms that plausibly explain antidepressant effects, and finally weigh safety, dosing, and overall clinical interpretation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory footing, since that sets the guardrails for clinical claims. Abilify (aripiprazole) is FDA-approved as adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), confirming a recognized antidepressant role when added to an antidepressant, with adult dosing typically initiated at 2–5 mg/day, maintained at 5–10 mg/day, and not exceeding 15 mg/day for this indication [^112jP5z6] [^114LnHyA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify whether this applies to monotherapy or only augmentation. I need to ensure I don't overstate the claim: aripiprazole's FDA indication in unipolar depression is adjunctive, not monotherapy, and among second-generation antipsychotics, only aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, olanzapine (in combination with fluoxetine), and quetiapine have FDA approvals related to MDD in adults as augmentation or specific combinations, underscoring that the evidence base is anchored in add-on therapy rather than standalone use for unipolar MDD [^1177QY5w].

> Next, I should review the randomized controlled data for MDD augmentation to quantify effect size and onset. In a well-cited double-blind RCT of MDD patients with inadequate antidepressant response, adjunctive aripiprazole produced a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms versus adjunctive placebo on MADRS (−8.8 vs −5.8), supporting efficacy as augmentation; pooled analyses across similar short-term studies reported early separation by week 1–2 in some subgroups, which aligns with clinical observations of relatively rapid add-on effects [^111HZiaF]. I should also confirm performance in older adults; in a multicenter RCT of treatment-resistant late-life depression, aripiprazole augmentation significantly increased remission rates compared with placebo, extending the evidence to geriatric populations with TRD [^116MC9Wn].

> I will now examine meta-analyses to assess consistency and magnitude across trials. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses show that adjunctive aripiprazole is superior to placebo for response, with a risk ratio around 1.54 and a number needed to treat of roughly 9, indicating a modest but clinically meaningful benefit when added to an antidepressant in MDD; broader SGA meta-analyses converge on similar conclusions regarding adjunctive strategies, though results vary by agent and dose [^112fy32m] [^111Utis1] [^112Gg6FA]. Wait, let me verify heterogeneity and dose nuances — these analyses also highlight variability across studies and emphasize that efficacy and tolerability are dose-dependent, supporting the practice of using lower augmentation doses to optimize the risk–benefit balance [^115R4moh].

> Let me consider symptom dimensions where benefit may be particularly salient. Post hoc and prospective reports suggest that augmentation may be useful in patients with prominent loss of interest/activity (anhedonia/psychomotor domains), and at least one randomized study in MDD with somatic symptom burden showed improvement in somatic symptom severity with low-dose adjunctive aripiprazole, providing a plausible clinical niche when these features are prominent [^112E2eZG] [^112BkRpj]. I should double-check that these are supportive, not definitive, signals; yes, these data are encouraging but often secondary or subgroup analyses, so they complement rather than supplant the core RCT and meta-analytic evidence [^112E2eZG] [^112BkRpj].

> But wait, what if someone is considering aripiprazole for bipolar depression — does the same antidepressant signal hold? I need to check the bipolar depression data. Reviews of bipolar depression trials indicate that aripiprazole monotherapy did not separate from placebo at fixed endpoints despite early symptom reductions, and meta-analytic summaries focus more on efficacy in mania than bipolar depression, so we should not generalize unipolar MDD augmentation data to bipolar depression treatment without caution [^111G6rFr] [^1117Uo8p]. This reinforces that the clearest antidepressant effect for aripiprazole is as adjunctive therapy in unipolar MDD, not as monotherapy for bipolar depression [^1177QY5w].

> I should confirm whether the pharmacology plausibly supports antidepressant effects. Mechanistically, aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A partial agonist and a 5-HT2A antagonist, a profile often described as "dopamine system stabilization", which could modulate reward processing and mood circuits; preliminary PET work links antidepressant response during augmentation to increased dopaminergic synthesis capacity in striatal regions, offering a biologically coherent rationale for improvements in anhedonia and related domains, though the mechanism remains incompletely defined [^1153hJUq] [^114VkvvE] [^114MfiZx].

> Let me think about dosing strategy and tolerability because that's where augmentation often succeeds or fails. For MDD augmentation, starting low (2–5 mg/day) and titrating slowly toward 5–10 mg/day is standard, as higher starts (for example, 10 mg) can provoke akathisia and restlessness; akathisia is one of the most frequent adverse effects, along with anxiety, insomnia, nausea, somnolence, and weight gain, so proactive monitoring and dose adjustments are prudent [^114LnHyA] [^1159C5WX] [^112ZDo43]. I need to ensure boxed warnings are not overlooked: as with other antipsychotics, there is increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis and a suicidality warning consistent with antidepressant-treated populations, so patient selection and counseling are essential [^1169bPnL].

> Next, I should review limitations to avoid overstating benefits. Trials are generally short-term (about 6–8 weeks), many are industry-sponsored, and not all patients respond — meta-analytic NNTs around 9 mean several patients will not benefit, and tolerability trade-offs (notably akathisia and metabolic effects) can drive discontinuation, underscoring the need to individualize augmentation and reassess early [^111Utis1] [^112fy32m]. Hold on, I should verify that comparative acceptability varies by agent and dose; yes, across SGAs, both efficacy and discontinuation for intolerability differ, and lower augmentation doses tend to be better tolerated while maintaining efficacy within the modest range observed [^112Gg6FA] [^115R4moh].

> Stepping back, my final synthesis is this: Yes, Abilify (aripiprazole) has reproducible, modest antidepressive effects when added to an antidepressant for adults with MDD, supported by FDA approval, multiple positive RCTs — including in late-life TRD — and convergent meta-analyses showing superior response versus placebo with an approximate NNT of 9, while evidence does not support monotherapy for unipolar depression and remains mixed or negative for bipolar depression endpoints; clinically, start low and go slow to mitigate akathisia and monitor safety per boxed warnings and common adverse events [^112jP5z6] [^112CSeFB] [^116MC9Wn] [^112fy32m] [^111Utis1] [^114LnHyA] [^1159C5WX] [^1169bPnL].

---

Yes, Abilify (aripiprazole) has **clinically meaningful antidepressant effects** as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) with inadequate response to antidepressants [^112jP5z6], with an **NNT of 7–10** for response and remission [^112fy32m] [^112CSeFB]. It is **not effective as monotherapy** for MDD or bipolar depression and is not approved for these uses [^111G6rFr] [^1177QY5w] [^112jP5z6]. Adjunctive aripiprazole improves core depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and interest-activity [^112E2eZG], with an early onset (within 1–2 weeks) [^111HZiaF]. Common adverse effects include akathisia, restlessness, and weight gain; monitor for metabolic changes and extrapyramidal symptoms [^112jP5z6].

## Clinical evidence for antidepressive effects

### Major depressive disorder (MDD)

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Aripiprazole is FDA-approved as adjunctive treatment for MDD with inadequate antidepressant response [^112jP5z6]. Multiple RCTs [^112CSeFB] and meta-analyses show significant improvements in depressive symptoms, response, and remission versus placebo [^112fy32m] [^111Utis1].

- **Efficacy metrics**: Meta-analyses report response and remission rates [^117PpYiE] significantly higher than placebo, with NNTs of 7–10 [^112fy32m] [^111iAL9D].

- **Symptom improvement**: Adjunctive aripiprazole improves core depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and interest-activity [^112E2eZG], with early onset (within 1–2 weeks) [^111HZiaF].

---

### Bipolar depression

Limited efficacy: Aripiprazole is **not effective as monotherapy** for acute bipolar depression; trials show no significant benefit versus placebo [^111G6rFr]. Not approved: It is **not FDA-approved** for bipolar depression [^112jP5z6].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to antidepressant effects

Aripiprazole's antidepressant effects likely reflect its **partial agonism** at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors [^1153hJUq], which modulates dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways implicated in mood regulation [^114MfiZx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Both the **APA** and **VA/DoD** guidelines recommend adjunctive aripiprazole — APA for MDD with inadequate antidepressant response and VA/DoD for treatment-resistant depression.

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

- **Common adverse effects**: Akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, weight gain, and metabolic changes.

- **Serious adverse effects**: Extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia [^112jP5z6], and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for metabolic changes, extrapyramidal symptoms, and suicidal ideation [^1169bPnL], especially in younger patients.

## Comparison with other atypical antipsychotics

| **Medication** | **Efficacy (NNT)** | **Common adverse effects** | **FDA approval for MDD** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aripiprazole | 7–10 | - Akathisia <br/> - Weight gain <br/> - Metabolic changes | Yes |
| Quetiapine | 6–9 | - Sedation <br/> - Weight gain <br/> - Metabolic changes | Yes |
| Brexpiprazole | 9–14 | - Weight gain <br/> - Akathisia | Yes |
| Cariprazine | 10–15 | - Akathisia <br/> - Insomnia | Yes |

## Patient populations benefiting from aripiprazole augmentation

Treatment-resistant depression: Patients with inadequate response to antidepressants benefit from **adjunctive aripiprazole** [^112fy32m]. Anhedonia and interest-activity symptoms: Patients with prominent anhedonia or reduced interest/activity may benefit from **aripiprazole augmentation** [^112E2eZG] [^114VkvvE].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Side effects**: Akathisia [^112fy32m] and metabolic changes may limit use [^113o7wJc].

- **Long-term safety**: Long-term safety and efficacy data are limited [^111iAL9D].

- **Cost**: Higher cost than some alternatives may limit access.

---

Abilify (aripiprazole) has **clinically meaningful antidepressant effects** as adjunctive therapy in MDD with inadequate antidepressant response, but is not effective as monotherapy for either MDD or bipolar depression.

### A clinical review of aripiprazole in bipolar depression and maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder [^111G6rFr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition with a significant negative impact on quality of life. Although effective treatments exist for acute mania, consensus on the treatment of acute bipolar depression is lacking, and long-term treatment options for bipolar disorder require further study. Aripiprazole is FDA approved for treating acute mania. This paper reviews the data on the efficacy of aripiprazole in treating acute bipolar depression and for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: PubMed and abstracts from recent conferences were searched for randomized, double-blind studies investigating the efficacy of aripiprazole in acute bipolar depression or maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder.

- **Results**: Two studies assessed the efficacy of aripiprazole monotherapy for acute bipolar depression. Although aripiprazole significantly reduced depressive symptoms early in treatment, results were not significantly different from placebo at the primary endpoint of week 8. Regarding long-term treatment, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in delaying time to relapse for manic episodes, but not for depressive episodes after 26 and 100 weeks of maintenance therapy. Aripiprazole was as effective as lithium, and adjunctive aripiprazole with lithium or valproate was more effective than placebo plus lithium or valproate in preventing a manic relapse. A study combining aripiprazole with lamotrigine achieved reductions in manic and mixed relapse rates compared to placebo; however, the results were cut off.

### Effect of symptom severity on efficacy and safety of aripiprazole adjunctive to antidepressant monotherapy in major depressive disorder: a pooled analysis [^117PpYiE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of evidence for outcome predictors in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) not responding to initial antidepressant therapy (ADT). This post-hoc analysis evaluated whether MDD severity affects response to adjunctive aripiprazole.

- **Methods**: Data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of adjunctive aripiprazole in adults with MDD and inadequate response to one to three ADT trials were pooled and stratified based on Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Categories included mild (≤ 24), moderate (25–30), and severe (≥ 31). Treatment differences in change in MADRS total scores and rates of response (≥ 50% MADRS improvement) and remission (response with MADRS total score ≤ 10) were analyzed at endpoint. Adverse events were assessed within each subgroup.

- **Results**: Aripiprazole produced greater improvement than placebo in the MADRS total score regardless of MDD severity at baseline (between-treatment difference [95% CI]: mild, -2.5 [-4.0 to -1.1]; moderate, -3.2 [-4.9 to -1.6]; severe, -4.5 [-6.8 to -2.2]). Compared with placebo, adjunctive aripiprazole increased the likelihood of response in all subgroups (risk ratio [95% CI]: mild, 1.50 [1.15, 1.95]; moderate, 1.51 [1.09, 2.11]; severe, 1.95 [1.23, 3.10]). Common treatment-emergent adverse events included akathisia and restlessness.

- **Limitations**: The original studies were not designed to assess the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole by baseline severity, and this post-hoc analysis was not powered to evaluate differences in severity subgroups.

### Adjunctive aripiprazole in major depressive disorder: analysis of efficacy and safety in patients with anxious and atypical features [^111HZiaF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) for patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder featuring anxious or atypical characteristics at baseline, data from two identical 14-week studies were pooled. This consisted of an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase followed by a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase of aripiprazole augmentation.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from the end of ADT treatment to the end of the randomized treatment, using the last observation carried forward method. Anxious depression was defined by a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression anxiety/somatization factor score of 7 or higher, while atypical depression was defined by criteria described previously on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report. Both anxious and atypical subtypes were assessed based on symptoms at entry into prospective ADT (week 0). Patients were enrolled between June 2004 and April 2006 in one study, and from September 2004 to December 2006 in the other, with the total randomized population being 742; the anxious/nonanxious population numbered 740, and the atypical/nonatypical population numbered 737.

Completion rates ranged from 84% to 90% and were consistent across all subgroups, with low rates of discontinuation due to adverse events. Patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total scores compared to those receiving adjunctive placebo, starting at week 1 or week 2 and continuing through to endpoint.

### Symptom dimension of interest-activity indicates need for aripiprazole augmentation of escitalopram in major depressive disorder: A CAN-BIND-1 report [^112E2eZG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Differential predictors of response to alternative treatment options are needed to improve outcomes in major depressive disorder. The symptom dimension comprising loss of interest and reduced activity has been reported as a predictor of poor outcome of treatment with antidepressants. We hypothesized that augmentation with partial dopamine agonist aripiprazole would be effective for individuals with pronounced interest-activity symptoms.

We tested this hypothesis in the 2-phase Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression trial 1 (CAN-BIND-1). All participants had a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder confirmed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. In phase 1, 188 individuals received escitalopram monotherapy (10–20 mg daily) for 8 weeks. In phase 2, nonresponders received augmentation with aripiprazole (2–10 mg daily) while responders continued escitalopram monotherapy for another 8 weeks. Outcomes were measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) every 2 weeks. Effects of baseline interest-activity symptoms on outcomes were tested in repeated-measures mixed-effects models.

Higher baseline interest-activity scores (indicative of more severe loss of interest and reduction in activity) predicted worse outcomes of escitalopram monotherapy in phase 1 (b = 1.75; 95% CI, 0.45 to 3.05; p = 0.009). However, the association disappeared with the augmentation option in phase 2 (b = -0.19; 95% CI, -1.30 to 0.92; p = 0.739). A significant interaction between the baseline interest-activity score and aripiprazole was observed.

### The efficacy and safety of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112CSeFB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole versus placebo as adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who showed an incomplete response to one prospective and one to three historical courses of ADT within the episode.

The method involved a 7- to 28-day screening phase, an 8-week prospective treatment phase, and a 6-week double-blind treatment phase. Patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined MDD were enrolled between June 16, 2004, and April 27, 2006. During prospective treatment, patients received ADT: escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled-release, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended-release, each with single-blind, adjunctive placebo. Incomplete responders continued ADT and were randomly assigned to double-blind, adjunctive placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole (2–15 mg/day with fluoxetine or paroxetine; 2–20 mg/day with all others). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from the end of prospective treatment to the end of double-blind treatment (week 14, last observation carried forward) in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (analysis of covariance).

Results indicated that a total of 178 patients were randomly assigned to adjunctive placebo and 184 to adjunctive aripiprazole. Baseline demographics were similar between groups, with a mean MADRS total score of 26.0. Mean change in MADRS total score was significantly greater with adjunctive aripiprazole (-8.8) than with adjunctive placebo (-5.8; p ≤ 0.05), indicating a significant improvement in depressive symptoms for patients in the aripiprazole group.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Gg6FA]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Overall, antipsychotics were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response (N = 10, n = 2733, RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.33–1.78, p < 0.001; NNT = 5, 95% CI 4–9). Individually, amisulpride (N = 2, n = 311, RR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.55–2.55, p < 0.001; NNT = 3, 95% CI 2–6), sulpiride (N = 1, n = 169, RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.03–2.17, p = 0.032; NNT = 7, 95% CI 4–57), and quetiapine (N = 5, n = 2087, RR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.23–1.78, p < 0.001; NNT = 6, 95% CI 4–12) were associated with significantly greater treatment response than placebo. Conversely, ziprasidone (N = 2, n = 166, RR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.81–1.99, p = 0.299) did not significantly separate from placebo regarding treatment response.

The first two studies, Shelton (2005) and Weissman (2012), were excluded, as they did not have a placebo arm to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of olanzapine monotherapy. The third study, Rothschild (2004), was excluded, as this study reported the results of olanzapine monotherapy for MDD with psychotic features.

- **Other studies**: Suppes (2016) was excluded, as this study reported results from a randomized placebo-controlled RCT on lurasidone monotherapy for MDD with mixed features where the effect size was large.

### Anti-aversive effects of the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole, in animal models of anxiety [^115iTCmj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole is a unique antipsychotic that seems to act as a partial agonist at dopamine D2-receptors, contrasting with other drugs in this class, which are silent antagonists. Aripiprazole may also bind to serotonin receptors. Both neurotransmitters may play major roles in aversion, anxiety, and panic-related behaviors. Thus, the present work tested the hypothesis that this antipsychotic could also have anti-aversive properties.

Male Wistar rats received injections of aripiprazole (0.1–10 mg/kg) and were tested in the open field, in the elevated plus and T mazes (EPM and ETM, respectively) and in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Aripiprazole (1 mg/kg) increased the percentage of entries onto the open arms of the EPM and attenuated escape responses in the ETM. In the latter model, the dose of 0.1 mg/kg also decreased the latency to leave the enclosed arm, suggesting anxiolytic and panicolytic-like properties. This dose also decreased the time spent in freezing in a contextual fear conditioning. No significant motor effects were observed at these doses.

The present data support the hypothesis that aripiprazole could inhibit anxiety-related responses. Acting as a partial agonist at dopamine receptors, this drug could effectively treat schizophrenia and, in contrast with most antipsychotic drugs, alleviate aversive states.

### Adjunctive aripiprazole therapy with escitalopram in patients with co-morbid major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence: Clinical and neuroimaging evidence [^116qb45w]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of depression has been reported to reduce the severity of alcohol use, potentially reflecting improvements in common brain reward circuits. We hypothesized that augmentation therapy with escitalopram and aripiprazole would improve depressive symptoms and reduce both craving for alcohol and cue-induced brain activity in patients with co-morbid alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder, compared to treatment with escitalopram alone.

Thirty-five subjects with major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups: 17 subjects received aripiprazole + escitalopram, and 18 subjects received escitalopram only. At baseline and following six weeks of treatment, symptoms of depression, craving for alcohol, and brain activity were evaluated.

During the six-week treatment period, both the Beck Depression Inventory and Clinical Global Index-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased in the aripiprazole + escitalopram and escitalopram-only groups. Following the treatment period, the Korean Alcohol Urge Questionnaire scores in the aripiprazole + escitalopram group were reduced from 23.3 ± 8.4 to 14.3 ± 4.9, compared to a reduction in the escitalopram group from 21.6 ± 8.4 to 19.3 ± 7.1 (F = 13.1, p < 0.01).

The activity within the anterior cingulate was increased in response to the presentation of alcohol drinking scenes following treatment in the aripiprazole + escitalopram group. The change in brain activity within the left anterior cingulate gyrus in all patients with co-morbid alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder was negatively correlated with the…

### Aripiprazole in pediatric psychosis and bipolar disorder: a clinical review [^1174vYWi]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic with unique pharmacological properties, used for a variety of indications, including psychotic and mood disorders in youth. Existing literature was reviewed to summarize experience with this agent in that population.

- **Methods**: A review of relevant literature using the keywords aripiprazole, children, pediatric, all child, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and atypical antipsychotics was conducted.

- **Results**: A total of 140 articles and book chapters were identified, of which 7 reported double-blind controlled trials with aripiprazole, 5 were meta-analyses of pooled data, 11 were open-label trials, 10 were chart reviews, and 17 were case reports or case series.

- **Limitations**: Although every effort was made to locate all available data, some information from posters or researchers was not available. Publication bias tends to report positive outcomes with a treatment, while negative studies are less likely to be reported. Most trials are of short duration.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with aripiprazole is associated with significant reduction of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) scores in youth with schizophrenia, and reductions in items in the negative symptom scores at higher doses (30 mg/day). Significant reductions in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) have been demonstrated in youth with bipolar disorder. In mixed populations, reductions in the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI-S) have also been demonstrated when compared with treatment with placebo. Head-to-head comparisons are fewer in number.

### Improving outcomes in patients with bipolar depression: A comprehensive review [^1154gQJU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Only three medications are currently approved in the US for acute bipolar depression: two atypical antipsychotics and a combination atypical antipsychotic-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Metabolic, neurologic, and hormonal adverse events are associated with all of the atypical antipsychotics approved for this indication. However, these agents differ in their propensity to cause weight gain or other side effects that significantly impact a patient's physical health and ability to function. The selection of medication, which may also include a mood stabilizer, as well as other forms of treatment, will affect the outcome. It is important to design treatment based on individual needs. Evidence suggests that the collaborative care model, which incorporates individualized systematic treatment, may be more appropriate for the management of bipolar depression than the acute care model.

### Abilify [^1153hJUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia or bipolar mania is unclear. However, the efficacy of aripiprazole in the listed indications could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively). It has moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki = 98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM).

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Abilify activity is presumed to be primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. Dehydro-aripiprazole has affinities for D2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. At steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole is dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozy…

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of augmentation pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for treatment-resistant depression in late life: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116MC9Wn]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Treatment-resistant major depression is common and potentially life-threatening in elderly people, in whom little is known about the benefits and risks of augmentation pharmacotherapy. We aimed to assess whether aripiprazole is associated with a higher probability of remission than is placebo.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three centres in the United States and Canada to test the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole augmentation for adults older than 60 years with treatment-resistant depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score of ≥ 15). Patients who did not achieve remission during a pre-trial with venlafaxine extended-release (150–300 mg/day) were randomly assigned (1:1) to the addition of aripiprazole (target dose 10 mg [maximum 15 mg] daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The computer-generated randomisation was done in blocks and stratified by site. Only the database administrator and research pharmacists had knowledge of treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was remission, defined as a MADRS score of 10 or less (and at least 2 points below the score at the start of the randomised phase) at both of the final two consecutive visits, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00892047.

- **Findings**: From July 20, 2009, to Dec 30, 2013, we recruited 468 eligible participants, 181 (39%) of whom did not remit and were randomly assigned to aripiprazole (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90). A greater proportion of participants in the aripiprazole group achieved remission.

### Aripiprazole augmentation of antidepressants for the treatment of partially responding and nonresponding patients with major depressive disorder [^112ZDo43]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole, a dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, as augmentation of antidepressant treatment in partially responding and nonresponding patients with major depressive disorder, a study was conducted. Fifteen patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder and exhibiting incomplete or no response to eight weeks or more of antidepressant monotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, or bupropion) were treated with aripiprazole augmentation in an eight-week, open-label study. Data collection took place from July 2003 to March 2004.

The mean duration of antidepressant monotherapy at baseline was 43.1 weeks. At baseline, the mean Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale score was 4.3, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score was 18.9. Following the initiation of aripiprazole augmentation, six out of fifteen patients achieved remission (HAM-D score ≤ 7) by week one, and nine out of fifteen patients remitted by week two. All eight completers achieved remission by the study endpoint.

Two patients experienced akathisia and withdrew prematurely, prompting a reduction in the starting dose of aripiprazole from 10 mg/day to 2.5 mg/day. This adjustment resulted in a 50% reduction in attrition due to akathisia; two out of seven withdrew due to akathisia with the 10 mg starting dose, while one out of eight withdrew with the 2.5 mg starting dose. Discontinuation rates after four weeks of treatment were lower for the 2.5 mg starting dose (1/8 patients) compared to the 10 mg starting dose (3/7 patients).

### Aripiprazole versus placebo for schizophrenia [^113uFtp4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

First-generation 'typical' antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, have been the mainstay of treatment until the introduction of second-generation 'atypical' antipsychotics, like risperidone and olanzapine. Both typical and atypical antipsychotics provide treatment responses for most individuals with schizophrenia, either by reducing psychotic episodes or lessening the severity of the illness. However, some individuals do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication. Additionally, atypical and especially typical antipsychotics are associated with serious adverse effects, which may compromise medication compliance and thus increase relapse incidence. This review examines the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo for individuals with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2008), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. An initial search was conducted in May 2007, followed by a second search in August 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo in individuals with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, using a fixed-effect model.

### Aripiprazole augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [^1128j2P9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Due to their favorable side effect profile, atypical antipsychotic agents offer important therapeutic advantages in mood disorders. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic agent with partial dopaminergic and serotonin 1A receptor agonist activity, may be particularly useful when used in conjunction with standard antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in depressed outpatients who had not experienced significant clinical improvement following an adequate trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

- **Method**: Twelve patients (mean ± SD age = 46.6 ± 11.3 years, 66.7% female) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Axis I Disorders, who had failed to experience a clinical response following an adequate trial of an SSRI, were treated with open-label aripiprazole in addition to their SSRI for eight weeks. Clinical response was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in depressive symptoms during the course of the trial (baseline-endpoint), as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score. Data were collected from August 2003 to July 2004.

- **Results**: Nine out of twelve (75.0%) patients completed the trial. Using a completer analysis, five out of nine (55.6%) patients were classified as responders. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis resulted in seven responders (58.3%). The overall proportion of remitters was three out of nine (33.3%) using a completer analysis and five out of twelve (41.7%) using the ITT analysis. Aripiprazole administration appeared safe, with no severe adverse events observed.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177QY5w]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Currently, four SGAs — aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine — have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adjunctive therapies in adults with MDD, while none have been approved as monotherapy.

In clinical practice, however, controversy exists as to the optimal selection of a particular antipsychotic for the treatment of patients with MDD. This is due to differences in SGAs' selectivity for 5-HT receptors and/or their affinity and intrinsic activity regarding D2 receptors, as well as their effects on different brain regions.

Although the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive SGA therapy in treatment-resistant and suboptimally responsive depression have been summarized in previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there has been no comprehensive evaluation of efficacy and safety/tolerability separating the clinically incompatible antipsychotic monotherapy and adjunctive strategies.

Therefore, it is highly important to have a broader view of a wide range of evidence, considering the strengths and weaknesses of each treatment strategy, to thoroughly examine the effectiveness of antipsychotics for MDD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest meta-analysis examining the efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotic treatment for depression both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive brexpiprazole 2 mg in major depressive disorder: A phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with inadequate response to antidepressants [^111EEyWr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of brexpiprazole as adjunctive therapy to antidepressant treatments (ADTs) in adults with major depressive disorder (as defined by DSM-IV-TR criteria) and inadequate response to ADTs, patients with historical inadequate response to 1–3 ADTs were enrolled. All patients entered a prospective 8-week phase on physician-determined, open-label ADT. Those with inadequate response were randomized to ADT + brexpiprazole 2 mg/d or ADT + placebo for 6 weeks. The study was conducted between July 2011 and May 2013.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, and the key secondary endpoint was change from baseline to week 6 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) mean score. The efficacy population comprised all patients who had ≥ 1 dose of study drug in the double-blind phase and both baseline and ≥ 1 post-randomization MADRS scores. The efficacy population per final protocol included patients from the efficacy population who met amended randomization criteria of inadequate response throughout prospective treatment.

Brexpiprazole (n = 175) reduced the mean MADRS total score versus placebo (n = 178) at week 6 in the efficacy population per final protocol (-8.36 vs. -5.15, P = 0.0002). Brexpiprazole improved the SDS mean score versus placebo (-1.35 vs. -0.89, P = 0.0349). The most common treatment-related adverse events were weight gain (brexpiprazole, 8.0%; placebo, 3.1%) and akathisia (7.4% vs. 1.0%).

Adjunctive brexpiprazole therapy appears to be effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder for patients with an inadequate response to ADTs.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^112hJzeK]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). High credibility.

Lu and colleagues performed a series of meta-analyses including single-armed studies on adjunctive aripiprazole (k = 15), single-armed studies on adjunctive dopamine agonists (k = 9), RCTs on adjunctive aripiprazole (k = 12), and RCTs on adjunctive PGD (k = 3). All conducted meta-analyses contained high levels of heterogeneity. Based on their findings, it can be concluded that adjunctive aripiprazole was the augmentation strategy with the best level of evidence, while the effect of PGD on prolactin levels was not significant.

Similar conclusions could be drawn from their network meta-analysis, which also included RCTs on adjunctive metformin (k = 2), adjunctive vitamin B6 (k = 1), adjunctive PGD (k = 5), and adjunctive dopamine agonists (k = 2). Although they found a significant effect of adjunctive vitamin B6, this was based on one study (n = 200) in which only males were included. In another network meta-analysis, they compared different dosing categories of adjunctive aripiprazole and concluded that aripiprazole doses of 5, 10, and > 10 mg/day were similarly effective, while prolactin elevation above 100 ng/ml was only significantly reduced at a dose of 5 mg/day. Aripiprazole at > 10 mg/day was associated with a higher incidence of side effects.

Our search retrieved one additional RCT on this topic. Zhu and colleagues evaluated the effect of metformin addition on amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinemia (n = 86, 47% women). Prolactin levels in the metformin group were significantly lower compared to the placebo group after 8 weeks. This effect was observed in the study.

### Antidepressant response to aripiprazole augmentation associated with enhanced FDOPA utilization in striatum: a preliminary PET study [^114VkvvE]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Several double-blind, prospective trials have demonstrated the antidepressant augmentation efficacy of aripiprazole in depressed patients unresponsive to standard antidepressant therapy. Although aripiprazole is now widely used for this indication and much is known about its receptor-binding properties, the mechanism of its antidepressant augmentation remains ill-defined. In vivo animal studies and in vitro human studies using cloned dopamine D2 receptors suggest that aripiprazole is a partial dopamine agonist. In this preliminary neuroimaging trial, we hypothesized that aripiprazole's antidepressant augmentation efficacy arises from dopamine partial agonist activity.

To test this, we assessed the effects of aripiprazole augmentation on the cerebral utilization of 6-[(18)F]-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (FDOPA) using positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen depressed patients, who had failed 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, underwent FDOPA PET scans before and after aripiprazole augmentation; 11 responded to augmentation. Whole-brain, voxel-wise comparisons of pre- and post-aripiprazole scans revealed increased FDOPA trapping in the right medial caudate of augmentation responders.

An exploratory analysis of depressive symptoms revealed that responders experienced large improvements only in the putatively dopaminergic symptoms of lassitude and inability to feel. These preliminary findings suggest that augmentation of antidepressant response by aripiprazole may be associated with potentiation of dopaminergic activity.

### Optimizing treatment with aripiprazole monohydrate: Pharmacokinetic advantages of long-acting injectable formulations, a consensus panel report [^113WRtoT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (BP-I) are chronic, disabling psychiatric illnesses marked by high morbidity, elevated mortality, and functional deterioration, often exacerbated by poor adherence to oral antipsychotic medications. Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics were developed to address adherence challenges and have demonstrated clinical benefits, including reduced non-adherence and relapse rates, fewer hospitalizations, improved functioning and quality of life, and reduced mortality risk.

Among available LAIs, aripiprazole offers a unique pharmacologic profile as the only partial dopamine agonist available in an LAI formulation. Aripiprazole monohydrate LAI is available as a once-monthly and a once-every-two-month formulation. In this consensus panel report, five psychiatric experts convened to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties, safety, efficacy, and clinical utility of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in the treatment of schizophrenia and BP-I.

The panel focused particularly on the more recently approved once-every-2-month ready-to-use formulation. This article summarizes the evidence reviewed by the panel and highlights key considerations for optimizing the use of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in clinical practice to enhance treatment outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and BP-I.

### Aripiprazole for the treatment of duloxetine-induced hyperprolactinemia: A case report [^116cfwh2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

It is well known that aripiprazole co-treatment effectively reduces antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. However, the effectiveness of aripiprazole for treating high prolactin levels induced by antidepressant drugs with serotonergic activity, such as duloxetine, remains unknown.

- **Case presentation**: An 18-year-old female diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) was treated with 100 mg sertraline once daily. After two weeks, galactorrhoea was observed. Blood biochemical tests revealed an elevated serum prolactin level of 241 ng/mL. Physiological causes and additional potential pathological causes were ruled out. Therefore, sertraline was cross-tapered with mirtazapine. Galactorrhoea ceased, but the side effect of sedation prompted a switch to 40 mg duloxetine twice daily. After two weeks, the patient developed menstrual irregularities and milky discharge concomitant with a serum prolactin level of 205 ng/mL. As a result, duloxetine was decreased to 60 mg once daily, and aripiprazole was initiated at 2.5 mg daily and titrated to 5 mg daily. Two weeks after the initiation of dual therapy, galactorrhoea stopped, and prolactin levels decreased to 118 ng/mL. After eight weeks, prolactin levels decreased to 39 ng/mL, and menstruation returned to normal. After antidepressant therapy finished, prolactin levels normalized to 19 ng/mL.

- **Conclusion**: The case suggests that adjunctive aripiprazole may be useful as a treatment option for duloxetine-induced hyperprolactinemia in MDD.

### Effect of augmentation with aripiprazole or augmentation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation versus switching to the antidepressant venlafaxine extended release/duloxetine on cognition: A comparative effectiveness research trial for antidepressant incomplete and non-responders with treatment-resistant depression (ASCERTAIN-TRD) [^1137t5Rp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Subjective cognitive impairment is a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD). Improving cognitive function in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is an important treatment outcome. This study compared the impact of augmenting antidepressants with aripiprazole or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus switching to venlafaxine (or duloxetine for those not eligible to receive venlafaxine) on cognition in TRD patients.

In a pre-defined secondary analysis of a multi-site, open-label trial, patients with TRD were randomly assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, rTMS augmentation, or switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine in a 1:1:1 ratio, and they were treated for 8 weeks. Cognition was assessed using the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ). A mixed-effects model with repeated measures was conducted.

Among the 258 randomized subjects with at least one post-baseline CPFQ assessment (aripiprazole n = 91; rTMS = 70; venlafaxine XR/duloxetine = 97), neither aripiprazole nor rTMS demonstrated significant differences compared to the venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch group in cognitive outcome as measured by the CPFQ scale (p > 0.025). The mean (SE) change in CPFQ scores from baseline to Week 8 was -8.04 (0.77) for aripiprazole augmentation versus -6.70 (0.75) for venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch, and -8.81 (0.64) for rTMS augmentation versus -6.72 (0.55) for venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch. Hedge's g values were 0.21 for aripiprazole augmentation versus switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine, and 0.33 for rTMS augmentation versus switching.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Utis1]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Antipsychotics are widely used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but there has been no comprehensive meta-analytic assessment that examined their use as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted on randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics for the treatment of adults with MDD. Data of both monotherapy and adjunctive antipsychotic use were extracted, but analyzed separately using a random-effects model. Co-primary outcomes were study-defined treatment response and intolerability-related discontinuation. The risk/benefit balance of antipsychotics for MDD was illustrated using two-dimensional graphs representing the primary efficacy and safety/tolerability outcome. Secondary outcomes included psychopathology, remission, all-cause discontinuation, inefficacy-related discontinuation, and adverse events.

- **Results**: Forty-five RCTs with 12,724 patients were included in the analysis. In monotherapy (studies = 13, n = 4375), amisulpride [1.99 (1.55–2.55)], sulpiride [1.50 (1.03–2.17)], and quetiapine [1.48 (1.23–1.78)] were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response. However, intolerability-related discontinuations were significantly higher compared to placebo with amisulpride and quetiapine. In adjunctive therapy (studies = 32, n = 8349), ziprasidone [1.80 (1.07–3.04)], risperidone [1.59 (1.19–2.14)], aripiprazole [1.54 (1.35–1.76)], brexpiprazole [1.41 (1.21–1.66)], and cariprazine [1.27 (1.07–1.52)] showed significant benefits.

### Efficacy of dose increase among nonresponders to low-dose aripiprazole augmentation in patients with inadequate response to antidepressant treatment: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trial [^116hpqer]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the efficacy of increasing the dose of aripiprazole to 5 mg per day in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) who did not respond to 4 weeks of treatment with aripiprazole 2 mg per day in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent study.

Method: 221 subjects with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition-diagnosed DSM-IV-TR MDD (mean ± SD age, 45 ± 11 years; 64% women) with inadequate antidepressant response were recruited from September 2008 to July 2009. They were randomized to 60 days of double-blind augmentation with either aripiprazole or placebo in two 30-day phases. The study was performed across 8 academic hospital sites and 14 nonacademic (private clinic) sites throughout the United States. Randomization followed a 2:3:3 ratio per sequential parallel comparison design: drug/drug (aripiprazole 2 mg/d in phase 1 and 5 mg/d in phase 2), placebo/placebo (placebo in both phases), and placebo/drug (placebo in phase 1 and aripiprazole 2 mg/d in phase 2). In phase 2, the efficacy of an aripiprazole dose increase to 5 mg/d in nonresponders to 2 mg/d was assessed by examining response rates (≥ 50% reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score [primary outcome measure]) and score changes in MADRS, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales, and patient-rated versions of the CGI-I and CGI-S scales.

Results indicated that the response rate for aripiprazole 2 mg/d in phase 1 was 18.5%.

Overall, antipsychotics were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response (N = 28, n = 7366, RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.26–1.45, p < 0.001; NNT = 12, 95% CI 9–16).

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Individually, ziprasidone (N = 2, n = 199, RR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.07–3.04, p = 0.028; NNT = 7, 95% CI 3–83), risperidone (N = 2, n = 313, RR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.19–2.14, p = 0.002; NNT = 6, 95% CI 3–18), aripiprazole (N = 8, n = 2416, RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.35–1.76, p < 0.001; NNT = 9, 95% CI 6–13), brexpiprazole (N = 6, n = 2167, RR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.21–1.66, p < 0.001; NNT = 14, 95% CI 9–27), cariprazine (N = 1, n = 808, RR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.07–1.52, p = 0.007; NNT = 10, 95% CI 6–31), and quetiapine (N = 6, n = 1339, RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.08–1.41, p = 0.002; NNT = 15, 95% CI 9–42) were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response.

Conversely, iloperidone (N = 1, n = 26, RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.44–2.29, p = 1.000), olanzapine (N = 1, n = 20, RR = 2.00, 95% CI 0.88–4.54, p = 0.098), perphenazine (N = 1, n = 30, RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.53–2.45, p = 0.732), and thioridazine (N = 1, n = 78, RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.74–1.22, p = 0.696) did not significantly separate from placebo.

### The acute efficacy of aripiprazole across the symptom spectrum of schizophrenia: a pooled post hoc analysis from 5 short-term studies [^115KVKjB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole across various symptoms, including positive, negative, disorganized thought, depression/anxiety, and hostility, in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Pooled data were analyzed from five short-term, double-blind, multicenter studies published between 1997 and 2007. These studies involved patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (five studies) or schizoaffective disorder (two studies), who were randomly assigned to receive aripiprazole (N = 875), haloperidol (N = 193), risperidone (N = 95), or placebo (N = 406). Aripiprazole doses ranged from 2 to 30 mg/day, but patients on the ineffective 2 mg dose were excluded from the primary analyses.

Factor analysis of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) data was used to evaluate changes from baseline with aripiprazole on five symptom factors: positive, negative, disorganized thought, depression/anxiety, and hostility, in two population subsets: schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Pairwise comparisons included aripiprazole versus placebo in all five schizophrenia studies; aripiprazole, haloperidol, and placebo in three studies; and aripiprazole, risperidone, and placebo in one study. Patients with schizoaffective disorder in two studies were included in the comparison of aripiprazole and placebo.

Results indicated that aripiprazole was significantly more effective than placebo in improving all five PANSS factor scores from baseline (each p < .001) in the schizophrenia dataset. In schizoaffective disorder, aripiprazole also demonstrated significant superiority over placebo for the improvement of symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iAL9D]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, the results of this, to our knowledge, currently largest meta-analysis of antipsychotic treatment for MDD suggest that antipsychotics were efficacious for MDD both as monotherapy and adjunctively. However, caution is needed, as the risks for intolerability-related discontinuations were higher than with a placebo and generally higher than the effect sizes for efficacy. Nevertheless, the risk/benefit balance of antipsychotics varied by specific antipsychotic and their dose, with a favorable risk/benefit ratio in monotherapy for sulpiride and adjunctively for low-dose risperidone. These results should inform clinical use regarding the role of antipsychotics in the management of MDD.

Although this is another important potential consideration, a PK/PD study of aripiprazole in healthy volunteers found that exposure (area under the curve over 24 hours) following 8 days of aripiprazole at 10 mg daily was within 10% of exposure at 14 days. In our study, antipsychotic levels were collected as close as possible to outcome data, with the maximum interval of a few hours, making it unlikely that plasma level fluctuations influenced the results, considering the 94-hour half-life of aripiprazole and its active metabolite. Additionally, the mean plasma aripiprazole concentration in our study corresponds to that associated with approximately 80% striatal D2/D3 occupancy. For these reasons, we think it is unlikely that an inadequate dose or duration of aripiprazole treatment explains the drug differences, although future studies could test this further. Finally, all previous double-blind investigations of the effects of antipsychotics on reward function in healthy volunteers have used only single doses, whereas our study more closely mimics the clinical use of antipsychotics by investigating repeated administration.

Our finding that amisulpride induced negative symptoms may seem surprising, as there is some evidence that low dose (50–300 mg) amisulpride is effective as a treatment for negative symptoms in schizophrenia. This has been hypothesized to relate to lower doses binding to presynaptic auto-receptors to enhance dopamine transmission.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115R4moh]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a priori-defined subgroup and meta-regression analyses for the co-primary outcomes, seeking to identify potential moderators, mediators, methodological biases, and whether the findings extended to clinically relevant sub-populations and treatment groups. The subgroup characteristics were:

- **Sponsorship**: Industry/academia.
- **Country and location**: International, USA, Europe, Asia, rest of the world.
- **Publication year**: 1999 or earlier, 2000–2009, 2010 or later.
- **Antipsychotic drug category**: First-generation antipsychotic (FGA), second-generation antipsychotics (SGA).
- **Study quality**: High risk of bias - yes/no.
- **Concealment**: Open/single-blinded, double-blinded.
- **Psychotic depression**: Including/excluding patients with psychotic depression.
- **Antipsychotic dose**: Using five dose groups based on the daily prescribed dose divided by defined daily dose (DDD) as per WHO methodology - 0 to ≤ 0.25 daily dose ratio; 0.25 to ≤ 0.5 daily dose ratio, 0.5 to ≤ 0.75 daily dose ratio, 0.75 to < 1 daily dose ratio; ⩾1.0 daily dose ratio.

The moderator or mediator variables were:

- **Age**.
- **Percent males**.
- **Percent Caucasian**.
- **Publication year**.
- **Sample size**.
- **Trial duration**.
- **Illness duration**.
- **Number of lifetime depressive episodes**.
- **Number of depressive episodes in the past year**.

Risk of bias was evaluated in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, using the following parameters: adequacy of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selection bias.

### Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (BeSt InTro): a pragmatic, rater-blind, semi-randomised trial [^111fT88G]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine are first-line atypical antipsychotics that have not previously been compared head-to-head in a pragmatic trial. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of these agents in a controlled trial.

- **Methods**: This pragmatic, rater-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in three academic centres of psychiatry in Norway and one in Austria. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (F20–29), and exhibited symptoms of active psychosis. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive oral amisulpride, aripiprazole, or olanzapine. Treatment allocation was open to patients and staff, and decisions regarding starting dose, treatment changes, and adjustments were left to the discretion of the treating physician. Computer-generated randomisation lists for each study centre were prepared by independent statisticians. Patients were followed up for 52 weeks after random assignment, during which assessments were conducted eight times by researchers masked to treatment. The primary outcome was the reduction of the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 52 weeks, and primary analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446328.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 20, 2011, and Dec 30, 2016, we assessed 359 patients for eligibility. A total of 215 patients were excluded (107 did not meet inclusion criteria, 82 declined to participate, and 26 for other reasons). Overall, 144 patients (mean baseline PANSS total estimated score 78.4 [SD 1.4]) were randomly assigned.

### Symptomatic and functional outcomes and early prediction of response to escitalopram monotherapy and sequential adjunctive aripiprazole therapy in patients with major depressive disorder: A CAN-BIND-1 report [^1151euJr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to report the symptomatic and functional outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) during a two-phase treatment trial. It also aimed to estimate the value of early improvement after two weeks in predicting clinical response to escitalopram and subsequently to adjunctive treatment with aripiprazole.

- **Methods**: Participants with MDD (N = 211), identified with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and confirmed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, were recruited from six outpatient centers across Canada between August 2013 and December 2016. They were treated with open-label escitalopram (10–20 mg) for eight weeks (Phase 1). Clinical and functional outcomes were evaluated using the MADRS, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Rated (QIDS-SR), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and Lam Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS). Participants were evaluated at eight and 16 weeks for clinical and functional response and remission. Phase 1 responders continued with escitalopram, while nonresponders received adjunctive aripiprazole (2–10 mg) for a further eight weeks (Phase 2).

- **Results**: After Phase 1, the MADRS response (≥ 50% decrease from baseline) and remission (score ≤ 10) were achieved by 47% and 31% of participants, respectively. The SDS response (score ≤ 12) and remission (score ≤ 6) were achieved by 53% and 24%, respectively. Response to escitalopram was maintained in 91% of participants at week 16. In Phase 2, 61% of the adjunctive aripiprazole group achieved a MADRS response. Response and remission rates with the QIDS-SR were lower than with the MADRS. The LEAPS demonstrated…

### Safety and efficacy of adjunctive second-generation antidepressant therapy with a mood stabiliser or an atypical antipsychotic in acute bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials [^115kt8Ce]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Although mania and hypomania define bipolar disorder, depressive episodes are more common and impairing, with few proven treatments. Adjunctive therapy with second-generation antidepressants is widely used to treat acute bipolar depression, but their efficacy and safety remain controversial.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to Jan 31, 2016, for randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of second-generation antidepressants adjunctive to a mood stabiliser or an antipsychotic in patients with acute bipolar depression. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was change in clinician-rated depressive symptom score; secondary outcomes were clinical response, clinical remission, treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, and tolerability (using dropout rates as a proxy). We used pooled random-effects models, subgroup comparisons, and meta-regression for analyses. We made subgroup comparisons based on mood stabiliser or antipsychotic treatment and conducted meta-regression examining trial duration.

- **Findings**: We identified six trials representing 1383 patients with bipolar depression. Second-generation antidepressants were associated with a small but significant improvement in clinician-rated depressive symptom score (standardised mean differences 0.165 [95% CI 0.051–0.278], p = 0.004). However, clinical response and remission rates did not…

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113o7wJc]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, up to 17% of adults are prescribed antidepressants, and up to 2% are prescribed antipsychotics. Rates of prescribing these medications are increasing year on year. Although antipsychotics and antidepressants are effective treatments for some patients, approximately 75% of patients experience side-effects. These side-effects are diverse and can impair quality of life and functioning, contribute to morbidity and mortality rates, create stigma, and result in poor medication concordance, thus increasing the risk of relapse of psychiatric illness.

Side-effects are significant factors that individuals with depression and schizophrenia consider when making prescription decisions, and concerns about side-effects represent a barrier to the treatment of mental illness. National and professional bodies recommend that discussions about side-effects are central to antipsychotic and antidepressant prescribing decisions. However, simultaneously considering the relative side-effect profile for every available antidepressant and antipsychotic is a complex, multidimensional process. For example, a discussion regarding which of 20 antidepressants to select based on the relative risk of ten side-effects involves 1900 pairwise comparisons; spending 10 seconds on each comparison would require over five hours of discussion. This process is further complicated by the fact that the avoidance of certain side-effects will be important to one patient but not to another, meaning that, at an individual level, greater consideration needs to be given to avoiding specific side-effects.

### Abilify asimtufii [^114MfiZx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is unknown. The efficacy of aripiprazole could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 (Kis 0.34 and 0.8 nM, respectively), and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors (Kis 1.7 and 3.4 nM, respectively). It shows moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors (Kis of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki = 98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM). Actions at receptors other than D2, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A could explain some of the other adverse reactions of aripiprazole; for example, the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha1 receptors.

ABILIFY ASIMTUFII activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors.

### Are antipsychotics or antidepressants needed for psychotic depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy with combination treatment [^112RLeei]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

To perform a meta-analysis of antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy for psychotic depression, we conducted the following:

- **Data sources**: We performed an electronic search from the inception of databases until February 28, 2011, in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO without language or time restrictions. The search terms included (psychosis OR psychotic OR hallucinations OR hallucinating OR delusions OR delusional) AND (depression OR depressed OR major depressive disorder) AND (random OR randomized OR randomly).

- **Study selection**: Eight randomized, placebo-controlled acute-phase studies in adults (N = 762) with standardized criteria-defined psychotic depression (including Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-IV, or ICD-10) were meta-analyzed, yielding 10 comparisons. Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment was compared in 5 trials with 6 treatment arms (n = 337) with antidepressant monotherapy and in 4 trials with 4 treatment arms (n = 447) with antipsychotic monotherapy.

- **Data extraction**: The primary outcome was study-defined inefficacy; secondary outcomes included all-cause discontinuation, specific psychopathology ratings, and side effects. Using random effects models, we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), number-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/NNH), and effect size (ES).

- **Results**: Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment outperformed antidepressant monotherapy regarding less study-defined inefficacy, with 6 comparisons (n = 378; RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.98; p = 0.03; heterogeneity [I²] = 34%) and NNT = 7.

### Aripiprazole for schizophrenia [^111Gq2oc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of people with schizophrenia using older typical antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, can be problematic. Many patients fail to respond to these older antipsychotics, and more people experience disabling adverse effects. Aripiprazole is said to be part of a new generation of atypical antipsychotics with promising antipsychotic properties and minimal adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (September 2005), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. Additionally, we contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, and authors of trials for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: All clinical randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical, or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

- **Main results**: Despite the fact that 7,110 people participated in fifteen randomized aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behavior, and engagement with services.

### Use of antipsychotics in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [^117HPwgg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of aripiprazole as the first antipsychotic to be used as an adjunct to antidepressant medications in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), information on the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of MDD has not been widely available.

- **Method**: Records of antipsychotic prescriptions for all U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs patients diagnosed with MDD (ICD-9 criteria), excluding those with comorbid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, in the fiscal year 2007 (N = 191,522) were examined. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to identify veterans' characteristics, measures of service use, and medical center characteristics that were associated with receipt of these medications and, among such users, with use of the lower doses suggested for MDD.

- **Results**: Altogether, 20.6% of veterans with MDD received antipsychotic medications, and 43% of those who did received them at the higher doses recommended for schizophrenia. GEE models showed that younger age, male gender, psychiatric comorbidities, duration of diagnosed MDD, and more intensive mental health service use were all associated with a greater likelihood of receiving antipsychotics and with less likelihood of receiving them at conventional antipsychotic doses.

- **Conclusion**: Antipsychotic medications were commonly used in the treatment of MDD prior to FDA approval, especially in the presence of comorbid mental illness and longer-term MDD. Further research is needed to evaluate the implications of these findings.

### Aripiprazole in major depression and mania: Meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^1117Uo8p]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

We performed meta-analyses to obtain pooled estimates from controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of aripiprazole in major depressive disorder and the manic phase of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: A search was performed in Medline/PubMed using "aripiprazole" AND "depressive disorder" and "aripiprazole" AND "bipolar disorder" as keywords, and "randomized controlled trial" as a limit. The last search was performed by April 30, 2009. References in the selected articles were revised to identify other studies. We selected four placebo-controlled clinical trials on aripiprazole's effect on major depression and three on aripiprazole's effect on bipolar disorder. Studies conducted in patients with comorbidity or aimed at measuring the effect of aripiprazole for maintenance therapy were excluded. We extracted, in duplicate, data on the number of patients, withdrawals, changes in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), response and remission rates, and side effects.

- **Results**: Aripiprazole is effective in increasing response rates in depressive patients (response rate in the aripiprazole group minus response rate in the placebo group: 7.7%, 95% CI: 1.5–14.2) and manic patients (difference in response rates: 15.7%, 95% CI: 9.7–21.8). It also improves scores by 3 points in YMRS. Evidence of improving remission rates is unavailable. Some side effects were more frequent in patients taking aripiprazole, notably akathisia in depressive trials (rate difference: 20.3%, 95% CI: 16.9–23.7) and nausea in manic patients.

### Dopamine system stabilizers, aripiprazole, and the next generation of antipsychotics, part 1, "Goldilocks" actions at dopamine receptors [^1133VZdg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Dopamine system stabilizers are a potential new class of antipsychotic agents that do not cause motor side effects. All known effective antipsychotics exert their effects at D2 receptors. A novel concept for developing antipsychotics without motor side effects is to stabilize these receptors rather than blocking them harshly.

### Aripiprazole augmentation for treatment of patients with inadequate antidepressants response [^111me6Yf]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether augmentation with aripiprazole is beneficial and tolerable for patients with an inadequate response to antidepressants (ADs). Thirteen patients with nonpsychotic major depression, who had failed to respond to an adequate trial of at least one AD, were prescribed aripiprazole (dose, 5–30 mg) for 8 weeks. The dose of their preexisting ADs was not changed. The treatment response was defined as the mean changes in the scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from baseline to the end of treatment. Eleven (84.6%) patients returned for at least one follow-up visit, and seven (53.8%) patients completed the study. The HAM-D and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased significantly from the baseline to the end of treatment by 53.8% and 56.0%, respectively (Z = -2.937, P = 0.003; Z = -2.961, P = 0.003). Seven (63.6%) patients showed a ≥ 50% reduction in the HAM-D score at the end of treatment. Three (27.3%) patients met the remission criteria at the end of treatment. There were no serious side effects. Despite the high dropout rate in this open study, aripiprazole appears to be reasonably effective and tolerated as an augmentation strategy in conjunction with conventional AD treatment in patients with an inadequate AD response. These results highlight the potential benefits of aripiprazole for these patients; however, adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.

### Efficacy of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder with somatic symptoms: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with clinical and electroencephalography evidence [^112BkRpj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Somatic symptoms, which are common in major depressive disorder (MDD), are associated with a worse prognosis and increased health costs.

- **Aims**: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of aripiprazole augmentation in MDD patients with somatic symptoms.

- **Methods**: A total of 41 MDD patients with somatic symptoms completed the study. Participants who had been on a stable dose of antidepressants for at least one month were randomly assigned to receive an 8-week adjunctive treatment with either aripiprazole or placebo. The initiation dose of aripiprazole was 2 mg/day, which was later adjusted to 1–10 mg/day. The primary endpoint was the change in the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised-Somatization (SCL-90-R-SOM) score. Quantitative electroencephalogram data were collected, and spectral analyses were performed to obtain the absolute power of frequency bands.

- **Results/Outcomes**: The aripiprazole group (n = 20; 2.98 ± 1.75 mg/day) showed a significant improvement in SCL-90-R-SOM scores compared to the placebo group (n = 21; F = 8.56, p = 0.006), without significant differences in changes in depression and anxiety symptoms. Compared to the control, the aripiprazole group showed a greater decrease in total alpha power (F = 7.03, p = 0.01). Changes in frontal alpha power were positively correlated with changes in SCL-90-R-SOM scores in the aripiprazole group (r = 0.53, p = 0.014).

- **Conclusions/Interpretation**: Aripiprazole adjunctive to antidepressants in patients with MDD and somatic symptoms improved somatic symptom severity without significant safety concerns.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^115jpSYm]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: Although clinical guidelines stipulate the need for discussion between clinician and patient about antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects before making prescription decisions, they do not specify how this complex, multidimensional process should be done. We searched PubMed for studies that provide an evidence-based synthesis of the relative risk or magnitude of antidepressant or antipsychotic side-effects using data from randomised controlled trials, with the search terms "(antipsychotic OR antidepressant) AND side effect", filtering for systematic review. We then searched PubMed from database inception up to January 28, 2023, with no language restrictions, for studies describing a digital tool that facilitates antidepressant or antipsychotic prescriptions in people with depression or schizophrenia by considering all side-effects of all treatments while also incorporating individual patient concerns, with the search terms "(antipsychotic OR antidepressant OR depression OR schizophrenia) AND side effect AND digital tool". Of the 737 studies retrieved, 14 provided meta-analytic data for antipsychotic or antidepressant side-effects. However, these studies were limited by either focusing on a restricted range of side-effects or a limited number of drugs. Thus, no studies were identified that have provided clinicians with a comprehensive, evidence-based synthesis of antidepressant or antipsychotic side-effects. Furthermore, no studies were identified describing a digital application to facilitate antidepressant or antipsychotic prescribing by considering all side-effects and individual patient concerns.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113tkMBT]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Our search included the following databases from their inception to January 8, 2016, with no language restrictions: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, AMED, the UK National Research Register, and PSYNDEX. The search terms used were "depress" OR "dysthymi" OR "adjustment disorder" OR "mood disorder" OR "affective disorder" OR "affective symptoms" combined with a list of all included antidepressants.

We included double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants with placebo or another active antidepressant as oral monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults (≥ 18 years old and of both sexes) with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10). Only double-blind trials were considered due to their inclusion of placebo in the network meta-analysis, enhancing methodological rigour by reducing performance and ascertainment biases. We included all second-generation antidepressants approved by regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe, or Japan:

- **Melatonergic antidepressant**: agomelatine
- **Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor**: bupropion
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline
- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, venlafaxine
- **Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA)**: mirtazapine
- **Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor**: reboxetine
- **Serotonin modulator and stimulant**: vilazodone
- **Serotonin receptor agonist and reuptake inhibitor**: vortioxetine

### Comparative effectiveness research trial for antidepressant incomplete and nonresponders with treatment resistant depression (ASCERTAIN-TRD): Effect of aripiprazole or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation augmentation versus switching to the antidepressant venlafaxine on quality of life [^117JdgWQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to compare the effects of augmenting antidepressants with aripiprazole or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine on quality of life (QoL) among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In a predefined secondary analysis of a multisite, open-label, effectiveness trial, patients with TRD were randomly assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, rTMS augmentation, or switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine in a 1:1:1 ratio, and they were treated for 8 weeks. TRD was defined as an inadequate response to two or more antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration, as indicated by the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire. QoL was predefined as a key secondary endpoint and was assessed using the short form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF). A mixed-effects model with repeated measures was applied, and the study was conducted from July 13, 2017, to December 22, 2021.

Among 258 randomized participants with at least one postbaseline Q-LES-Q-SF measurement, augmentation with aripiprazole demonstrated statistically significant superiority over switching on the Q-LES-Q-SF (P = 0.002), while rTMS did not (P = 0.326). At endpoint, changes from baseline in the Q-LES-Q-SF scores were as follows: 10.61 (SE = 1.0) for aripiprazole augmentation, 11.59 (SE = 1.1) for rTMS augmentation, and 8.68 (SE = 0.9) for the venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch. Augmentation with aripiprazole, but not rTMS, improved QoL significantly.

### Analysis of suicidality in pooled data from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled aripiprazole adjunctive therapy trials in major depressive disorder [^111orq76]. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of adjunctive aripiprazole versus adjunctive placebo treatment on suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder, data were pooled from two identical aripiprazole augmentation studies. Patients with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed major depressive disorder, who had an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant treatment, were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole (2–20 mg/d) treatment for 6 weeks. Adverse events related to suicidality were identified in the adverse event database using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities-preferred term. Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was defined using item 10 (suicidality) of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and item 18 (suicidality) of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS).

In total, 737 patients were included in the safety database (aripiprazole n = 371; placebo n = 366). No suicides were reported. There were no treatment-emergent, suicide-related adverse events in the aripiprazole group; however, 2 patients in the placebo group experienced ≥ 1 adverse event related to suicide (both cases were suicidal ideation). More placebo than aripiprazole patients over 25 years old experienced a 2-point (P < .01) or 1-point (P < .05) worsening of MADRS item 10 scores. For this age group, a 2-point improvement in MADRS item 10 scores and a 1-point improvement of IDS item 18 scores were significantly more common in aripiprazole patients compared to placebo patients (both P < .05).

This post hoc analysis demonstrated that adjunctive aripiprazole was associated with a favorable safety profile in terms of suicidality outcomes compared to placebo in patients with major depressive disorder.
