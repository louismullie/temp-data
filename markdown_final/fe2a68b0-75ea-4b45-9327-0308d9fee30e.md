## Question

What did guidelines say about treatment of chronic hypocalcemia in primary hypoparathyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic hypocalcemia in primary hypoparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the clinical context and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and dosing principles. Next, I will review therapeutic targets and monitoring cadence. After that, I need to check when to escalate to PTH replacement and what the evidence shows. Finally, I should consider special populations, quality gaps, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and diagnostic anchors so I don't jump to conclusions: chronic hypoparathyroidism is defined by persistent hypocalcemia with inappropriately low or undetectable PTH beyond 6–12 months after surgery or due to nonsurgical causes, with hyperphosphatemia and hypercalciuria as key pathophysiologic consequences, and most cases are postsurgical, which frames both prognosis and management expectations [^114bvFbt] [^113XxZ3x] [^115RQKfJ].

> I need to verify the first-line therapy consensus before discussing targets: multiple international guidelines converge on conventional therapy with oral calcium salts and active vitamin D analogues (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) as initial management, typically in divided doses to improve absorption and titration flexibility, with the strength of recommendation graded as weak due to low-quality evidence but reflecting broad expert consensus [^114bvFbt] [^113XxZ3x] [^114nyQnc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing. I should confirm practical ranges and formulation choices: typical elemental calcium totals range from about 1,000–3,500 mg/day in divided doses, and calcitriol is commonly dosed at 0.25–0.5 mcg twice daily, with dose adjustments guided by frequent calcium checks early on. Calcium citrate is preferred over carbonate in achlorhydria or with PPI use, and thiazides can be added to reduce urinary calcium excretion when hypercalciuria emerges, though I should double-check that thiazide use is adjunctive rather than routine [^115H3AwN] [^115DAeFG] [^112YeFM1].

> Next, I should review therapeutic targets and make sure I'm precise: serum calcium is generally targeted to the low-normal range or just below normal to mitigate hypercalciuria, often cited as 8.0–9.0 mg/dL (2.0–2.25 mmol/L) in trials and practice statements, while serum phosphate is aimed at the normal range and the calcium–phosphate product is kept below about 55 mg²/dL². 24-hour urinary calcium is commonly targeted below roughly 7.5 mmol/day in men and 6.25 mmol/day in women to reduce nephrolithiasis risk, and I should confirm that these thresholds are consistent across sources before applying them rigidly [^1123D52X] [^113uTUT8] [^115H3AwN] [^112f9ZBx].

> Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence because undertesting is a frequent pitfall: during active titration, calcium should be checked frequently (weekly to monthly), then once stable, routine labs every 3–6 months for albumin-adjusted calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine/eGFR, and symptom review. 24-hour urinary calcium and renal imaging are suggested annually or if stones or rising creatinine occur, and I should emphasize that magnesium repletion is essential since hypomagnesemia impairs PTH secretion and action [^115abRXW] [^1113mTDi] [^112SGMJi] [^115DAeFG].

> I will now examine when to escalate beyond conventional therapy, and I need to ensure I align with guideline triggers: indications include persistent symptomatic hypocalcemia despite optimized calcium/active D, hypercalciuria with nephrolithiasis or declining eGFR, hyperphosphatemia with elevated calcium–phosphate product, high pill burden or intolerance, and impaired quality of life. Importantly, guidelines suggest PTH replacement rather than mandate it, reflecting low-to-moderate certainty evidence and the need to individualize risk–benefit [^114bvFbt] [^113XxZ3x] [^113L92Lm].

> Let me consider the PTH options and their evidence base so I don't overstate claims: rhPTH(1–84) is FDA-approved as adjunctive therapy for patients not well controlled on calcium and active vitamin D, with REPLACE showing many patients reducing or discontinuing conventional therapy. Teriparatide (PTH 1–34) is used off-label and requires multiple daily injections. Palopegteriparatide, a long-acting PTH analog with a ~60-hour half-life, has shown sustained improvements in serum calcium, phosphate, urinary calcium, and quality of life in phase 3 trials and is now approved in the US and EU. Meta-analyses suggest PTH therapy achieves modest QoL gains, substantial reductions in calcium and active vitamin D needs, and favorable effects on phosphate and urinary calcium, albeit with a small increase in hypercalcemia risk that mandates close monitoring [^113a2EEe] [^114nyQnc] [^112CXA3p] [^1139ue7Q] [^113L92Lm].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has malabsorption? I should double-check special populations: in pregnancy and lactation, calcium and active vitamin D require careful titration to keep calcium in the mid-to-low normal range to avoid maternal and fetal complications, with closer monitoring. After bariatric surgery or in malabsorption, liquid calcium or calcium citrate may be better absorbed. In renal impairment, hypercalciuria risk is higher, so tighter urinary calcium targets and judicious use of thiazides are reasonable, and I need to ensure magnesium and vitamin D status are optimized in all scenarios [^113XxZ3x] [^115XJ4tn] [^112f9ZBx] [^115DAeFG].

> I should confirm real-world quality gaps to contextualize implementation: UK audits show high adherence to avoiding routine PTH use but poor performance on magnesium monitoring, 24-hour urine calcium, and renal imaging when indicated, with nontrivial hospitalization rates, underscoring the need for standardized monitoring and education. This aligns with broader observations that despite guideline availability, care fragmentation and undermonitoring persist [^1113mTDi] [^111Ay2cP] [^113y8B5j].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step: confirm chronic hypoparathyroidism with low or inappropriately normal PTH and hypocalcemia beyond 6–12 months. Initiate calcium and active vitamin D with divided dosing, correct magnesium and vitamin D deficiency, and titrate to low-normal calcium while avoiding hypercalciuria. Monitor frequently early, then every 3–6 months for calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine/eGFR, and symptoms. Add thiazide if hypercalciuria persists. If targets are not met or QoL remains impaired, consider PTH replacement with rhPTH(1–84) or palopegteriparatide, with shared decision-making about injection burden, monitoring, and safety. Throughout, counsel on adherence, symptom recognition, and when to seek urgent care [^114bvFbt] [^113XxZ3x] [^115abRXW] [^112CXA3p].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that PTH replacement is "standard of care" for all. I should correct that to align with guidelines: conventional therapy remains first-line for most, and PTH replacement is a targeted strategy for refractory cases or when the limitations of high-dose calcium/active D outweigh benefits, supported by moderate-certainty evidence for biochemical and QoL improvements but still requiring vigilant monitoring for hypercalcemia and long-term safety [^114bvFbt] [^113XxZ3x] [^112CXA3p].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is crisp and actionable: treat chronic hypocalcemia in primary hypoparathyroidism with calcium plus active vitamin D as foundation, titrate to low-normal calcium while guarding against hypercalciuria, monitor comprehensively and regularly, and escalate to PTH replacement when conventional therapy fails or causes unacceptable complications, tailoring choices to patient context and evolving evidence [^114bvFbt] [^113XxZ3x] [^113L92Lm].

Guidelines recommend **calcium plus active vitamin D as first-line therapy** [^114bvFbt] for chronic hypocalcemia in primary hypoparathyroidism, targeting serum calcium in the low-normal range [^113XxZ3x] to balance symptoms and renal risk [^113cWXtT]. PTH replacement (rhPTH 1–84 or palopegteriparatide) is reserved for patients who are **inadequately controlled** [^113XxZ3x] or cannot tolerate conventional therapy due to hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, or persistent symptoms [^113cWXtT]. Routine PTH therapy is not recommended [^115abRXW] because of long-term safety concerns and the need for ongoing monitoring [^113a2EEe]. Regular monitoring of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, renal function, and 24-hour urine calcium is essential to guide therapy and prevent complications [^115abRXW] [^112SGMJi].

---

## First-line therapy: calcium and active vitamin D

- **Calcium supplementation**: Oral calcium salts (e.g. calcium carbonate or calcium citrate) are the cornerstone of therapy, typically administered in divided doses to maintain serum calcium within the low-normal range [^115H3AwN].

- **Active vitamin D analogues**: Calcitriol or alfacalcidol are essential to enhance intestinal calcium absorption and compensate for the lack of PTH-mediated renal 1α-hydroxylation [^111voJp3].

- **Target calcium levels**: Serum calcium should be maintained at the lower end of normal or slightly below normal (typically 8.0–9.0 mg/dL or 2.0–2.25 mmol/L) to minimize hypercalciuria and renal complications [^1123D52X] [^113cWXtT].

---

## Limitations of conventional therapy

Conventional therapy, while effective in controlling hypocalcemia, has several limitations:

- **Hypercalciuria and renal complications**: Chronic use of calcium and active vitamin D can lead to hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and renal impairment [^114tFU9o] [^111D1eWB].

- **Fluctuating calcium levels**: Patients often experience wide fluctuations in serum calcium, leading to intermittent hypocalcemic symptoms [^113XxZ3x] [^113L92Lm].

- **High pill burden and adherence**: Multiple daily doses of calcium and vitamin D can reduce adherence and quality of life [^113XxZ3x] [^113uTUT8].

---

## Second-line therapy: parathyroid hormone replacement

For patients inadequately controlled with conventional therapy, **parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement** is recommended:

- **Indications**: Persistent hypocalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, or intolerance to high doses of calcium and vitamin D [^113cWXtT].

- **Available formulations**: Recombinant human PTH (rhPTH 1–84, Natpara) and long-acting PTH analogues (e.g. palopegteriparatide) have been shown to normalize serum calcium, reduce urinary calcium excretion, and improve quality of life [^1139ue7Q] [^113L92Lm].

- **Limitations**: Potential risks include hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia upon withdrawal, and long-term safety concerns such as osteosarcoma risk observed in animal studies. Regular monitoring and careful titration are essential [^112CXA3p] [^113a2EEe] [^114bvFbt].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular monitoring is critical to ensure **therapeutic efficacy** and prevent complications:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum calcium | Every 3–6 months | Adjust calcium and vitamin D doses to maintain target calcium levels [^115abRXW] |
| Serum phosphate | Every 3–6 months | Monitor for hyperphosphatemia and adjust therapy accordingly [^1113mTDi] |
| Serum magnesium | Every 3–6 months | Correct hypomagnesemia to improve calcium responsiveness [^111Ay2cP] |
| Renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR) | Every 3–6 months | Detect early renal impairment due to hypercalciuria [^115abRXW] |
| 24-hour urinary calcium excretion | Annually or as indicated | Monitor for hypercalciuria and adjust therapy to prevent nephrolithiasis [^1113mTDi] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Calcium and active vitamin D require careful adjustment to prevent maternal and fetal complications. PTH replacement therapy is generally avoided during pregnancy due to limited safety data [^113XxZ3x].

- **Pediatric patients**: Growth and developmental considerations necessitate careful monitoring and dose adjustments to avoid both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia [^notfound].

- **Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH)**: PTH replacement is contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis [^1133Scow].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Calcium supplementation plus active vitamin D analogues to maintain serum calcium at the lower end of normal [^114bvFbt].

- **Second-line therapy**: PTH replacement (rhPTH 1–84 or palopegteriparatide) for patients inadequately controlled or intolerant to conventional therapy [^113XxZ3x].

- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium, renal function, and urinary calcium excretion to guide therapy and prevent complications [^115abRXW].

- **Individualized care**: Therapy should be tailored based on patient-specific factors, including age, comorbidities, and response to treatment [^113XxZ3x].

---

Guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**, starting with calcium and active vitamin D, then adding PTH replacement if needed, with regular monitoring to balance symptom control against renal complications [^114bvFbt].

Abstract

Objectives

Individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism may experience suboptimal medical care with high frequency of unplanned hospitalisation and iatrogenic harm. In 2015 the European Society for Endocrinology published consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism. We set out to audit compliance with these guidelines.

Methods

Using these recommendations as audit standards we worked with the Society for Endocrinology and Parathyroid UK to conduct a national audit of management of chronic hypoparathyroidism in the United Kingdom. Endocrine leads in 117 endocrine departments were invited to participate in the survey by completing a data collection tool on up to 5 sequential cases of chronic hypoparathyroidism seen in their outpatient clinics in the preceding 12 months. Data were collected on 4 treatment standards and 9 monitoring standards. Data on hospitalisations and Quality of Life monitoring were also collected.

Results

Responses were received from 22 departments giving a response rate of 19%, concerning 80 individual cases. The mean age of subjects was 48.4 years. The main findings were that the commonest cause of hypoparathyroidism was post surgical (66.3%). Treatments taken by the group included activated vitamin D analogues (96.3%), oral calcium salts (66.3%), vitamin D supplements (17.5%), thiazide diuretics (5%) and rhPTH 1–34 (1.3%). Compliance with the audit standards varied between 98.8% and 60% for the treatment standards and between 91.3% and 20% for the monitoring standards. Some of the areas of weakness revealed include low rates of 24 h urinary calcium excretion monitoring, serum magnesium monitoring and low rates of renal imaging where indicated. In addition and importantly, 16.3% of subjects had experienced at least one hospital admission in the preceding 12 months.

Conclusion

We conclude that further improvements in the UK national standard of management of chronic hypoparathyroidism should be made and that this will benefit both quality of life, morbidity and potentially mortality in this group of patients.

For compliance with the monitoring standards, these were 77.5% for standard 5 (Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of albumin adjusted serum calcium [e.g. every 3–6 months]); 67.5% for standard 6 (Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum phosphate [e.g. every 3–6 months]); 16.3% for standard 7 (Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum magnesium [e.g. every 3–6 months]); 63.8% for standard 8 (Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum creatinine [e.g. every 3–6 months]); 63.8% for standard 9 (Recommend routine biochemical monitoring eGFR [e.g. every 3–6 months]); 80% for standard 10 (Recommend routine assessment of symptoms of hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia at regular time intervals [e.g. every 3–6 months]); 23.8% for standard 11 (Suggest considering monitoring of 24 h urinary calcium excretion at regular intervals [1–2 yearly]); 20% for standard 12 (Recommend renal imaging if a patient has symptoms of renal stone disease or if serum creatinine levels start to rise); and 91.3% for standard 13 (Advise against routine monitoring of BMD by DXA scans) (Figure 1B).

Finally, we found that 13 out of 80 individuals (16.3%) with chronic hypoparathyroidism had experienced at least 1 admission to hospital in the 12 months before the return date, 2 of which were admitted with hypocalcaemia, 3 with cardiac and renal diagnoses and the remainder were unrelated to hypoparathyroidism or were unclear. None (0%) of these individuals had a quality of life survey administered in the preceding 12 months. We did not have any data on how frequently serum vitamin D levels were checked.

Thus, among the 80 returns from 22 endocrine centres across the United Kingdom, overall data completeness was generally very high with only 1 of the 15 standards being open to incomplete assessment due to data completeness and rates of compliance with the 15 audit standards based on consensus recommendations in the European Society for Endocrinology chronic hypoparathyroidism management guidelinesranging from 0% (standard 15, assessment of Quality of life) to 98.8% (standard 3, Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues).

2.1 Measurements

Medical records were reviewed with focus on P‐Ca²⁺ and changes in doses of calcium supplements and alfacalcidol. Patients diagnosed with postoperative hypocalcaemia were initially admitted to our department for monitoring and treatment of calcium homeostasis. After initial stabilization, patients were followed up at our out‐patient clinic for further titration with less frequent measurement of calcium levels on the discretion of the treating physician. After stabilization, calcium levels are measured routinely every 3 rd month, or more frequently, if needed (eg suspected hypo‐ or hypercalcaemia). If dose adjustments were needed, calcium levels were re‐measured 3–14 days later and the patient was followed closely until normocalcaemia was re‐established. If a patient was not seen for a given week, normocalcaemia was assumed as well as unchanged doses were assumed since the last clinical visit with last values carried forward. Calcium levels were measured in blood drawn in the morning and prior to medication. In the beginning of the disease, levels were sometimes measured several times a day. However, for the purpose of this study, we only used fasting morning samples. Ionized plasma calcium was measured immediately by an automated electrochemical method (Nova 8), and levels were adjusted to a pH value of 7.4. All patients were treated at our department according to the standard of care as detailed in the European guidelines for monitoring and treatment of chronic HypoPT, aiming at P‐Ca²⁺ levels in the lower half of the reference interval or slightly below the lower limit of normal. The reference for ionized calcium in our laboratory is 1.18–1.32 mmol/L. In the context of guidelines allowing for a target range for plasma calcium levels slightly below lower limit of normal, we defined hypocalcaemia as levels ≤ 1.15 mmol/L.

Using the consensus management recommendations from the 2015 European Society for Endocrinology documentas audit standards we worked with the Society for Endocrinology and the patient support group Parathyroid UK to conduct a UK national audit of management of chronic hypoparathyroidism during the second half of 2020. We used these recommendations as they are the most specific and proscriptive of the three sets of guidelines, especially around monitoring frequencies, and therefore lent themselves most readily to forming a set of audit standards.

### Efficacy and safety of transCon PTH in adults with hypoparathyroidism: 52-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^113cWXtT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conventional therapy for the management of hypoparathyroidism includes active vitamin D (ie, calcitriol or alfacalcidol) and elemental calcium. According to the 2022 Guidelines from the Second International Workshop, treatment with conventional therapy is suggested as first-line therapy to raise serum calcium to the target range (ie, the lower half or just below the reference range) and alleviate symptoms of hypocalcemia while avoiding hypercalciuria to reduce the risk of renal disease. However, the Guidelines grade this as a weak recommendation for first-line treatment of hypocalcemia and its symptoms, citing low-quality evidence. Though conventional therapy aims to alleviate hypocalcemia and its symptoms, it does not restore normal PTH physiology and is associated with long-term complications including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal dysfunction. Chronically elevated phosphate levels and a high calcium-phosphate product, resulting from both hypoparathyroidism itself and the long-term use of conventional therapy, can contribute to ectopic calcifications in the kidney, brain, eye, or vasculature. Individuals with hypoparathyroidism treated with conventional therapy may report a substantial pill burden with unpredictable fluctuations in serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia, decreased kidney function, reduced HRQoL, impaired physical functioning, and well-being. The 2022 Guidelines recommend considering the use of PTH replacement therapy when conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory because of inadequate control of biochemical and clinical parameters (ie, symptomatic hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalciuria, and poor quality of life), malabsorption or intolerance of large doses of vitamin D and calcium, or the requirement of high doses of conventional therapy. For individuals with hypoparathyroidism, there remains an unmet need for a PTH therapy capable of providing physiological levels of PTH, reducing symptom burden and long-term complications, and improving HRQoL.

The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — short-term follow-up data (Statement 13) specifies that to assess early postoperative hypoparathyroidism, clinicians should include serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels on the day of surgery or POD1, and when PTH is low or symptoms of hypocalcemia are present, serum calcium measurements should follow fixed schedules in the early postoperative phase within 2–3 weeks to assess any need for or guide treatment; the document records Consensus: Yes with Evidence level: Moderate.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^115H3AwN]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — long-term targets and supplementation: Serum calcium should be maintained in the low normal reference range and serum phosphorus should be maintained no higher than the upper normal range; recommendations for 24-hour urine calcium excretion < 7.5 mmol/day and calcium-phosphorus product < 55 mg²/dL² have been advocated. Calciphylaxis mortality approaches 45–50%. Calcium supplementation doses up to 3500 mg of elemental calcium per day have been reported, with most patients requiring 1500 mg daily, and therapy in two to three divided doses provides the best absorption. Calcitriol is usually recommended, with most patients requiring 0.25 to 0.5 µg of calcitriol daily (0.25–4.0 µg/day).

### Safety and efficacy of oral human parathyroid hormone (1–34) in hypoparathyroidism: an open-label study [^115KeE6X]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The standard treatment of hypoPT with oral calcium supplementation and calcitriol (or an analog), intended to control hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and avoid hypercalciuria, remains challenging for both patients and clinicians. Loss of renal PTH action decreases renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate, causing hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia, respectively. (5) Thus, patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism have been found to have an increased risk of renal complications, such as nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and often ectopic calcification in other organs. Titration of calcium and calcitriol dose is often slow and imprecise and may require frequent dose adjustments. In addition, the intake of supplements multiple times throughout the day is inconvenient and often causes gastrointestinal intolerance. (6) PTH deficiency leads to low bone turnover and markedly altered microarchitectural and biomechanical properties of the skeleton that result in structural and dynamic skeletal defects that are not addressed by calcium supplements and active vitamin D therapy. (7, 8) Standard treatment is titrated to achieve blood calcium levels that are at the lower limit of normal to reduce the risk of hypercalciuria and ectopic calcification. (9) Patients have repeatedly reported quality of life problems such as altered mood and cognition, which may be caused by the relatively low blood calcium provided by standard treatment. (10, 11, 12) Replacement therapy with PTH has the potential advantages of reducing the high dose of calcium supplements, providing better correction of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and decreasing urine calcium. With these potential advantages, treatment of PTH deficiency with PTH is compelling.

### Efficacy of calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate for the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism… [^112f9ZBx]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Efficacy of Calcium Citrate Versus Calcium Carbonate for the Management of Chronic HypoparathyroidismClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview BACKGROUND Hypoparathyroidism is an endocrinopathy characterized by a deficient secretion or action of PTH associated with low calcium level. It can be primary, or secondary. The most common cause of chronic Hypoparathyroidism is the postsurgical one: it is usually secondary to previous thyroid surgery but may also occur following parathyroidectomy or other cervical surgical procedures. Transient Hypoparathyroidism occurs in 30–60% of patients undergoing total or subtotal thyroidectomy. About 60–70% of cases of postoperative hypocalcaemia resolve within 4–6 weeks after surgery. About 15–25% of patients will develop chronic Hypoparathyroidism. The risk of chronic Hypoparathyroidism is closely related to the number of parathyroid glands remaining in situ at operation.

Hypocalcemia is defined as serum calcium level below the lower limit of the reference range. In literature there are not data that suggest which is the best serum calcium level to maintain during treatment, but the aim is to maintain serum calcium level in the lower part or slightly below the lower limit of the reference range, serum phosphate levels within the reference range, serum calcium-phosphate product below 4. 4 mmol²/l², 24-hurinary calcium excretion < 7. 5 mmol/2h in men, < 6. 25 mmol/24h in women, or < 0. 1 mmol/kg per 24 h in both sexes.

In addition to hypocalcemia, patients affected by chronic hypoparathyroidism have a higher risk of renal implications such as urolithiasis and renal impairment because lack of PTH reduces calcium absorption and phosphate excretion causing hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. According to the European guideline, standard treatment includes oral calcium salts and active vitamin D metabolites to relieve symptoms of hypocalcaemia, maintain serum calcium levels in the low normal range and improve the patient's QoL An adequate daily intake of calcium from diet and supplements is advisable. Different calcium salts are available as supplements because elemental calcium is highly reactive so it has to be combined with other substances. These preparations differ in the concentration of elemental calcium per gram. Therefore, in some patients it is better to find an alternative to calcium carbonate.

Calcium citrate, for example, should be recommended to patients with achlorhydria or on treatment with proton pump inhibitors as well as to patients who preferred to take supplements outside mealtimes. Previous studies showed that calcium citrate, in comparison to calcium carbonate, causes greater increment in serum calcium concentration and urinary calcium excretion in parallel with greater suppression of serum PTH, after Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass and this datum suggests both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic superiority of calcium citrate. Calcium citrate is also better adsorbed than calcium carbonate after panproctocolectomy, so in a condition of a general enteric malabsorption. Up to now, there are no studies aimed to investigate the efficacy of calcium citrate in the management of subjects with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to follow-up (after surgery), AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism with persistently elevated PTH levels after parathyroidectomy and treat for causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Monitor for recurrent disease if no causes are present.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines [^111L7Zex]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of current information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

Participants

Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three Workshop Panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the Conference held in Florence, Italy, May 7–9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each Workshop Panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An Expert Panel then considered this information, developed summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitutes this summary statement.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each Workshop Panel conducted an extensive literature search as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information taking into account the historical and current literature.

Consensus Process

This report represents the Expert Panel's synthesis of the conference material placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge studies of hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

This document not only provides a summary of our current knowledge but also places recent advances in its management into a context that should enhance future advances in our understanding of hypoparathyroidism.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease with a prevalence of 37 per 100,000. It usually arises due to operative trauma to the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy or other anterior neck surgery although a range of other causes are also seen including autoimmune, genetic, mineral deposition disorders and others. Acute hypoparathyroidism is conventionally defined as that which lasts less than 6 months after surgery and is terminated by spontaneous recovery of parathyroid function and chronic hypoparathyroidism is that lasting longer than 6 months and which rarely recovers. The major clinical manifestations of chronic hypoparathyroidism relate to hypocalcaemia and include tetany, paraesthesia, carpopedal spasm and muscular cramps. Other symptoms include impaired cognition, neuropsychological manifestations and reduced quality of life. Clinical manifestations may also arise due to complications of treatment, especially where this is insufficiently or inexpertly monitored and managed and may include the occurrence of nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and impairment of renal function. Unlike management of other endocrine deficiency states where treatment with hormone replacement therapy is the norm, individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism are conventionally managed with activated vitamin D compounds in the form of alfacalcidol or calcitriol and oral calcium salts including calcium carbonate and others. The main risks of these treatments arise from insufficient biochemical monitoring and include symptomatic hypocalcaemia, iatrogenic hypercalcaemia and renal manifestations as described above. Treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone as hormone replacement therapy is now licensed in some areas of the world although the field is very much at the dawn of this era and there are still shortcomings and limitations of this treatment in its current form and further development is still required. Individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism may experience suboptimal care with a high frequency of unplanned hospitalisationand occurrence of iatrogenic harm. In 2015 the European Society for Endocrinology published authoritative, evidence base consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism. Since this time other consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism have also been published. Specifically, these are: a summary statement and guideline from Brandi and colleagues in 2016and a Canadian and international consensus paper by Khan et al.in 2019. The main difference between these three documents reflects the accumulating evidence base supporting the use of rhPTH1‐84 in that Bollerslev et al.recommend against its use where as Brandi et al.and Khan et al.promote its use under specific circumstances and both documents provide specific evidence based recommendations for when to consider its use. Other differences between the documents are that Brandi et al.suggest the use of phosphate binders when needed and also propose key objectives for a future research agenda in the management of hypoparathyroidism and Khan et al.include a very useful section on the management of hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy and a detailed section summarising the evidence base around complications of treatment.

### The PARADIGHM (physicians advancing disease knowledge in hypoparathyroidism) registry for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism: study protocol and interim baseline patient characteristics [^1133Scow]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

The recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–84), rhPTH(1–84), is full-length PTH that is approved in the United States and Europe as adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. In Europe, rhPTH(1–84) is indicated as adjunctive treatment for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who cannot be adequately controlled with conventional therapy alone. In the United States, rhPTH(1–84) is indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia and is recommended only for patients who cannot be well controlled with calcium supplements and active vitamin D alone. The safety and efficacy of rhPTH(1–84) in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism were first shown in short-term placebo-controlled clinical studies in which the need for conventional therapy was reduced, serum calcium levels were maintained, serum phosphate decreased, and events of hypocalcemia were reduced. In longer-term, open-label clinical studies, no new safety concerns were observed, reductions in oral calcium supplements and active vitamin D were achieved, serum calcium remained within target range, serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphate product levels improved, and urinary calcium excretion normalized.

Observational studies complement findings from interventional clinical trials and can provide real-world information on long-term outcomes of safety, effectiveness, and HRQoL across a broad population. Patient registries, in particular for rare diseases, can obtain natural disease or treatment response data over the long-term that would otherwise be limited if performed by individual centers.

The multinational PARADIGHM (physicians advancing disease knowledge in hypoparathyroidism) registry (NCT01922440, EUPAS register number: EUPAS16927) is an opportunity to obtain valuable real-world data beyond those reported for clinical trials in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism by providing long-term data for the treatment of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with rhPTH(1–84). PARADIGHM also records data that will allow for the assessment of the overall disease course in patients under conditions of routine clinical practice. Herein we describe the protocol for PARADIGHM and report baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the current participants.

### Parathyroid hormone therapy for managing chronic hypoparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CXA3p]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy for managing long-term hypoparathyroidism is being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available randomized controlled trials to investigate the benefits and harms of PTH therapy and conventional therapy in the management of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. To identify eligible studies, published in English, we searched Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to May 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We defined patients' important outcomes and used grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) to provide the structure for quantifying absolute effects and rating the quality of evidence. Seven randomized trials of 12 publications that enrolled a total of 386 patients proved eligible. The follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 36 months. Compared with conventional therapy, PTH therapy probably achieves a small improvement in physical health-related quality of life (mean difference [MD] 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–5.3, minimally important difference 3.0, moderate certainty). PTH therapy results in more patients reaching 50% or greater reduction in the dose of active vitamin D and calcium (relative risk [RR] = 6.5, 95% CI 2.5–16.4, 385 more per 1000 patients, high certainty). PTH therapy may increase hypercalcemia (RR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–5.04, low certainty). The findings may support the use of PTH therapy in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Because of limitations of short duration and small sample size, evidence from randomized trials is limited regarding important benefits of PTH therapy compared with conventional therapy. Establishing such benefits will require further studies. © 2022 The Authors.

### UK national chronic hypoparathyroidism audit [^116QTNRw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results show that among 80 cases of chronic hypoparathyroidism under follow up from 22 different UK endocrine departments, compliance with the audit standards varied between 98.8% and 60% for the treatment standards and between 91.3% and 20% for the monitoring standards. In addition and importantly, 16.3% of subjects had had at least one hospital admission in the preceding 12 months.

We have searched the literature for other similar work where compliance at a national level with hypoparathyroidism guidelines has been reported but can not find any and think that this may be the first systematic national level hypoparathyroidism management audit that has been conducted and reported. Generally speaking there is much scope for improvement in compliance with the guidance in the ESE guidelinesused as the basis for the audit standards reported herein and by extension with all of the major international hypoparathyroidism management guidelines. It should be noted that in both the Bollerslevand Khanguidelines the quality of evidence for each recommendation was graded by formal methodology and in nearly all cases was graded by the authors as either "low" or "very low". It will still be important to initiate a quality improvement drive in this field of endocrine practice and then complete the audit cycle with a further national audit of hypoparathyroidism management after a suitable period. One of the quality improvement initiatives that the Society for Endocrinology has recently introduced in this area is the inauguration of the "Endocrine Specialist Network" for bone and calcium disorders. By making regional hubs of expertise available to endocrinologists in each region of the United Kingdom, being available to discuss clinical challenges, raising awareness and running MDT meetings and educational events it is anticipated that over time awareness of and standards in hypoparathyroidism management will progressively improve. Other quality improvement initiatives will undoubtedly also be necessary. Particular areas for improvement as revealed by the results of our audit will include improvements in routine monitoring and in particular the monitoring of 24 h urinary calcium excretion and ultrasound screening for stone formation are areas of particularly low attainment at present (Figure 1B) and are particularly worrying as there may be a link between suboptimal management of these factors and potential subsequent development of impaired renal function. Paradoxically, one of the highest areas of attainment in our audit was against audit standard 3 (Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues). It should be born in mind that the ESE guidelines are now over 6 years oldand since their publication rhPTH 1‐84 ("Natpar" in European markets) has received licensing authorisation from several regulatory bodies.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — prophylactic postoperative management can include oral calcium carbonate given as 500–625 mg to 1000–1250 mg two to three times a day, and routine administration of oral calcium has been reported to reduce postoperative hypocalcemia to approximately 10%; adding calcitriol (1,25-(OH)₂-D₃), usually 0.5–1.0 μg per day, increases effectiveness, and calcitriol has a half-life of 5–8 hours; in a prospective randomized study, 1500 mg of oral calcium salts and 1 μg of calcitriol increased calcium and PTH superior to 0.5 μg of calcitriol administered twice a day or no calcitriol; given risks of overshooting and hypercalcemia, biochemical monitoring for medication titration is mandatory; costs noted indicate the cost of calcitriol and calcium tend to be less than PTH testing, though PTH testing is considerably lower than an emergency room visit or hospital admission; when postoperative hypoPT is known to be present, higher baseline calcium and activated vitamin D replacement are associated with better chances of parathyroid recovery.

The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism remains the most frequent complication following thyroid surgery, with reported incidence rates ranging from 14% to 60%. While the majority of cases are transient and resolve within weeks, a substantial proportion (up to 25%) progress to persistent hypoparathyroidism, defined by sustained reductions in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum calcium levels beyond 6–12 months after surgery.

Despite its prevalence and clinical impact, postoperative hypoparathyroidism continues to be variably defined across studies and institutions. Terminology such as 'postoperative parathyroid failure', 'protracted hypoparathyroidism', and 'permanent hypoparathyroidism' has been proposed to reflect the temporal evolution of the condition. However, the lack of standardized definitions and reporting criteria has hindered meaningful comparisons across clinical studies and limited the development of consistent management strategies.

Current approaches to hypoparathyroidism management range from short-term calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation to long-term replacement therapy and monitoring protocols. These variations underscore the need for a unified framework to guide diagnosis, classification, and treatment.

In addition to harmonizing definitions, there is a critical need to identify and standardize core variables that should be reported in surgical research related to hypoparathyroidism. These include biochemical parameters (for example PTH and calcium levels), timing of measurements, patient symptoms, and therapeutic interventions. Consistent reporting of these variables is essential to improve data comparability, facilitate meta-analyses, and guide evidence-based practice.

Furthermore, hypoparathyroidism has emerged as a key quality marker in thyroid surgery. Its incidence and severity reflect not only surgical technique and intraoperative decision-making but also perioperative care and long-term follow-up. Establishing robust metrics for hypoparathyroidism, such as rates of transient versus permanent hypoparathyroidism, time to recovery, and need for chronic supplementation, can serve as benchmarks for surgical performance and institutional outcomes.

In response to this gap, the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES), the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES), and the International Association of Endocrine Surgeons (IAES) collaborated to develop a consensus statement using a structured Delphi methodology. This initiative aims to standardize the reporting of hypoparathyroidism in clinical research and publications (including definitions, core variables to be reported, and quality markers and metrics of thyroid surgery related to hypoparathyroidism) and provide a globally accepted reference for clinicians and researchers in endocrine surgery.

Results

Definition and incidence

Recently published meta-analyses have shown great inconsistency of definitions and diagnostic approaches to hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery. The definitions of hypoparathyroidism included reduced PTH levels only, hypocalcaemia only, or a combination of both. In most cases, these groups could be subdivided into studies that included the presence or absence of symptoms to define the presence of hypoparathyroidism. Moreover, in some patients, postoperative PTH levels, despite being within the normal range, are inadequate to maintain normal calcium levels and to avoid symptoms (relative parathyroid insufficiency).

Overall, this demonstrates significant variation in how hypoparathyroidism is defined across the studies, making direct and systematic comparisons of these parameters nearly impossible.

To address the challenges posed by complex and inconsistent diagnostic criteria, the latest statement from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) introduced a classification of hypoparathyroidism into three categories: biochemical hypoparathyroidism, clinical hypoparathyroidism, and parathyroid insufficiency (also referred to as relative hypoparathyroidism).

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

### Conventional treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^115DAeFG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism consists of oral calcium and either activated vitamin D or vitamin D supplements at varying doses. Although adjusting dosing of calcium and/or activated vitamin D or vitamin D itself, the serum calcium should be obtained weekly or monthly depending on the clinical situation. Calcium supplementation in hypoparathyroidism usually consists of calcium carbonate because it is 40% elemental calcium by weight. However, calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is indicated for patients with achlorhydria and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Many clinicians prefer to uptitrate the activated form of vitamin D to reduce the amount of calcium supplementation.

Definitions — temporary and permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism: Temporary postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a condition that usually resolves within the first 6 months after surgery (but sometimes can last up to 12 months) with PTH and serum calcium levels within the reference range, without calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements. Permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism is a condition that continues for more than 12 months after surgery with persistently low serum calcium levels if not supplemented; the PTH level can be undetectable, low, or inappropriately low, and to assure the diagnosis of this condition, there should be an attempt at stopping supplements within 12 months after surgery.

### Changes in treatment needs for chronic postoperative hypoparathyroidism during initiation of conventional treatment compared to stable phase of treatment [^111EvNfG]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The most severe case of hypocalcaemia had P‐Ca²⁺ at 0.80 mmol/L, which was measured prior to the stable phase of treatment.

Figure S1 B shows the number of patients per week who experienced either no hypercalcaemia, mild hypercalcaemia or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, which can be read off of the y‐axis on the left site. Furthermore, the figure shows the median number of days per week that patients with hypercalcaemia suffered from hypercalcaemia which can be read off of the y‐axis on the right site.

Nine patients (38%) had one or more episodes with hypercalcaemia prior to the stable phase of treatment, while 11 patients had episodes with hypercalcaemia during the stable phase (p = .56). The episodes with hypercalcaemia were sporadic and randomly occurring. Moreover, the median duration of the episodes varied from 1 to 7 days/week. As it is seen on Figure S1 B, there was no difference between the stable phase of treatment and prior to the stable phase regarding the length of the episodes with hypercalcaemia or the number of patients experiencing hypercalcaemia. The most severe case of hypercalcaemia had P‐Ca²⁺ at 1.91mmol/L.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder resulting from undetectable or inappropriately low circulating levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is the principal regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The main biochemical abnormalities resulting from PTH deficiency are hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is neck surgery (approximately 75% of cases). Guidelines from the European Society of Endocrinology; the First International Conference on the Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment of Hypoparathyroidism; and the Canadian-led international working group provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of chronic hypoparathyroidism in adults. Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism who are treated with conventional therapy consisting of calcium and active vitamin D supplements may still be inadequately controlled and have symptoms and risks of complications and comorbidities. In a 13-country patient and caregiver survey, the magnitude of symptom severity experienced by patients whose hypoparathyroidism was not adequately controlled despite receiving conventional therapy was associated with decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status assessments and with increased caregiver burden. Evaluation of HRQoL in patients with hypoparathyroidism has proved challenging because of variability of symptoms and differing types of study designs. Many but not all studies found there is a substantial burden of illness that adversely affects HRQoL in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. A spectrum of symptomatology varying from no symptoms to severe symptoms was reported by patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism; in 36-item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) data transformed on a 0−100 scale (lower scores indicating poorer health states) the scores ranged from 20 to > 80 in different domains.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism. © 2022 The Authors.

### Predictors of hypocalcemia post parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism; a single center study [^111xhqNU]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Parathyroidectomy is a surgery to remove one or more parathyroid glands in a patient with hyperparathyroidism. It is considered the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. According to the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons' guidelines (AAES), the first indication for parathyroidectomy is symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. However, asymptomatic patients' management is still not clear. On the other hand, one of the major postoperative complications is hypocalcemia. The incidence of post‐parathyroidectomy hypocalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism is variable, with some investigators reporting a range of 12%–70%.

There was controversy over finding an agreed definition of hypocalcemia. Siyam et al. and Cooper et al. defined hypocalcemia as total serum calcium less than 2.10 mmol/L. At the same time, Pathy et al. assigned a hypocalcemia cutoff of 2.15 mmol/L. On the other hand, Pepe et al. defined it as corrected total serum calcium levels less than 2.12 mmol/L (8.5 mg/dL); however, measurement of ionised calcium (normal values of 1.17–1.33 mmol/L) is the gold standard for diagnosis in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Other studies defined hypocalcemia by determining cut‐off points accompanied by specific conditions (symptomatic patients, abnormal PTH, requiring treatment, duration).

Persistent hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia that develop as a consequence of comprehensive re‐mineralisation of the skeletal system after PTH suppression are considered a critical complications of parathyroidectomy. Hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy was attributed to the rapid skeletal uptake of calcium as a result of a sudden decline in the highly elevated PTH levels. This decline was believed to induce suppression of bone resorption on top of enhanced bone formation. Symptomatic hypocalcemia patients may present with seizures, tetany, numbness, tingling, perioral paresthesia, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and laryngospasm.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is defined as long‐term excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as a result of an adenoma, hyperplasia, or, rarely, carcinoma. It is considered the third most common endocrine disease, with an incidence ranging from 4 to 112 per 100,000 in the USA. In addition, impaired renal function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients or vitamin D deficiency can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^113cpXdz]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, only two other meta‐analyses have investigated some of the aspects related to PTH replacement therapy. These both limited their analysis to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (four and five articles, respectively). Liu and colleagues included only data on biochemical parameters, whereas Palui and colleagues did not compare PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84.

RCTs undoubtedly represent the highest level of evidence. However, open‐label and uncontrolled studies may still provide valuable evidence, especially in rare diseases, in which the small sample size and logistic limitations often render RCTs unfeasible or biased. Furthermore, the inclusion of all prospective studies, including real‐world ones, in a systematic review and meta‐analysis increases the power of the analysis, reduces publication bias, better reflects real‐life settings. In fact, the European Medicine Agency's guidelines state that study designs other than RCTs (prospective open‐label or crossover studies) are acceptable for rare conditions and clinical trials in small populations, if they help to improve the interpretability of the study results.

For all these reasons, we performed a meta‐analysis of both RCTs and nonrandomized prospective studies to investigate the effects of PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 on serum and urinary calcium and phosphate levels, serum vitamin D levels, doses of calcium and active vitamin D supplements, bone markers, bone mineral density, QoL, and safety in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) management of significant post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia — Recommendation 61 states: "Patients with significant post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia should receive oral calcium as first-line therapy, calcitriol as necessary, and intravenous calcium in severe or refractory situations. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Practical dosing and adjuncts include: "Oral calcium carbonate is widely available without prescription, usually well tolerated, and a typical postoperative dose is 1–2 g, 2–3 times daily with prompt dose escalation as required for symptom relief (excess ingestion is readily excreted)". If symptoms persist with oral calcium, "oral calcitriol should also be initiated, at a typical dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily", and laboratory evaluation can guide management: "Phosphorus level can help to distinguish between bone hunger (normal PO4) and hypoparathyroidism (elevated PO4). Magnesium and 25-OH vitamin D levels should also be checked". For severe cases, infusion is preferred: "Intravenous boluses of calcium are not recommended due to their short-lived effect; infusions of calcium over several hours are more effective and preferred".

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^1139ue7Q]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is the only endocrine deficiency for which hormone replacement therapy is not the standard of care. Although conventional treatments may control hypocalcaemia, other complications such as hyperphosphatemia, kidney stones, peripheral calcifications, and bone disease remain unmet needs. This meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019126881) aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of PTH 1–34 and PTH 1–84 in restoring calcium metabolism in chronic hypoparathyroidism. EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized clinical trials or prospective studies published between January 1996 and March 2021. English-language trials reporting data on replacement with PTH 1–34 or PTH 1–84 in chronic hypoparathyroidism were selected. Three authors extracted outcomes, one author performed quality control, all assessed the risk of biases. Overall, data from 25 studies on 588 patients were analyzed. PTH therapy had a neutral effect on calcium levels, while lowering serum phosphate (-0.21mmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.31 to -0.11mmol/L; p < 0.001) and urinary calcium excretion (-1.21mmol/24h; 95% CI, -2.03 to -0.41mmol/24h; p = 0.003). Calcium phosphate product decreased under PTH 1–84 therapy only. Both treatments enabled a significant reduction in calcium and calcitriol supplementation. PTH therapy increased bone turnover markers and lumbar spine mineral density. Quality of life improved and there was no difference in the safety profile between PTH and conventionally treated patients. Results for most outcomes were similar for the two treatments. Limitations of the study included considerable population overlap between the reports, incomplete data, and heterogeneity in the protocol design. In conclusion, the meta-analysis of data from the largest collection to date of hypoparathyroid patients shows that PTH therapy is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in normalizing serum phosphate and urinary calcium excretion, as well as enabling a reduction in calcium and vitamin D use and improving quality of life. © 2022 The Authors.

4 DISCUSSION

Patients were treated with alfacalcidol and calcium supplements as recommended by guidelines, in order to obtain and maintain a stable concentration of P‐Ca²⁺ in the lower part of the reference range. On a contrary to other studies, our data demonstrated that treatment needs varied greatly until 11 weeks after surgery, where the mean doses of alfacalcidol became more stable, which occurred a bit earlier for doses of calcium. The stable phase occurred much later than former studies. Days with hypocalcaemia occurred randomly and were not only in the beginning of the treatment but also in the stable phase of treatment, although the number of patients experiencing hypocalcaemia decreased concurrently with the number of weeks after surgery.

The gender distribution seen in our study with 29% men and 71% women was in consistency with other studies investigating postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

### Chronic hypoparathyroidism-current and emerging therapies [^114nyQnc]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low serum calcium due to insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) and results in significant complications. Conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism with calcium salts and activated vitamin D has limitations such as inadequate control of symptomatic hypocalcemia and large pill burden. PTH replacement therapy offers a more physiologic alternative to conventional therapy. PTH (1–34) has a short half-life of 1 hour and is used off-label for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. rhPTH (1–84) has a half life of 3 hours and improves symptom control but its production is being halted due to manufacturing issues. Palopegteriparatide has a 60-hour half life and results in an infusion like PTH release profile. This molecule is effective in lowering urinary calcium, maintaining serum eucalcemia, lowering serum phosphate and reducing pill burden and is now approved by the FDA and EMA. Emerging therapies include Eneboparatide which is currently being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials. Encalaret is a calcilytic molecule which is in phase 3 clinical trials and is a promising molecule for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1. New molecules include an oral PTH1receptor agonist which is in phase 1 clinical trials. A weekly PTH molecule is also being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials.

American Thyroid Association — Table 4 key recommendations for prevention and management of hypoparathyroidism: Conduct surgery so as to avoid removal or devascularization of parathyroid tissue. Autotransplant devascularized or inadvertently removed parathyroid glands. Either treat at-risk patients empirically with calcium, or measure calcium and/or PTH in the immediate postoperative period and treat according to evidence-based protocols. Titrate calcium with or without calcitriol to maintain eucalcemia, and wean calcium and/or calcitriol when appropriate. Communication between providers is critical, since hypoPT may be prolonged and can negatively affect multiple organ systems. Inability to achieve independence from calcium by six months indicates permanent hypoPT. Recombinant human PTH analogues may be considered for patients with permanent hypoPT. Avoiding hypoPT is much less costly than treating hypoPT. Teriparatide acetate (recombinant human PTH 1–34; rhPTH[1–34]) is an approved treatment for osteoporosis, but it is currently being studied as a possible off-label treatment for postoperative hypoPT.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^114sDqfE]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is the most common complication following bilateral thyroid operations. Thyroid surgeons must employ strategies for minimizing and preventing post-thyroidectomy hypoPT. The objective of this American Thyroid Association Surgical Affairs Committee Statement is to provide an overview of its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Summary

HypoPT occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoPT include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Medical and surgical strategies to minimize perioperative hypoPT include optimizing vitamin D levels, preserving parathyroid blood supply, and autotransplanting ischemic parathyroid glands. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative intact PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management. In general, a postoperative PTH level < 15pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoPT. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoPT can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium, and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide. Monitoring for rebound hypercalcemia is necessary to avoid metabolic and renal complications. For more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoPT has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

Materials and Methods

Patients and study design

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported by Mannstadt et al. and Clarke et al. Briefly, the study enrolled patients between 18 and 85 years old with chronic hypoparathyroidism based on hypocalcemia and documented serum PTH levels below the lower limit of the normal range. Patients with known or suspected mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene were excluded. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards, and all study participants provided written informed consent.

After enrollment, patients underwent an optimization period lasting 2 to 16 weeks, during which active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) and calcium doses were adjusted to achieve albumin-corrected serum calcium levels between 7.5 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L) and the upper limit of normal, but ideally within a target range of 8.0 to 9.0 mg/dL (2.0 to 2.2 mmol/L). Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were optimized to be between 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L), and magnesium deficiency [defined as values < 1.3 mEq/L (0.7 mmol/L)] was corrected.

Parathyroids

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare event and only a few case reports have described its occurrence as an adverse effect of ICI therapy. –

Management

Acute hypocalcaemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability and seizures. It should be treated as per general guidelines with intravenous calcium infusion in cases of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia, and oral calcium replacement in mild to moderate cases. In patients with hypoparathyroidism, active vitamin D (calcitriol) or vitamin D analogue (1-alfacalcidol) is required to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health.

2 Conversely, high calcium levels drive PTH suppression, with hypermagnesemia and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D also inhibiting the production and release of PTH. Parathyroid disorders can be primary or secondary. 1, 3 Once a calcium abnormality has been identified, the evaluation should include a systematic search for signs and symptoms associated with abnormal calcium levels. 1, 2, 4–6 A history should include dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus, medications that increase serum calcium levels, supplements that contain calcium, and family history of endocrine disorders. A patient history of conditions such as fractures, pancreatitis, and nephrolithiasis may indicate or contribute to abnormal calcium levels. Initial laboratory testing can be used to identify potential etiologies of parathyroid disorders that affect calcium levels.

Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the most common causes of hypercalcemia. 4 Additional causes are listed in Table 2. Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia should be managed acutely with intravenous fluids, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, denosumab, or dialysis. 6 Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, which can present acutely with carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures, and a prolonged QT interval, should be managed with intravenous calcium gluconate while the cause is being determined.
12. Hyperparathyroidism PRIMARY Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common condition and the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism and mild hypercalcemia. 1, 13 In primary hyperparathyroidism, calcium levels are usually elevated without appropriate suppression of PTH levels, which can be normal or high.

13 However, in normocalcemic cases, calcium levels can be normal with elevated PTH levels, which may be encountered incidentally when screening for bone and renal disorders. In nations with readily accessible laboratory services, primary hyperparathyroidism is most often identified in asymptomatic individuals as an incidental finding of hypercalcemia on routine laboratory testing. Comprehensive evaluation of hypercalcemia to identify primary hyperparathyroidism should begin with symptom assessment and laboratory testing, including measurements of serum total or ionized calcium, albumin, PTH, serum creatinine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 24-hour urinary calcium and creatinine levels. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is also recommended. 13, 16 Parathyroid imaging is not needed to diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism but may be helpful for perioperative management.
15.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that presents with abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood, low urinary calcium excretion, and normal or slightly elevated PTH levels. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia generally does not require treatment, including surgery. Indications for parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism include the presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria. 13, 15–17 Patients who desire surgery and do not have contraindications may also be considered for parathyroidectomy. Increasing evidence regarding the benefits and risks of operative management has expanded the number of asymptomatic patients who are recommended for surgery.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^114vaGkA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Through a systematic analysis of all published clinical trials, we collated the largest group to date of patients treated with PTH‐receptor agonists and demonstrated their efficacy in restoring serum phosphate levels, reducing calcium excretion and reactivating bone turnover — all issues that are not addressed by any alternative treatment. These therapies also enabled the reduction or discontinuation of oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and had a relatively good safety profile.

The first clinical study on PTH replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism dates back to 1996. Despite the 25 years elapsed since then, very few randomized trials have been conducted to date, and none have compared PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84. Given the rarity of this disease, the few trials conducted were small in size and heterogeneous in outcomes or design, limiting the ability to draw robust conclusions. PTH replacement therapy is not currently used as standard clinical practice according to the European guidelines. However, although the conventional therapies are generally able to control hypocalcaemia, they leave several clinical issues unaddressed: hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis are a significant burden for many patients, for whom PTH treatment might well be a better alternative.

One of the concerns in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism with calcium and calcitriol supplements is the delicate balance between overtreatment and symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Our meta‐analysis showed PTH replacement therapy could be considered neither superior nor inferior to oral supplements in controlling serum calcium levels. This may be because the patients enrolled in clinical trials were mostly on target for calcium at the baseline, and their oral calcium supplements were significantly reduced or discontinued during studies. It is worth noticing that studies were heterogenous in duration. We showed that PTH therapies are safe with respect to the risk of hypocalcemic or hypercalcemic episodes.

An unmet need in hypoparathyroidism is combating the associated rise in serum phosphate levels, which are largely unaffected by conventional therapies. Active vitamin D is unable to match the phosphaturic action of PTH and can even worsen hyperphosphatemia, by promoting intestinal phosphate absorption. Our meta‐analysis revealed a large posttreatment reduction in serum phosphate and a significant difference between patients receiving PTH therapies and controls. PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 showed a similar efficacy in lowering serum phosphate.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism [^113XxZ3x]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia in the presence of a low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone level. HypoPT is most commonly seen after neck surgery, which accounts for approximately 75% of cases, whereas approximately 25% have HypoPT due to nonsurgical causes. In both groups of patients, conventional therapy includes calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy aiming to maintain serum calcium concentration in the low normal or just below the normal reference range and normalize serum phosphorus, magnesium concentrations, and urine calcium levels. The limitations of conventional therapy include wide fluctuations in serum calcium, high pill burden, poor quality of life, and renal complications. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy may improve the biochemical profile in those in whom conventional therapy proves unsatisfactory. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature, the panel made a graded recommendation suggesting conventional therapy as first line therapy rather than administration of PTH (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers use of PTH. Because pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in calcium homeostasis, close monitoring is required during these periods with appropriate adjustment of calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy to ensure that serum calcium remains in the mid to low normal reference range in order to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Emerging therapies include molecules with prolonged PTH action as well as different mechanisms of action that may significantly enhance drug efficacy and safety. © 2022 The Authors.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^115RQKfJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone.

Methods

This review is an evidence-based summary of hypoparathyroidism in terms of relevant pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic concepts.

Results

Many clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are due to the lack of the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone on its 2 major target organs: the skeleton and the kidney. The skeleton is inactive, accruing bone without remodeling it. The kidneys lose the calcium-conserving actions of parathyroid hormone and, thus, excrete a greater fraction of calcium. Biochemical manifestations, besides hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone, include hyperphosphatemia and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Calcifications in the kidney, brain, and other soft tissues are common. Removal of, or damage to, the parathyroid glands at the time of anterior neck surgery is, by far, the most likely etiology. Autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands and other genetic causes represent most of the other etiologies. Conventional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain the serum calcium level but high doses may be required, adding to the risk of long-term soft tissue calcifications. The advent of replacement therapy with recombinant human PTH(1–84) represents a major step in the therapeutics of this disease.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of hypoparathyroidism have led to greater understanding of the disease itself and our approach to it.

Statement 5: In patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism and/or low serum calcium levels and/or manifestations of hypocalcaemia, measurements of calcium should be repeated as necessary to assure diagnosis and to allow tailoring of calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements.

According to the ATA statement, transient hypoparathyroidism refers to cases lasting < 6 months following surgery, whereas permanent hypoparathyroidism persists beyond that time frame. These two classifications are based on and expand upon existing literature, supported by extensive research and data. Relative hypoparathyroidism, though characterized by normal serum PTH and calcium levels, still necessitates treatment due to clinically relevant symptoms or signs of hypocalcaemia. While the ATA's diagnostic criteria for hypoparathyroidism are valuable for identifying patients based on hypocalcaemia symptoms and guiding clinical care, they may not accurately reflect the true incidence — potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation. Qiu et al.found that PTH levels recovered between 6 and 12 months after thyroid surgery with central neck dissection in 25.4% of patients diagnosed with permanent hypoparathyroidism at 6 months after surgery and that PTH levels recovered or did not recover after 12 months in 74.6% of patients. This phenomenon can be partly explained by the fact that most autotransplanted parathyroid glands typically require 2–6 weeks to gradually regain function, although, in some cases, full recovery may take several months. Villarroya-Marquina et al.studied 854 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy and found that 14.5% of patients had postoperative hypoparathyroidism, with their parathyroid function recovering at different times (< 6 months in 8.5%, 6–12 months in 2.5%, and > 12 months in 1.4%; 4.2% of patients did not recover during follow-up). These data support the 12-month threshold for distinguishing transient from permanent hypoparathyroidism, as a substantial proportion of patients continue to show recovery of parathyroid function between 6 and 12 months after surgery. This approach is consistent with the most recent definition developed and approved by an international panel of experts presented as part of the best practice recommendations discussed at the Parathyroid Summit, held as a pre-Endocrine Society meeting in May 2024 (Boston, MA, USA), stating that a diagnosis of permanent hypoparathyroidism is confirmed ≥ 12 months after surgical intervention in the presence of hypocalcaemia (albumin-adjusted or ionized calcium) determined on two separate occasions (≥ 2 weeks apart) with inappropriately normal or low PTH levels.

3.22. In case of infertility, assisted reproductive treatment can be considered according to national guidelines (A+).

3.23. In patients with PHP and related disorders, natural and induced pregnancies should be monitored from an obstetrical point of view in the same way as any other pregnancy. However, dosages of active forms of vitamin D and levothyroxine might have to be adjusted. The possibility of vaginal delivery might be limited as a result of reduced pelvic size and decreased range of motion of the hips due to local ossifications (A+).

3.24. Management of hypocalcaemia and hypothyroidism should follow the current guidelines available for the management of hypoparathyroidism and hypothyroidism during pregnancy. The newborn should be evaluated for levels of TSH, calcium and phosphorus. Lactation is not contraindicated, but close follow-up and clinical monitoring (particularly of weight) of the baby are advised (B++).

3.25. Patients with PHP and related disorders have several potential risk factors for osteoporosis (hypogonadism, chronic elevation of PTH and GH deficiency). However, owing to the lack of evidence of increased fracture risk, there is no indication to perform routine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements in patients with PHP and related disorders. If osteoporosis is diagnosed, management should take into account, whenever possible, treatment of the underlying secondary cause for bone loss (hypogonadism, postmenopausal status or related to sustained elevation of PTH levels and GH deficiency) (B++).

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism across the VA health care system… [^112YTGzA]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question How is primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed and treated in a large integrated health system using electronic health records. Findings In this national cohort study of 371 370 veterans with chronic hypercalcemia, 86 887 were evaluated for primary hyperparathyroidism with serum parathyroid hormone level. Of 47 158 patients with hormonal evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism, 6049 underwent definitive treatment with parathyroidectomy. Meaning Primary hyperparathyroidism appears to be underdiagnosed despite the presence of chronic hypercalcemia, and it is undertreated with parathyroidectomy despite surgical indications. Importance Untreated primary hyperparathyroidism impairs quality of life and incurs substantial costs. Parathyroidectomy is a low-risk, high-success, definitive intervention.

Objectives To determine the appropriateness of diagnostic evaluation for primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with hypercalcemia and the use of parathyroidectomy for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism across the Veterans Affairs health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants. Of 371 370 patients with chronic hypercalcemia, 86 887 received further testing with parathyroid hormone level. Of 47 158 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism, 6048 underwent parathyroidectomy. Of 5793 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism presenting with a serum calcium level more than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, 1501 underwent parathyroidectomy. There was a decreasing trend in the use of parathyroidectomy over time.

Conclusions and Relevance From this study's findings, parathyroid hormone level is infrequently tested in patients with hypercalcemia, suggesting underdiagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism are undertreated with recommended parathyroidectomy. Similar gaps have previously been observed in non-VA care of primary hyperparathyroidism, suggesting the need for a systematic evaluation of barriers to diagnosis and treatment that informs intervention design. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for pHPT. It is a low-risk operation, commonly performed on an outpatient basis, with high cure rates and excellent long-term outcomes, including in elderly patients. 5–7 Surgical intervention for pHPT has been associated with increased bone mineral density, decreased risk of fracture, decreased progression of kidney disease, and decreased rates of associated cardiovascular. treatment for pHPT, when surgery is possible.

19 Management guidelines have been periodically updated and reflect the growing evidence on the benefits of parathyroidectomy. 20–23 The most recent management guidelines released by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons suggest that parathyroidectomy should be considered in patients with mild, nonclassic symptoms, if surgical risk is not prohibitive.
19. Thus, we examined diagnostic evaluation for pHPT and treatment patterns in the VA health care system. Our study objectives were to assess the rate of diagnostic testing for pHPT among patients with hypercalcemia, examine the use of parathyroidectomy for pHPT and determine temporal trends, and identify factors associated with surgical treatment in pHPT. We created a cohort of eligible patients by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Patients who still require supplement therapy due to persistently low or absent iPTH after 1 month are considered to have protracted postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The prevalence of protracted postsurgical hypoparathyroidism varies from 13% to 44%. Others have demonstrated that the rate of protracted postsurgical hypoparathyroidism depends on the number of glands left in situ, ranging from 13% to 15% when all four glands remain in situ, to 40% to 44% when two or fewer remain in situ. The probability of recovering parathyroid function over the next 12 months is approximately 75%.

There is lack of consensus on the definition of permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Most investigators and guidelines use the need for Ca salts and active vitamin D therapy at 6 or 12 months. Permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism includes three distinct subcategories (Table 2). Approximately 10% to 15% of cases recover after 1 year.

The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — definition variability and classification are highlighted by meta-analyses showing great inconsistency of definitions and diagnostic approaches after thyroid surgery, with definitions including reduced PTH levels only, hypocalcaemia only, or a combination of both, and many studies also using the presence or absence of symptoms to define hypoparathyroidism. Postoperative PTH can be within the normal range yet inadequate to maintain normal calcium and avoid symptoms (relative parathyroid insufficiency). To address heterogeneity, the latest statement from the American Thyroid Association introduced a classification into three categories, beginning with biochemical.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: present and future [^112mCDFU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused upon maintaining the serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

Evidence Synthesis

Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handing of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with abnormal calcium and skeletal homeostasis. Control with calcium and active vitamin D can be a challenge. The availability of PTH (1–84) replacement therapy may usher new opportunities for better control with reduced supplementation requirements.

Visual identification of the parathyroid glands — while it helps guide preservation, it does not guarantee function; visualizing and preserving more parathyroid glands in situ during total thyroidectomy significantly reduces the risk of hypocalcaemia and permanent hypoparathyroidism, and patients with a lower PGRIS score (1–2 versus 3 or 4; where PGRIS stands for parathyroid glands remaining in situ) had higher rates of hypoparathyroidism.

### Natpara for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^115p1sMB]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia, due to absent or inappropriately low parathyroid hormone levels. For management of chronic hypoparathyroidism, current treatment options involve oral calcium and vitamin D. This standard treatment cannot resolve all problematic aspects of the disease, such as abnormal bone remodeling and reduced quality of life, and is associated with long-term complications, including nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, renal impairment, cataracts and cerebral calcifications.

Areas Covered

In 2015, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved rhPTH (1–84), named Natpara®, a bioengineered recombinant human PTH, for the management of hypoparathyroidism of any etiology, except Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia, not well controlled with calcium and active vitamin D. Herein, the authors review its chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy for hypoparathyroidism.

Expert Opinion

Replacement therapy with rhPTH (1–84) is a fundamental step in the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism in cases not well controlled by standard therapy, providing the natural hormone that is lacking for the maintenance of normal calcium levels, and reducing long-term risks associated with conventional therapy. Nevertheless, given the chronic nature of the disease, in the future, further studies will have to be performed to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the drug.

A 38-yr-old woman with chronic non-surgical hypoparathyroidism, managed elsewhere, presented to our practice with symptomatic hypocalcemia. At the age of 17, she began to suffer from muscle cramps, paresthesia, and ongoing diffuse pain. It took years before she was correctly diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism. Her symptoms were severe enough that she required emergency room visits several times a year. After she was properly diagnosed and started on calcium and calcitriol therapy, she continued to experience frequent episodes of severe hypocalcemia. She saw multiple healthcare providers who each introduced a new regimen. In addition, poor communication led to her discontinuing her medications altogether. As a result, her calcium levels remained consistently low, and she lost confidence in her prospect for better health. At the time of her visit to our clinic, she had discontinued calcitriol, was taking a large amount of oral calcium daily all at once, and had hypocalcemia. We addressed her concerns, and the challenges she faces with adherence to her medication regimen. We provided her with detailed information about the disease and the reasoning behind her treatment plan. Treatment was initiated with calcium carbonate 600 mg 3 times daily and calcitriol 0.5 mcg once daily. One week after treatment initiation, her test results showed improvement in her albumin-adjusted calcium, phosphorus, and 24-h urine calcium which were all within target range.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^114tFU9o]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) — definitions and diagnostic thresholds — Biochemical hypoPT is defined as a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level below the laboratory lower limit (usually 12 pg/mL) with hypocalcemia, while clinical hypoPT adds symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia; hypocalcemia itself is a total serum calcium below the center-specific reference range. Transient or temporary hypoPT lasts for less than six months after surgery, and permanent hypoPT continues beyond six months. The short half-life of PTH (3–5 minutes) contributes to postoperative vulnerability of parathyroid function. Parathyroid insufficiency (relative hypoPT) can occur after central neck surgery with symptoms despite normal laboratory values.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^114fQGFG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Hypoparathyroidism is the only endocrine deficiency for which hormone replacement therapy is not the standard of care. Although conventional treatments may control hypocalcaemia, other complications such as hyperphosphatemia, kidney stones, peripheral calcifications, and bone disease remain unmet needs. This meta‐analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42019126881) aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 in restoring calcium metabolism in chronic hypoparathyroidism. EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized clinical trials or prospective studies published between January 1996 and March 2021. English‐language trials reporting data on replacement with PTH 1−34 or PTH 1−84 in chronic hypoparathyroidism were selected. Three authors extracted outcomes, one author performed quality control, all assessed the risk of biases. Overall, data from 25 studies on 588 patients were analyzed. PTH therapy had a neutral effect on calcium levels, while lowering serum phosphate (−0.21 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.31 to −0.11 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and urinary calcium excretion (−1.21 mmol/24 h; 95% CI, −2.03 to −0.41 mmol/24 h; p = 0.003). Calcium phosphate product decreased under PTH 1−84 therapy only. Both treatments enabled a significant reduction in calcium and calcitriol supplementation. PTH therapy increased bone turnover markers and lumbar spine mineral density. Quality of life improved and there was no difference in the safety profile between PTH and conventionally treated patients. Results for most outcomes were similar for the two treatments. Limitations of the study included considerable population overlap between the reports, incomplete data, and heterogeneity in the protocol design. In conclusion, the meta‐analysis of data from the largest collection to date of hypoparathyroid patients shows that PTH therapy is safe, well‐tolerated, and effective in normalizing serum phosphate and urinary calcium excretion, as well as enabling a reduction in calcium and vitamin D use and improving quality of life. © 2022 The Authors.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition caused by defective release of parathyroid hormone (PTH), resulting in impaired mineral metabolism. The combination of a lower 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) conversion rate and reduced calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion from the renal tubules leads to hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria, whereas the lack of PTH itself results in reduced bone turnover and bone disease. Conventional therapy is based on supplementation with oral calcium salts and active vitamin D, but this often fails to normalize biochemical parameters other than serum calcium. Although the latter can be maintained at target levels in most patients, the failure to control serum phosphate levels, calcium phosphate product, and calcium and phosphate excretion increases the risk of peripheral calcifications, kidney stone formation, kidney infections, and, ultimately, impaired kidney function.

Over the last two decades, several attempts have been made to develop a physiological replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism, the only endocrine deficiency for which replacement with the missing hormone is not currently the standard of care. PTH deficiency is now known to have significant effects on patients' quality of life (QoL), morbidity, and mortality, meaning that such a therapy is urgently needed.

Human PTH 1−34, teriparatide, is a fragment of the natural molecule widely used to treat osteoporosis that has been also used in hypoparathyroidism since 1996. Its short half‐life necessitates multiple daily injections, reducing tolerability. Later, the more stable recombinant human PTH 1−84 has been approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. Nevertheless, as hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease with few controlled trials, and PTH has multiple systemic targets, the management and safety of PTH replacement therapy — and the ideal candidates for such a therapy — have yet to be established.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^112o7c6P]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Statement 1: Biochemical postoperative hypoparathyroidism is defined by an undetectable or low PTH (less than the lower limit of the centre-specific reference range) with or without hypocalcaemia.

Consensus: Yes (8.088)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 2

Evidence level: Moderate

A systematic review and meta-analysis recently analysed 188 studies on the definition and early diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism; it found that postoperative PTH measurements within 24 h had higher sensitivity and specificity than intraoperative PTH for predicting hypoparathyroidism, thresholds of < 10 pg/ml and < 15 pg/ml were both reliable for identifying patients at risk, no specific time point within the first 24 h (for example 1 h, 6 h versus 12 h versus 24 h) was superior, and any measurement within postoperative day 1 (POD1) was effective. Nowadays, measuring PTH within 24 h is considered standard practice in many endocrine surgery centres. It allows for early identification of patients at risk of hypoparathyroidism, timely initiation of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation, and safe discharge for individuals at low risk of hypoparathyroidism. This timing is also used in registry protocols and quality improvement initiatives to benchmark outcomes. In addition, measuring serum PTH levels 1–6 h after total or completion thyroidectomy provides high predictive accuracy for identifying the need for supplementation to prevent symptoms that may require readmission. This approach enables selective supplementation and supports safe early discharge, particularly in outpatient thyroidectomy protocols where timely discharge decisions are critical.

Statement 2: The first postoperative PTH level should be measured within 24 h.

Consensus: Yes (8.022)

Outliers: 9

Negative outliers: 8

Evidence level: Moderate

GA voting: Agree: 78.25%, Disagree: 21.75%. In addition, 66.78% of voters preferred this measurement to be done 1–6 h after surgery.

Hypoparathyroidism is a clinically heterogeneous condition, where biochemical markers like PTH and calcium are essential for diagnosis, but symptom severity varies widely and may not align with laboratory values.

Statement 3: Postoperative hypoparathyroidism may be an asymptomatic condition or it can become clinically apparent with a variety of manifestations ranging from mild numbness and tingling, muscle cramps, tetany, and seizures to life-threatening laryngospasm and cardiac arrhythmia.

### Evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism summary statement and guidelines from the second international workshop [^114bvFbt]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the prevention, diagnosis, and management of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and provides evidence-based recommendations. The HypoPT task forces included four teams with a total of 50 international experts including representatives from the sponsoring societies. A methodologist (GG) and his team supported the taskforces and conducted the systematic reviews. A formal process following the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the systematic reviews provided the structure for seven of the guideline recommendations. The task force used a less structured approach based on narrative reviews for 20 non-GRADEd recommendations. Clinicians may consider postsurgical HypoPT permanent if it persists for > 12 months after surgery. To predict which patients will not develop permanent postsurgical HypoPT, we recommend evaluating serum PTH within 12 to 24 hours post total thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). PTH > 10pg/mL (1.05pmol/L) virtually excludes long-term HypoPT. In individuals with nonsurgical HypoPT, genetic testing may be helpful in the presence of a positive family history of nonsurgical HypoPT, in the presence of syndromic features, or in individuals younger than 40years. HypoPT can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataracts, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory indices. In patients with chronic HypoPT, the panel suggests conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D metabolites as first-line therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers the use of PTH. © 2022 The Authors.

### Hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, management and emerging therapies [^113L92Lm]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action and results in hypocalcaemia, and can lead to hyperphosphataemia and hypercalciuria. Most cases of hypoparathyroidism occur as a complication of surgery, with the remainder due to causes including autoimmune disease, genetic causes, infiltrative diseases, mineral deposition or due to abnormalities in serum levels of magnesium. Hypoparathyroidism can cause multisystem disease, with long-term complications resulting from ectopic calcification as well as renal complications with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in addition to respiratory, cardiac or neurological manifestations. Conventional therapy consists of oral calcium salts and active vitamin D but it has limitations, including fluctuations in serum levels of calcium and a high pill burden, and can increase the risk of long-term complications. By contrast, PTH replacement therapy can effectively achieve normal serum levels of calcium, and lower serum levels of phosphate. The long-acting PTH analogue, palopegteriparatide, has been shown to normalize urine levels of calcium. In addition, PTH replacement therapy reduces the pill burden. Palopegteriparatide is also associated with improved quality of life in comparison to conventional therapy. This Review summarizes current recommendations regarding the pathophysiology, evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and also references the 2022 international hypoparathyroidism guidelines. Palopegteriparatide has now been approved as PTH replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Emerging therapies will also be presented in this Review.

### UK national chronic hypoparathyroidism audit [^113y8B5j]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The Parathyroid UK member survey from 2017showed that only 11% of patients with this condition are regularly receiving care from an endocrinologist specialising in this condition and the PARADOX studyshowed that of 374 individuals with hypoparathyroidism, 72% had experienced more than 10 hypoparathyroidism symptoms in the preceding 12 months and 79% had required an emergency department attendance or hospital admission in the preceding 12 months. It is known that there is an increased risk of renal complications of treatment (Nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and impaired renal function) in those treated for chronic hypoparathyroidism in comparison to a control population (hazard ratio: 4.31, 95% confidence interval: 2.84–6.52). It is, therefore, clear that there is a clinical need for improvements in routine care of those with chronic hypoparathyroidism and the publication of the ESE and other guidelines, on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism is an important step towards improving care. However, if improvements in care and outcome are to be realised it is necessary that there are adequate levels of compliance with the recommendations in these guidelines. We therefore sought to audit compliance with the ESE guidelines'main recommendations across UK secondary care endocrine practice.

### AAES guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism management… [^117J3Tye]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Findings Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients, should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, and is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy. Clinically relevant thyroid disease should be assessed preoperatively and managed during parathyroidectomy. Devascularized normal parathyroid tissue should be autotransplanted. Patients should be observed postoperatively for hematoma, evaluated for hypocalcemia and symptoms of hypocalcemia, and followed up to assess for cure defined as eucalcemia at more than 6 months. Calcium supplementation may be indicated postoperatively. Familial pHPT, reoperative parathyroidectomy, and parathyroid carcinoma are challenging entities that require special consideration and expertise.

Conclusions and Relevance Evidence-based recommendations were created to assist clinicians in the optimal treatment of patients with pHPT. The surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism has undergone extensive change in the past 2 decades. The presentation, diagnosis, and medical management have been previously addressed by an international workshop. 1–4 To meet the need for a detailed focus on operative management, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons developed evidence-based guidelines to delineate the safe and effective practice of parathyroidectomy to achieve definitive treatment. In pHPT, PTH levels are high or inappropriately normal. Diagnosis of normocalcemic pHPT requires the exclusion of other causes of secondary elevation of PTH. Nonparathyroid causes of hypercalcemia are associated with suppressed PTH. Renal function and vitamin D status should be assessed preoperatively.

A 24-hour urinary calcium level is important to distinguish pHPT from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which is an autosomal dominant disorder of the renal calcium-sensing receptor that can mimic pHPT. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should be considered in patients with long-standing hypercalcemia, urinary calcium levels less than 100 mg/24 hours, and a calcium to creatinine clearance ratio less than 0.
01. Recommendation 1–3: In patients with suspected pHPT, a personal and family history should be taken. Patients with otherwise asymptomatic pHPT may have nephrocalcinosis or silent nephrolithiasis; both are indications for parathyroidectomy. 4 Recommendation 1–4: In patients with asymptomatic pHPT, abdominal imaging should be performed for detection of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment of pHPT.

Symptomatic patients are expected to derive clear benefits from curative parathyroidectomy, and patients considered to be asymptomatic frequently report improvement in quality-of-life indexes. 11–14 Observation and pharmacologic therapy are less effective and less cost-effective than surgery, even when the patient is considered asymptomatic. 15 Long-term hypercalcemia should be avoided because of potential deleterious effects. 16–18 Referral to an experienced parathyroid surgeon is advised to determine whether the likelihood and benefits of cure outweigh the anticipated risks of the procedure. Quiz Ref IDRecommendation 3–1: Parathyroidectomy is indicated, and is the preferred treatment, for all patients with symptomatic pHPT.

### Efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone replacement with transCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism: 26-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^113uTUT8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease caused by insufficient or absent production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with multiorgan involvement. Under normal physiological conditions, PTH and its downstream hormone calcitriol are the primary regulators of calcium and phosphate and act on the bone, kidney, and intestine. Hypoparathyroidism can lead to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. As a result, individuals with hypoparathyroidism may experience a range of severe and potentially life‐threatening short‐term and long‐term complications, including neuromuscular irritability, renal complications, and vascular calcifications. Cognitive impairment, perhaps independent of abnormalities in calcium levels, is also common. All of these are associated with reduced health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). The negative impact of these hypoparathyroidism symptoms on daily life and work productivity is substantial and underrecognized, despite published studies highlighting them.

Current consensus guidelines for the long‐term management of chronic hypoparathyroidism have identified six therapeutic goals: (i) prevent signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia; (ii) maintain the serum calcium concentration within or slightly below the normal range; (iii) maintain the calcium × phosphate product below 55 mg²/dL² (4.4 mmol²/L²); (iv) avoid hypercalciuria; (v) avoid hypercalcemia; and (vi) avoid renal (nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis) and other extraskeletal calcifications. Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism consists of active vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol or its analog alfacalcidol) and large quantities of calcium, and is associated with a substantial pill burden. Although conventional therapy targets hypocalcemia and its acute symptoms, it fails to restore the normal physiological effects of PTH. Additionally, long‐term conventional therapy may increase the filtered load of calcium and further elevate serum phosphorus thereby increasing the risk of nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney disease. Conventional therapy also does not improve HRQoL or the functional and mental health status of individuals with hypoparathyroidism.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^117Ks59L]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors, thresholds, and management are summarized as follows: Hypoparathyroidism occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management, and in general, a postoperative PTH level ≤ 15 pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoparathyroidism. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoparathyroidism can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide for supplementation; for more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoparathyroidism has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Is calcium supplementation always needed in patients with hypoparathyroidism? [^114dU9KF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral calcium salts are recommended for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), although dosimetry is variable between individual patients and clinicians. However, patient feedback on calcium salts can be negative, particularly due to gastrointestinal side effects and hypercalciuria-related complications. We begin with a clinical case of a HypoPT patient taking oral calcium salts following thyroid surgery, who requested support in reducing her dose of these with a view to stopping entirely. To evaluate her request, we first describe the usual treatment of HypoPT according to current guidance and then present data from (a) a case note review of a cohort of 24 HypoPT patients managed with a "no calcium" treatment regimen by single physician (b) a comprehensive online survey of HypoPT patients' treatment and experiences (n = 330). The case note review found that target range serum calcium levels were successfully achieved in all 24 patients since transitioning to a "no calcium" regimen, without any breakthrough hypocalcaemia-related symptoms, the development of new renal stones, the occurrence of calcium-related hospital admissions or the finding of significant hypercalciuria. The online survey identified 36% of HypoPT patients who continued to take activated vitamin D, but had discontinued calcium supplements. HypoPT patients not currently taking calcium reported a significantly lower prevalence of adverse effects and outcomes, both compared with their previous experiences whilst taking calcium and also compared with the 64% of patients who continued to take oral calcium. We conclude that, subject to methodological limitations, there are significant issues of tolerability arising from conventional calcium-based treatment regimens for patients with chronic HypoPT. For selected patients, it may be reasonable to facilitate a managed therapeutic transition to "no calcium" regimen, and we also propose that calcium-based regimes be prospectively evaluated against calcium-free (or calcium-low) alternatives.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^114vqPTs]. Osteoporosis International (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism if serum calcium is elevated (total calcium corrected for albumin or elevated ionized calcium) in the presence of an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH in the absence of conditions mimicking primary hyperparathyroidism (thiazide diuretics or lithium) and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

### UK national chronic hypoparathyroidism audit [^115abRXW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

Endocrine leads in 117 endocrine departments in the United Kingdom were invited to complete a survey of up to 5 sequential cases of chronic hypoparathyroidism seen in their department's outpatient clinics in the preceding 6 months. The data collection tool and audit standards were developed from the recommendations in the European Society for Endocrinology Chronic Hypoparathyroidism management guideline. Specifically, the audit standards employed were:
Treatment standards: (1) Recommend treatment of all patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with an albumin adjusted serum calcium level < 2.0 mmol/L; (2) Recommend the use of activated vitamin D analogues plus calcium supplements in divided doses as the primary therapy; (3) Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues; (4) Recommend vitamin D supplementation in a daily dose of 400–800 IU to patients treated with activated vitamin D analogues.
Monitoring standards: (5) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of albumin adjusted serum calcium (e.g. every 3–6 months); (6) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum phosphate (e.g. every 3–6 months); (7) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of serum magnesium (e.g. every 3–6 months); (8) Recommend routine biochemical monitoring of creatinine (e.g. every 3–6 months); (9) Recommend routine monitoring of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) (e.g. every 3–6 months); (10) Recommend routine assessment of symptoms of hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia at regular time intervals (e.g. every 3–6 months); (11) Suggest considering monitoring of 24 h urinary calcium excretion at regular intervals (1–2 yearly); (12) Recommend renal imaging if a patient has symptoms of renal stone disease or if serum creatinine levels start to rise; (13) Advise against routine monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.

### Efficacy and safety of parathyroid hormone replacement with transCon PTH in hypoparathyroidism: 26-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^114jLYcv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants

Eligible participants included men and nonpregnant women (≥ 18 years of age) with chronic hypoparathyroidism of postsurgical, autoimmune, genetic, or idiopathic etiologies for a duration of at least 26 weeks. Participants must have been treated with calcitriol ≥ 0.5 μg/d or alfacalcidol ≥ 1.0 μg/d in addition to elemental calcium ≥ 800 mg/d for at least 12 weeks before screening. Stable doses of conventional therapy (ie, active vitamin D and calcium) were required for at least 5 weeks before screening, not precluding occasional (≤ 2/week) pro re nata (PRN, as needed) doses of calcium and/or active vitamin D. To ensure safety for those who might be randomized to the placebo arm, participants were required to achieve an albumin‐adjusted or ionized serum calcium within the normal range or slightly below the normal range (albumin‐adjusted serum calcium 7.8–10.6 mg/dL [1.95–2.64 mmol/L] or ionized serum calcium 4.40–5.29 mg/dL [1.10–1.32 mmol/L]), 25(OH) vitamin D levels 20–80 ng/mL (49–200 nmol/L), and magnesium levels ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L), as is currently the goal of conventional treatment. Urinary calcium excretion ≥ 125 mg/24 h and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² was required for enrollment. The diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism was confirmed by the presence of persistent hypocalcemia in the setting of inappropriately low serum PTH levels. Low PTH levels were defined as at or below the median value of the reference range at the performing laboratory. Individuals with impaired responsiveness to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism) or any disease that might affect calcium metabolism, calcium × phosphate homeostasis, or PTH levels other than hypoparathyroidism were excluded. Thiazide diuretic use was not allowed within 4 weeks before the 24‐hour urine collection before visit 1, and the use of PTH analogs was not allowed within 4 weeks of screening. Eligible participants could not have used other drugs known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (except for active vitamin D analogs and elemental calcium) within 12 weeks before screening or osteoporosis therapies known to influence calcium and bone metabolism (ie, bisphosphonate) within 2 years before screening. The use of loop diuretics, phosphate binders, digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, biotin > 30 μg/d, and systemic corticosteroids (other than as replacement therapy) were not permitted during the trial. All participants provided signed informed consent before treatment initiation.

Table 1
Detailed breakdown of treatments used

In terms of compliance with the audit standards, these were, for the treatment standards: 63.5% for standard 1 (Recommend treatment of all patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism with an albumin adjusted serum calcium level < 2.0 mmol/L); 62.5% for standard 2 (Recommend the use of activated vitamin D analogues plus calcium supplements in divided doses as the primary therapy). Patients who had both a vitamin D analogue and a calcium supplement prescribed met the standard; 98.8% for standard 3 (Recommend against the routine use of replacement therapy with PTH or PTH analogues.) and 60.0% for standard 4 (Recommend vitamin D supplementations in a daily dose of 400–800 IU to patients treated with activated vitamin D analogues) (Figure 1A). However, it should be noted that the compliance with standard 1 was calculated from a partially incomplete data set. Although 40 out of 80 returns demonstrated compliance against this standard (50%), 23 (28.8%) returns demonstrated non compliance. against this standard and a further 17 returns contained incomplete data (21.3%), incomplete data sets arose as a result of biochemical results from the time of diagnosis not being available on the replies. The headline compliance figure of 63.5% was, therefore, calculated as a percentage of the 63 returns containing complete data for this standard.

### Initial assessment and monitoring of patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism: a systematic current practice survey [^112SGMJi]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life (QoL). The goals of management for chronic HypoPT include improvement in QoL and the prevention of both hypo- and hypercalcemia symptoms and long-term complications. Several groups have provided consensus statements and guidelines on the management of HypoPT; however, due to limited evidence, these recommendations have largely been based on literature reviews, expert opinion, and consensus statements. The objective of this study was to use a systematic approach to describe current practice for the initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. We developed a survey asking experts in the field to select the responses that best reflect their current practice. The survey found no differences in responses between nonsurgical and postsurgical patient assessment. For new patients, respondents usually performed an assessment of serum lab profile (calcium [either albumin-adjusted or ionized], magnesium, creatinine, phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D), 24-hour urine (creatinine, calcium), and a renal ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. For follow-up patients, most respondents perform blood tests and urine tests every 6months or less frequently. The reported clinical practice patterns for monitoring for complications of chronic HypoPT vary considerably among respondents. Based on the responses in this systematic expert practice survey, we provide practice suggestions for initial assessment and follow-up of patients with chronic HypoPT. In addition, we highlight areas with significant variation in practice and identify important areas for future research. © 2022 The Authors.
