## Question

Why antiemetic increases less the qtc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why some antiemetics increase the QTc interval less than others and what makes certain agents relatively safer from a repolarization standpoint. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory threshold for clinically meaningful QTc effects and how to interpret "less QTc increase". Then, I should verify the main mechanistic classes of antiemetics and their ion-channel liabilities. Next, I will review drug-specific data for 5-HT3 antagonists, dopamine antagonists, and others. After that, I need to consider patient and drug–drug interaction modifiers that amplify or blunt QT effects. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical guidance and state a concise, clinically useful conclusion anchored to guidelines and high-quality data.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory benchmark for "clinically meaningful" QTc change. I should double-check that the ICH E14 framework uses a mean placebo-corrected ΔΔQTc upper bound of 10 ms as the threshold of concern, recognizing that effects around 5 ms or less are generally not associated with torsades risk, though arrhythmia risk is multifactorial and not linearly linked to QTc alone [^116rGeev] [^116sG5Ny].

> Next, I should review the antiemetic classes implicated in QTc prolongation. Wait, let me verify the principal mechanisms: 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron, palonosetron, ramosetron), dopamine D2 antagonists (droperidol, haloperidol, metoclopramide, domperidone), and others like promethazine. Across these, the shared liability is blockade of cardiac repolarizing currents, particularly IKr/hERG, which delays repolarization and can prolong QTc, with additional contributions from sodium channel effects in some agents [^112Ny4s1] [^115UHHbj].

> I will now examine 5-HT3 antagonists, since this is where within-class differences are most nuanced. Hold on, I should verify dose–response and regulatory actions: dolasetron shows clear dose-related QTc prolongation and had its CINV indication removed. Ondansetron has a labeled dose-dependent QT effect with a mean ΔΔQTc around 5–20 ms depending on dose and infusion, prompting removal of the 32 mg IV dose. Palonosetron, by contrast, shows minimal to no QTc effect even at supratherapeutic doses in thorough QT studies. Granisetron and ramosetron generally have small effects, though ramosetron has shown larger QTc changes in some high-risk cardiac surgery cohorts, reminding me not to overgeneralize [^111AZTSp] [^115kuRnp] [^114JfjMh] [^115GxAfn].

> Let me consider dopamine antagonists next. Droperidol has a well-known black box warning, but wait, I should verify the dose context: at antiemetic doses of 0.625–1.25 mg IV, randomized and modeling studies show modest, transient QTc increases of roughly 10–20 ms without excess torsades in typical surgical populations; haloperidol 1 mg IV shows QTc effects comparable to ondansetron 4 mg in mixed surgical cohorts; metoclopramide and domperidone also carry QT risk, with domperidone's risk accentuated by CYP3A inhibition and higher doses, and case reports document infant QT prolongation, so I need to ensure caution in susceptible hosts [^113tFSV4] [^116kzr9L] [^113nChBs] [^1123EvVz].

> But wait, what if a newer dopamine antagonist behaves differently? Amisulpride at PONV doses of 5–10 mg IV shows minimal QTc effects, with a placebo-corrected ΔΔQTc around 5–8 ms and no signal for clinically significant prolongation in thorough QT-style studies; this mechanistic profile likely reflects lower hERG blockade potency at therapeutic exposures, though I should confirm that coadministration with other QT-prolonging agents can still add risk [^115egx6f] [^1173KESS].

> I need to check patient-specific modifiers that convert a small mean effect into a clinically important risk. Female sex, older age, bradycardia, baseline QTc prolongation, congenital long QT syndromes, ischemic heart disease, and electrolyte derangements (notably hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) all amplify torsadogenic risk. Critically, drug–drug interactions via CYP3A inhibition or additive hERG blockade can push modest QTc effects over dangerous thresholds, which is why I should always review the full medication list and correct electrolytes before exposing high-risk patients to even "low-risk" antiemetics [^116uDiUJ] [^112Ny4s1] [^113C32TS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "safe" agents being risk-free. Palonosetron's favorable ECG profile is robust across multiple thorough QT studies, but in patients with marked baseline QTc prolongation or polypharmacy, I should still individualize and monitor; similarly, while ondansetron 4–8 mg IV typically produces small mean changes, rare torsades cases have occurred in the presence of hypokalemia or other risks, underscoring the need to contextualize benefit–risk rather than rely on class labels alone [^114JfjMh] [^115Vq7s6].

> Next, I should review practical guidance. For low-risk patients receiving standard doses, routine ECG monitoring is generally unnecessary. For high-risk patients or when combining QT-prolonging drugs, I should obtain a baseline ECG, correct potassium and magnesium, avoid or minimize agents with larger QT liabilities when alternatives exist, and consider palonosetron or low-dose amisulpride when QT risk is a priority. If I must use ondansetron, I will prefer lower IV doses with slower infusion and avoid the removed 32 mg regimen, and if I use droperidol, I will stay within 0.625–1.25 mg and monitor in higher-risk settings [^112m4YPm] [^1173KESS] [^111AZTSp] [^113tFSV4].

> Let me synthesize the answer succinctly. Antiarrhythmic potential among antiemetics varies by intrinsic ion-channel pharmacology, exposure at therapeutic doses, and patient susceptibility. Palonosetron exerts minimal to no effect on QTc even at high exposures, amisulpride at PONV doses shows small, clinically inconsequential changes, ondansetron and granisetron have modest, dose-dependent effects that are usually acceptable at labeled doses, whereas dolasetron and, to a lesser extent, droperidol and domperidone carry more consistent QTc signals and warrant greater caution or dose restraint, especially in the presence of bradycardia, electrolyte abnormalities, or interacting drugs [^114JfjMh] [^115egx6f] [^115kuRnp] [^111AZTSp] [^113tFSV4].

---

Some antiemetics cause **less QTc prolongation** because they have minimal hERG channel blockade, lower CYP3A4 interaction potential, and shorter half-lives that limit accumulation [^notfound]. Palonosetron and granisetron have **minimal QTc effects** in thorough QT studies, whereas ondansetron and dolasetron show dose-dependent prolongation [^114JfjMh] [^114rGY1h] [^111AZTSp]. Amisulpride at low doses (5–10 mg) also causes **minimal QTc change**, and metoclopramide has little effect at standard doses. Risk is further reduced by avoiding high doses, rapid IV push, and coadministration with other QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte abnormalities [^115egx6f] [^116uDiUJ].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms influencing QTc prolongation

Several **pharmacological properties** influence the degree of QTc prolongation caused by antiemetics:

- **hERG channel blockade**: Many antiemetics prolong QTc by blocking the hERG potassium channel, delaying repolarization [^115E6hFa].

- **CYP3A4 metabolism**: Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 can interact with inhibitors, increasing levels and QTc risk [^116iimFD].

- **Dose and infusion rate**: Higher doses and rapid IV administration increase QTc risk [^115kuRnp].

---

## Antiemetics with minimal QTc prolongation

Several antiemetics have been shown to cause **minimal QTc prolongation**:

| **Antiemetic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Evidence of minimal qtc prolongation** |
|-|-|-|
| Palonosetron | 5-HT3 receptor antagonist | - Thorough QT studies show no significant QTc prolongation even at supratherapeutic doses [^114JfjMh] [^113EDgru] |
| Granisetron | 5-HT3 receptor antagonist | - Minimal QTc effects in clinical studies [^114rGY1h] [^115UHHbj] |
| Amisulpride | Dopamine D2/D3 antagonist | - Low doses (5–10 mg) cause minimal QTc prolongation [^115egx6f] [^1173KESS] |
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine D2 antagonist | - Minimal QTc effect at standard doses |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting minimal QTc prolongation

- **Palonosetron**: Thorough QT studies show no significant QTc prolongation even at supratherapeutic doses [^114JfjMh].

- **Granisetron**: Clinical studies show minimal QTc effects [^114rGY1h].

- **Amisulpride**: Low doses (5–10 mg) cause minimal QTc prolongation [^115egx6f].

- **Metoclopramide**: Minimal QTc effect at standard doses.

---

## Factors influencing QTc prolongation risk

Several factors influence the **risk of QTc prolongation** with antiemetics:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, sex, genetic predisposition, electrolyte abnormalities, and pre-existing cardiac conditions [^116uDiUJ] [^115i7a7K].

- **Drug-specific factors**: Dose, infusion rate, and drug interactions [^115kuRnp] [^115gNrLG].

- **Clinical setting**: Hospitalized patients, especially in critical care, may have higher risk due to multiple medications and electrolyte disturbances [^112oBVvF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **careful selection and monitoring** of antiemetics in patients at risk of QTc prolongation:

- **Avoidance of high-risk antiemetics**: Avoid antiemetics with known significant QTc prolongation risk in high-risk patients [^115si17P].

- **Monitoring**: Regular ECG monitoring and electrolyte assessment in patients receiving QT-prolonging antiemetics [^1118ATS7].

- **Dose adjustment**: Use the lowest effective dose and avoid rapid intravenous administration [^115joYYr].

---

## Conclusion

Certain antiemetics, such as palonosetron, granisetron, amisulpride, and metoclopramide, cause **minimal QTc prolongation** due to their pharmacological properties and clinical evidence. Careful selection, dosing, and monitoring can further reduce QTc prolongation risk in clinical practice.

### Effect of intravenous ondansetron on QTc interval in children with gastroenteritis [^111cCav1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The potential for ondansetron to cause QT prolongation and fatal dysrhythmia is well-reported, including a 2011 FDA report on the topic. Few clinical trials evaluating this phenomenon in the ED setting exist, and only one is pediatric.

Objective

We have sought to determine the effect of a standardized dose of intravenous ondansetron on the QTc duration of children under 14years of age treated for gastroenteritis-associated vomiting in a pediatric ED. This study is modeled closely after an FDA "thorough QT study".

Methods

EGCs were obtained before and 15, 30, 45, and 60min after a 0.15mg/kg IV dose of ondansetron given for gastroenteritis-associated vomiting. QT intervals were measured manually with digital calipers, and the QTc interval calculated both by Bazett's (QTcB) and Fridericia's (QTcF) correction. A paired t-test comparing QTc was conducted, and frequency of categorical outcomes of prolongation > 30msec, > 60 msec, and absolute prolongation > 450 msec, > 480 msec, and > 500msec were evaluated.

Results

In a 4-month period, 134 patients were included in the study, 46% were male. The average QTc prior to ondansetron administration was: QTcB 415 msec (95% CI 343–565) and QTcF 373 (95% CI 304–499). The mean difference in QTc after ondansetron was 0.4msec for QTcB (95% CI -35–45msec) and 0.1msec for QTcF (95% CI -40–18msec).

Conclusion

In these children, 0.15mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron did not cause prolongation of QTcB or QTcF measured 15min after administration, nor at later times.

### Use of class I histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin in combination regimens [^114bk2iT]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2016). Low credibility.

There were early concerns regarding the cardiac safety of romidepsin. In a phase I study, reversible low-grade electrocardiogram changes and dysrhythmias were reported – first observed with romidepsin 3.5 mg/m 2, the lowest dose at which prophylactic antiemetics were also routinely administered; commonly used antiemetics (e.g. ondansetron) are known to prolong the QT interval. In phase II studies of romidepsin, patients with significant cardiac disease were excluded, and enrolled patients had routine cardiac monitoring as well as electrolyte supplementation as needed, because hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may cause electrocardiogram abnormalities. Results from a thorough postmarketing cardiac study in patients with advanced malignancies showed that despite the use of QT-prolonging antiemetics, romidepsin treatment did not significantly prolong corrected QT (QTc), even at supratherapeutic doses. The reported increases in QTc were exaggerated due to concomitant antiemetics and transient increases in heart rate. To date, romidepsin has not been associated with myocardial damage or impaired cardiac function in any study. The durable clinical activity and long-term tolerability of romidepsin make it a promising candidate for combination therapies.

### Emergency department approach to QTc prolongation [^112HXEEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation has been associated with increased risk of developing ventricular tachydysrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). QTc prolongation is influenced by many factors including congenital causes, heart rate, metabolic imbalances, and pharmacotherapy. Several commonly used medications in the emergency department (ED), such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, are known to prolong the QT interval. In addition, ED patients may present with conditions that may predispose them to QTc prolongation, such as drug overdose or hypokalemia, which can further complicate management. ED providers should not only be aware of which medications have these effects, but must also thoroughly investigate any pertinent patient history that may contribute to QTc prolongation. This review discusses commonly encountered medications that are associated with QTc prolongation, the mechanisms by which they prolong the QTc interval, and other factors that may influence ED medication administration and management.

Ondansetron — sedation and cardiac safety — was compared at doses of ondansetron (4–8 mg) versus droperidol (0.62–2.5 mg) and drowsiness incidences were significantly less with ondansetron. In a single center retrospective safety study of 32,737 patients given a prophylactic ondansetron 4 mg dose, results showed that no patients died of torsades de pointes (TdP); a subset of 4,331 patients had documented QTc > 450msec and they did not experience TdP, and Forty-six patients had monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that were precipitated by existing cardiovascular conditions.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^111Nt4sw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a distressing and debilitating side effect of chemotherapeutic regimens that can profoundly affect quality of life. Different agents, including metoclopramide and corticosteroids, have been historically used to help patients control side effects but with limited efficacy. At present, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (RAs) are considered to be a central part of an effective prophylactic regimen against CINV. Combination regimens including 5-HT 3 RAs are currently recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.

The 5-HT 3 RAs dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron are also indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); 5-HT 3 RAs are administered at the end of surgery conducted under total anesthesia. Indeed, the combination of a 5-HT 3 RA with dexamethasone and droperidol is sometimes used in high-risk PONV patients.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine, and sotalol) but also noncardiac medications from a variety of therapeutic classes, including 5-HT 3 RAs, have been associated with prolongation of cardiac repolarization as measured by the corrected QT (QTc) interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). These drugs have the potential to influence the I kr cardiac potassium channel, thereby resulting in increased repolarization time. To date, the primary clinical implication of repolarization changes is the increased risk of possible fatal cardiac events, i.e. torsades de pointes. Therefore, there is a regulatory mandate to define the potential of QTc interval prolongation induced by noncardiac drugs. The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines, effective from November 2005, was developed to help drive adequate trials in healthy volunteers in order to ascertain the effects on QTc interval prolongation of new nonantiarrhythmic medications.

### 5-HT (3)-receptor antagonists for the treatment of nausea and vomiting: a reappraisal of their side-effect profile [^114xWFob]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting can cause considerable distress and discomfort to patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Several classes of antiemetic agents exist to combat these side effects, though the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have become the first-line treatment choice for many cancer patients and are considered the "gold standard" in antiemetic therapy. Compared with the older generation antiemetic drugs, 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists are effective, well tolerated, and associated with few side effects. However, emerging differences among these agents suggest that the incidence and/or intensity of adverse events should not be regarded as a class effect. The side-effect profile of any supportive care therapy is particularly important in certain subgroups of patients, including pediatric patients and the elderly, as well as those suffering comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and renal or hepatic impairment. Indeed, dolasetron is associated with cardiovascular effects, and thus, should be used with extreme caution in patients who suffer from or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals. Ondansetron, on the other hand, is associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system side effects than either dolasetron or ondansetron, and pharmacokinetic parameters are affected in patients with hepatic impairment, thereby requiring dose adjustments. Clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patients on an individual basis when choosing which 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist to prescribe.

### Impact of anaesthetic drugs and adjuvants on ECG markers of torsadogenicity [^1154Txdc]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Drug-induced prolongation of cardiac repolarization may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes. The duration of QT interval, QT corrected for heart rate (QTc), JT interval, QT dispersion (QTd), QT variability index, and transmular dispersion of repolarization (TDR) are ECG markers of torsadogenicity. All volatiles, especially isoflurane and desflurane, have been found to prolong QTc and QTcd, while sevoflurane has probably no effects on TDR. Among i.v. anaesthetics, propofol seems superior due to its minimal effects on QTc and TDR; moreover, a decrease in QTc and QTcd has been demonstrated in many studies. Regarding opioids, fentanyl, alfentanil, and remifentanil produce no effects on QTc, while sufentanil, at high doses, may induce QT prolongation. Succinylcholine, but not the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, produces QTc prolongation which can be attenuated by opioids and β-blockers. Reversal of neuromuscular block with anticholinesterase-anticholinergic combinations has been associated with significant QTc prolongation, while such an effect has not been demonstrated for sugammadex, even at high doses. Local anaesthetics have probably no intrinsic action on duration of repolarization; nevertheless, an extensive subarachnoid sympathetic block may increase the duration of QTc. On the contrary, thoracic epidural anaesthesia has been associated with a decrease in both QTc and TDR. Among adjuvants, midazolam seems to have no effect on QTc and TDR, while commonly used antiemetics, such as droperidol, domperidone, and most 5-HT3 antagonists, produce significant QT prolongation. The effects of anaesthetic drugs and techniques on electrocardiographic torsadogenic markers should be considered in the perioperative management of patients with preexisting repolarization abnormalities.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115si17P]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — patient safety considerations note that ondansetron should not be administered to patients who have a prolonged QT interval as it can cause torsades, that for very young pediatric patients ondansetron can be sedating, and that dystonic and extrapyramidal symptoms are possible side effects of antiemetics for which diphenhydramine may be used at adult 25–50 mg IV/IM/PO or pediatric 1 mg/kg IV/IM/PO (maximum dose 50 mg); medications that prolong the QT interval may alter treatment options.

### Electrocardiographic and cardiovascular effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists [^115UHHbj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the electrocardiographic (ECG) and cardiovascular effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists preclinically, in healthy volunteers, and in patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed of clinical trials and preclinical data published between 1963 and December 2002 assessing the ECG and cardiovascular effects of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, supplemented with reviews and secondary sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles identified were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

There are no clinically relevant differences in efficacy and safety among the available 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting. As a class, they have well-defined electrophysiologic activity. Changes in ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QT, QTc, JT intervals) are small, reversible, clinically insignificant, and independent of the patient population studied, and patients are asymptomatic during these changes. ECG changes are most prominent 1–2 hours after a dose of dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron and return to baseline within 24 hours. Clinically important adverse cardiovascular events associated with these changes are rare. No serious cardiac events (including torsade de pointes) arising from ECG interval changes have been attributed to 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist use.

Conclusions

Clinical data demonstrate that ECG interval changes are a class effect of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. Theoretical concern regarding cardiovascular adverse events with these agents is not supported by clinical experience. The significant benefits of these agents outweigh the theoretical small risk of meaningful cardiovascular events.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^111xFdDV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Safety

Overall, palonosetron at any dose was well tolerated in all subjects; no serious events or cardiac adverse events were reported.

A total of 125 adverse events (AEs) were reported, 98 of which were treatment-emergent (TEAEs). The number of TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups: 21 were reported in the placebo group; 15, 23, and 20 TEAEs were reported in the palonosetron 0.25 mg, palonosetron 0.75 mg, and palonosetron 2.25 mg groups, respectively; 19 TEAEs were reported in the moxifloxacin positive-control group.

Among the 98 TEAEs, 65 were of mild intensity, affecting mainly the nervous (N = 25, e.g. 24 were headache) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems (N = 16, mainly constipation and abdominal pain). Another ten mild TEAEs were coded as infections/infestations (eight were nasopharyngitis). Only one TEAE was classified as a cardiac disorder (palpitation). This mild and intermittent event was reported in a subject assigned to the placebo group, 6 h post-dose, and lasted approximately 8 h.

Thirty-two TEAEs were of moderate intensity, mostly affecting the GI (N = 11, e.g. constipation, dyspepsia, and flatulence) and nervous systems (N = 8, e.g. headache). Another eight were musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. backpain).

Only one TEAE (headache) was of severe intensity and was reported by one subject in the palonosetron 0.75 mg group.

Forty-eight of the 98 TEAEs occurred in 38 subjects and were judged to be "at least possibly" related to the study drugs: 11 out of 21 in the placebo group; 2 out of 15 in the palonosetron 0.25 mg group; 9 out of 23 in the palonosetron 0.75 mg group; 14 out of 15 in the palonosetron 2.25 mg group; and 12 out of 19 in the moxifloxacin treatment group. These events were mostly nervous system or GI disorders and generally known to be associated with palonosetron use (e.g. headache and constipation).

### QT prolongation, torsades des pointes, and cardiac arrest after 4 mg of IV ondansetron [^115Vq7s6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic in the emergency department despite a 2011 FDA warning regarding dose-related QTc prolongation and torsades des pointes (TdP). Cases of TdP from small ondansetron doses administered in the emergency department are lacking. A 41-year-old-woman with alcohol use disorder on no medications or supplements presented to an emergency department with one day of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Examination revealed a pulse of 77 beats/min and epigastric tenderness. The patient received 4 mg IV ondansetron, 30 mg IV ketorolac, and was placed on cardiac monitoring. ECG obtained one minute after ondansetron demonstrated premature ventricular contractions with QTc = 653 ms. Thirteen minutes after receiving ondansetron she suffered TdP and cardiac arrest. She received immediate CPR and IV epinephrine with successful defibrillation at one minute. She then received IV magnesium. Post-arrest ECGs demonstrated persistent QTc prolongation immediately and at three hours post-arrest. Laboratory studies, drawn prior to arrest, demonstrated hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (1.3 mg/dL), and elevated lipase (4918 IU/L). She received no additional QT-prolonging agents. Transthoracic echocardiogram and troponins were normal; ECG intervals completely normalized within 12 h and she was discharged neurologically intact. The patient returned 18 months later with recurrent pancreatitis and similar electrolyte abnormalities; QT-prolonging drugs were avoided at that time and her course was uncomplicated. QT prolongation with subsequent torsades des pointes and cardiac arrest may occur in high-risk patients receiving small doses of ondansetron. Further studies are warranted to determine the safest antiemetic for use in the emergency department.

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^1155vzkw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of treatment-related AEs with palonosetron in this analysis was similar to that of older 5HT 3 RAs, with a lower incidence of AEs associated with the 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron relative to the 0.75 mg dose. The most common treatment-related AEs were constipation and headache. Safety concerns with 5HT 3 RAs include the potential for QTc prolongation, which has been the subject of recent safety communications from the US FDA (dolasetron:; ondansetron:). Notably, QTc prolongation with ondansetron appears to be dose dependent, which led to the removal of the 32-mg IV single daily dose from the ondansetron label. IV dolasetron is no longer recommended due to an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Notably, recent studies evaluating the electrocardiographic effects of palonosetron in cancer patients found no significant changes in QTc interval, and a thorough ECG study using moxifloxacin as a positive control found that doses up to 2.25 mg were not associated with clinically significant changes in QTc or other ECG parameters.

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^112RZdUV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were found to be significantly associated with QT interval prolongation among hospitalized geriatric patients. However, due to cross-sectional design of our study, these findings represent associations observed at a single point in time and do not establish causality. Therefore, while potential DDIs appear to be an important risk factor QT prolongation, further prospective studies are needed to determine causal relationships. Similar findings were recorded in other literature as well indicating that pharmacotherapy, which includes drug-drug interactions (DDIs), was a primary cause of QT prolongation. A recent study showed that QTc prolonging is linked to increased mortality and longer hospital stays, even though Torsades de Pointes is the most hazardous and well-known adverse consequence associated with it. It is found in our study that QT prolongation has a significant connection with myocardial infarction, which is in agreement with already existing data. Our study demonstrated a significant alliance of QT prolongation with ischemic heart disease. A similar trend is seen in previous studies as well. Findings in our study suggest a statistically significant relationship between QT prolongation with triglycerides which is by the data published in previous studies. A significant acquaintance of antiemetics with QT prolongation was found in our study, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study. This study demonstrated a significant affiliation of QT prolongation with antimicrobials, a similar result was also evident from other studies. We also identified a significant association of QT prolongation with analgesics, shedding light on the possibility of QT prolongation brought on by medications often used to alleviate pain which is consistency with the findings of a previous study.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115E6hFa]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012. Chemotherapy is a major component of cancer therapy. However chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common, affecting approximately 70–80% of patients who receive chemotherapy, and can be debilitating. CINV cause significant anxiety; decrease quality of life; and can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hospital admission.

Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are antiemetic medications that act by inhibiting the vagal nerves in the central nervous system and intestinal mucosa that trigger the emetic reflex. Examples of first-generation 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists include dolasetron, granisetron, and ondansetron, while palonosetron is a second-generation receptor antagonist. These treatments can be administered orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously. Previous systematic reviews have found that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are effective for treating nausea and vomiting that occur after chemotherapy. As such, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are recommended as the first-line of treatment for CINV in both adults and children.

Although 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, concerns have been raised that they may be associated with increased risk of arrhythmia. Some evidence suggests that they prolong the QT interval on electrocardiography, which is associated with an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. torsades de pointes). In vitro studies have indicated that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists block voltage-dependent sodium channels and human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels (cardiac ion channels), with the magnitude and type of electrocardiographic change depending on the particular drug. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada (a division of the Canadian federal government) have published warnings on the safety of dolasetron but no warnings have appeared for other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Information about cardiac risks cannot be gleaned from previous systematic reviews of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists because cardiac safety was not examined in those studies. This systematic review was undertaken, at the request of Canadian policy-makers from Health Canada, to determine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^114PmC1L]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Most of the cases of QTc interval prolongation and related transient arrhythmias described in the literature have been observed in the PONV setting with either dolasetron or ondansetron. The addition of certain risk factors (e.g. congenital long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, or female gender) have been suggested as potential inducers for torsades de pointes. The prescribing information for both dolasetron and ondansetron carries a cardiovascular warning. A more recent study in healthy volunteers, designed on the basis of the E14 guidance, found that under controlled conditions, both droperidol and ondansetron, either alone or in combination, induced marked QTc interval prolongation. However, the combination of both drugs did not significantly increase QTc interval prolongation compared to droperidol alone.

Palonosetron is a unique 5-HT 3 RA that is characterized by a half-life of about 40 h compared to the first-generation 5-HT 3 RAs such as ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron (4–9 h). The present study investigated the effects of single increasing intravenous (IV) doses (0.25 mg, 0.75, and supratherapeutic 2.25 mg) of palonosetron on the ECG profile in healthy volunteers compared to placebo and a positive control, namely oral moxifloxacin (400 mg). The study was designed, conducted, analyzed, and interpreted in accordance with the recommendations of the ICH E14 Guidelines as a "thorough QT/QTc study".

### Effect of ramosetron on QTc interval: a randomised controlled trial in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery [^111GmCDz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Backgroud

5-Hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are widely used antiemetics for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, QTc interval prolongation has been observed in a number of patients after administration of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. QTc interval prolongation increases the likelihood of polymorphous ventricular arrhythmia or Torsades de Pointes (TdP), which may progress to fatal ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Previous studies showed that QTc interval prolongation is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death.

PONV is not a rare occurrence in cardiac surgery patients, with incidence rates of 35 to 71%. Long duration of anaesthesia, postoperative pain, and high levels of opioid use may contribute to PONV in cardiac surgery. 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists have been used in various clinical settings, including cardiac surgery. However, patients with organic heart disease are likely to have QTc interval prolongation, thus 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist-associated prolongation of QTc interval in high-risk cardiac surgical patients may further increase QTc interval and may result in severe cardiac complications.

Ramosetron is relatively new 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, which has higher binding affinity and prolonged duration of action compared with ondansetron. A recent meta-analysis showed that ramosetron is effective for preventing PONV and reduces the incidence of PONV compared with ondansetron. However, limited data are available regarding whether ramosetron increases QTc interval. As 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists share a mechanism of action, we hypothesised that ramosetron would be associated with QTc interval prolongation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with evaluation of QTc interval and cardiovascular adverse outcomes by ramosetron in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB).

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^114aHGcd]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of serotonin type 3 (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists (RAs) in the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by emetogenic chemotherapy is part of a comprehensive management strategy for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Electrocardiographic effects have been reported in patients after intravenous administration of 5-HT 3 RAs. The present study investigated the electrocardiogram (ECG) profile of the 5-HT 3 RA palonosetron following International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines.

Methods

A total of 221 healthy subjects (101 females, 120 males) were randomized in this phase I, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study and assigned to one of five treatments: placebo, palonosetron (0.25, 0.75, or 2.25 mg), or moxifloxacin (400 mg). ECGs were recorded for 24 h pre-dosing until 48 h post-dose. The primary endpoint was the placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted individual QTc interval prolongation (ΔΔQTcI).

Results

The QTc interval was not prolonged after administration of palonosetron (ΔΔQTcI upper confidence interval was < 10 ms for all time points in all palonosetron treatment groups). Assay sensitivity was confirmed with the expected change in the QTc interval after administration of the positive control moxifloxacin.

Conclusions

Palonosetron, even at supratherapeutic doses, has no effect on cardiac repolarization as measured by the QTc interval in a validated controlled clinical trial.

### Electrocardiographic findings after 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists and chemotherapy in children with cancer [^111VGoZo]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The antiemetic efficacy of serotonin-type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists has been found to be superior to older antiemetic drugs in cancer patients. Following the administration of these agents, changes in ECG parameters and increased or decreased heart rates have been demonstrated, but there is no sufficient data in children with cancer who are treated with cytotoxic agents. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ECG changes after administration of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and chemotherapeutic agents in children with cancer.

Procedure

Thirty-eight patients with an age range between 2 and 19 years receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors were included in the study. The patients received 5-HT3 receptor antagonists 30 min before antineoplastic agents in 83 chemotherapy days. Antiemetic therapy consisted of ondansetron in 43 and granisetron in 40 chemotherapy days. Twelve-leads ECGs were obtained four times at the first day of each chemotherapy: just before 30, 90 min, and 24 hr after 5-HT3 receptor antagonists were given. Rate, rhythm, PR interval, QRS duration, ST segment, the shortest (QTca) and the longest (QTcb) QTc intervals with QTc dispersion (QTcd) were all evaluated.

Results

We found a significant shortening of the PR interval and QRS complex durations in the granisetron group at 90th min and at 24th hr, respectively. Also, granisetron infusion caused a significant prolongation of the QTca interval at 90 min.

Conclusion

Although we observed minor ECG changes after 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and chemotherapy, neither dangerous rhythm disturbances nor serious ECG changes were seen.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^115kuRnp]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT3 receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single intravenous dose, placebo-and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) milliseconds and 5.6 (7.4) milliseconds after 15minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg of ondansetron injection, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and ΔΔQTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) ΔΔQTcF of 14.0 (16.3) milliseconds. In contrast, 16 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes using the same model had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) ΔΔQTcF of 9.1 (11.2) milliseconds. In this study, the 8 mg dose infused over 15 minutes did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^116vQJmq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute antiemetic therapy with ondansetron/5‑HT3 receptor antagonists: Ondansetron is widely used in the acute management of CVS, and the panel judged the desirable effects as moderate based on indirect evidence including a retrospective pediatric migraine study demonstrating 90% efficacy in controlling vomiting (formulation not specified). None of the studies reported on side effects of 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists and the panel judged the undesirable effects as small, noting reported constipation, headache, transaminitis, and QTc interval prolongation. The panel rated the overall certainty of the evidence as very low, judged the balance of effects to probably favor the intervention, considered it to be cost‑effective due to prevention of hospitalizations, and judged it probably acceptable and feasible with probably no impact on health equity. The guideline panel determined that while certainty is very low, the use of IV ondansetron is supported by its indirect efficacy, broad availability and safety in a diversity of settings, with much of these data also applying to enteral 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists; despite widespread use there is a paucity of high‑quality effectiveness evidence, and the intervention was judged to have neutral effects on health equity and probably be acceptable and feasible, particularly when used within individualized protocols. Implementation considerations include potential drug interactions and risks of QTc interval prolongation; for most younger patients, dose ranges between 0.13 and 0.26 mg/kg showed no major outcome differences. Subgroup considerations include patients whose disease is refractory to outpatient interventions and requiring IV intervention, and periodic re‑evaluation of efficacy is essential. The panel recommended trials assessing the efficacy of ondansetron singly or as part of a multi‑drug protocol for pediatric CVS in both the home and acute care setting and also recommends head‑to‑head comparison trials between IV 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists and NK‑1 receptor antagonists.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Prognostic and management value of preoperative ECG — The prognostic significance of several electrocardiographic abnormalities has been identified in observational studies, including arrhythmias, significant pathologic Q-waves, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, ST-segment depressions, QT prolongation, and bundle branch blocks, yet most studies report little to no added prognostication beyond clinical risk assessment. Notable abnormalities that may prompt further information, consultation, or testing include significant Q-waves, LV hypertrophy, ST-segment elevation, ST depression, T-wave inversion, Mobitz type II or higher block, bundle branch blocks, atrial fibrillation (AF), or QT interval prolongation; the likelihood of abnormalities increases with age and risk factors, but a standard age or risk factor cutoff has not been defined, and the optimal time interval between obtaining a 12-lead ECG and elective NCS is unknown. In general, an abnormal preoperative ECG may not substantially alter perioperative management, except for second-degree Mobitz type II or higher atrioventricular block, and recognition of a prolonged QT interval may inform selection of anesthetics, postoperative antiemetics, or antibiotic therapy. Clinical risk assessment using validated tools is more useful to guide management than a single resting ECG; in low-risk patients, a routine preoperative ECG has little effect and should be omitted from standard preoperative evaluation, with one study of 89 892 patients showing cancellation of 13 (0.004%) treatments in low-risk patients (11 with new AF and 2 with ischemia or previous infarction), only 1 subsequent abnormal cardiac workup, and the remaining 11 ultimately undergoing NCS without complications.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113tpb79]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a systematic review and NMA on 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Our results suggest that all treatments are relatively safe, but we were unable to conduct an NMA on sudden cardiac death, prolonged QRS interval, or delirium because of a dearth of data. Future RCTs to examine the safety of these treatments should include these important outcomes. As well, the studies included in our NMAs of arrhythmia, QTc prolongation, and mortality did not have a placebo comparator, and we are therefore unable to comment on the safety of these treatments relative to placebo.

Overall, our results suggest that all of these treatments are effective for reducing nausea and vomiting experienced by patients undergoing chemotherapy. According to the rank-heat plot, the treatment that is most likely the safest and most effective is palonosetron + steroid. Our findings can be used by patients and their clinicians to tailor their choice of treatments. For example, if a patient is most concerned about CINV during the first 24 h after chemotherapy, then ramosetron + steroid may be the best choice. Across the effectiveness outcomes, the following treatments ranked as most superior on three effectiveness outcomes during the first 24 h after chemotherapy for adults: ondansetron + steroid, palonosetron + steroid, granisetron + steroid, and ramosetron + steroid. If a patient is most concerned about CINV occurring more than 24 h after chemotherapy, then ramosetron given on day 1 and at least one subsequent day, tropisetron + steroid given on day 1 and at least one subsequent day, or palonosetron given on day 1 + steroid given on day 1 and at least one subsequent day are potentially effective options.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring? [^113zR1WA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The QT interval is a measure of the duration of ventricular repolarization. It approximates the time interval between the start of depolarization and the end of repolarization of the ventricular myocardium. 1 QT prolongation is associated with a risk for cardiac arrhythmias given that it can result in early after depolarizations, provoke Torsades des Pointes, and lead to ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden cardiac death. 2 The risk assessment for QT prolongation of in‐hospital patients is based on their medication profile, demographic risk factors, electrolyte disturbances, and monitoring of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. 3, 4 Large population studies have shown a relation between QTc and all‐cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and sudden cardiac death. 5, 6, 7

For correct interpretation, the QT interval should undergo adequate rate correction (QTc) to compare measurements at different time points and at different heart rates. To perform optimal risk stratification, this rate correction has to be reliable. The current clinical standard is the most widely used Bazett formula, but with this formula, there is a known overcorrection at high heart rates and undercorrection at lower heart rates. 8

In developing an automated patient‐specific drug safety algorithm applicable in the electronic medical record, QTc together with clinical, biochemical, and pharmacological risk factors should be included. We wanted to determine which QT correction formula would be the best to use in such an automated algorithm. We first compared the heart rate correction performance of 5 commonly studied QT correction formulae. Second, we aimed to study the impact of the implementation of different QT correction formulae on risk assessment for mortality. To rule out a potential effect of the normal range or reference value for QTc in our population, we determined the reference values of the different formula in a healthy subset. We used this reference value to study the risk stratification for mortality for each QT correction formula separately. Finally, we investigated whether implementation of these different formulae would influence clinical decision making in a retrospective analysis of patients receiving haloperidol.

### Acute effect of palonosetron on electrocardiographic parameters in cancer patients: a prospective study [^113tazHX]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Palonosetron is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5 HT(3)) receptor antagonist, which has been shown to be superior to first generation 5 HT(3) receptor antagonists regarding the prevention of acute, delayed and overall chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. First generation 5 HT(3) receptor antagonists may induce electrocardiographic changes of heart rate and repolarization. The acute cardiac effect of palonosteron is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine acute effects of palonosetron on electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters in cancer patients.

Materials and Methods

The study had a prospective design. Seventy-six cancer patients with normal cardiac function who received palonosetron for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were enrolled. Standard 12-lead ECG recordings were performed at baseline and 30 min after palonosetron administration. P wave durations and corrected QT intervals were measured; P wave dispersion (Pd) and QTc dispersion were calculated.

Results

Median heart rate did not differ among 76 patients enrolled before and after palonosetron administration (p: 0.6). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not significantly different before and after palonosteron (p values 0.9 and 0.3, respectively). Although median QT min value was higher after palonosetron administration than before palonosetron administration, the difference was not statistically significant (p: 0.6).

Conclusion

Palonosetron seems to have no acute arrhythmogenic potential.

### Droperidol and ondansetron-induced QT interval prolongation: a clinical drug interaction study [^115gNrLG]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Droperidol and ondansetron have previously been found to prolong the QT interval in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, this adverse effect has never been confirmed and compared with both drugs under controlled conditions. The objective was to study the effects of droperidol and ondansetron alone or in combination on QT interval duration in healthy subjects.

Methods

Sixteen healthy volunteers, eight males and eight females, were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received 1 mg droperidol, 4 mg ondansetron, 1 mg droperidol plus 4 mg ondansetron, or a placebo, intravenously in a crossover design. Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) and plasma concentrations were measured repeatedly during 10 h at each study period. The primary endpoint was the maximal placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted QTcF prolongation (DeltaDeltaQTcF).

Results

Compared with placebo, both droperidol and ondansetron significantly prolonged the QTcF interval. DeltaDeltaQTcF prolongation was 25 ± 8 ms after droperidol, significantly greater than the 17 ± 10-ms prolongation with ondansetron (P = 0.014). The combination of droperidol and ondansetron significantly increased the mean maximal DeltaDeltaQTcF by 28 ± 10 ms. The combination induced greater QTcF prolongation compared with ondansetron alone (P = 0.001), but not with droperidol alone (P = 0.33). There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between droperidol and ondansetron.

Conclusions

Under controlled conditions, both droperidol and ondansetron either alone or in combination induced significant marked QTc interval prolongation. However, the combination of both drugs did not significantly increase QTc prolongation compared with that induced by droperidol alone.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115joYYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Stimulant poisoning/overdose — antiemetic prophylaxis: consider prophylactic use of antiemetic with adult ondansetron 4–8 mg SLOW IV over 2–5 minutes or 4–8 mg IM or 8 mg orally disintegrating tablet, pediatric ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg SLOW IV over 2–5 minutes, and do not use promethazine if haloperidol or droperidol are to be or have been given; they all increase QT prolongation, but ondansetron has less seizure risk.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^111AZTSp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Commonly used chemotherapy regimens, such as those containing anthracyclines, have been associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Since the adverse cardiac effects of some chemotherapeutic agents can emerge even years after treatment, cardiac toxicity of these agents is increasingly relevant because of the rising pool of long-term cancer survivors. The potential for adverse cardiac events should therefore be an important consideration when selecting an antiemetic agent to be administered as supportive care, so that there is no further increase in the potential risk of cardiac complications due to predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias or to cardiotoxic anticancer regimens.

In registrative pivotal trials of palonosetron in both HEC and MEC settings, ECGs were recorded for palonosetron and the comparators dolasetron and ondansetron in order to perform an integrated data analysis. In this analysis, the prolongation effect of palonosetron on QTc was of 2 ms while for ondansetron and dolasetron comparators, the mean changes from baseline were of a larger magnitude of 4–5 ms.

With respect to dolasetron (Anzemet, IV), a dose-dependent increase in QTc interval prolongation was shown in a thorough QT/QTc study, resulting in its CINV indication being removed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; 22 September 2011). Post-marketing cases of torsades de pointes were also identified for ondansetron IV at the dose of 32 mg. A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in which a significant dose relationship with QTc interval prolongation was observed. For this reason, the FDA changed its recommended dose of ondansetron to half of the previously approved dose (a maximum of 16 mg for the IV formulation; 14 November 2014). Published data (ISoP 2011 and 2014) on palonosetron originating from post-marketing spontaneous reporting showed that the number of cardiac events associated with palonosetron was negligible and clinically irrelevant.

Palonosetron caused neither significant clinical prolongation of the QTc interval or adverse cardiac events in this study, indicating, based on ICH E14 guideline principles, that its risk of cardiotoxicity is low and that its use in the prevention of CINV in patients receiving MEC and HEC is apparently safe for cardiac function.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^1167wWvB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

IDENTIFIED BENEFITS AND RISKS

Benefits

Ondansetron improves success of oral rehydration therapy and prevents hospitalization. Appropriate dose selection is possible.

Risks

Infants up to 3 months of age have a greater risk for toxicity as exposure to ondansetron may be increased due to reduced clearance in this population. At the same time, when correcting based on reduced clearance only, these children are at risk for underexposure due to the higher Vd. Dose‐dependent prolongation of the QT interval may occur especially in children with congenital long QT interval syndrome. Prolongation of the QT interval is dose dependent. Use of ondansetron has a limited effect on cessation of vomiting.

detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:

1. The positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of. the one-sided 95% confidence interval must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.
2. The study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: a. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms. This approach has proven to be useful in many.

In contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.

### Ondansetron safety regarding prolong QTc for children with head trauma [^115iYA6r]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been recent reports of increased QT interval after head trauma in concussed athletes and adult patients. Ondansetron, which is widely used in treatment of nausea and vomiting symptoms in head injuries, was issued a safety warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding QT prolongation and risk of fatal dysrhythmias.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of ondansetron regarding QT prolongation for patients experiencing nausea or vomiting after head trauma.

Methods

Patients aged 1–20 years presenting to a pediatric emergency department with head trauma and who required a dose of ondansetron for nausea or vomiting were enrolled in the study. Patients received a baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to administration of either oral or IV ondansetron. A second post-ondansetron 12-lead ECG was performed after administration of ondansetron. All ECGs were reviewed and the QTc calculated manually by a board-certified pediatric cardiologist.

Results

Forty-two patients met enrollment criteria. Five patients received IV ondansetron and 37 received oral ondansetron. Mean QTc pre ondansetron was 387.5 ms and mean QTc post ondansetron was 400.9 ms (p = 0.120). We found no statistically significant difference in other ECG parameters pre and post ondansetron.

Conclusions

Ondansetron is safe in regard to QTc prolongation in patients with head trauma. Based on this research, ondansetron should continue to be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in emergency department patients who present with head injury.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^113tFSV4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Dopamine receptor antagonists — droperidol for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis: the recommended dose is 0.625–1.25 mg (A1) and the optimal timing is the end of surgery (A1). Meta-analyses support its efficacy; in bimaxillary surgery, droperidol 0.3–1 mg had equal efficacy as granisetron 1.0 mg, although both were less effective than a droperidol and granisetron combination. Safety and regulatory notes include an FDA black box warning in 2001 for risk of sudden cardiac death; at PONV doses, QT prolongation potential is similar to ondansetron and, when combined with ondansetron, the risk is comparable to either drug alone. Observational data report no increase in ventricular tachycardia with droperidol 0.625 mg, akathisia risk comparable between ondansetron 4 mg, droperidol 0.625 mg, and droperidol 1.25 mg, and a low rate (0.9%) of adverse events such as extrapyramidal effects (B1).

### Efficacy and safety of palonosetron for the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV): a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11239pL9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Palonosetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonist (5-HT(3)RA) with a strong binding affinity and long half-life, has been used in numerous trials for the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). We systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of palonosetron compared to other 5-HT(3)RAs in CINV prophylaxis.

Methods

A literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing palonosetron to other 5-HT(3)RAs in CINV prophylaxis. Primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR), complete control (CC), no emesis, no nausea, or taking no rescue medications. Secondary endpoints were the percentage of patients suffering from 5-HT(3)RA-related adverse events.

Results

Sixteen RCTs were identified with 2,896 patients randomized to palonosetron and 3,187 patients randomized to other 5-HT(3)RAs. Palonosetron was consistently statistically superior in CR, CC, no emesis, or no nausea and was sometimes superior in no rescue medication. Subgroup analyses demonstrated similarity in efficacy between highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy cohorts. In the acute phase, statistical superiority of palonosetron was found for trials that did not allow dexamethasone; conversely, RCTs that administered dexamethasone to all patients were nonsignificant. Palonosetron was statistically significantly safer in dizziness and mean QTc interval change and similar in constipation, headache, and diarrhea. Clinical superiority of palonosetron was reached in 3 of 19 analyzed efficacy and safety endpoints.

Conclusions

Palonosetron is safer and more efficacious than other 5-HT(3)RAs. Future antiemetic guidelines should discuss the merits of including palonosetron as a first-line treatment.

### Intravenous ondansetron and the QT interval in adult emergency department patients: an observational study [^115iR6QT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ondansetron is known to cause QT interval prolongation, but this effect and clinical significance has not been prospectively studied in adult emergency department (ED) patients. The primary objective was to determine the mean maximal corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation after intravenous (IV) administration of 4 mg of ondansetron. The secondary objective was to report any serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational, single-center cohort study conducted between 2012 and 2013 in an academic, military hospital ED. Adult patients ordered to receive 4 mg of IV ondansetron were eligible for the study. A six-lead electrocardiogram was recorded at baseline and every 2 minutes after ondansetron administration for 20 minutes. The QTc was calculated using the Bazett formula. Serious adverse cardiac electrical events (nonsinus rhythm, severe bradycardia, and sudden cardiac death) were also recorded.

Results

Twenty-two adult ED patients were enrolled. Ondansetron caused a mean prolongation of the QTc by 20 ms (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14 to 26 ms), with a mean proportion change from baseline of 5.2% (95% CI = 3.8% to 6.6%). There were zero (95% CI = 0 to 13%) reported serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

Conclusions

While QTc prolongation does occur in adult ED patients receiving IV ondansetron, the clinical impact is questionable.

### Palonosetron hydrochloride (Aloxi) [^112E5CQZ]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

6.2 Postoperative Nausea And Vomiting

The adverse reactions cited in Table 2 were reported in ≥ 2% of adults receiving I.V. Aloxi 0.075 mg immediately before induction of anesthesia in one phase 2 and two phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials. Rates of events between palonosetron and placebo groups were indistinguishable. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. Please refer to Section 12.2, thorough QT/QTc study results, for definitive data demonstrating the lack of palonosetron effect on QT/QTc.

In these clinical trials, the following infrequently reported adverse reactions, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following administration of ALOXI to adult patients receiving concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications including those associated with anesthesia:

Cardiovascular: 1%: electrocardiogram QTc prolongation, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia; < 1%: blood pressure decreased, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, generalized edema; ECG T wave amplitude decreased, platelet count decreased. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo.

Dermatological: 1%: pruritus.

Gastrointestinal System: 1%: flatulence, < 1%: dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia.

General: < 1%: chills.

Liver: 1%: increases in AST and/or ALT < 1%: hepatic enzyme increased

Metabolic: < 1%: hypokalemia, anorexia.

Nervous System: < 1%: dizziness.

Respiratory: < 1%: hypoventilation, laryngospasm.

Urinary System: 1%: urinary retention.

6.3 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ALOXI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Very rare cases (< 1/10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions (burning, induration, discomfort and pain) were reported from postmarketing experience of ALOXI 0.25 mg in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

### News flash: old mother hubbard reports the cupboard is bare… time for the FDA to let droperidol out of the (black) box [^116LeXr8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

A quick way for a clinical pharmacist to eliminate himself or herself from "employee of the month" consideration is to mention the term medication shortage. Even with training geared toward maximizing resources, the cumulative disappearance of a plethora of medications for the treatment of nausea, vomiting, and/or primary headaches is almost too much for emergency medicine physicians to manage. With prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, promethazine, and ondansetron in increasingly short supply, it is time for the Food and Drug Administration to revisit droperidol's black box warning driven by QTc interval prolongation, given its questionable validity, and restore droperidol's place in the armamentarium of emergency medicine physicians.

### QTc prolongation in cannabis hyperemesis syndrome patients exposed to antiemetics: a retrospective chart review [^116zEAWw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the risk of QT prolongation in patients treated for Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) in the emergency department.

Methods

This was a retrospective comprehensive chart review of patients in the University of Colorado Health Emergency Department. Charts were identified by ICD9/10 codes from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 for cannabis use and data were manually abstracted. We performed chi-square and odds ratios, stratified by drug, to determine differences in medication induced QTc prolongation and performed logistic regression to predict prolongation greater than 500 ms. We captured adverse events from medications as a secondary outcome.

Results

We found 282 cases of CHS during the study period. There were no significant differences between the median post-medication QTc value stratified by drug when all medications were analyzed simultaneously. A multiple logistic regression model showed that only a potassium below 3.0 mmol/L predicted QT prolongation greater than 500 msec.

Conclusion

Anti-emetics used to treat CHS did not result in significant QTC prolongation in this cohort.

### Transdermal versus oral granisetron in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a meta-analysis [^112B1N8Y]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of transdermal granisetron versus oral granisetron in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with cancer METHODS: Data sources were CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria included randomized controlled trials comparing transdermal versus oral granisetron in patients with CINV. For data extraction, two authors independently analyzed the methodological quality and extracted data. A random effects model was used to estimate the risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

Three studies (1086 patients) were included. Oral granisetron is superior (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99) to its transdermal form in achieving complete control of CINV in patients receiving chemotherapy. As for the risk of constipation (RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.73 to 2.40) and QTc prolongation (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.40) as adverse effects, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two routes.

Conclusion

Oral granisetron is better in achieving complete control of CINV in patients receiving chemotherapy. As for the risk of constipation and QTc prolongation as adverse effects, there was no statistically significant difference between the two routes.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112PvgK8]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

From this study, we conclude that most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone or combined with steroids decrease the occurrence of nausea and/or vomiting. Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. Dolasetron + dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron + dexamethasone. Additional studies are needed to characterize the cardiac and cognitive safety of these treatments. Until then, it would be prudent for clinicians to obtain baseline electrocardiographic tracings before prescribing these common, effective antiemetics to any patients who are undergoing chemotherapy.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116pU4bo]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment

Studies involving patients of any age undergoing chemotherapy and receiving a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist (i.e. dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, ramosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisone) were included, regardless of publication status, duration of administration of the intervention, or duration of follow-up. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded.

After a calibration exercise, pairs of reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of citations and the full-text articles of potentially relevant studies, and then abstracted data from included studies. Disagreements were resolved through consensus or the involvement of an arbitrator (ACT). The following types of data were abstracted from the included studies a priori: study characteristics, patient characteristics, and outcomes. The primary outcome of interest, as identified by policy-makers with Health Canada, was the number of patients experiencing arrhythmia. Secondary outcomes included the numbers of patients experiencing QTc prolongation, QRS interval prolongation, death, sudden cardiac death, delirium, no nausea, no vomiting, no CINV, and severe vomiting.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, and controlled before–after studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care risk-of-bias tool. Cohort studies were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. The quality of reporting of harm outcomes was appraised using the McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of Harm (McHarm) tool. Potential conflicts of interest were recorded for all studies. Pairs of reviewers independently appraised methodological quality and conflicts were resolved through discussion.

**Row-wise percentages were calculated

In logistic regression (Table 6), univariate analysis demonstrates a significant association of QT prolongation with various categories of potential DDIs 6–10 (OR = 2; 95% CI = 1.1–3.6; p = 0.03), 11–15 (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.5–5.4; p = 0.001), > 15 (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.4–4.2; p = 0.001), ischemic heart disease (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1–2.5; p = 0.02), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1–2.9; p = 0.01), antimicrobials (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4–1; p = 0.04) and antiemetics (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1–2.6; p = 0.01). The overall fit of the logistic regression model was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, which yielded a chi-square value of 9.9 with 8 degrees of freedom (p = 0.273), indicating no significant discrepancy between observed and predicted outcomes and thus a good model fit. The − 2 Log Likelihood value for the model was 453.025, reflecting appropriate model convergence. Additionally, the model explained approximately 13–18% of the variance in QT interval prolongation, as indicated by the Cox & Snell R 2 (0.13) and Nagelkerke R 2 (0.18) values. Together, these findings suggest that the logistic regression model demonstrated an adequate fit and reasonable explanatory power in identifying predictors of QT interval prolongation in this patient population. The multivariate analysis illustrates that potential DDIs 11–15 (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.1–5.4; p = 0.03) and antiemetics (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1–3.8; p = 0.02) were independently associated with QT prolongation at a statistically significant level.

### Effect of low-dose droperidol on the QT interval during and after general anesthesia: a placebo-controlled study [^113LQYZY]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since the effects of antiemetic doses of droperidol on the QT interval have not been previously studied, the authors designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the intraoperative and postoperative effects of small-dose droperidol (0.625 and 1.25 mg intravenous) on the QT interval when used for antiemetic prophylaxis during general anesthesia.

Methods

One hundred twenty outpatients undergoing otolaryngologic procedures with a standardized general anesthetic technique were enrolled in this study. After anesthetic induction and before the surgical incision, 60 patients were given either saline or 0.625 or 1.25 mg intravenous droperidol in a total volume of 2 ml. A standard electrocardiographic lead II was recorded immediately before and every minute after the injection of the study medication during a 10-min observation period. The QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) was evaluated from the recorded electrocardiographic strips. In 60 additional patients, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained before and at specific intervals up to 2 h after surgery to assess the effects of droperidol and general anesthesia on the QTc. Any abnormal heartbeats or arrhythmias during the operation or the subsequent 2-h monitoring interval were also noted.

Results

Intravenous droperidol, 0.625 and 1.25 mg, prolonged the QT interval by an average of 15 ± 40 and 22 ± 41 ms, respectively, at 3–6 min after administration during general anesthesia, but these changes did not differ significantly from that seen with saline (12 ± 35 ms) (all values mean ± SD). There were no statistically significant differences among the three study groups in the number of patients with greater than 10% prolongation in QTc (vs. baseline). Although general anesthesia was associated with a 14- to 16-ms prolongation of the QTc interval in the early postoperative period, there was no evidence of droperidol-induced QTc prolongation after surgery. Finally, there were no ectopic heartbeats observed on any of the electrocardiographic rhythm strips or 12-lead recordings during the perioperative period.

Conclusion

Use of a small dose of droperidol (0.625–1.25 mg intravenous) for antiemetic prophylaxis during general anesthesia was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the QTc interval compared with saline. More importantly, there was no evidence of any droperidol-induced QTc prolongation immediately after surgery.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114dPNQN]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, they may be associated with increased cardiac risk. Our objective was to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (e.g., dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2015 for studies comparing 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists with each other or placebo in chemotherapy patients. The search results were screened, data were abstracted, and risk of bias was appraised by pairs of reviewers, independently. Random-effects meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted.

Results

After screening 9226 citations and 970 full-text articles, we included 299 studies (n = 58,412 patients). None of the included studies reported harms for active treatment versus placebo. For NMAs on the risk of arrhythmia (primary outcome; three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 627 adults) and mortality (secondary outcome; eight RCTs, 4823 adults), no statistically significant differences were observed between agents. A NMA on the risk of QTc prolongation showed a significantly greater risk for dolasetron+dexamethasone versus ondansetron+dexamethasone (four RCTs, 3358 children and adults, odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.13–4.17). For NMAs on the number of patients without nausea (44 RCTs, 11,664 adults, 12 treatments), number of patients without vomiting (63 RCTs, 15,460 adults, 12 treatments), and number of patients without chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (27 RCTs, 10,924 adults, nine treatments), all agents were significantly superior to placebo. For a NMA on severe vomiting (10 RCTs, 917 adults), all treatments decreased the risk, but only ondansetron and ramosetron were significantly superior to placebo. According to a rank-heat plot with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve results, palonosetron+steroid was ranked the safest and most effective agent overall.

Conclusions

Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. However, dolasetron+dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron+dexamethasone. All agents were effective for reducing risk of nausea, vomiting, and chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting.

### Droperidol in the emergency department: is it safe? [^113iNWPp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Droperidol is an antipsychotic and antiemetic drug that has been used extensively by emergency physicians, psychiatrists, and anesthesiologists worldwide since 1967. It also has been used effectively for other diverse conditions, such as treatment of headache and vertigo. As of January 2001, Droperidol was no longer available in Europe after its founder, Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals, discontinued its distribution. In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on the use of Droperidol in response to an association between Droperidol and fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes, resulting from prolongation of the QT interval. In this review we closely examine the pharmacology, indications, use, and complications associated with Droperidol, and speculate on its future use in the Emergency Department.

### Latest update on prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer patients [^1129hcDU]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

5-HT3 antagonists form the cornerstone of antiemetic prophylaxis regimens for moderate to highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses in adults, and then in children, have shown their efficacy. Tricco et al. systemically reviewed over 299 studies with 58,412 patients, published 1995–2015. Twenty-five (8%) of those studies included pediatric-only trials and eight (2.7%) included combined adult and pediatric patients. Primary outcomes were to evaluate both efficacy and safety when using 5-HT3 antagonists alone and with dexamethasone. No statistically significant differences in the overall effectiveness between the 5-HT3 antagonists were observed. Combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist with dexamethasone provided superior antiemetic control than a 5-HT3 antagonist alone. None of the studies compared treatment versus placebo arm for adverse effects. However, when specifically evaluating for QTc prolongation, a known adverse effect of the 5-HT3 antagonists, a network meta-analysis showed a slightly increased risk of prolongation of QTc with the combination of dolasetron and dexamethasone versus ondansetron and dexamethasone. The analysis included four randomized controlled trials reflecting 3358 adults and children, odd ratio of 2.94 and 95% CI 2.13–4.17. Of note, all of the 5-HT3 antagonists come with labeling of possible QTc prolongation, however, in children, the risk is minimal given single doses of > 16 mg are never used and co-morbidities that increase this risk (use of antiarrhythmic, cardiovascular disease) are much lower. In fact, even when studies have found statistically significant minor EKG changes, none have reported dangerous rhythm disturbances or adverse events in children.

### Prolongation of QTc interval after postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron [^1126be5U]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

At dosages above 0.1 mg/kg, droperidol induces a dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Although subject to controversy, low-dose droperidol has recently been suspected to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Hence, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists have become the first-line drug for management of postoperative nausea and vomiting. These drugs are also known to prolong the QTc interval at high dosages. This study describes QTc interval changes associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron at low doses.

Methods

Eighty-five patients with postoperative nausea and vomiting were included in this prospective, single-blind study. Patients received either 0.75 mg intravenous droperidol (n = 43) or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron (n = 42). Electrocardiographic recordings were obtained before administration of antiemetic drug and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min after. Electrocardiographic monitoring was maintained for 3 h in eight patients in each group.

Results

The QTc interval was prolonged (> 450 ms in men, > 470 ms in women) in 21% of the patients before antiemetic drug administration. This was significantly correlated with lower body temperature and longer duration of anesthesia. Compared with predrug QTc measurement, both antiemetics were associated with a significant QTc interval prolongation (P < 0.0001). The mean maximal QTc interval prolongation was 17 ± 9 ms after droperidol occurring at the second minute and 20 ± 13 ms after ondansetron at the third minute (both P < 0.0001). Compared with predrug measurement, the QTc interval was significantly lower after the 90th minute in both groups.

Conclusions

Droperidol and ondansetron induced similar clinically relevant QTc interval prolongations. When used in treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a situation where prolongation of the QTc interval seems to occur, the safety of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists may not be superior to that of low-dose droperidol.

### Does IV fentanyl, frequently used in emergency departments, change QTvalue? A prospective observational study [^114onr7K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study determined that fentanyl prolonged the QT C value by a small but statistically significant amount. This prolongation occurs most prominently at the 30th minute. Although we excluded conditions that may affect the QT C value, such as electrolyte imbalance, congenital long QT disease, coronary artery disease, and the use of other medications in the included patient group, a QT C greater than 500 ms or a QT C increase of 60 ms or more was observed in one-third of patients receiving fentanyl. Especially Females gender and patients over 40 years of age constitute most of the patient population exceeding the critical threshold value, but clinically no malignant arrhythmia was detected.

As the studies in the literature about fentanyl were investigated, some showed that it shortened the QT C, while others showed that it prolonged the QT C. In a study on human cardiac myocytes, it was reported that opioid agonists, including fentanyl, could block cardiac potassium currents. Accordingly, fentanyl could prolong the QT interval by prolonging the action potential. A similar effect was found in a study on canine purkinje fibers, and it was found that fentanyl prolongs the action potential duration. In current clinical studies in humans, the effect of fentanyl on QT C is controversial. So far, antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, prokinetics, and antipsychotics have been shown to cause QT prolongation. Notably, there is no other study in which fentanyl was administered as a single drug. The study was the first to be conducted in ED. With this study, it was determined that IV fentanyl affects the QT C value and prolongs the QT C.

### Antiemetic prophylaxis with droperidol in morphine-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: a propensity score matched cohort study [^111VyEbg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The addition of droperidol to morphine-based IV-PCA was associated with lower rates of PONV and the need for antiemetic medications. No additional risk of unintentional sedation attributable to droperidol was found in this single-center matched cohort. The antiemetic benefit of droperidol was especially significant within 36 h after surgery and attenuated thereafter. Our results suggest that the addition of droperidol to IV-PCA is effective in the prophylaxis of PONV, and that it does not affect sedation risk, opioid requirements, or pain intensity. We suggest the following issues for future studies: the prophylactic role of droperidol against PONV in low-risk patients, the optimal concentration of droperidol in morphine-based IV-PCA in terms of antiemesis and sedation, and the efficacy and cost of combination antiemetic regimens compared to droperidol alone. Lastly, droperidol should be used cautiously in patients with preexisting QT prolongation or the concomitant use of drugs that potentially prolong the QT interval.

### Haloperidol versus ondansetron for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^116kzr9L]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Haloperidol is effective for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, but there are almost no data comparing it to 5-HT(3) antagonists.

Methods

Two hundred forty-four adults were randomized to receive i.v. haloperidol 1 mg or ondansetron 4 mg, during general anesthesia. Nausea, vomiting, need for rescue, sedation, extrapyramidal effects, QTc intervals, and time to postanesthesia care unit discharge were evaluated with a third-party blind design.

Results

There was no intergroup difference in any measure of efficacy or toxicity. Haloperidol and ondansetron subjects (78.2% and 76.8%) had complete response. Postoperatively, prolonged QTc occurred in 28.9% and 22.1% (N.S.).

Conclusions

In a mixed surgical population, the efficacy and toxicity of postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis with haloperidol 1 mg was not significantly different from ondansetron 4 mg.

### Droperidol, QT prolongation, and sudden death: what is the evidence? [^113hz32S]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Droperidol is a butyrophenone commonly used as an antiemetic and antipsychotic in the United States since US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1970. Its labeling has recently been revised, with a black box warning for cases of QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes and death. A black box warning is applied when serious adverse drug reactions are uncovered for medications. We sought to examine the evidence of a causal association suggested by the black box warning to aid clinicians in their risk-benefit analyses regarding further use of droperidol.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken to determine the evidence regarding the association between droperidol and QT prolongation or torsades de pointes. The evidence was then evaluated by using evidence-based medicine principles. In addition, a review of the FDA regulatory process is presented.

Results

Three clinical studies, 1 published abstract, and 7 case reports were reviewed. Available postmarketing surveillance data (MedWatch reports) were also reviewed. Applying the criteria of evidence-based medicine and Hill's criteria, the evidence is not convincing for a causal relationship between therapeutic droperidol administration and life-threatening cardiac events.

Conclusion

The recent black box warning appears to have originated from postmarketing surveillance data rather than data reported in the peer-reviewed medical literature. Ongoing monitoring of drug safety and more definitive study appear appropriate.

### Antipsychotics and the QTc interval during delirium in the intensive care unit… [^112oBVvF]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Study days are considered as time from randomization to treatment group. The sample size provided for each day represents the number of patients who were included in the analysis for that day to estimate the average predose QTc interval. Question Do antipsychotics increase the QTc interval and the risk of fatal arrhythmias in patients with delirium in the intensive care unit with baseline QTc interval less than 550 ms. dose of study drug administration was a 7. 4-ms increase, only 32 of 2264 scheduled doses were held due to QTc greater than 500 ms and only 4 of those had a QTc greater than 550 ms, and no episodes of torsade de pointes had occurred in a patient receiving study drug. When baseline QTc was greater than or equal to 550 ms, randomization was deferred, and reversible causes of QTc prolongation, such as calcium abnormalities, thyroid disease, or other medications, were identified and treated.

If QTc measurements remained 550 ms or higher for 5 days, the patient was excluded and never randomized. During the entirety of the trial, we monitored and documented the QTc interval before administration of each dose of study medication. If the QTc was 550 ms or greater on telemetry, we obtained a 12-lead ECG for confirmation. Again, if the 12-lead ECG QTc was 550 ms or greater, we held study drug until a reversible cause for QTc interval prolongation was found and treated and QTc was less than 550 ms on telemetry. The QTc interval can have diurnal variations. Twice-daily study drug administration at the same times minimized bias due to diurnal limitation. Additionally, our study was conducted in a diverse population of critically ill patients who commonly have electrolyte abnormalities and are receiving many concomitant ICU medications that prolong QTc intervals.

Our study also has important limitations. First, we did not record concomitant medications and electrolyte abnormalities that can cause QTc interval prolongation. Study sites, however, were encouraged to identify and correct reversible causes of QTc prolongation. Furthermore, a study by Harrigan et al5 did not demonstrate that concomitant medications causing metabolic inhibition prolonged the QTc interval.

### A model for evaluating droperidol's effect on the median QTc interval [^11175YPn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Controversy surrounds the use of the antiemetic droperidol, because of the Food and Drug Administration-imposed "black box" warning alleging that even small doses of the drug can lead to serious (even fatal) arrhythmias when it is used for antiemetic prophylaxis during the perioperative period. We used mathematical modeling of electrocardiographic QT interval data published in a peer-reviewed manuscript to evaluate the relationship between the dose of droperidol (0.1–0.25 mg/kg i.v.) and QT(c) prolongation. In comparing the calculated QT(c) values based on the logarithm model (27–63 ms), the linear model (27–67 ms) and the square-root model (36–57 ms) to the actual measured QT(c) values (37–59 ms), the square-root model provided the best simulation of the experimental findings. Other models that we evaluated included the polynomial model and various exponent models (e.g., quartic-root model, cubic-root model, square model, and cubic model). The estimated median prolongation of the median QT(c) interval produced by droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg i.v. would vary from 9 ± 3 to 18 ± 3 ms. Therefore, this regression analysis suggests that small "antiemetic" doses of droperidol (≤ 1.25 mg) would be unlikely to produce proarrhythmogenic effects in the perioperative period.

Implications

Using a square-root curve fit model to evaluate the relationship between the dose of droperidol and QT(c) prolongation, small-dose droperidol (0.625–1.25 mg i.v.) would be expected to produce < 30-ms prolongation of the QT(c) interval. Therefore, small "antiemetic" doses of droperidol would not be expected to produce proarrhythmogenic effects when used for prophylaxis in surgical patients.

### QTc interval changes in preeclampsia vs. normal pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TpBWX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Pregnancy and preeclampsia induce significant cardiovascular adaptations that can affect ventricular repolarization. However, the extent of QTc interval changes during normal pregnancy and preeclampsia remains unclear.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

What are the changes in the QTc interval during different trimesters of normal pregnancy and preeclampsia?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

In this systematic review, which included 57 studies and 6,686 individuals, there was significant QTc interval lengthening throughout the trimesters of normal pregnancy, with an additional QTc interval increase in patients with preeclampsia during the third trimester.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

The significant QTc interval lengthening during pregnancy — further amplified in preeclampsia — may be concerning, especially in pregnant individuals with known risk factors for QTc interval prolongation. Further, well‐designed studies are needed to assess the arrhythmogenicity in third‐trimester preeclampsia, especially with using QT‐prolonging drugs.

Pregnancy induces significant adaptations in the cardio‐autonomic nervous system leading to structural left ventricular remodeling that can prolong ventricular repolarization. Moreover, there is a 10‐to‐20‐fold increase in estrogen and progesterone concentrations, which affect cardiac ion channels responsible for ventricular repolarization. In addition to these physiological changes, drugs that prolong cardiac repolarization, such as ondansetron and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly used during pregnancy.

Preeclampsia, a condition affecting approximately 6–8% of pregnancies worldwide, is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. With increased cardiac workload due to hypertension, concentric ventricular hypertrophy and electrophysiological alterations are common and can exacerbate preexisting arrhythmias or even induce de novo arrhythmias. In addition, changes in circulating hormones and electrolytes with increased sympathetic neural outflow can also impact ventricular repolarization.

### Incidence and relevance of QTc-interval prolongation caused by tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^113TUL6P]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Variables modulating QTc interval at baseline visit

At baseline measurements, QTc was slightly, but significantly greater in females than in males (QTc females = 404 ms (IQR 392–417) vs QTc males = 399 ms (IQR 385–414), P = 0.027), which is consistent with previous studies. Patients treated with co-medication known to prolong the QTc interval, such as anti-depressants, anti-epileptics, and anti-emetics, had a statistically significant higher baseline QTc interval than the patients who did not use such co-medication (409 ms (IQR 398–424) vs 400 ms (IQR 387–414), respectively, P = 0.035). Consistent with previous studies, patients suffering from hypokalaemia had longer median QTc intervals than patients with normokalaemia and hyperkalaemia (median QTc in hypokalaemic, normokalaemic, and hyperkalaemic patients 416 ms (IQR 376–431), 401 ms (IQR 389–415), and 391 ms (IQR 381–408), P = 0.028, respectively). A more detailed report about baseline QTc intervals according to the evaluated variables is found in Supplementary Table 1.

Quantitative variations of the QTc interval

The median on treatment time before the ECG was performed was 43 days (IQR 26–118 days). In the entire population of 363 patients, the start of a TKI resulted in a statistically significant increase in QTc interval, with a median ΔQTc of +11 ms (P < 0.00001). The distribution of ΔQTc was significantly different across TKIs (P = 0.0001). When analysing subgroups of patients treated with specific TKIs, patients treated with sunitinib (N = 110), vemurafenib (N = 67), sorafenib (N = 52), imatinib (N = 41), and erlotinib (N = 21) showed a statistically significant increase in QTc interval after start of treatment (median ΔQTc ranging from +7 to +24 ms, P < 0.004; Figure 1). For lapatinib (N = 16) and pazopanib (N = 46), no statistically significant increase in QTc interval after start of treatment was found (Table 2).

### Antiemetic prophylaxis with droperidol in morphine-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: a propensity score matched cohort study [^1132ux6V]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning indicating an association between droperidol, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes, although high-quality clinical trials did not support this hypothesis. Consequently, droperidol was rapidly replaced by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, neurokinin blockers, and atypical antipsychotics. Experts argued that the warning about droperidol was primarily based on nine case reports without solid evidence of causation. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the QT prolongation related to droperidol was transient, dose-dependent and did not develop into serious ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest at therapeutic doses (0.625–1.25 mg). In 2015, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine stated that the evidence supporting the black box warning was inadequate, and supported the use of droperidol in an emergency setting. In February 2019, droperidol was reintroduced to the United States drug market by American Regent, Inc. (Shirley, NY, USA), still with the black box warning. To date, no study has investigated the changes in baseline rates of PONV before and after the black box warning. Further studies and real-world data are needed to evaluate the actual impact of the reintroduction of droperidol on the incidence of PONV.

### Ondansetron and the risk of cardiac arrhythmias: a systematic review and postmarketing analysis [^116EhuEN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To explore the risk of cardiac arrhythmias associated with ondansetron administration in the context of recent recommendations for identification of high-risk individuals.

Methods

We conducted a postmarketing analysis and systematically reviewed the published literature, grey literature, manufacturer's database, Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System, and the World Health Organization Individual Safety Case Reports Database (VigiBase). Eligible cases described a documented (or perceived) arrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron administration. The primary outcome was arrhythmia occurrence temporally associated with the administration of a single, oral ondansetron dose. Secondary objectives included identifying all cases associating ondansetron administration (any dose, frequency, or route) to an arrhythmia.

Results

Primary: No reports describing an arrhythmia associated with single oral ondansetron dose administration were identified. Secondary: Sixty unique reports were identified. Route of administration was predominantly intravenous (80%). A significant medical history (67%) or concomitant use of a QT-prolonging medication (67%) was identified in 83% of reports. Approximately one third occurred in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents, many of which are known to prolong the QT interval. An additional third involved administration to prevent postoperative vomiting.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not support routine ECG and electrolyte screening before single oral ondansetron dose administration to individuals without known risk factors. Screening should be targeted to high-risk patients and those receiving ondansetron intravenously.

### Use of QT prolonging medications by hemodialysis patients and individuals without end-stage kidney disease [^113Lzzby]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study establishes that hemodialysis patients use QT prolonging medications with known and possible TdP risk to a greater extent than individuals without ESKD. Non‐antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, psychotropics, antiemetics, acid suppressants) were the most commonly prescribed agents. Our findings highlight high‐risk and potentially unsafe prescribing patterns, underscoring the need for future studies evaluating the cardiac safety of QT prolonging medications, especially non‐antiarrhythmic agents, in the clinically complex hemodialysis population.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^1176kzeP]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this population, we observed no serious side effects or QTc prolongation. We also found that domperidone helps manage DHE-associated nausea in combination with other antiemetics. These findings align with decades of internationally accumulated clinical experience and numerous prospective trials. Although a range of options exist to treat migraine, migraine-associated nausea, and emergent nausea with DHE, most treatments are dangerous or replace nausea with disabling sedation. As a less sedating alternative, domperidone is invaluable in migraine management given that safety concerns are allayed.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and small sample size. Efficacy, including comparisons with centrally acting dopaminergic blockers, could not be assessed. Rare events and conditions, such as a concealed long QT syndrome, may be missed. In addition, this population was relatively young and healthy, and few patients had exacerbating conditions, such as electrolyte disorders or coadministration of QT prolonging agents. Finally, side effects were not specifically queried; we relied on progress notes and discharge summaries. Minor and asymptomatic side effects, such as liver enzyme or prolactin elevation, may have been missed.

It should be noted that no patients received high domperidone doses, and that all patients had baseline screening ECGs. While caution should be used when treating patients with risk factors such as older age, heart disease, concurrent use of QT prolonging medications, and hypokalemia, current evidence suggests that domperidone is safe and effective in the vast majority of individuals.

This audit provides Class IV evidence that domperidone is safe for treating nausea associated with DHE infusion and headache in a tertiary hospital. Future studies should extend these findings to other settings (e.g. outpatient clinics) and other populations (e.g. nonmigrainous headache disorders, patients with risk factors). Given domperidone's effectiveness and tolerability, concern for safety should not preclude its use in a well-screened headache population.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^1111UZ9p]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A previous study of IV ondansetron in healthy children who were undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia or who had AGE with mild dehydration found a nonsignificant prolongation of QTc of 0.4 to 17 ms. Our results were similar, showing that oral ondansetron did not prolong QTc and that changes in ΔQTc were not significant. However, Trivedi et al. reported that several risk factors, including electrolyte imbalance, multidrug use with the possible risk of QT interval change, and organ dysfunction, prolonged QT in pediatric patients in the intensive care unit. In patients who had risk factors or baseline QTc over 460 ms, QT could be prolonged more than 500 ms. The patients we included were children with acute diseases who were previously healthy and without underlying disease and who received only a single dose of ondansetron. Recently two pediatric emergency centers in Pakistan conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that supported our results which reported safety use and improve success rate of ORT of single dose oral ondansetron among children with gastroenteritis-associate vomiting. Therefore, further multicenter prospective study focusing on the effect of oral ondansetron on QT prolongation is needed to deduce the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of ondansetron in patients with a high risk of QT prolongation.

### The cardiotoxic potential of the 5-HT (3) receptor antagonist antiemetics: is there cause for concern? [^116Wbs5J]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review and evaluate the potential cardiac effects of 5-HT(3) antiemetic treatment in patients who may be predisposed to cardiac complications resulting from malignancy, cytotoxic oncologic regimens, or preexisting comorbid conditions.

Design

A literature review was conducted on the negative cardiovascular effects of chemotherapeutic agents, and, more specifically, on the cardiac interactions of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Results

Clinical studies in healthy subjects have reported electrocardiograph changes following administration of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. However, there are limited data on the use of 5-HT(3) antiemetics when administered with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the development of significant electrocardiograph changes with some agents may indicate a potential for significant cardiac effects in patients, particularly those who may be predisposed to cardiac complication.

Conclusions

As the predicted human life span increases, clinicians will be treating a larger, older oncology population. Because two of the most common major comorbidities are cardiovascular related, we need to be acutely aware of the toxic effects of chemotherapy, as well as the possible cardiac interaction of supportive agents, specifically the 5-HT(3) antiemetics. Until more data are made available, the best antiemetic option for patients receiving emetogenic and cardiotoxic chemotherapy may be the agent with the fewest apparent cardiac effects.

### The effect of antiemetics and antihistamines on the QTc interval in emergent dialysis patients with baseline QTc prolongation [^115CWAQX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Unfunded patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who do not have routinely scheduled hemodialysis often receive medications known to prolong the QTc interval for their uremic symptoms even though they may have pre-existing QTc prolongation.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of these medications on the QTc interval in these patients.

Methods

Unfunded patients with ESRD presenting to the emergency department (ED) for emergent hemodialysis (HD) with QTc prolongation on their initial electrocardiogram (ECG) were recruited. Approximately 2 hours after receiving an antihistamine or antiemetic, a second ECG was ordered and the QTc was measured. The patients were followed-up 1 week later.

Results

Twenty-nine percent (44/152) of the unfunded patients with ESRD presenting for HD at a county hospital had QT prolongation and were included with 107 total ED visits during the 4-week study period. The mean QTc was 483.7 msec on presentation to the ED, and the mean QTc measured 2 hours after receiving an antihistamine or antiemetic was 483.8 msec. None of the patients were admitted for life-threatening dysrhythmias. Thirty-six percent (16/44) of the recruited patients had QTc intervals > 500 msec with a combined total of 31 patient visits, of which only 25.8% (8/31) had an increase in the QTc interval after an antihistamine or antiemetic medication was given. None of these patients had adverse outcomes, such a dysrhythmia or death, at 1-week follow-up.

Conclusion

This study shows that medications known to cause QTc prolongation are safe to use in therapeutic doses in patients with ESRD who have pre-existing QT prolongation. Few patients in this cohort had significantly prolonged QTc intervals at baseline.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^113FsTzT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

TRADE‐OFFS: BALANCING BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ONDANSETRON

The assessment has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary editorial board of the DPF consisting of pediatricians, pharmacists, and clinical pharmacologists.

Benefits clinically relevant?

Improved efficacy of oral rehydration preventing hospital admission is considered clinically relevant. Drug therapy should only be considered if the child is at high risk for dehydration and oral rehydration is not successful.

Residual risks acceptable?

The multidisciplinary board discussed if pre‐emptive ECG testing is indicated for use in gastroenteritis. Daily practice is quite pragmatic: parents are asked for their family history of cardiac events and comedications. If negative, ondansetron is prescribed without ECG. Domperidone may also induce a prolonged QT interval. For domperidone, an ECG is only recommended when listed risk factors (hypokalemia/ poor renal function/ diabetes mellitus/ QT prolonging or comedication resulting in increased blood levels/ high doses/ pre‐existent prolonged QT time or long QT syndrome) are present. The same approach is considered acceptable to mitigate the risk of QT prolongation in ondansetron. Caution is needed in infants < 3 months old, as clinical monitoring of the drug effect is indicated.

Comparison with alternatives

Metoclopramide and domperidone are contraindicated due to the high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, especially in infants. Hence, domperidone and metoclopramide are still considered to be unsuitable. Ondansetron is considered a safer alternative.

Conclusion on balance

The benefits only outweigh the risks when oral rehydration therapy alone is insufficient and the child is at risk of dehydration. Ondansetron should not be used to treat nausea and vomiting symptoms without (imminent) dehydration.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112GSeKt]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Ondansetron — an antiemetic selective 5‑HT3 antagonist — has the following profile: "Mechanism not fully characterized; selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; binds to 5-HT3 receptors both in periphery and in CNS, with primary effects in GI tract. Has no effect on dopamine receptors and therefore does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms". Indications are "For the management of nausea or vomiting". The note states "EKG monitoring is recommended in patients who have electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, or bradyarrhythmias or who are also receiving other medications that cause QT prolongation". Contraindications are "Hypersensitivity, coadministration with apomorphine; combination reported to cause profound hypotension and loss of consciousness". The warning is "May cause dose-dependent QT prolongation, avoid in patients with congenital long QT syndrome".

### Intravenous amisulpride does not meaningfully prolong the QTc interval at doses effective for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115egx6f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are significant issues in surgical patients, and additional treatment options are needed. Dopaminergic antiemetics have been popular for their efficacy, but their use has been limited by safety concerns, especially the potential for torsade de pointes arising from QT interval prolongation. Intravenous (IV) amisulpride, a dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist shown to be effective at preventing and treating PONV at doses of 5 and 10 mg, respectively, has a dose-dependent effect on QT but at 5 mg is not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. This study was designed to evaluate the QT effect of a 10-mg dose of amisulpride, alone and when simultaneously coadministered with ondansetron, an antiemetic of a different class, also known to prolong the QT interval.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period, crossover study, healthy male and female volunteers 18–65 years of age received IV, in a random sequence: (1) amisulpride 10 mg given twice, 2 hours apart; (2) amisulpride 10 mg and ondansetron 4 mg, given simultaneously; and (3) placebo.

Results

Thirty subjects were enrolled, and 29 completed all 3 treatment periods. The largest mean placebo-corrected change-from-baseline QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) (ΔΔQTcF) after the first and second amisulpride dose was 5.2 milliseconds (90% confidence interval [CI] 3.53–6.96 milliseconds) and 8.0 milliseconds (90% CI, 5.49–10.58 milliseconds), respectively. After coadministration of amisulpride and ondansetron, the largest mean ΔΔQTcF was 7.3 milliseconds (90% CI, 5.48–9.16 milliseconds). The slope of the amisulpride concentration-change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) relationship was 0.006 ms/ng/mL (90% CI, 0.0020–0.0098). No QTc outliers (absolute QTcF value > 480 milliseconds or increase from baseline > 30 milliseconds) were seen in any period.

Conclusions

A 10-mg dose of IV amisulpride, given alone or in combination with ondansetron, does not have a clinically significant effect on the QT interval.

### QT-prolonging medications: prevalence of use and associated risks in CKD [^114wiE8C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10% of the global adult population and is associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (often precipitated by ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes) is a leading cause of death in patients with CKD. Prolongation of the QT interval (a marker of delayed ventricular repolarization) is a significant risk factor for arrhythmia in patients with CKD, whether they are on dialysis or not. QT prolongation in CKD is multifactorial and may result from electrolyte imbalances, myocardial remodelling, autonomic dysfunction, and exposure to QT-prolonging drugs. Patients on haemodialysis are particularly vulnerable to QT prolongation, due to rapid intradialytic electrolyte and fluid shifts. Many drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antipsychotics) are frequently prescribed to patients with CKD, even though there are few data on their safety in this population. The results of several well-designed pharmaco-epidemiological analyses (all based on data from the United States Renal Data System) have shown associations between QT-prolonging drugs and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death among patients on dialysis. These findings are concerning, given the widespread use of such drug. The objective of this narrative review is to critically evaluate the pathophysiological relevance, prevalence, and cardiovascular consequences of QT-prolonging drug use in the CKD setting.

### Underuse of ECG monitoring in oncology patients receiving QT-interval prolonging drugs [^1118ATS7]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We examined use of ECG monitoring in oncology patients prescribed QT-prolonging drugs.

Methods

Patients ≥ 66 years diagnosed with cancer between 2005 and 2011 were identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry and linked to multiple population-based administrative databases to ascertain demographics, comorbidities, prescription drug use, systemic therapy and ECG. QT-prolonging drugs were identified as per drug lists developed by the Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to examine factors associated with ECG use in patients on first-line systemic therapy.

Results

A total of 48236 patients (median age 74; 49% women) received one or more drugs associated with a risk of QT-interval prolongation but only 27% of patients had an ECG performed. Factors associated with more ECG use on multivariable analysis included recent cancer diagnosis (p for trend < 0.001 between 2005 and 2011), use of concurrent QT-prolonging drugs (OR = 1.15 per each additional QT-prolonging drug, 95%CI 1.12 to 1.17) and the presence of coronary artery disease (OR 1.31; 95%CI 1.25 to 1.38) and heart failure (OR 1.25; 95%CI 1.17 to 1.35). Use of anticancer (OR 0.74; 95%CI 0.70 to 0.79) and antiemetic (OR 0.93; 95%CI 0.88 to 0.99) QT-prolonging drugs was paradoxically associated with less ECG use.

Conclusions

Our study highlights common use of QT-prolonging drugs and underuse of ECG in oncology patients. Since ECG is an inexpensive, non-invasive and widely available test, it may be readily incorporated in the monitoring of patients for toxicities in routine clinical practice.

### 5 HT (3)-receptor antagonists and cardiac repolarization time in patients expressing a novel genetic target associated with baseline QTc interval abnormalities [^112fJWzs]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To investigate whether a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10494366, is associated with significant prolongation of the QTc interval following administration of 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists in the perioperative setting.

Design

Post-hoc analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples and electrocardiographic (ECG) data from an established perioperative genomics database.

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Measurements

DNA samples of 132 ASA physical status 1, 2, and 3 patients were obtained from an established genomic database of surgical patients who had received either granisetron or dolasetron as part of their general anesthesia plan. ECG recordings were collected on all subjects before administration of antiemetic medication, then 10 minutes after drug injection. DNA analysis was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR genotyping assay. Results from the TaqMan real-time PCR assay were used to calculate relative frequencies of the T (major) and G (minor) alleles, in addition to calculating the genotype frequencies. QTc intervals were calculated according to Bazett's formula.

Results

Relative frequencies for T and G alleles were 0.63 and 0.37, respectively. The relative frequencies of the pertinent genotypes were TT 39.4%, TG 46.9%, and GG 13.7%. No significant difference was noted in QTc interval pre-antiemetic or post-antiemetic drug administration for the homozygous carriers of the minor allele GG (P = 0.059), but a significant difference was seen in the pre-drug and post-drug QTc intervals in the heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the major allele TG and TT (P = 0.003 and P = 0.017, respectively). Compared with homozygous carriers of the minor allele, absolute risk increase for QTc interval prolongation after antiemetic administration was 0.08 and 0.15 in heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the major allele, respectively.

Conclusion

Homozygous and heterozygous carrier status for the major SNP, rs10494366 allele (T), in intron 1 of the human NOSA1P gene may be associated with an increased risk of QTc interval prolongation following administration of 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists in the perioperative setting, when compared with homozygotes for the minor (G) allele.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^114JfjMh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) in the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by emetogenic chemotherapy is part of a comprehensive management strategy for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Electrocardiographic effects have been reported in patients after intravenous administration of 5-HT3 RAs. The present study investigated the electrocardiogram (ECG) profile of the 5-HT3 RA palonosetron following International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines.

Methods

A total of 221 healthy subjects (101 females, 120 males) were randomized in this phase I, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study and assigned to one of five treatments: placebo, palonosetron (0.25, 0.75, or 2.25 mg), or moxifloxacin (400 mg). ECGs were recorded for 24 h pre-dosing until 48 h post-dose. The primary endpoint was the placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted individual QTc interval prolongation (ΔΔQTcI).

Results

The QTc interval was not prolonged after administration of palonosetron (ΔΔQTcI upper confidence interval was < 10 ms for all time points in all palonosetron treatment groups). Assay sensitivity was confirmed with the expected change in the QTc interval after administration of the positive control moxifloxacin.

Conclusions

Palonosetron, even at supratherapeutic doses, has no effect on cardiac repolarization as measured by the QTc interval in a validated controlled clinical trial.

### The effect of intravenous ondansetron on QT interval in the emergency department [^115PRXBM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ondansetron, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, is commonly used in emergency departments to treat nausea and vomiting. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that this medicine may cause QT prolongation, potentially leading to deadly arrhythmias. The objective of this study was to characterize the QT interval prolongation associated with ondansetron use in the Emergency Department.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients who presented to the emergency department during a one-year period and were treated with intravenous ondansetron. We investigated the QT prolongation associated with dosages. ECGs were obtained before the medication and 5, 15, and 30 minutes after IV drug administration. Every QT measurement was recorded and compared to the zero point. The severity of drug-induced QT prolongation was determined according to the recommendations of the International Conference on Compliance (ICH). QTc prolongation was categorized as 'negligible' (< 5 ms), 'significant' (> 20 ms), 'potential concern' (> 30 ms), or 'definitely worrying' (> 60 ms).

Results

Of the 435 patients enrolled in the study, 60% (261 patients) were female and the mean age was 39 (± 18). The QT prolongation peaked at the fifth minute and remained consistent at the fifteenth and thirty-first minutes. The maximum prolongation of the mean QT duration occured at the fifth minute (7.9 ± 18.1 ms). No patient revealed any problems with cardiac conduction. The prolonged QT interval was not related to the dose of ondansetron, but QT measurements were higher in the 30th minute in patients treated with 8 mg of ondansetron. The effect of ondansetron administration on QT prolongation was found to be above the 'negligible' but below the 'significant' value, according to the ICH recommendations.

Discussion

In this study, QT prolongation due to ondansetron administration was below the 'important' value according to the recommendations of the ICH. No cases of cardiac arrhythmia were reported in any of the partients. Thus, routine ECG monitoring in patients given ondansetron due to the risk of QTc prolongation does not seem cost-effective when evaluated together with additional factors such as its negative impact on emergency patient flow, waste of personnel and time, and increase in healthcare costs. In the absence of a known risk of cardiac arrhythmia, IV administration of 4 mg and 8 mg of ondansetron doses no risk of QT prolongation in the emergency population.

### Absence of QT prolongation after administration of a 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron pill (RHB-102) [^113VW3TZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prospective data evaluating the effect of ondansetron on the corrected QT (QTc) interval is lacking in emergency department clinical use. As part of a randomized trial of a 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron (RHB-102) pill, we tested the effect of RHB-102 compared to placebo on QTc change.

Methods

This was a planned safety outcome analysis within a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial compared the effects of RHB-102 among patients ≥ 12 years who presented to 21 centers with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. Patients with an initial baseline electrocardiogram as well as a follow-up electrocardiogram 4 h later were included in the analysis. The safety endpoint for this analysis was the change from baseline in QTc interval at 4 h, the median time at which ondansetron serum level peaks.

Results

A total of 147 patients were included with a mean baseline QTc in the RHB-102 and placebo arms of 410 and 406 ms, respectively. There was no difference in the change in QTc at 4 h post-study drug administration between the RHB-102 (+4, 95% CI 1–8 ms) and placebo group (+5, 95% CI 1–9 ms). In the RHB-102 arm, 6.6% of patients had a QTc change > 30 ms and in the placebo arm 3.6% (p = 0.48). No patient in either arm had a QTc change > 60 ms after study drug administration.

Conclusion

In patients with normal baseline QTc, 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron did not prolong the QTc in comparison to placebo.

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^113cY5TV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

There are not many studies that concentrate on figuring out how prevalent potential QT DDIs are in clinical settings. We found that 23.2% of the study population had potential QT DDIs. Among these, the most common drug interacting pair comprised of Metoclopramide - Ondansetron and Azithromycin - Metoclopramide. While research indicates that using the highest risk QTc lengthening medication concurrently with any other QTc prolonging medication must be circumvented due to the significant increase in the danger for fatal toxicities, such as the onset of TdP or other severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias of considerable severity. Apart from this, many previous studies considered only certain drug classes in their analysis, whereas, we used a broader strategy that took into account all medication classes that were prescribed to hospitalized geriatric patients. Our study found that diuretics, antimicrobials, antiemetics, proton pump inhibitors, and analgesics were the most commonly involved drug classes in QT prolongation. In our investigation, we found 228 cases of diuretics, indicating a significant prevalence. However, diuretics were commonly used by hospitalized patients, and our results align with the results of the earlier research done on older individuals. Among diuretics, furosemide was the most commonly used, constituting 20.5% of the prescriptions. The second most commonly prescribed group was antimicrobials, with 202 instances. Metoclopramide emerged as the most frequently used antiemetic, representing 13.7% of the prescriptions. Another study also reported a similar proportion where its use was documented in 11.1% of cases. The possible negative effects of QT-prolonging medications were disregarded, despite their widespread use.

relationship to heart rate, the measured QT interval is routinely corrected by means of various formulae to a less heart rate dependent value known as the QTc interval. It is not clear, however, whether arrhythmia development is more closely related to an increase in the absolute QT interval or QTc. Most drugs that have caused TdP clearly increase both the absolute QT and the. systemic bioavailability, but may not apply to products with highly localized distribution and those administered topically and not absorbed. The focus is on agents being developed for uses other than the control of arrhythmias, as antiarrhythmic drugs can prolong the QT/QTc interval as a part of their mechanism of clinical efficacy. While this document is concerned primarily. The "thorough QT/QTc study" is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation.

It is difficult to determine whether there is an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval that is so small as to be of no consequence.

When the largest time-matched difference exceeds the threshold, the study is.

There were no significant differences in the incidence of PONV and the need for rescue antiemetics 0–2 h postoperatively. However, significant differences were observed in the incidence of PONV and complete response among the three groups 2–48 h postoperatively (Table 2). Nausea occurred less frequently and the rate of complete response was higher in group C than in group A or B 2–24 and 24–48 h postoperatively (Table 2). Additionally, rescue antiemetics were less frequently required in group C than in groups A or B 2–48 h postoperatively (Table 2).

Total incidences of PONV for subgroups that did or did not receive dexamethasone were analyzed (Table 3). The incidence of nausea was lower and that of complete response was higher in group C than group A in both patients with or without steroid (Table 3).

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^116iyp2J]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

QT prolongation.

Although initial publications suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with TCAs, many of the newer antidepressants are not exempt from the onset of heart disease. In a comprehensive review that analyzed the antidepressant-induced QT prolongation in people with psychiatric disorders, the authors found an increased mortality odds ratio of 2.11 with high doses of TCA and 2.78 in SSRI users compared with controls matching for age and sex.

The QT interval is the period between the onset of a Q wave and the end of a T wave on the electrocardiogram (EKG). By contrast, the corrected QT interval (QTc) refers to the QT after adjustment to baseline heart rate. An increased QT interval can be associated with a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as Torsade de Pointes. The risk of QT prolongation should be considered during the use of TCAs and in patients when using SSRIs. A meta-analysis found that among SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the agent most significantly associated with QTc prolongation.

A clinically consistent association with cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias has not been identified with the SNRIs. However, venlafaxine (in doses over 200 mg daily) and duloxetine have been associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure.

Although the risk of cardiovascular disease is not high in central neuromodulator users, they should be prescribed in the lowest doses required to be effective. An EKG should be considered to evaluate for QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias and must be done in the elderly population and patients with heart disease or concomitant treatment with drugs known to cause prolongation of the QTc interval. Examples include antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide, verapamil, and diltiazem. In addition, noncardiovascular drugs such as ondansetron, macrolide, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and first-generation antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol, thioridazine, and sertindole should be considered. If the EKG confirms QT prolongation, stop the high-risk medication and restart treatment at a lower dose after a cardiac consult and then repeat the EKG.

Evaluation of efficacy and safety

The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR: no emesis, no rescue antiemetics) during the acute phase (0–24 h after the start of the administration of the first [most] emetogenic chemotherapeutic agent). The key secondary endpoint was CR rates during the delayed (24–120 h) phase. Additional secondary endpoints were the overall CR rates (0–120 h) after administration of chemotherapy, the proportion of patients with complete control (defined as CR and no more than mild nausea), without emetic episodes, without nausea, and without rescue medication, as well as the severity of nausea (four-point Likert scale: none, mild, moderate, severe), the time to first emetic episode, and patient global satisfaction with antiemetic therapy. These parameters were assessed and reported at various intervals during 0–120 h, as acute, delayed, and overall phases. Safety was assessed based on occurrence of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and laboratory parameters. For all ECGs, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF intervals, and heart rate were analyzed.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^114tHep3]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

The experience of adults admitted for IV DHE treatment to the UCSF Headache Center between July 2012 and May 2015 was audited. Treatment was at the discretion of the attending neurologist. In our practice, we routinely use domperidone 10 mg orally prior to DHE infusion, with increased dosing as needed for persistent nausea. All patients who received at least one dose of domperidone were included. Patients with at least one ECG after exposure to domperidone were included in the analysis of cardiac safety.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

This study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. Patient consent was waived for this retrospective audit.

Nausea severity.

Nausea severity was defined as absent (no as-needed antiemetics), mild (some as-needed antiemetics but no increase in scheduled dosing), moderate (aprepitant added or increased, or additional antiemetics required despite maximum aprepitant), severe (DHE infusion slowed despite maximum antiemetics), or refractory (DHE stopped due to nausea).

QT interval measurement.

Admission ECG QT and QTc were interpreted automatically at the time of the admission. All ECGs for patients included in the QTc analyses were also manually interpreted in a blinded fashion by 2 cardiac electrophysiologists (M.M.S. H. I.). If patients had multiple ECGs on domperidone, QTc was averaged for comparison.

Statistical methods.

All tests were done with IBM (Armonk, NY) SPSS Statistics v22. We compared manually interpreted QTc before and after domperidone administration using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with 2-tailed significance. A drug-induced QTc prolongation of ≥ 30 ms has been proposed as the cutoff for defining a clinically significant change. To increase sensitivity for detecting safety concerns, we used a postdomperidone increase of ≥ 10 ms. Assuming a 10-ms difference and a common SD of 15 ms, we calculated that 26 patients would be required to achieve adequate power. We compared groups using Pearson χ 2, Mann-Whitney U, or Fisher exact test as appropriate.

### A randomized controlled trial of intravenous haloperidol vs. intravenous metoclopramide for acute migraine therapy in the emergency department [^1146DpbN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency Department (ED) headache patients are commonly treated with neuroleptic antiemetics like metoclopramide. Haloperidol has been shown to be effective for migraine treatment.

Study Objective

Our study compared the use of metoclopramide vs. haloperidol to treat ED migraine patients.

Methods

A prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial of 64 adults aged 18–50 years with migraine headache and no recognized risks for QT-prolongation. Haloperidol 5 mg or metoclopramide 10 mg was given intravenously after 25 mg diphenhydramine. Pain, nausea, restlessness (akathisia), and sedation were assessed with 100-mm visual analog scales (VAS) at baseline and every 20 min, to a maximum of 80 min. The need for rescue medications, side effects, and subject satisfaction were recorded. QTc intervals were measured prior to and after treatment. Follow-up calls after 48 h assessed satisfaction and recurrent or persistent symptoms.

Results

Thirty-one subjects received haloperidol, 33 metoclopramide. The groups were similar on all VAS measurements, side effects, and in their satisfaction with therapy. Pain relief averaged 53 mm VAS over both groups, with equal times to maximum improvement. Subjects receiving haloperidol required rescue medication significantly less often (3% vs. 24%, p < 0.02). Mean QTcs were equal and normal in the two groups and did not change after treatment. In telephone follow-up, 90% of subjects contacted were "happy with the medication" they had received, with haloperidol-treated subjects experiencing more restlessness (43% vs. 10%).

Conclusions

Intravenous haloperidol is as safe and effective as metoclopramide for the ED treatment of migraine headaches, with less frequent need for rescue medications.

### Comparative efficacy of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1128Ka7J]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Administration of most 5-HT 3 antagonists led to significantly fewer patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, and PONV relative to placebo. However, some of the corresponding PrIs were not statistically significant, suggesting that the statistically significant treatment effects might change should a new study become available. For all age groups and across all outcomes, the most effective agents were granisetron plus dexamethasone. For adults, the most effective agents were ondansetron plus droperidol IV; and for children, the most effective agents were ondansetron plus dexamethasone.

We also conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis on the safety of these medications. Our network meta-analysis results suggested that granisetron plus dexamethasone increases the risk of arrhythmia. However, a statistically significant increase in the risk of delirium was not observed in another network meta-analysis. In a meta-analysis including three studies for ondansetron versus placebo, no statistically significant results were observed for mortality. Only two studies reported prolongation of the QT interval; meta-analysis was not feasible because the studies compared different interventions.

Our network meta-analysis results for vomiting and PONV are similar to those of a previous network meta-analysis that examined only these two outcomes. The only difference was that, unlike the current study, the earlier analysis showed that granisetron was significantly better than ondansetron and dolasetron for PONV. However, we included 378 studies involving a total of 68,167 patients that were not included in the earlier review. Although we are aware of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, the previous researchers did not conduct a network meta-analysis, and therefore the results cannot be compared. Notably, because of our comprehensive literature search and broad eligibility criteria, we included 205 studies involving a total of 43,075 patients that were not included in those previous reviews (Additional file 1: Appendix 22).

### The QT interval prolongation potential of anticancer and supportive drugs: a comprehensive overview [^112Ny4s1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with cancer are prone to prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) due to the use of anticancer drugs with QTc-prolonging potential in combination with electrolyte imbalances caused by, for example, gastrointestinal side-effects. However, most anticancer drugs were approved with little information on their QTc-prolonging potential and the added risk of torsade de pointes. The absence of this information on the drug label poses a considerable challenge to clinicians regarding the measures that need to be taken to safely start anticancer treatment. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence for the QTc-prolonging properties of 205 anticancer drugs and 14 antiemetic drugs available from drug labels, assessment reports, and published studies. We classify the drugs as low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk for QTc prolongation. We also discuss the clinical relevance of these findings and include practical recommendations to guide clinicians to select the drugs with the least QTc-prolonging properties and to adequately monitor susceptible patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^1173KESS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Dopamine receptor antagonists — amisulpride for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV): an IV formulation was recently approved for PONV, and dose–response data indicate that amisulpride 5 mg was more effective vs. placebo (A2) whereas 1 and 2 mg were not (A3). As PONV treatment rescue in prophylaxis naïve patients, 5 and 10 mg were more effective than placebo (A3), and for PONV treatment the 10 mg dose was more effective than 5 mg in patients who had prior PONV prophylaxis with a non-antidopaminergic agent (A3). Safety findings note a mild increase in prolactin with unclear clinical significance, that for the PONV dose amisulpride is unlikely to cause QTc prolongation or extrapyramidal side effects, and that 10 mg IV alone or with ondansetron did not have a clinically significant effect on QTc; a single preoperative oral dose of 25 mg given two hours before craniotomy decreased PONV with no adverse effects.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^114U8Nhp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

The mean effective dose in adults is 75‐100 mg daily or 1‐1.5 mg/kg body weight. 3, 15, 28 Amitriptyline is best titrated in 10‐25 mg increments as this improves tolerability by allowing adaptation to and preventing discontinuation from side effects, particularly daytime sedation. This improves the ultimate efficacy of the medication. Most of the panelists used 10 mg but some used 25 mg. As always, this needs to be individualized based upon the patient response. The incidence of side effects with AT varies from 9% to 25% although this did not result in discontinuation of the drug in most studies. 19 Side effects include daytime sedation, weight gain, dryness of mouth, and constipation. The night‐time administration of AT can often promote sleep, whereas the lingering daytime sedation tends to improve or resolve in 8‐12 weeks. Though most studies have only evaluated AT, NT may be used alternatively to minimize side effects. Given the risk of prolongation of the QTc interval and cardiac arrhythmias, we recommend obtaining an EKG at baseline, once during titration at ~50 mg and after the target dose is reached. More frequent monitoring will vary between individual patients, based on their response to AT and concomitant use of other medications that can prolong the QT interval. It is recommended that the QTc be maintained at < 470 msec for women and < 450 msec for men. The dosage of AT should be reduced or stopped if there is QTc prolongation or development of significant side effects. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias appears to be low, and no serious adverse events have been reported with its use in CVS. Serious psychiatric side effects such as psychotic reactions, hypomania, and delirium may occur with the treatment of depression with amitriptyline but are not reported in CVS, perhaps due to the higher doses typically used to treat the former. 29

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^113nChBs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Medications for nausea and vomiting — domperidone — are discussed for patients who fail metoclopramide, noting limited large RCT data; domperidone, a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are risks, it has fewer central side effects than metoclopramide, and availability in the United States is only through an FDA investigational drug application; the recommended starting dose is 10 mg 3 times a day, although escalation to 20 mg 4 times a day has been reported, this should probably be avoided for cardiovascular safety considerations; published studies reveal modest efficacy, and in a single-center cohort (n = 115) 68% had improvement in symptom scores, although 7% had cardiac side effects requiring drug cessation.

In subjects who were anti‐Ro/SSA‐positive, the global burden of QT‐prolonging risk factors was significantly increased when compared with those who were anti‐Ro/SSA‐negative. Subjects who were anti‐Ro/SSA‐positive were older and more frequently females; had lower potassium and calcium levels; were more frequently affected with IHD and treated with drugs with QT‐prolonging potential (specifically, antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistaminics, antimalarials, antipsychotics, bronchodilators, cholinesterase inhibitors, diuretics, inotropes, proton pump inhibitors, and vasoconstrictors), when compared with subjects who were negative (Table 3).

### Effect of ramosetron on QTc interval: a randomised controlled trial in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery [^115GxAfn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, 0.3 mg of intravenous ramosetron was associated with a significant increase of maximal change in QTc interval during OPCAB. Also, increase of the QTc interval of more than 60 ms, which is considered to increase the risk of TdP was more frequently observed in the ramosetron group. There were no statistically significant differences in the intraoperative haemodynamic variables measured.

Most QTc interval prolonging drugs act by blocking the potassium channel encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). 5-HT 3 antagonists share the same potential proarrhythmic mechanisms. However, not all drugs in the 5-HT 3 antagonist class have clinically significant QTc-interval-prolonging effects. Ondansetron produced dose-related prolongation of QTc interval, but granisetron and palonosetron did not induce significant QTc interval prolongation. There are limited data regarding the effects of ramosetron on QTc interval in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Postoperative QTc interval prolongation was observed in 80% of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Multiple drugs, including opioids, general anaesthetics, antibiotics, and cardioactive drugs, are associated with QT prolongation. In a recent study, QTc interval prolongation was common in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. However, this report did not describe the method of anaesthesia including the use of volatile anaesthetics, which prolong QTc interval and confound the effects of 5-HT 3 antagonists on QTc interval. In the present study, general anaesthesia was maintained during surgery using continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil, which are known to have minimal effects on QTc interval. Mean intraoperative QTc intervals did not increase compared to baseline QTc value in both the ramosetron and placebo groups (Fig. 3). A previous study indicated that tracheal intubation caused significant prolongation of QTc interval during the anaesthetic induction period due to sympathetic stimulation. However, in this study, tracheal intubation was performed 7.6 ± 1.6 min after administration of ramosetron or placebo, and it did not significantly prolong QTc interval (Fig. 3). Sufentanil administered during anaesthetic induction may attenuate the sympathetic stimuli during tracheal intubation.

### Pharmacokinetics and repolarization effects of intravenous and transdermal granisetron [^114rGY1h]. Clinical Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The need for greater clarity about the effects of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists on cardiac repolarization is apparent in the changing product labeling across this therapeutic class. This study assessed the repolarization effects of granisetron, a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist antiemetic, administered intravenously and by a granisetron transdermal system (GTDS).

Experimental Design

In a parallel four-arm study, healthy subjects were randomized to receive intravenous granisetron, GTDS, placebo, or oral moxifloxacin (active control). The primary endpoint was difference in change from baseline in mean Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) between GTDS and placebo (ddQTcF) on days 3 and 5.

Results

A total of 240 subjects were enrolled, 60 in each group. Adequate sensitivity for detection of QTc change was shown by a 5.75 ms lower bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) for moxifloxacin versus placebo at 2 hours postdose on day 3. Day 3 ddQTcF values varied between 0.2 and 1.9 ms for GTDS (maximum upper bound of 90% CI, 6.88 ms), between -1.2 and 1.6 ms for i.v. granisetron (maximum upper bound of 90% CI, 5.86 ms), and between -3.4 and 4.7 ms for moxifloxacin (maximum upper bound of 90% CI, 13.45 ms). Day 5 findings were similar. Pharmacokinetic-ddQTcF modeling showed a minimally positive slope of 0.157 ms/(ng/mL), but a very low correlation (r = 0.090).

Conclusion

GTDS was not associated with statistically or clinically significant effects on QTcF or other electrocardiographic variables. This study provides useful clarification on the effect of granisetron delivered by GTDS on cardiac repolarization.

### Antiemetic therapy for nausea and vomiting in the emergency department [^114ccnA9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antiemetic agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the emergency department (ED). Nevertheless, there are no widely accepted evidence-based guidelines to optimize the use of these medications for nausea or vomiting in this setting.

Objective

The objective of this article is to briefly review the evidence supporting the use of antiemetic agents for the treatment of nausea or vomiting for adults in the ED, and to provide recommendations to help guide therapy.

Discussion

The antiemetic agents studied include droperidol, promethazine, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron. Droperidol was commonly used in the past, and is more effective than prochlorperazine or metoclopramide, but due to the US Food and Drug Administration black box warning regarding the potential for QT prolongation with this drug, its use is limited to refractory cases. Promethazine is more sedating than other comparative agents, and also has the potential for vascular damage upon intravenous administration. It may be a suitable option when sedation is desirable. Patients given prochlorperazine or metoclopramide must be monitored for akathisia that can develop at any time over 48 h post administration. Decreasing the infusion rate can reduce the incidence of this adverse effect, and the effect can be treated with intravenous diphenhydramine. Ondansetron is as effective as promethazine, and is not associated with sedation or akathisia.

Conclusion

Based on the safety and efficacy of ondansetron, it may be used as a first-line agent for relief of nausea or vomiting for most patient populations in the ED.

### Results from the IQ-CSRC prospective study support replacement of the thorough QT study by QT assessment in the early clinical phase [^112oVPbQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

The QT effects of five "QT-positive" and one negative drug were tested to evaluate whether exposure-response analysis can detect QT effects in a small study with healthy subjects. Each drug was given to nine subjects (six for placebo) in two dose levels; positive drugs were chosen to cause 10 to 12 ms and 15 to 20 ms QTcF prolongation. The slope of the concentration/ΔQTc effect was significantly positive for ondansetron, quinine, dolasetron, moxifloxacin, and dofetilide. For the lower dose, an effect above 10 ms could not be excluded, i.e., the upper bound of the confidence interval for the predicted mean ΔΔQTcF effect was above 10 ms. For the negative drug, levocetirizine, a ΔΔQTcF effect above 10 ms was excluded at 6-fold the therapeutic dose. The study provides evidence that robust QT assessment in early-phase clinical studies can replace the thorough QT study.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^1148P5X8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is one of the most common diseases of children, with 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually and about 500,000 deaths of children under 5 years old. The World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as initial treatment in mildly to moderately dehydrated children. Successful treatment with ORT reduces the need for intravenous (IV) fluid therapy and can reduce the duration of hospital stay and prevent unnecessary use of medical resources. Vomiting control is pivotal in the treatment of mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE. In the emergency department (ED), vomiting is a major obstacle to the use of ORT. Recent studies have recommended the use of oral ondansetron as an antiemetic.

Ondansetron is an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 and may cause QT prolongation due to its mechanism of action. Many studies have reported that ondansetron can enable the successful use of ORT by suppressing vomiting. Ondansetron has also been safely and effectively used in patients with cancer and postoperative patients. However, the US Food and Drug Administration reported in 2011 that IV ondansetron possibly caused fatal arrhythmias in patients with prolonged QT interval. On the other hand, recent studies found that IV ondansetron did not cause QT prolongation or increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias in mildly to moderately dehydrated pediatric patients with AGE.

For convenience, oral ondansetron has been preferred to IV ondansetron to treat children with vomiting while receiving ORT. Most previous studies have focused on the safety of IV ondansetron, and there have been no studies of changes in QT interval after oral administration of ondansetron. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE.

### QT interval prolongation associated with the oral use of domperidone in an infant [^1123EvVz]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux is very common in childhood. If conservative procedures fail to relieve it, the use of a potent antiemetic agent that facilitates gastric motility and emptying, such as domperidone, is justified. We report a 4-month-old child who presented with QT interval prolongation after the oral use of domperidone, which normalized after the drug was discontinued.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^113EDgru]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The major finding of this study is that palonosetron did not show significant effects on cardiac repolarization, as measured by the QTc interval in an ICH E14 compliant, moxifloxacin-controlled clinical trial. There were also no effects on HR, atrioventricular conduction (PR interval), depolarization (QRS interval duration), or wave morphology. In addition, there was no evidence of any relationship between palonosetron concentration and QT/QTc parameters over a wide concentration range. This study is also in agreement with recently published data in cancer patients, where palonosetron did not show changes in heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) duration.

In contrast, other 5-HT 3 RAs have been reported to cause QTc interval prolongation. A comparative study reported that both dolasetron and ondansetron prolonged the QTc interval. Dolasetron was found to predominantly alter ventricular depolarization (QRS interval duration), whereas ondansetron primarily affected ventricular repolarization as measured by a prolongation of QT and JT. Moreover, two studies comparing granisetron and ondansetron in children reported significant prolongation of the QTc interval with granisetron, but not with ondansetron.

This study was designed using E14 Guidelines to accurately evaluate the potentially significant implications of cardiovascular toxicity, with the specific aim of detecting the persistent and late electrophysiological variations observed with other 5-HT 3 RAs, following the administration of a supratherapeutic dose of palonosetron that is ninefold greater than the current standard dose (2.25 vs 0.25 mg IV). No significant QTc interval prolongations were detected at any time point during the entire study observation period. Supratherapeutic doses of ondansetron and dolasetron both showed a significant dose-dependent effect on the QTc interval for up to 4 h post-administration, corresponding to a steady-state condition.

Investigating supratherapeutic dosages may be of particular interest considering the pharmacokinetic profile of palonosetron. Compared with first-generation 5-HT 3 RAs, palonosetron has a substantially longer half-life (40 h), which together with its differential receptor binding properties may be associated with its long lasting effects. Despite the long exposure to palonosetron, the present thorough QT/QTc E14-compliant trial demonstrated no dose-related cardiotoxicity.
