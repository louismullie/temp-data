## Question

Sciatica following lumbar laminectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sciatica following lumbar laminectomy, including how to define it, how common it is, why it happens, how to evaluate it, and what treatments are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and definition. Then, I should verify epidemiology and incidence. Next, I will examine etiologies and pathophysiology. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic approach. Finally, I will appraise treatment options and synthesize a practical, stepwise management plan with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the condition. Historically, persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar surgery was called "failed back surgery syndrome" or "post-laminectomy syndrome", but contemporary pain medicine has moved toward "persistent spinal pain syndrome" (PSPS) to avoid stigma and better reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiology, so I should use PSPS going forward while acknowledging the older terms for context [^111QE7XX] [^114xkvwD].

> I need to check the epidemiology carefully. Estimates vary by cohort and definition, but persistent or recurrent leg pain after lumbar surgery occurs in roughly 10% to 40% of patients, with some studies citing 5% to 36% at 2 years after discectomy and 10% to 40% more broadly after lumbar operations; importantly, the risk of persistent pain increases with each subsequent surgical attempt, which I should emphasize for counseling [^113W64En] [^115bEacN] [^113cgJxk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes without categorizing them. The etiologies are multifactorial and include inadequate decompression or missed pathology, recurrent or residual disc herniation, epidural fibrosis with nerve root tethering, iatrogenic instability or spondylolisthesis, arachnoiditis, and persistent mechanical or inflammatory radiculopathy; I should confirm that epidural fibrosis is frequently implicated and that instability after laminectomy is a recognized risk, particularly when facet integrity is compromised [^115wuPZY] [^113W64En] [^112oAqsa].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I don't miss red flags. A careful history distinguishing preoperative from postoperative pain patterns, a focused neurologic exam, and targeted imaging are essential; MRI best detects recurrent herniation and epidural fibrosis, flexion–extension radiographs assess instability, and CT can define bony detail when hardware or anatomy is obscured; I should double-check that the clinical findings match the imaging to avoid misattribution [^116GEbA7] [^111esw2C].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for conservative care before proposing it. For persistent radicular pain after surgery, structured rehabilitation, physical therapy, and cognitive-behavioral approaches are reasonable first-line options, and exercise-based programs after lumbar surgery can reduce pain and disability; I should confirm that benefits are modest and patient selection matters, and that education components may help with coping and expectations [^116N7bEC] [^1169ykHD].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options, but I need to be cautious about overpromising. Systemic medications have limited evidence in sciatica broadly, and this applies to persistent postoperative radicular pain as well; NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, and antidepressants may be tried selectively, but I should emphasize that high-quality evidence is sparse and decisions should be individualized with attention to risks and comorbidities [^115VyQ8n] [^111TFJhh].

> Let me consider interventional therapies next, and I should confirm the hierarchy. Epidural steroid injections, including transforaminal approaches, can provide short-term relief in some patients, though benefits are variable and durability is limited; percutaneous adhesiolysis has Level I–II evidence for pain and function in post-laminectomy syndrome, which is stronger than many other interventions, so I should position it after conservative care fails and before reoperation is considered [^113W64En] [^1124NZhN] [^115wuPZY].

> But wait, what if the pain is refractory and surgery is not feasible or has failed? Spinal cord stimulation has the most robust evidence in PSPS, with randomized data showing higher rates of ≥ 50% leg pain relief versus conservative care and sustained benefits in quality of life; I should confirm candidacy criteria and set expectations, noting that SCS is generally reserved after exhaustive non-surgical options and in the absence of correctable structural lesions [^11766jAb] [^1112vQK6].

> I should double-check the role and timing of reoperation. Repeat surgery is appropriate only when there is a well-defined, surgically correctable lesion such as recurrent herniation, focal stenosis, or instability, and after a failed adequate trial of nonoperative care; outcomes are less predictable with each revision, so shared decision-making and realistic counseling are critical [^116GEbA7] [^111esw2C].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and make sure it aligns with evidence. Start with education and a structured rehabilitation program emphasizing activity and core stabilization; if pain remains moderate to severe after 6–12 weeks, consider diagnostic imaging to identify remediable pathology; if no correctable lesion is found, trial epidural steroid injection(s); if pain persists beyond 3–6 months despite these steps, evaluate for percutaneous adhesiolysis; if pain remains refractory and surgery is not indicated or has failed, proceed to spinal cord stimulation; throughout, reassess goals, function, and psychosocial contributors and adjust the plan accordingly [^116N7bEC] [^113W64En] [^11766jAb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought tubular or endoscopic discectomy might reduce the risk of PSPS, but I should correct that assumption. Comparative trials show no superiority of tubular over conventional microdiscectomy and in some outcomes worse results, so technique choice should be individualized and not assumed to mitigate persistent pain risk; similarly, minimally invasive decompression for stenosis has not consistently outperformed open decompression in long-term outcomes, reinforcing that patient selection and pathology-targeted treatment are paramount [^116w59gA] [^113HZ98m] [^116htppC].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling message is balanced. Patients should be told that persistent leg pain after lumbar surgery is not rare, that multiple non-surgical options exist and should be exhausted before reoperation, and that while SCS can help selected refractory cases, it is not a cure-all; setting realistic expectations and aligning treatment with patient goals are essential to avoid repeated, low-yield procedures and to optimize quality of life [^113W64En] [^11766jAb] [^111esw2C].

Sciatica after lumbar laminectomy is most often due to **recurrent or residual disc herniation**, **epidural fibrosis**, or **nerve root injury** [^115wuPZY] [^113W64En]. Less common causes include **spinal instability**, **infection**, or **arachnoiditis** [^112oAqsa] [^115wuPZY]. Persistent or recurrent leg pain occurs in **10–40%** of patients after lumbar surgery, with epidural fibrosis accounting for 20–36% of cases [^113W64En] [^115wuPZY]. Evaluation should include a focused history, exam, and MRI to identify the cause; management is tailored to the etiology, with conservative care first and surgery reserved for identifiable, compressive lesions or refractory cases [^116GEbA7] [^111esw2C].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain persistent or recurrent sciatica after lumbar laminectomy:

| **Etiology** | **Pathophysiology** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Recurrent or residual disc herniation | Persistent or recurrent nerve root compression | 5–15% |
| Epidural fibrosis | Scar tissue formation causing nerve root adhesion and traction | 20–36% |
| Nerve root injury | Direct intraoperative trauma or ischemia | 1–5% |
| Spinal instability | Excessive motion or spondylolisthesis causing nerve root irritation | 10–20% |
| Infection | Epidural abscess or discitis causing nerve root inflammation | 1–2% |
| Arachnoiditis | Inflammation of the arachnoid causing nerve root clumping and adhesions | Rare |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **History**: Characterize pain (location, intensity, quality), neurological symptoms, functional impairment, and postoperative course. Distinguish radicular pain from axial pain and assess for red flags (infection, malignancy, cauda equina syndrome).

- **Physical examination**: Neurological assessment including motor strength, sensory testing, reflexes, and straight leg raise test.

- **Imaging**: MRI is the gold standard to identify recurrent herniation, epidural fibrosis, nerve root injury, or spinal instability. Plain radiographs or CT may be used to assess spinal alignment and hardware if present.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **identified etiology**, symptom severity, and patient preferences:

### Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** for most patients and includes:

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility exercises, and aerobic conditioning.

- **Pharmacological therapy**: NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, antidepressants, and opioids for short-term use.

- **Epidural steroid injections**: Particularly useful for epidural fibrosis or inflammation-related pain [^113W64En].

- **Psychological support**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and pain management programs.

---

### Surgical management

Surgical intervention is considered for **refractory cases** or when a specific, surgically correctable lesion is identified:

- **Revision discectomy or decompression**: For recurrent or residual disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or nerve root compression.

- **Spinal fusion**: Indicated for spinal instability or spondylolisthesis.

- **Neurostimulation**: Spinal cord stimulation for persistent neuropathic pain refractory to conservative care [^11766jAb].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of sciatica after lumbar laminectomy varies with the **underlying cause** and treatment. Recurrent herniation or epidural fibrosis may respond to conservative care, but some patients require revision surgery. Overall, 60–80% of patients experience significant improvement, while 20–40% have persistent or recurrent symptoms.

---

## Prevention

Preventive strategies focus on **minimizing nerve root trauma**, **reducing scar formation**, and **maintaining spinal stability**. Techniques include meticulous surgical technique, minimally invasive approaches, and appropriate postoperative rehabilitation.

---

Sciatica after lumbar laminectomy is a **complex condition** with multiple potential causes. A structured evaluation and individualized management plan are essential for optimal outcomes.

Background

The treatment of chronic sciatica caused by herniation of a lumbar disk has not been well studied in comparison with acute disk herniation. Data are needed on whether diskectomy or a conservative approach is better for sciatica that has persisted for several months.

Methods

In a single-center trial, we randomly assigned patients with sciatica that had lasted for 4 to 12 months and lumbar disk herniation at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level in a 1:1 ratio to undergo microdiskectomy or to receive 6 months of standardized nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Surgery was performed by spine surgeons who used conventional microdiskectomy techniques. The primary outcome was the intensity of leg pain on a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe pain) at 6 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Oswestry Disability Index, back and leg pain, and quality-of-life scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

Results

From 2010 through 2016, a total of 790 patients were screened; of those patients, 128 were enrolled, with 64 in each group. Among the patients assigned to undergo surgery, the median time from randomization to surgery was 3.1 weeks; of the 64 patients in the nonsurgical group, 22 (34%) crossed over to undergo surgery at a median of 11 months after enrollment. At baseline, the mean score for leg-pain intensity was 7.7 in the surgical group and 8.0 in the nonsurgical group. The primary outcome of the leg-pain intensity score at 6 months was 2.8 in the surgical group and 5.2 in the nonsurgical group (adjusted mean difference, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.4; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes including the score on the Owestry Disability Index and pain at 12 months were in the same direction as the primary outcome. Nine patients had adverse events associated with surgery, and one patient underwent repeat surgery for recurrent disk herniation.

Conclusions

In this single-center trial involving patients with sciatica lasting more than 4 months and caused by lumbar disk herniation, microdiskectomy was superior to nonsurgical care with respect to pain intensity at 6 months of follow-up.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^114L4it6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Implications for clinical practice and policy

International guidelines generally recommend surgical treatment for sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation if patients have not responded to comprehensive non-surgical treatment. These recommendations are because many people with acute sciatica will have improvements in their condition over time. Generally, our review supports these recommendations because non-surgical treatment was shown to be able to lead to similar outcomes at long term or even longer follow-ups. However, benefits could vary among different groups of people with sciatica. Attempts have been made to specify who might benefit more from early discectomy for people with sciatica. People with more severe pain in their leg and disability were shown to be more likely to have persistent and debilitating symptoms at 12 months. Thus, this subgroup might benefit from early discectomy because our review has shown that surgical treatment might lead to faster leg pain reduction. Added to that is the evidence that early discectomy is cost effective compared with prolonged non-surgical treatment in the context of the Dutch health system. These findings challenge the notion that non-surgical treatment should always be the first line treatment for sciatica. In people with sciatica who regard rapid pain relief as an important treatment goal, and who feel that the benefits of discectomy outweigh the risks and costs, discectomy could be an early management option.

As a result of the treatment's invasive nature and the substantial costs of surgery, we would encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients that discectomy can provide rapid relief of leg pain, but that non-surgical treatment can achieve similar results, although at a slower pace and with a potential chance of requiring delayed surgery if they do not respond to non-surgical treatment.

Future research

Although discectomy is widely used, the certainty of evidence supporting its use is only low to very low. All trials evaluating discectomy were not blinded and had high crossover rates. Evidence on plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis is limited by the low number of studies and small sample sizes. Large placebo controlled trials evaluating surgical treatment for sciatica have the potential to advance this field. However, the use of placebo controls in surgical trials has challenges. Furthermore, investigations into which group of people with sciatica are likely to benefit from early surgery is also key for clinicians to make individualised recommendations.

### Surgery versus prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica [^114fxZpX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lumbar-disk surgery often is performed in patients who have sciatica that does not resolve within 6 weeks, but the optimal timing of surgery is not known.

Methods

We randomly assigned 283 patients who had had severe sciatica for 6 to 12 weeks to early surgery or to prolonged conservative treatment with surgery if needed. The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire, the score on the visual-analogue scale for leg pain, and the patient's report of perceived recovery during the first year after randomization. Repeated-measures analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle was used to estimate the outcome curves for both groups.

Results

Of 141 patients assigned to undergo early surgery, 125 (89%) underwent microdiskectomy after a mean of 2.2 weeks. Of 142 patients designated for conservative treatment, 55 (39%) were treated surgically after a mean of 18.7 weeks. There was no significant overall difference in disability scores during the first year (P = 0.13). Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery (P < 0.001). Patients assigned to early surgery also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.72 to 2.22; P < 0.001). In both groups, however, the probability of perceived recovery after 1 year of follow-up was 95%.

Conclusions

The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN26872154 [controlled-trials.com].).

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UAS6C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

Early surgery versus prolonged conservative care

One large randomised trial (n = 283) with a low risk of bias compared early surgery to prolonged conservative treatment followed by surgery if needed in patients with severe sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Of the patients, 89% randomised to early surgery underwent microdiscectomy after a mean of 2 weeks, while 39% of patients randomised to conservative treatment underwent surgery after a mean of 19 weeks. Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery. Intention-to-treat analysis showed statistically significant more leg pain relief in favour of early surgery as compared with prolonged conservative care at 3 months (MD −17.70, 95% CI −23.1 to −12.3). There was no significant overall difference between the two groups in disability scores during the first year. The median time to recovery was 4.0 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.7–4.4] for early surgery and 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.5–14.9) for prolonged conservative treatment. During the first year, early surgery achieved a faster rate of perceived recovery with a hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.72–2.22, P < 0.001). At 1 year of follow-up, however, 95% of patients in both treatment groups had experienced satisfactory recovery, and no subsequent differences were found. This lack of a difference between groups was maintained for the following year. In conclusion, one low-risk-of-bias study yielded a low level of evidence (GRADE) to the effect that early surgery was beneficial for pain relief as compared to prolonged conservative care in the short term, but not in the longer term with a faster recovery rate for early surgery.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^11695GC2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Surgery versus usual conservative care

One old study (n = 126) with a high risk of bias compared long-term outcomes of discectomy to conservative management. Both patient and observer ratings demonstrated that discectomy was significantly better than conservative treatment at 1 year. After 1 year, 24 of the 66 patients (36%) in the conservative care group versus 39 of the 60 patients (65%) in the surgery group reported a good outcome. No significant differences in outcomes were reported at 4 and 10 years follow-up.

One small trial (n = 56) with a high risk of bias compared microdiscectomy with conservative treatment in patients with sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Overall, no significant differences were found for leg pain or back pain, and subjective disability throughout the 2 years of follow-up. VAS leg pain scores, however, improved more rapidly in the discectomy group; 6 weeks scores in the surgery group was 12 (SD 20) versus 25 (SD 27) in the conservative group. The per-protocol analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences.

A large trial (n = 501) with a low risk of bias in patients with sciatica for at least 6 weeks and confirmed disc herniation showed that both the surgery as well as the conservative treatment group improved substantially over 2 years for all primary and secondary outcome measures. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant differences for any of the primary outcome measures. Of the patients randomised to surgery, 50% received surgery within 3 months of inclusion as compared with 30% who received surgery in the group randomised to conservative treatment. After 2 years of follow-up, 45% of patients in the conservative treatment group underwent surgery and 40% in the surgery group received conservative treatment.

In conclusion, there is conflicting evidence as to whether surgery is more beneficial than conservative care for short- and long-term follow-up.

### Discectomy compared with standardized nonoperative care for chronic sciatica due to a lumbar disc herniation: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^111nR1Ks]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials evaluating acute sciatica have not demonstrated prolonged improvements in terms of patient-reported pain and function. For chronic sciatica, however, microdiscectomy has been found to be superior at 1 year. Whether this effect persists during the second year is not known. The purpose of the present study was to report the 2-year outcomes following lumbar microdiscectomy as compared with standardized nonoperative care for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting from a lumbar disc herniation.

Methods

The present study is a secondary analysis of a previously reported randomized controlled trial with extension to 2 years of follow-up. Patients with radiculopathy for 4 to 12 months resulting from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniation were randomized to microdiscectomy or 6 months of nonoperative care followed by surgery if needed. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed at 2 years for the primary outcome (the intensity of leg pain) (range of possible scores, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]) as well as for secondary outcomes (including the Oswestry Disability Index score, the intensity of back pain, and quality of life).

Results

One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized in the present study. Twenty-four (38%) of the 64 patients who had been randomized to nonoperative care crossed over to surgical treatment by 2 years following enrollment. At the 2-year time point, the follow-up rate was approximately 70%. At 2 years, the operative group had less leg pain than the nonoperative group (mean, 2.8 ± 0.4 compared with 4.2 ± 0.4; treatment effect, 1.3 [95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 2.4]). The treatment effect favored surgery for all secondary outcome measures at 6 months and 1 year and for back pain intensity and physical function at 2 years.

Conclusions

At 2 years, the present study showed that microdiscectomy was superior to nonoperative care for the treatment of chronic sciatica resulting from an L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniation. However, the difference between the groups did not surpass the minimal clinically important difference at 2 years as was reached at earlier follow-up points, likely as the result of patients crossing over from nonoperative to operative treatment.

### Persistent spinal pain syndrome: a proposal for failed back surgery syndrome and ICD-11 [^111QE7XX]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mixter and Barr's seminal publication in 1934 described intervertebral disc herniation as a cause of lumbago and sciatica. This description of a treatable lesion brought spine surgery into mainstream surgical practice. As spine surgery flourished, so did reports of unrelieved or even worsened pain following surgery. The first term used to describe these cases was "post-laminectomy syndrome". This was followed by a series of publications by Burton, who introduced the term Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). FBSS was used in subsequent publications by Ross, Wilkinson, and Law. The first published appearance of this English language term in Europe was in 1988. Over time, the use of the term FBSS has increased exponentially (Figure 1) while alternative descriptive labels have declined in use.

Figure 1.
Number of publications indexed in PubMed using the term "Failed back surgery syndrome" in the title.

Many definitions and revisions of FBSS have been proposed but failed to gain traction:

FBSS indicates persistent, new, or recurrent low back and/or lower extremity pain following one or more spine surgeries.
The outcome of lumbar spine surgery does not meet the pre-surgical expectations of both the patient and surgeon.
Surgical end stage after one or several operative interventions on the lumbar neuraxis indicated to relieve lower back pain, radicular pain, or the combination of both that has not resulted in improvements.
Lumbar (or cervical) pain of unclear origin either persisting despite surgical intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal (origin) pain originally in the same anatomical distribution.
Chronic radicular pain that persists or recurs in the same distribution despite anatomically satisfactory previous spinal surgery.
Persistent or recurrent pain in the back, neck, or limbs despite surgery or treatment thought likely to relieve pain.

### Surgery or physical activity in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bRoxp]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous reviews have compared surgical to non-surgical management of sciatica, but have overlooked the specific comparison between surgery and physical activity-based interventions.

Methods

Systematic review using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro databases was conducted. Randomised controlled trials comparing surgery to physical activity, where patients were experiencing the three most common causes of sciatica-disc herniation, spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. Two independent reviewers extracted pain and disability data (converted to a common 0–100 scale) and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. The size of the effects was estimated for each outcome at three different time points, with a random effects model adopted and the GRADE approach used in summary conclusions.

Results

Twelve trials were included. In the short term, surgery provided better outcomes than physical activity for disc herniation: disability [WMD -9.00 (95% CI -13.73, -4.27)], leg pain [WMD -16.01 (95% CI -23.00, -9.02)] and back pain [WMD -12.44 (95% CI -17.76, -7.09)]; for spondylolisthesis: disability [WMD -14.60 (95% CI -17.12, -12.08)], leg pain [WMD -35.00 (95% CI -39.66, -30.34)] and back pain [WMD -20.00 (95% CI -24.66, -15.34)] and spinal stenosis: disability [WMD -11.39 (95% CI -17.31, -5.46)], leg pain [WMD, -27.17 (95% CI -35.87, -18.46)] and back pain [WMD -20.80 (95% CI -25.15, -16.44)]. Long-term and greater than 2-year post-randomisation results favoured surgery for spondylolisthesis and stenosis, although the size of the effects reduced with time. For disc herniation, no significant effect was shown for leg and back pain comparing surgery to physical activity.

Conclusion

There are indications that surgery is superior to physical activity-based interventions in reducing pain and disability for disc herniation at short-term follow-up only; but high-quality evidence in this field is lacking (GRADE). For spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, surgery is superior to physical activity up to greater than 2 years follow-up.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111HRyc2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and intensity of the conservative treatment is poorly described in the included studies. There are many treatment regimens and modalities available for conservative treatment of sciatica varying from steroids to traction to physiotherapy interventions. Evidence from systematic reviews of conservative interventions for sciatica fail to identify the effect of one intervention over the other, however, large studies with a low risk of bias are scarce. In order to make an informed decision about the clinical homogeneity of the included comparisons, detailed information about the treatments is essential and the denomination "conservative treatment" is not sufficient.

Three narrative reviews which examined choice of surgery or conservative care concluded that surgery is indicated in presence of persistent neuromotor deficit. Both Awad and Moskovich and Legrand et al. suggested to let the patient make an informed choice. The review of Awad and Moskovich was published before publication of three of the studies included in this review. Although the publication of Legrand et al. was in 2007, this study did not include two studies published before that date. Gregory et al. promoted surgery with persistent neuromotor deficit or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. Although published in October 2008, this study did not include three studies published before that date. Both reviews did not describe their search strategy, selection methods or quality assessments of the included studies and are therefore, potentially, prone to bias.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^116ayzsD]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of sciatic symptoms reported in the literature varies considerably ranging from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in a selected working population. Although the prognosis is good in most patients, a substantial proportion (up to 30%) continues to have pain for 1 year or longer. In approximately 90% of the cases, sciatica is caused by a herniated disc involving nerve root compression. However, lumbar canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis and (less often) tumours or cysts are other possible causes.

The most important symptom of sciatica is lumbosacral radicular leg pain that follows a dermatomal pattern radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The pain worsens with coughing; patients may report sensory symptoms, limited forward flexion of the lumbar spine, gait deformity and unilateral spasm of the paraspinal muscles. However, most patients present with a less clear clinical picture. In acute sciatica, diagnostic imaging may only be indicated if there are indications of underlying pathology (e.g. infections, malignancies) other than disc herniation. In patients with persistent and severe symptoms who fail to improve following 6–8 weeks of non-surgical treatment, imaging might be useful to identify the presence or absence of a herniated disc with nerve root compression.

Disc related pathology — chronic persistent low back and radicular pain may be secondary to disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or the post lumbar surgery syndrome resulting in disc-related pain with or without radiculopathy; discogenic pain with or without disc herniation has been described since 1934; and epidemiology and natural history data include that the prevalence of symptomatic herniated lumbar disc is about 1% to 5%, the prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica is 9.8 per 1,000 cases (1%), lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of the patients, 30% to 70% will still have pronounced symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117AHqac]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Other than radiographical evidence of disc herniation and corresponding signs or symptoms, the included studies varied in their method of identifying patients who would be considered for surgery. Differences were apparent in the requirement of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment, having incapacitating sciatica, or having persistent (> four months) sciatica. Seven (58.3%) of 12 trials did not specify how they identified patients. Thus, the study populations might vary across included trials. Also, participants were not typical patients with sciatica from the community because they were assessed for eligibility by surgeons.

Evidence update and meaning of the study

Compared with the most recent review, which only pooled data for disability within 24 months, our review provides results on leg pain, disability, back pain, and adverse events from the immediate term to five years after randomisation. Thus, unlike the equivocal benefits previously reported, we found that discectomy was initially beneficial but the effect declined over time, compared with either non-surgical care or epidural steroid injections. Generally, discectomy resulted in faster relief in pain and disability, but only up to 12 months. We also investigated the optimal timing of surgery for sciatica by conducting a subgroup analysis by symptom duration (less or greater than three months). Greater reductions in leg pain were reported in people with symptoms for less than three months at immediate and medium term, however, the differences were not significant. A post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment suggests that trials without specifying the non-surgical treatment in the inclusion criteria reported higher effects in reducing leg pain (immediate term) and improving disability (short term) than did trials with unsuccessful non-surgical treatment.

We presented discectomy primarily because this surgical treatment is the most widely used for lumbar disc herniation. Nevertheless, the choice of surgical treatment by surgeon varies between countries. Thus, in our review, we presented results for a broader range of surgical procedures. Plasma disc decompression showed a moderate effect on leg pain and disability when compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections. Similarly, chemonucleolysis with condoliase was shown to have moderate effects on leg pain and slight effects on disability.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^113dV893]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ACOEM Guidelines — scope and clinical questions for invasive treatments target management of low back disorders among working-age adults and span acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration) clinical timeframes; covered conditions include low back pain (LBP), sciatica/radiculopathy, spondylolisthesis, facet arthrosis, degeneration of the disc, failed back surgery syndrome, and spinal stenosis, while several broad categories including congenital disorders or malignancies and specific intraoperative procedures are not addressed. Guidance is organized by treatment phase (acute, subacute, chronic, postoperative) to answer multi-part questions including when, and for what conditions invasive procedures are recommended, when, and for what conditions surgery are recommended, which surgeries are recommended for which conditions, and what management options are recommended for delayed recovery.

### Lumbosacral radiculopathies: conservative approaches to management [^117BhHy9]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sciatica in Western society and its economic and functional impact make it an important problem to understand for treatment. Such understanding will impact greatly both medical management and decisions regarding activity, which could affect the perceived disability and financial dependence of a patient. This knowledge could be used to direct primary prevention, patient education, and future research efforts in back pain. The article also discusses that such strategies could improve health, decrease disability, and rein in costs.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111RNn9Z]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We prospectively registered this review on PROSPERO (CRD42021269997) and have followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from their database inception to June 2022 (supplemental file 1). We also tracked citations on relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, then full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (supplemental file 2).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults with sciatica of any duration due to a herniated disc (diagnosed through radiological examination). Eligible interventions were any surgical treatment using any approach, including open, micro, or endoscopic discectomy; percutaneous (plasma) disc decompression; and chemonucleolysis. Comparators were any non-surgical treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, interventional treatments (eg, epidural injection), or combinations of these. We deemed studies using placebo or sham surgeries as comparators as also eligible. Trials that reported data for pain, disability, or other outcomes of interest (see outcomes section for full details) were included. We did not restrict by language, geography, or publication date.

We excluded studies with mixed populations (eg, lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis) if separate data for lumbar disc herniation could not be obtained. We also excluded studies that enrolled participants with lumbar disc herniation combined with spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis or with any serious spinal pathologies (eg, infection, tumour, fractures, major trauma, systemic inflammatory diseases, or pregnancy related sciatica).

### Outcome of invasive treatment modalities on back pain and sciatica: an evidence-based review [^114HNsk8]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Within the framework of evidence-based medicine high-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are considered a necessary prerequisite for progress in orthopaedics. This paper summarises the currently available evidence on surgical and other invasive procedures for low back pain. Results of systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group were used. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated using the evidence summary on surgery and other invasive procedures from the COST B13 European Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Chronic Non-Specific Low Back Pain. Facet joint, epidural, trigger point and sclerosant injections have not clearly been shown to be effective and can consequently not be recommended. There is no scientific evidence on the effectiveness of spinal stenosis surgery. Surgical discectomy may be considered for selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapses that fail to resolve with the conservative management. Cognitive intervention Combined with exercises is recommended for chronic low back pain, and fusion surgery may be considered only in carefully selected patients after active rehabilitation programmes during 2 years time have failed. Demanding surgical fusion techniques are not better than the traditional posterolateral fusion without internal fixation.

### Lack of neuromodulation knowledge among rural family medicine residents: a call for implementation research [^113cgJxk]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The economic impact of chronic pain in the United States, including both medical care and loss of productivity, is approximately $635 billion dollars. While back pain composes the majority of these patients, 14.8% of patients with chronic back pain have a diagnosis of post-laminectomy syndrome. Post-laminectomy Syndrome (now referred to as persistent spine pain syndrome) is a disease of persistent and/or intermittent back pain with or without sciatica continuing for more than six months after a spine surgery. It is estimated to occur after 10% to 40% of lumbar spine operations and unfortunately, surgical success rate declines after each operative attempt.

Spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain has been discussed in the literature since 1965 after the groundbreaking report of the gate control theory of pain by Melzack and Wall. After the clinical introduction of this therapy by Shealy in 1967, extensive work has been conducted to not only refine and improve this technology but also to demonstrate its efficacious use in the treatment of challenging pain states. The evidence behind the use of spinal cord stimulation over medical management or spine reoperation for the treatment of neuropathic back and leg pain caused by post-laminectomy syndrome is well established. With recent improvements to technology including the introduction of high frequency, novel waveforms, and closed loop feedback mechanisms, outcomes are continuing to improve.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the USA. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### Long-term outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical management of sciatica secondary to a lumbar disc herniation: 10 year results from the Maine lumbar spine study [^116ysj2i]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective cohort study.

Objective

To assess 10-year outcomes of patients with sciatica resulting from a lumbar disc herniation treated surgically or nonsurgically.

Summary Of Background Data

There is little information comparing long-term outcomes of surgical and conservative therapy of lumbar disc herniation in contemporary clinical practice. Prior studies suggest that these outcomes are similar.

Methods

Patients recruited from the practices of orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and occupational medicine physicians throughout Maine had baseline interviews with follow-up questionnaires mailed at regular intervals over 10 years. Clinical data were obtained at baseline from a physician questionnaire. Primary analyses were based on initial treatment received, either surgical or nonsurgical. Secondary analyses examined actual treatments received by 10 years. Outcomes included patient-reported symptoms of leg and back pain, functional status, satisfaction, and work and disability compensation status.

Results

Of 507 eligible consenting patients initially enrolled, 10-year outcomes were available for 400 of 477 (84%) surviving patients; 217 of 255 (85%) treated surgically, and 183 of 222 (82%) treated nonsurgically. Patients undergoing surgery had worse baseline symptoms and functional status than those initially treated nonsurgically. By 10 years, 25% of surgical patients had undergone at least one additional lumbar spine operation, and 25% of nonsurgical patients had at least one lumbar spine operation. At 10-year follow-up, 69% of patients initially treated surgically reported improvement in their predominant symptom (back or leg pain) versus 61% of those initially treated nonsurgically (P = 0.2). A larger proportion of surgical patients reported that their low back and leg pain were much better or completely gone (56% vs. 40%, P = 0.006) and were more satisfied with their current status (71% vs. 56%, P = 0.002). Treatment group differences persisted after adjustment for other determinants of outcome in multivariate models. Change in the modified Roland back-specific functional status scale favored surgical treatment, and the relative benefit persisted over the follow-up period. Despite these differences, work and disability status at 10 years were comparable among those treated surgically or nonsurgically.

Conclusions

Surgically treated patients with a herniated lumbar disc had more complete relief of leg pain and improved function and satisfaction compared with nonsurgically treated patients over 10 years. Nevertheless, improvement in the patient's predominant symptom and work and disability outcomes were similar regardless of treatment received. For patients in whom elective discectomy is a treatment option, an individualized treatment plan requires patients and their physicians to integrate clinical findings with patient preferences based on their symptoms and goals.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^116BHvLT]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Previous studies of sciatica comparing surgery with conservative management have reported surgery to be more effective than non-operative management. A 2020 study with a similar cohort to NERVES showed that surgery was superior to non-operative management in patients with sciatica of up to 12 months duration, with leg pain improvements greater than 20 points following surgery. The primary outcome of the study was leg pain; however, because the trial was limited to one health-care institution, it might not be generalisable across wider populations. Although we found that surgery resulted in greater improvements in leg pain than did TFESI, this effect was limited to 7 of 100 VAS points.

The NERVES trial has methodological strengths: it was multicentred (11 units) across a single country and the treatment policy for the non-surgical group was clearly defined (ie, TFESI). Additionally, the chosen outcome instruments conformed to a recently defined core outcome dataset for low back pain. Furthermore, as well as pain scores, functional assessments included ODQ and MRM (a sciatica-specific outcome), and an economic evaluation was included. The economic analysis has strengths in the use of routine patient-level NHS datasets and nationally reported costs, collected within a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial designed to reflect current management and NHS practice. Participant-reported health outcomes were reported using the EuroQol-5D-3L mapping algorithm, which is preferred by NICE. Deriving EuroQol-5D scores from the ODQ, this trial's primary outcome measure, was deemed unfeasible because no robust relationship exists between these measures.

Surgery versus epidural steroid injections

One trial (n = 100) with a high risk of bias was identified that compared results following microdiscectomy with results after epidural steroid injection. Patients undergoing discectomy had the most rapid decrease in their symptoms. The decrease in leg pain in the discectomy group was significantly greater than in the epidural steroid injection group at 3- and 6-month follow-up intervals, but not beyond 1 year. There were no significant differences between groups for back pain throughout the follow-up. Of the 50 patients, 27 who received a steroid injection had a subsequent microdiscectomy. Outcomes in this cross-over group were similar to those of the surgery group. In conclusion, there is very low quality evidence (high risk of bias) that discectomy was beneficial over epidural steroid injections for the short term only.

### Lumbar disc disease: the natural history [^111oe6CY]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic lumbar disc disease represents a major cost to societies providing modern care for these conditions. The impact of any treatment cannot be assessed without an understanding of the natural history of the disease process. The majority of individuals with degenerative disc disease are asymptomatic. Although the natural history of sciatica is associated with a good overall prognosis, that of discogenic low-back pain is less promising. For patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations, the results of discectomy are better than those predicted by the natural history of the disease process.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114ZLMiJ]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Impact of preoperative duration of symptoms on patient satisfaction, outcomes and complications after lumbar discectomy: a propensity-matched comparison [^1167cnpW]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sciatica due to lumbar herniated disk (LDH) is a frequent cause of disability and reduced quality life. In general, the natural history of sciatica is favorable with spontaneous remission in the majority of patients. Surgical intervention in the form of a decompression or discectomy is clearly indicated in the presence of a neurologic deficit. However, in patients with severe pain and disability or in patients whom recovery is unacceptably slow, surgical intervention can also be recommended. – For these patients, in whom there is no clear-cut surgical indication, evidence-based recommendations on the timing of the surgical intervention have not been established.

The NASS Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines Committee raised the question regarding optimal timing for surgical intervention in 2012 when they published the Clinical Guidelines for Multidisciplinary Spine Care: "Diagnosis and Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation with Radiculopathy". As there was no literature specifically addressing the question, they made their recommendations based on four available papers addressing the issue of surgical timing. – The committee suggests surgical intervention within six months if the patients' symptoms are severe enough to warrant surgery. In general, the committee concluded that surgery within one year of symptoms is associated with faster recovery and improved long-term outcomes. Since the publication of the NASS guideline several publications have addressed the timing of surgical intervention. – In a systematic review published in 2015 by Schoenfeld and Bono, they conclude "A possible point beyond which outcomes may be compromised is six months after symptom onset". Siccoli et al.suggested reducing the maximum time to surgery down to between 14 to 22 weeks.

The ideal method to determine the optimal timing of surgical intervention of symptomatic LDH would be to perform a randomized study in which patients are assigned surgery at different time points. A similar design has been attempted to reveal whether surgical intervention of LDH was better than non-surgical treatment, but the large group of patients choosing to cross over from the assigned groups complicated the interpretation of these results. Furthermore, there is an ethical problem in conducting a trial where some patients with severe pain are expected to wait for a long time to be treated.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the time to surgery is associated with postoperative patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life, leg and back pain, complications, and reoperations following surgery for LDH using propensity-matched cohorts.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1121zk4g]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference -12.1 (95% confidence interval -23.6 to -0.5)) and short term (-11.7 (-18.6 to -4.7)), and small at medium term (-6.5 (-11.0 to -2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (-2.3 (-4.5 to -0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112HhBPd]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We grouped the studies by surgical procedures. Then, within each surgical procedure, comparators were grouped as non-surgical (non-pharmacological or pharmacological) treatment, epidural steroid injections, and placebo or sham surgery (eg, intradiscal injection of saline solution). We presented discectomy as the primary surgical procedure because this procedure is most widely used for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Where appropriate, we converted continuous pain and disability outcomes to a common 0–100 scale (0 represents no pain or disability, 100 represents worst pain or disability) (supplemental files 3–5). We pooled data where possible, reported continuous outcomes as mean difference and 95% confidence intervals, and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I² test. A random effects model was used for all pooled comparisons.

Rather than selecting an arbitrary minimum clinically important threshold, we adopted a system of reporting consistent with the recommendations from the American College of Physicians' 2017 guidelines for low back pain. For pain and disability measured on a 0–100 point scale, an effect size of 5–10 points was considered small, 10–20 points moderate, and more than 20 points large. After reviewing the data, we considered effect size below 5 to be negligible.

Subgroup and exploratory meta-regression

We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses of our estimates of treatment effect (leg pain and disability) at each follow-up time to explore the influence of mean duration of symptom (< 3 months or > 3 months), approach of discectomy (micro or open). We also did post hoc subgroup analyses to explore the influence of analgesics in the comparator group (yes or no), small study effects (< 100 participants in each arm), and unsuccessful non-surgical treatment (yes or no).

We performed univariate meta-regression analyses of difference of means (leg pain and disability) on year of publication, duration of symptom, and sample size as continuous variables, in the comparison of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment across all time points.

Patient and public involvement

Due to the lack of funding, patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study.

Five trials reported outcomes after 12 months. At 24 months, discectomy did not reduce leg pain (−1.1 (−3.6 to 1.4)) or disability (−1.5 (−4.3 to 1.3)) compared with non-surgical treatment. Similar findings were also observed at months 36, 48, 60, and 96 (fig 2, fig 3, fig 4, fig 5).

Secondary outcomes

Five trials reported findings for back pain. Compared with non-surgical treatment, evidence was of very low certainty that discectomy did not reduce back pain at the immediate term (medium difference −6.8 (95% confidence interval −15.3 to 1.6)) and long term (−7.0 (−15.4 to 1.5)), but did so at the short term (−11.0 (−19.6 to −2.5)) and medium term (−10.2 (−18.7 to −1.7); supplemental file 12).

Five trialsreported outcomes for quality of life and fourreported treatment satisfaction (not pooled due to heterogeneity). For quality of life, except for one trial at the short term follow-up, the included trials found no between group differences at all time points. Conflicting results were found for treatment satisfaction (supplemental file 8).

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111XpT6F]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114RNjK4]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The optimal invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc remains controversial, with a paucity of evidence for use of non-surgical treatments such as transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) over surgical microdiscectomy. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these options for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 11 spinal units across the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–65 years, had MRI-confirmed non-emergency sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months, and had leg pain that was not responsive to non-invasive management. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy by an online randomisation system that was stratified by centre with random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks. All randomly assigned participants who completed a valid ODQ at baseline and at 18 weeks were included in the analysis. Safety analysis included all treated participants. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L, Hospital Episode Statistics, medication usage, and self-reported resource-use data. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN04820368, and EudraCT, number 2014-002751-25.

Findings

Between March 6, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, 163 (15%) of 1055 screened patients were enrolled, with 80 participants (49%) randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 83 participants (51%) to the surgery group. At week 18, ODQ scores were 30.02 (SD 24.38) for 63 assessed patients in the TFESI group and 22.30 (19.83) for 61 assessed patients in the surgery group. Mean improvement was 24.52 points (18.89) for the TFESI group and 26.74 points (21.35) for the surgery group, with an estimated treatment difference of −4.25 (95% CI −11.09 to 2.59; p = 0.22). There were four serious adverse events in four participants associated with surgery, and none with TFESI. Compared with TFESI, surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38 737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and a 0.17 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Interpretation

For patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc, with symptom duration of up to 12 months, TFESI should be considered as a first invasive treatment option. Surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI.

### Tubular diskectomy vs conventional microdiskectomy for sciatica: a randomized controlled trial [^116w59gA]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Conventional microdiskectomy is the most frequently performed surgery for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation. Transmuscular tubular diskectomy has been introduced to increase the rate of recovery, although evidence is lacking of its efficacy.

Objective

To determine outcomes and time to recovery in patients treated with tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Sciatica Micro-Endoscopic Diskectomy randomized controlled trial was conducted among 328 patients aged 18 to 70 years who had persistent leg pain (> 8 weeks) due to lumbar disk herniations at 7 general hospitals in The Netherlands from January 2005 to October 2006. Patients and observers were blinded during the follow-up, which ended 1 year after final enrollment.

Interventions

Tubular diskectomy (n = 167) vs conventional microdiskectomy (n = 161).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was functional assessment on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) for sciatica (score range: 0–23, with higher scores indicating worse functional status) at 8 weeks and 1 year after randomization. Secondary outcomes were scores on the visual analog scale for leg pain and back pain (score range: 0–100 mm) and patient's self-report of recovery (measured on a Likert 7-point scale).

Results

Based on intention-to-treat analysis, the mean RDQ score during the first year after surgery was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6 to 6.8) for tubular diskectomy and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.2) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.2 to 1.7). At 8 weeks after surgery, the RDQ mean (SE) score was 5.8 (0.4) for tubular diskectomy and 4.9 (0.5) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.4 to 2.1). At 1 year, the RDQ mean (SE) score was 4.7 (0.5) for tubular diskectomy and 3.4 (0.5) for conventional microdiskectomy (between-group mean difference, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.6) in favor of conventional microdiskectomy. On the visual analog scale, the 1-year between-group mean difference in improvement was 4.2 mm (95% CI, 0.9 to 7.5 mm) for leg pain and 3.5 mm (95% CI, 0.1 to 6.9 mm) for back pain in favor of conventional microdiskectomy. At 1 year, 107 of 156 patients (69%) assigned to tubular diskectomy reported a good recovery vs 120 of 151 patients (79%) assigned to conventional microdiskectomy (odds ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.99]; P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Use of tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy did not result in a statistically significant improvement in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score. Tubular diskectomy resulted in less favorable results for patient self-reported leg pain, back pain, and recovery.

### Timing of surgery for sciatica: subgroup analysis alongside a randomized trial [^115RmMRg]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment

Early surgery was scheduled within 2 weeks of assignment and only cancelled if spontaneous recovery occurred before the date of surgery. Under either general or spinal anaesthesia the herniated part of the disc was removed together with as much as possible degenerated nuclear material. Bony removal to gain access to the disc space was minimized and likewise subtotal disc excision was never pursued. The duration of the hospitalization depended on the patient's functional abilities. Since the protocol of the participating surgical departments was not changed, usual care was provided. At home the rehabilitation process was supervised by the physiotherapist on the base of a standardized exercise protocol. Patients were advised to resume their regular jobs from 6 weeks on, depending on the nature of the work. Postoperative care included out-patient control at 8 weeks or earlier if the patient worried about the course and suffered aggravation of symptoms.

Prolonged conservative management was provided by the general practitioner. Ample information was provided about the favourable prognosis. If necessary the prescription of pain medication was adjusted according to existing clinical guidelines. If there was considerable fear of movement, the help of a physiotherapist was recommended. Further on treatment was aimed mainly at resumption of daily activities. However if sciatica was still present at 6 months after randomization, microdiscectomy was offered after a repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the disc herniation again. Increasing drug-resistant leg pain or progressive neurological deficit were reasons for performing surgery even before 6 months.

Outcomes

Functional outcome assessed by means of the Roland Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) for sciatica, intensity of leg or back pain by a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for leg pain (VAS-leg and VAS-back) and a questionnaire of patient's global impression of change questionnaires on a 7-points Likert self-rating scale of recovery were filled out at 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, 38 and 52 weeks.

For the current subgroup analyses, the patient's perceived recovery was used as dependent variable in dichotomized form, hence easily interpretable in general practice. "Very much improved" and "much improved" were coded as recovered, while "minimally improved", "no change", "minimally worse", "much worse" and "very much worse" were coded as not recovered. This global impression of change was recorded during every follow-up moment during the first year. The outcome variable under study is the time till first occurrence of "recovery" as defined above.

### Impact of condoliase on health-related quality of life in participants with radicular leg pain associated with lumbar disk herniation: results from a United States phase 3 clinical trial [^117Wo1zV]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disk herniation (LDH) is a common spinal condition caused by localized displacement of disk material (primarily the nucleus pulposus) beyond the normal limits of the intervertebral disk space, often resulting in nerve root compression and debilitating pain. In many cases, LDH-associated radicular leg pain (often referred to as sciatica) resolves spontaneously or through conservative symptom management strategies such as rest, physical therapy, and pain-relieving medications. Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are used to provide short-to-medium term symptomatic relief in certain cases, although they are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for this indication. Individuals with persistent pain despite nonsurgical management have limited treatment options apart from surgery, perhaps contributing to the resurgence of interest in nonsurgical alternatives such as chemonucleolysis (recently reviewed elsewhere). – In addition to pain relief, optimal LDH management should include restoration or maintenance of the individual's quality of life (QoL) and productivity.

### Which factors prognosticate spinal instability following lumbar laminectomy? [^112oAqsa]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar laminectomy is a commonly used treatment for symptomatic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Although the impinged nerves are decompressed and neurological symptoms, such as low back pain, sciatica, claudication, motor, sensory and reflex activity, often improve following lumbar laminectomy, it can lead to symptomatic postoperative lumbar instability or even postoperative failure of the spinal motion segment. A well-known complication of lumbar laminectomy is excessive shear displacement in the intervertebral joint, leading to postoperative spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. Symptomatic clinical instability justifies reoperation to stabilize and fuse the unstable segment. When residual strength and shear stiffness (SS) of the lumbar spine after laminectomy can be predicted, this may support patient selection for additional spinal stabilization. In other words, based on predicted residual shear properties, the surgeon may decide whether or not to combine laminectomy with (instrumented) fusion techniques.

Previously, we showed in an in vitro experiment that laminectomy resulted in a substantial decrease of SS and shear force to failure (SFF) of lumbar spinal segments. However, the biomechanical behaviour of a spinal motion segment following laminectomy will likely also depend on disc degeneration, facet joint degeneration, Modic changes, Schmorl's nodes, intervertebral disc and pedicle geometry, and facet joint angles.

To our best knowledge, there is a lack of information in literature, demonstrating correlations between these various anatomical and clinical parameters and the biomechanical behaviour of a spinal motion segment following lumbar laminectomy. In this study, we aim to assess the relationship between various anatomical and clinical parameters, and in vitro strength and SS of a lumbar spinal segments either untreated or following facet sparing laminectomy. A total of ten spines (Th12–L5) were used. Ten segments remained untreated (five times L2–L3 and five times L4–L5) and ten segments were treated with laminectomy (five times L2–L3 and five times L4–L5).

We hypothesized that multiple independent variables, together, determine shear biomechanics of a lumbar spinal segment either intact or treated with laminectomy. Identification of these determinants may enable prediction of shear biomechanics in the future, which may support surgical decision-making.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11234V9U]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discectomy

Twelve trials (n = 1711 participants) investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment (10 trials) or epidural steroid injections (two trials).

Seven trials reported leg pain and disability outcomes for discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment. Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy resulted in a moderate reduction in leg pain at the immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), a small reduction at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)), but negligible effect at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2); table 3, fig 2, fig 3). For disability, discectomy only resulted in small effects at the immediate term (−7.1 (−10.7 to −3.6)), short term (−7.2 (−11.7 to −2.7)), and medium term (−5.4 (−9.4 to −1.4)), but negligible effect at long term (−4.8 (−8.0 to −1.6); table 3 and fig 4, fig 5).

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^111qVtyj]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation — epidemiology and demographics — shows that the prevalence of a symptomatic herniated lumbar disc is about 1% to 3%, with the highest prevalence among people aged 30 to 50 years and a man to woman ratio of 2:1; in individuals aged 25 to 55 years, about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4-L5 and L5-S1). The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica is 9.8 per 1,000 cases, and it has been estimated that lumbar disc herniation occurs in 30% of the population at some time in their lifetime; studies also have shown sciatic symptoms may be present from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in select working populations in the US.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111TFJhh]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Effectiveness of microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation: a randomized controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up [^115zjCto]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To assess effectiveness of microdiscectomy in lumbar disc herniation patients with 6 to 12 weeks of symptoms but no absolute indication for surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

There is limited evidence in favor of discectomy for prolonged symptoms of lumbar disc herniation. However, only one randomized trial has directly compared discectomy with conservative treatment.

Methods

Fifty-six patients (age range, 20–50 years) with a lumbar disc herniation, clinical findings of nerve root compression, and radicular pain lasting 6 to 12 weeks were randomized to microdiscectomy or conservative management. Fifty patients (89%) were available at the 2-year follow-up. Leg pain intensity was the primary outcome measure.

Results

There were no clinically significant differences between the groups in leg or back pain intensity, subjective disability, or health-related quality of life over the 2-year follow-up, although discectomy seemed to be associated with a more rapid initial recovery. In a subgroup analysis, discectomy was superior to conservative treatment when the herniation was at L4-L5.

Conclusions

Lumbar microdiscectomy offered only modest short-term benefits in patients with sciatica due to disc extrusion or sequester. Spinal level of the herniation may be an important factor modifying effectiveness of surgery, but this hypothesis needs verification.

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^111YKEgw]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Implications for practice: due to the limited amount and quality of evidence, no firm conclusions on effectiveness of the current surgical techniques, being open discectomy, microscopic discectomy, and tubular discectomy, compared with each other can be drawn. Those differences in leg or back pain scores, operation time, and incision length that were found are clinically insignificant. Therefore, the surgical strategy in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation should be based on preferences of patients and surgeons rather then outcome measures.

Implications for research: large, high-quality studies are needed, which examine not only effectiveness but cost-effectiveness as well.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112AATZJ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Eight trials reported at least one safety outcome for discectomy. Low certainty evidence showed no between group differences in the risk of any adverse events between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98); supplemental file 19a). Compared with epidural steroid injections, discectomy had a slightly higher risk of any adverse event (1.76 (1.03 to 3.02); supplemental file 19b). Surgery related complications were reported by seven trials. Dural tears and wound complications were the most frequently reported adverse events (supplemental file 9). All cause mortality was rare and similar between discectomy and non-surgical groups (1.73 (0.19 to 15.36); supplemental files 9). No trials reported any surgery related deaths.

The risks of adverse events in plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis were also similar between the surgical and non-surgical groups. The results could not be pooled because of the low number of studies (supplemental file 9).

Subgroup and meta-regression analyses

Detailed results for the subgroup and exploratory sensitivity analysis are presented in supplemental file 10. Discectomy had smaller effects on leg pain (mean difference −3.1 (95% confidence interval −5.7 to −0.4)) in trials that included analgesics in the comparators than did trials without analgesics (−21.4 (−30.3 to −12.4)) at the medium term. In small studies, discectomy had greater effects on disability (−10.1 (−13.9 to −6.3)) compared with larger studies (−4.4 (−7.7 to −1.0)). A post-hoc analysis indicated that in trials that did not specify unsuccessful non-surgical treatment as a prerequisite of entering the trial, discectomy had larger effects in reducing leg pain at immediate term (−19.3 (−30.4 to −8.2) v −1.2 (−5.5 to 3.1)) and improving disability at short term (−10.6 (−14.0 to −7.3) v −1.3 (−9.8 to 7.3)) than did trials that only included participants who had unsuccessful non-surgical treatment. Mean symptom duration at baseline (less or greater than three months), and the approach of discectomy (micro or open), did not influence treatment outcomes.

### What are long-term predictors of outcomes for lumbar disc herniation? A randomized and observational study [^117H3Gip]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation, there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes.

Questions/Purposes

We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at 8 years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial. We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at 13 different clinical sites. Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site. Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort. Of those in the randomized cohort, 309 of 501 (62%) provided 8-year data and in the observational group 469 of 743 (63%). Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care. By 8 years, only 148 of 245 (60%) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 122 of 256 (48%) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery. The primary outcome measures were SF-36 bodily pain, SF-36 physical function, and Oswestry Disability Index collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. Further analysis studied the following factors to determine if any were predictive of long-term outcomes: sex, herniation location, depression, smoking, work status, other joint problems, herniation level, herniation type, and duration of symptoms.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort at 8 years showed no difference between surgical and nonoperative treatment for the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures of sciatica bothersomeness, leg pain, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement showed greater improvement in the group randomized to surgery despite high levels of crossover. The as-treated analysis of the combined randomized and observational cohorts, adjusted for potential confounders, showed advantages for surgery for all primary outcome measures; however, this has the potential for confounding from other unrecognized variables. Smokers and patients with depression or comorbid joint problems had worse functional outcomes overall (with surgery and nonoperative care) but similar surgical treatment effects. Patients with sequestered fragments, symptom duration greater than 6 months, those with higher levels of low back pain, or who were neither working nor disabled at baseline showed greater surgical treatment effects.

Conclusions

The intent-to-treat analysis, which is complicated by high rates of crossover, showed no difference over 8 years for primary outcomes of overall pain, physical function, and back-related disability but did show small advantages for secondary outcomes of sciatica bothersomeness, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement. Subgroup analyses identified those groups with sequestered fragments on MRI, higher levels of baseline back pain accompanying radiculopathy, a longer duration of symptoms, and those who were neither working nor disabled at baseline with a greater relative advantage from surgery at 8 years.

### Retro-trochanteric sciatica-like pain: current concept [^11765Qbc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis

Lumbar spinal stenosis is defined as a narrowing of the spinal canal. In some patients, this condition becomes symptomatic. The classic presentation is that of bilateral neurogenic claudication, defined as intermittent pain radiating at varying degrees to the buttocks, thigh and leg, which gets worse with prolonged standing, walking or lumbar extension.

However, many individuals remain asymptomatic and radiographic findings do not necessarily correlate with clinical symptoms. Lumbar spinal stenosis occurs with normal vertebral alignment, while some patients also suffer from concomitant degenerative 'spondylolisthesis', which is defined as the forward slipping of one lumbar vertebra in relation to another with an intact neural arch. In most cases, 'spondylolisthesis' affects the L4–L5 level. It commonly occurs in patients over the age of 50 and affects females six times more frequently than males. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is generally asymptomatic, but it can be associated with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and radiculopathy.

Treatment options are either non-surgical methods or surgical intervention, depending on the severity of the stenosis and the number of levels involved. Surgical fusion and laminectomy are the methods most commonly used to treat spinal stenosis.

The management of degenerative lumbar disease is demanding. Non-surgical treatment consisting of oral pain medication, epidural corticosteroid injections, traction and spinal manipulation has been described with varying results. Surgery may be necessary when the patient has symptoms due to either instability or neurological compression.

Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a leading cause of chronic disability. OA characterised by joint pain, tenderness, limitation of movement and a varying degree of inflammation is most common in the hip, knee and hand joints.

Synovitis is an intrinsic component of OA, which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses. It may not be apparent clinically, but it can be detected by arthroscopy, MRI and ultrasound. Synovitis may contribute to the progression of cartilage degradation.

The conservative treatment for hip and knee OA includes physiotherapy with an exercise and muscle strengthening programme, cryotherapy and orthotic management, such as footwear or bracing. Furthermore, pharmacotherapy with NSAIDs and analgesics is extensively used in clinical settings, as are intra-articular injections with corticosteroids.

However, the treatment of choice for advanced hip and knee OA in elderly patients is still arthroplasty.

Contralateral knee OA, as well as ipsilateral knee and hip OA, has been shown to be associated with GTPS.

### Systematic review of percutaneous adhesiolysis and management of chronic low back pain in post lumbar surgery syndrome [^115wuPZY]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Post lumbar surgery syndrome or failed back surgery syndrome with persistent pain continues to increase over the years. The speculated causes of post lumbar laminectomy syndrome include acquired stenosis, epidural fibrosis, arachnoiditis, radiculopathy, and recurrent disc herniation. Epidural fibrosis may account for as much as 20% to 36% of all cases of failed back surgery syndrome. Percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis has been employed in interventional pain management in the treatment of chronic, refractory low back and lower extremity pain after back surgery.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized trials and observational studies.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing electronic databases, as well as systematic reviews and cross references from 1966 through December 2008. The quality of individual articles used in this analysis was assessed by modified Cochrane review criteria for randomized trials and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria for assessment of observational studies. Clinical relevance was evaluated using 5 questions according to the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Review Back Group. Analysis was conducted using 5 levels of evidence, ranging from Level I to III, with 3 subcategories in Level II.

Outcome Parameters

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief of at least 6 months and long-term relief of more than 6 months). Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and change in opioid intake.

Results

Of the 13 studies considered for inclusion, 3 randomized trials and 4 observational studies met the inclusion criteria for methodologic quality assessment and evidence synthesis based on methodologic quality scores of 50 or more. Evidence of percutaneous adhesiolysis in the management of chronic low back pain in post-lumbar surgery syndrome is Level I to Level II-1, with evidence derived from 3 randomized trials.

Limitations

There is a paucity of efficacy and pragmatic trials. No trials have been published after 2006.

Conclusion

The indicated level of evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis is Level I or II-1 based on the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria.

Leg pain VAS scores at week 18 improved by 58.3 points in the surgery group, compared with 43.6 points in the TFESI group (appendix pp 10–11). The adjusted estimate for the average effect of surgery versus TFESI over all timepoints was −7.04 (−15.81 to 1.73; p = 0.11). For the joint modelling post-hoc analysis of VAS leg pain scores, the adjusted effect estimate of surgery versus TFESI was −7.06 (−15.82 to 0.86; p = 0.098; appendix p 37).

Back pain VAS scores at week 18 improved by 26.0 points in the surgery group, compared with 23.4 points in the TFESI group (appendix pp 10–11). The adjusted effect estimate of surgery versus TFESI was −3.01 (−11.29 to 5.26; p = 0.47). For the joint modelling post-hoc analysis of VAS back pain scores, the adjusted effect estimate of surgery versus TFESI was −2.87 (−10.58 to 3.16; p = 0.46; appendix p 37).

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^112bomnw]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Management of sciatica that is caused by a herniated disc varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care, but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints persist for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. However, consensus is lacking as to whether surgery is useful or not in the absence of serious neurologic deficits. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients with sciatica and presence of a herniated lumbar disc. In most Western countries, especially in the United States, rates of spine surgery are high. The primary rationale of any form of surgery for sciatica due to herniated disc is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression, but the results should be balanced against the likely natural history and the results of conservative care. A recent systematic review indicated that surgery resulted in faster recovery when compared with conservative care, but for the longer term (12 months) no differences were found. The usual indication for surgery is to provide more rapid relief of pain and disability in the minority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow.

The most common type of surgery is microscopic discectomy, which is defined as surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Most studies refer to Caspar, Yasargil, and Williams when discectomy is performed with a microscope; and to Foley and Smith or Greiner-Perth et al. when discectomy is performed with tubular, muscle splitting, retractor systems, and endoscope. However, some have returned to using a microscope, while retaining the less invasive muscle splitting approach of Foley and Smith. There is also uncertainty regarding the relative benefits and harms of different surgical techniques, as was concluded in the 2007 Gibson and Waddell Cochrane review on lumbar disc herniation. This review needs to be updated as several new randomized trials have come to our attention comparing surgical techniques. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of the various surgical techniques for discectomy, such as open, microscopic or tubular discectomy.

### SPORT lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and back pain: does treatment, location, or morphology matter? [^115z7VVE]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Diskectomy candidates with at least 6 weeks of sciatica and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized or observational cohort.

Objective

This study sought to determine: (1) whether diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and (2) whether herniation location and morphology affected back pain outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies have reported that lumbar diskectomy is less successful for relief of back pain than leg pain and patients with central disc herniations or protrusions have worse outcomes.

Methods

Patients underwent diskectomy or received "usual" nonoperative care. Data from the randomized cohort and observational cohort were combined in an as-treated analysis. Low back pain was recorded on a 0 to 6 point scale, and changes in low back pain were compared between the surgical and nonoperative treatment groups. The effects of herniation location and morphology on back pain outcomes were determined.

Results

The combined analysis included 1191 patients with 775 undergoing surgery within 2 years, whereas 416 remained nonoperative. Overall, leg pain improved more than back pain in both treatment groups. Back pain improved in both surgical and nonoperative patients, but surgical patients improved significantly more (treatment effect favoring surgery -0.9 at 3 months, -0.5 at 2 years, P < 0.001). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to report no back pain than nonoperative patients at each follow-up period (28.0% vs. 12.0% at 3 months, P < 0.001, 25.5% vs. 17.6% at 2 years, P = 0.009). At baseline, central herniations were associated with more severe back pain than more lateral herniations (4.3 vs. 3.9, P = 0.012). Patients with central herniations and protrusionshad a beneficial treatment effect from surgery similar to the overall surgical group.

Conclusion

Diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and this difference was maintained at 2 years for all herniation locations and morphologies.

### The appropriate management of persisting pain after spine surgery: a European panel study with recommendations based on the RAND / UCLA method [^111esw2C]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Management of patients with persisting pain after spine surgery (PPSS) shows significant variability, and there is limited evidence from clinical studies to support treatment choice in daily practice. This study aimed to develop patient-specific recommendations on the management of PPSS.

Methods

Using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RUAM), an international panel of 6 neurosurgeons, 6 pain specialists, and 6 orthopaedic surgeons assessed the appropriateness of 4 treatment options (conservative, minimally invasive, neurostimulation, and re-operation) for 210 clinical scenarios. These scenarios were unique combinations of patient characteristics considered relevant to treatment choice. Appropriateness had to be expressed on a 9-point scale (1 = extremely inappropriate, 9 = extremely appropriate). A treatment was considered appropriate if the median score was ≥ 7 in the absence of disagreement (≥ 1/3 of ratings in each of the opposite sections 1–3 and 7–9).

Results

Appropriateness outcomes showed clear and specific patterns. In 48% of the scenarios, exclusively one of the 4 treatments was appropriate. Conservative treatment was usually considered appropriate for patients without clear anatomic abnormalities and for those with new pain differing from the original symptoms. Neurostimulation was considered appropriate in the case of (predominant) neuropathic leg pain in the absence of conditions that may require surgical intervention. Re-operation could be considered for patients with recurrent disc, spinal/foraminal stenosis, or spinal instability.

Conclusions

Using the RUAM, an international multidisciplinary panel established criteria for appropriate treatment choice in patients with PPSS. These may be helpful to educate physicians and to improve consistency and quality of care. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### SCIATICA… [^112hVqox]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The term "sciatica" commonly refers to a pain which extends from the sacroiliac region into the posterior or posterolateral part of the thigh and calf or lateral portion of the leg. The pain may continue as far as the heel or even into the lateral border of the foot. This pain is almost always caused by the presence of a pathological process affecting the sciatic nerve, the lumbosacral plexus or the fourth lumbar, fifth lumbar or first sacral nerve roots. Pain that extends only from the lumbosacral junction to the inferior margin of the gluteal fold or to the midportion of the posterior part of the thigh should not be classed as sciatica and may be due to pathological processes which do not affect the sciatic nerve or any of the fibers which form it. The diagnosis of the cause of sciatica depends on evaluation of a composite examination that Millikan CH. SCIATICA: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. JAMA. 1951; 145: 1–4.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115xwyUk]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction

Two authors extracted data independently and were reviewed by a third author. We extracted data according to the hierarchy of between group differences (ie, mean difference) and 95% confidence intervals, post-treatment means and standard deviations, and then pretreatment to post-treatment within group change scores. When standard deviations were not reported, the Cochrane's RevMan calculator was used to estimate standard deviations. When it was not possible to estimate standard deviations, we borrowed them from a similar study included in the review. When data were not available in the published manuscript, we sought to extract data from the trial registry, if available.

We classified follow-up times into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months). In studies with multiple time points, we extracted data from the time point closest to six weeks and to months three, six, and 12. Outcomes longer than 12 months were also extracted.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity (eg, Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Visual Analogue Scale) and disability (eg, Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were back pain intensity, health related quality of life (eg, short form-36), adverse events (any adverse event and serious adverse events as defined by each study), and satisfaction with treatment (eg, Likert Scale).

### Systematic review of prognostic factors for work participation in patients with sciatica [^116KrCzA]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbosacral radicular syndrome, often called sciatica, is commonly caused by a herniated lumbar disc. The syndrome is characterised by lower limb pain radiating below the knee in an area of the leg served by one or more lumbosacral nerve roots. There may be other neurological findings such as sensory and motor deficits. Sciatica is usually self-limiting with pain and disability decreasing over time, but not all patients fully recover. Surgical treatment is usually offered in more severe cases when severe radiating leg pain persists after a period of conservative management. In a large study (n = 782), 34% of conservatively treated patients experienced very or extremely bothersome symptoms at 6 months follow-up. Similarly, a systematic review (n = 13 883) showed that surgically treated patients reported, despite decreased pain and disability scores 3 months after surgery, on average mild to moderate pain and disability 5 years after surgery.

The direct and indirect costs of patients suffering from sciatica are high, and an important cost driver is work absenteeism. In the acute phase, most people with sciatica will stop working and some will resume work in the short time. Return to work (RTW) rates vary from 66% after 2 yearsto between 67% and 85% after 10 years. The high socioeconomic impact of sciatica and its impact on the ability to work in patients raise the need to identify factors that predict reduced RTW. Prognostic evidence could assist clinicians to better define high risk groups and inform both clinicians and patients with regard to counselling and treatment choices to promote RTW. The objective of this study was to review and summarise prognostic factors of work participation in patients with sciatica.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes of lumbar radiculopathy [^113DavSM]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lumbar disk herniation is a significant cause of lumbar radiculopathy and results in billions of dollars in health care expenditure. Herniated lumbar disks cause mechanical and chemical irritation of the nerve roots leading to complaints of sciatica. Surgeons have several surgical options when approaching herniated disks, including various microsurgical procedures. The 3 most prominent studies to date on surgical and nonsurgical management of herniated disks agree on the efficacy of surgery over medical management in the short term but have some discrepancies when looking at long-term results. Cauda equina syndrome is a variation of lumbar disk herniation in which patients experience a combination of saddle anesthesia, abnormal lower extremity reflexes, and neurogenic bowel or bladder symptoms.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114ogTWp]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

NERVES is a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, with an internal pilot phase, comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. Participants were recruited from and followed up at 11 spinal tertiary units (outpatient neurosurgical, pain, and orthopaedic clinics; appendix pp 2–3) across the UK. The initial plan was to limit duration of symptoms at screening to 6 months. However, this criterion had a negative impact on recruitment because few patients were receiving specialist treatment within the NHS by this time, so the protocol was extended to 1 year of symptoms. The main aim of treatment was to relieve sciatica symptoms in patients as quickly and safely as possible.

An independent trial steering committee viewed reports with treatment assignment concealed, and an independent data monitoring committee viewed unmasked reports regularly to assess conduct and progress, including safety.

The trial was granted(reference 21322/004/001) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The trial protocol was also approved by a research ethics committee (National Research Ethics Service Committee North West–Liverpool Central; reference 14/NW/1219) and has been published.

Participants

All participants required an MRI diagnosis of nerve compression secondary to herniated lumbar disc and had leg pain that was non-responsive to at least one attempt of conservative, non-invasive management. A screening log was maintained at each trial centre, with information on eligibility, consent, and randomisation. Eligible participants were aged 16–65 years, had clinical evaluation of leg pain by a consultant spinal surgeon that was deemed concordant with nerve compression seen on MRI, and had a duration of symptoms between 6 weeks and 12 months. Patients with emergency cases of significant ankle weakness or threatened cauda equina syndrome were excluded, as were those with far lateral disc prolapses. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is in the appendix (p 2). Eligible participants provided written informed consent before participating in the trial.

### Management of symptomatic lumbar disk herniation: an international perspective [^115E7GWi]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

The diversity among the current international practice patterns and the discrepancy between the eminence-based medicine and the evidence-based medicine in the treatment of lumbar disk herniation is presented. Minimally invasive techniques were expected to give the lowest postoperative low back pain, however, also to give the highest risk of recurrent disk herniation.

Study Design

A questionnaire survey.

Objective

To evaluate the current practice patterns of surgeons regarding both the surgical and nonsurgical management of lumbar disk herniation (LDH) worldwide and to compare this with the current literature.

Summary Of Background Data

Sciatica is a common diagnosis in the general population. Sciatica is most frequently caused by LDH. Multiple surgical techniques and treatment modalities are available to treat LDH, albeit some with small effect sizes or without compelling evidence.

Methods

A survey including questions on the application of physical examination, expectations regarding different surgical and nonsurgical techniques, factors influencing the outcome of surgery were distributed among members of AOSpine International and the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies.

Results

Eight hundred and seventeen surgeons from 89 countries completed the questionnaire. These surgeons perform a total of 62.477 discectomies yearly. Pain medication and steroid injections were expected to be the most effective nonsurgical treatments. The severity of pain and/ or disability and failure of conservative therapy were the most important indications for surgery. A period of 1 to 2 months of radiculopathy was regarded as a minimum for indicating surgery. Unilateral transflaval discectomy was the procedure of choice among the majority and was expected to be the most effective technique with the lowest complication risk. Surgeons performing more lumbar discectomies, with more clinical experience and those located in Asia, were more likely to offer minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Conclusion

This study shows that current international practice patterns for LDH surgery are diverse. There seems to be a discrepancy between preferred surgical techniques and the attitudes of surgeons worldwide and the evidence. Further research should focus on developing international guidelines to reduce practice variety and offer patients the optimal treatment for LDH.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^112GDcim]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

There is considerable uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of epidurals in sciatica compared with surgery for treatment of herniated lumbar disc. However, transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), a newer and more precise treatment option, offered promise given that it can deliver the drug in a closer proximity to the site of pathology. We searched PubMed using the term "sciatica epidural steroid" immediately before the initial development of the NERVES protocol in 2013–14 and found that previous evidence supporting TFESI had come from cohort studies or single-centre studies, without clear specification of the non-surgical treatments provided. A meta-analysis from 2015 suggested that non-opioid analgesia, TFESI, and surgery were effective management options for sciatica secondary to uncomplicated herniated lumbar disc. However, the effectiveness of TFESI compared with surgery for herniated lumbar disc was uncertain, leading to wide variation in management guidelines for this common condition.

Added value of this study

NERVES is the first multicentre randomised trial directly comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI on a 1:1 allocation basis as initial invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. There was no significant difference between TFESI and surgery pathways in clinical outcome, and surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI. Complications of surgery were significant, offsetting any benefits of surgery as an early treatment, whereas only minor adverse events were seen with TFESI.

Implications of all the available evidence

NERVES provides high-quality evidence for a stepwise treatment framework of uncomplicated sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. TFESI would be less costly as an initial alternative to surgery for this condition, while achieving similar levels of improved outcomes.

Lumbar transforaminal epidural injections — Despite increased use, significant debate continues regarding effectiveness. A review in APS guidelines evaluated 3 higher quality, placebo-controlled trials of the transforaminal approach and concluded that for low back pain with sciatica the evidence was mixed, with 2 of 3 higher quality trials showing no benefit compared to controlled injections. A critical evaluation concluded the evidence appears to be fair in managing lumbar nerve root pain with transforaminal epidural injections. Limited evidence was shown for lumbar radicular pain in post surgery syndrome, and there were no studies in spinal stenosis meeting the inclusion criteria. Moderate evidence was reported in support of selective nerve root blocks for treating painful radicular syndromes.

### Tubular diskectomy vs conventional microdiskectomy for the treatment of lumbar disk herniation: 2-year results of a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113HZ98m]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Transmuscular tubular diskectomy has been introduced to increase the rate of recovery, although evidence is lacking.

Objective

To evaluate the 2-year results of tubular diskectomy compared with conventional microdiskectomy.

Methods

Three hundred twenty-eight patients with persistent leg pain caused by lumbar disk herniation were randomly assigned to undergo tubular diskectomy (167 patients) or conventional microdiskectomy (161 patients). Main outcome measures were scores from Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica, Visual Analog Scale for leg pain and low-back pain, and Likert self-rating scale of global perceived recovery.

Results

On the basis of intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference between tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica scores during 2 years after surgery (between-group mean difference = 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.3–1.6). Patients treated with tubular diskectomy reported more leg pain (Δ = 3.3 mm; 95% CI, 0.2–6.2) and more low-back pain (Δ = 3.0 mm; 95% CI, -0.2–6.3) than those patients treated with conventional microdiskectomy. At 2 years, 71% of patients assigned to tubular diskectomy documented a good recovery vs 77% of patients assigned to conventional microdiskectomy (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45–1.28; P = 0.35). Repeated surgery rates within 2 years after tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy were 15% and 10%, respectively (P = 0.22).

Conclusion

Tubular diskectomy and conventional microdiskectomy resulted in similar functional and clinical outcomes. Patients treated with tubular diskectomy reported more leg pain and low-back pain, although the differences were small and not clinically relevant.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Tq2jn]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

If data were available for the same outcome measure from at least two trials, meta-analysis was performed using Revman v5.4. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to account for the variability of included studies. Heterogeneity was calculated with I² statistics and interpreted as follows: 'might not be important' (0–40%), 'moderate' (30–60%), 'substantial '(50–90%), and 'considerable' (75–100%). We performed separate overall meta-analyses comparing physiotherapy interventions with control interventions for our primary outcomes of pain and disability.

We planned to perform a subgroup analysis according to type of physiotherapy interventions. However, this was impossible as interventions were too heterogeneous to pool. We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis comparing the effect of physiotherapy interventions according to the type of control intervention (minimal vs. substantial). Minimal intervention included advice/education only, GP care, or sham treatment. Substantial intervention included surgery, disc and epidural injections. Due to high risk of bias, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis, removing those studies where at least two parameters of risk of bias were rated as high. Results that could not be included in the meta-analysis were narratively described.

Evidence Review with Evidence Level Designation

A number of studies have been performed assessing discectomy procedures, as well as several reviews. Some studies have compared microendoscopic discectomy to open techniques. Others have compared microendoscopic techniques to percutaneous methods. Still, others have compared percutaneous techniques to open procedures, and tubular methods to open procedures, as well. A number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also been completed which compared the above techniques, some focusing on efficacy while others on complications. While many studies of these procedures are available, for the purposes of this guideline, we limited our use to the most recent data available in an effort to provide the most accurate and up-to-date recommendation.

In summary, percutaneous and endoscopic disc procedures have a favorable safety and efficacy profile in terms of lumbar disc herniation with persistent radicular symptoms. Further research is needed to examine complication rates in regard to dural tears and re-herniation and evaluating methods to further decrease these rates of incidence for these techniques to supplant MD as standard of care. For percutaneous and endoscopic disc procedures, there was sufficient evidence in the form of RCTs (Table 17) for the committee to make recommendations. Table 18 summarizes those recommendations.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis has many etiologies that can include hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, osteophytes, facet joint hypertrophy and degeneration of the disc space. Lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar degenerative disc disease are often seen in conjunction and are largely products of each other. Treatment options for those with spinal stenosis and degenerative changes include conservative measures such as physical therapy, medications, and epidural steroid injections. The most common surgical options can include open laminectomy or decompression with or without transpedicular screw fixation. There are several limitations to these spinal surgical procedures including extended recovery and chronic back pain associated with post-laminectomy syndrome. These surgeries have also been associated with a higher incidence of adverse events such as cerebrospinal fluid leak, nerve injury, deep wound infections, misplaced hardware, and hardware failures. Lastly, there is concern regarding adjacent segment disease from altered biomechanics. Many of these factors limit the use of these procedures in those patients of advanced age, those with medical comorbidities, and those with mild or moderate findings. Minimally invasive approaches with reduced procedural risks become a viable option for those patients.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^111MzDxD]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

63 (79%) of 80 patients randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 61 (73%) of 83 patients in the surgery group were included in the primary outcome analysis. Both groups showed similar improvements in ODQ scores from baseline to week 18 (table 2). A post-hoc classification showed that a similar proportion of participants in both groups achieved an improvement of 10 points or more on the ODQ. Only eight participants (13%) in the surgery group and six (10%) in the TFESI group showed deterioration in symptoms.

Table 2
Summary of ODQ scores at baseline and at week 18

ODQ scores did not differ between groups at week 18, with the model effect estimate of surgery versus TFESI being −4.25 (95% CI −11.09 to 2.59; p = 0.22). From this model, we estimate that surgery would result in an average improvement in ODQ score of 4.25 points more than would TFESI, which is less than the minimum clinically important difference of 10 points. Figure 2 presents the distribution of ODQ score improvements at the primary outcome timepoint of 18 weeks after randomisation.

Figure 2
Distribution of differences in ODQ scores between baseline and week 18

Fitted lines are kernel density estimates; histogram show percentage of patients in nine bins. TFESI = transforaminal epidural steroid injection. ODQ = Oswestry Disability Questionnaire.

Of the 61 patients randomly assigned to the surgery group and who were included in the primary analysis, two (3%) also received TFESI before completing the questionnaire at week 18. In the TFESI group, 13 (21%) of 63 participants with valid primary outcome data received surgery after receiving TFESI.

The second model, adjusting for additional covariates, gave an effect estimate of surgery versus TFESI of −5.03 (−12.76 to 2.70). An additional variable, level of disc prolapse, was included in a post-hoc analysis. This model resulted in an estimate of −4.94 (−12.81 to 2.93).

### Lumbar disc herniation: diagnosis and management [^114m2weD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common causes of lower back pain, neurological dysfunction, and buttock/leg pain. Herniation refers to the displacement of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the annulus fibrosus, thereby causing pressure on the neural elements. The sequalae of lumbar disc herniations range in severity from mild low back and buttock pain to severe cases of inability to ambulate and cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved with a thorough history and physical examination along with advanced imaging. Treatment plans are dictated by corresponding patient symptoms and examination findings with their imaging. Most patients can experience relief with nonsurgical measures. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, surgery may be appropriate.

Lumbar disc herniation — Albeck et al prospective case series found that in 80 surgically–confirmed cases, using clinical parameters the level of the disc herniation was predicted accurately in 93%, but only sciatica was predictive of disc herniation; the study provides Level III diagnostic evidence that monoradicular sciatica is predictive of a disc herniation affecting the fourth lumbar or first sacral root.

Surgical management — open discectomy and decompression, with or without fusion, are the most common surgical interventions performed for disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and post surgery syndrome; absolute indications for surgery, even though rare, include altered bladder function and progressive muscle weakness, and the usual indication for surgery is to provide the rapid relief of pain and to address the possibility of impending disability in the majority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^114VdnHR]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

A single-centre randomised trial of 128 patients compared surgery with conservative care (including steroid injections) for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc and found that surgery provided better clinical improvement in leg pain scores by 24 points. Although this study reported a surgical benefit, there was a clear difference in safety profiles between treatments, with nine adverse events (including one nerve root injury) in patients receiving surgery and none in patients managed conservatively. Furthermore, a single-institution study might not be generalisable across wider health-care providers. Although treatment for radiculopathy with TFESI offers theoretical cost advantages and reduced risk compared with surgery, robust class I clinical data supporting its efficacy are scarce, and there is no worldwide consensus on the use of TFESI. We are aware of only one other trial comparing the direct effect of surgery with that of epidural steroid injections in 100 patients with sciatica secondary to lumbar disc herniation. However, this trial was also a single-centre study and the route of administration was via a posterior interlaminar (lumbar puncture) injection, as opposed to TFESI. The trial showed that steroid injections avoided the need for surgery in 23 (46%) of 50 patients. In view of conflicting clinical evidence, we aimed to complete the first multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical effectiveness of TFESI with that of surgical microdiscectomy for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc in patients with non-emergency presentation of sciatica with symptom duration of up to 12 months. We also aimed to assess cost-effectiveness and quality of life outcomes of both treatments.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^113W64En]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Lumbar post-surgery syndrome — definition, etiologies, incidence, and interventional management: Failed back surgery syndrome is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as persistent or recurrent pain mainly in the lower back or legs after previously anatomically successful surgeries, with frequent or recurrent leg pain reported in 5% to 36% of patients 2 years after the operation and other literature showing occurrence rates from 10% to 40%. Patients with extensive epidural fibrosis were 3.2 times more likely to experience recurrent radicular pain than those with less scarring, and described abnormalities include mechanical tethering of nerve roots, disturbances in blood flow, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines with irritation of the dorsal root ganglion. Consequently, in post-lumbar surgery syndrome, a multitude of pathophysiologic bases have been described including recurrent disc herniation, scarring and entrapment of the nerve roots and discogenic pain. These can be addressed with epidural interventions, either with epidural injections or percutaneous adhesiolysis, and multiple RCTs and systematic reviews have been performed with caudal epidural injections as well as percutaneous adhesiolysis in post-lumbar surgery syndrome.

### Sequence variant at 8q24.21 associates with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation [^1118t5KS]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

When selecting cases for microdiscectomy, neurosurgeons have established that the herniated disc material is likely to cause the associated sciatica symptoms. Indeed in most cases, rapid symptom relief follows microdiscectomy, but in up to 20% of cases symptoms persist after surgery. Besides the symptoms caused by mechanical compression on nerve roots by the herniated lumbar disc, inflammatory and immunological consequences are also considered a factor in sciatica symptom severity and duration. Of interest in this context is that GSDMC, downstream of rs6651255, is highly expressed in the spleenwhich plays a significant role in adaptive immune responses. While the role of the immune system in regression of herniated discs and/or development of sciatica is not clear, the immune system is known to become activated by the otherwise immune-privileged nucleus pulposus as it herniates from its protected environment into the immune-regulated epidural space. The subsequent migration of immune cells into the herniated disc tissues and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines is accompanied by the ingrowth of nociceptive nerve fibres into the disc, a process thought to contribute to the pathogenic development of the associated painful symptoms.

The surgically defined phenotype used in this study was selected to represent a severe, symptomatic form of LDD, that is, herniated lumbar disc with sciatica indicating LDHsurg. In light of the clear clinical criteria associated with this type of surgery and the findings presented here, we speculate that the observed effect of rs6651255 on risk of undergoing LDHsurg is mainly driven by the severity of symptoms, that is, susceptibility to developing persistent and painful sciatica in the presence of the mechanical and biochemical nerve root insult created by a herniated lumbar disc. While our findings await replication in a comparable sample, we have provided compelling evidence for this variant having a significant role in the development of sciatica resulting from a herniated lumbar disc. The observed association in the Icelandic population is highly significant and we were able to exclude that the effect on sciatica is solely through the variant's effect on height. However, it is clear that further studies are required to complete this complicated but intriguing picture.

### [ISRCTN 16558617] A randomized, controlled trial of spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis in chronic refractory low back and lower extremity pain [^113TrrjL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

A moderate proportion of patients show improvement in pain and functional level with interventional pain management procedures, including fluoroscopically-directed epidural steroid injections and percutaneous adhesiolysis utilizing a special catheter. In addition, initial clinical studies of spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis and a preliminary report of a randomized controlled trial showed improved clinical outcomes. However, a recent prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing caudal epidural with targeted steroid placement on affected nerve roots during spinal endoscopy for chronic sciatica, concluded that targeted placement of steroid did not significantly reduce pain intensity and anxiety and depression compared with caudal epidural steroid injection.

Most studies utilized post lumbar laminectomy syndrome or epidural fibrosis as inclusion criteria, whereas one study included patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, and another exclusively studied patients without history of surgery. In addition, some studies specifically described inclusion criteria as patients without long-term improvement following fluoroscopically directed epidural steroid injections and one-day percutaneous adhesiolysis. Consequently, these studies represent heterogenous populations. Even though retrospective evaluations have shown the effectiveness of spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis in patients after lack of long-term effect following fluoroscopically-directed caudal epidural steroid injections and one-day percutaneous adhesiolysis, the effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled trials.

Spinal endoscopy also has been utilized for diagnostic purposes. Even though multiple authors have described various types of findings, including the identification of inflammation with an endoscope, neither the reliability nor the clinical utility of spinal endoscope as a diagnostic tool has been established. Consequently, no attempt was made to evaluate the diagnostic utility of spinal endoscopy.

This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis and targeted delivery of steroids was designed to evaluate their effectiveness in patients with chronic low back and lower extremity pain who lacked significant response to fluoroscopically-directed epidural steroid injections and one-day percutaneous adhesiolysis with hypertonic saline neurolysis, as well as to other conservative modalities of treatment.

The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy (surgery) with an online randomisation system. A designated member of the site team, usually a clinician or nurse involved in the participant's care, did the online randomisation. Randomisation was stratified by centre and used permuted blocks of random variable length (block sizes two and four). The randomisation sequence was generated by an independent statistician, and allocations were concealed from investigators and participants before recruitment. It was not possible to mask investigators and participants due to the treatments received.

Procedures

Surgery for posterolateral herniated lumbar disc was done following a standard open surgical microdiscectomy technique with an operative microscope, delivered by a consultant spinal surgeon. Specialists identified the correct side and level before treatment with level localisation using an image intensifier. The nature of disc prolapse (eg, contained, extruded, or sequestrated) was recorded by the operating surgeon, along with spinal level.

TFESI was completed by pain specialists, radiologists, or spinal surgeons as per local policy or technique with the lateral foraminal portal of entry. All fluoroscopically guided techniques were permitted to specify the correct level. Radiological level and appropriate spread of contrast were confirmed by the operator. To minimise variability across participating centres, the recommended injection regimen was 20–60 mg triamcinolone acetonide and 2 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine. A second injection of the same dose was permitted if the injection was considered partially effective.

For both groups, treatment was recommended within 6 weeks of randomisation. Participants were allowed to crossover and subsequently receive the non-allocated treatment if primary treatment was considered ineffective. Participants were followed up for 54–62 weeks. Questionnaires were collected at 18, 30, 42, and 54 weeks, each within a window of 2 weeks. All questionnaires were completed at hospital visits, except for those at 30 and 42 weeks, which were delivered by post. The types of data and collection methods are detailed in the study protocol.

An assessment of related adverse events was done at each study clinic visit at 18 weeks and 54 weeks after treatment. All related serious adverse events were reported within 24 h of site awareness of event. Related adverse events and serious adverse events were reported throughout the trial follow-up period.

### Pain management after laminectomy: a systematic review and procedure-specific post-operative pain management (prospect) recommendations [^117DAj2n]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

With lumbar laminectomy increasingly being performed on an outpatient basis, optimal pain management is critical to avoid post-operative delay in discharge and readmission. The aim of this review was to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after one- or two-level lumbar laminectomy.

Methods

A systematic review utilizing the PROcedure-SPECific Post-operative Pain ManagemenT (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in the English language from 1 January 2008 until 31 March 2020-assessing post-operative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions-were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases.

Results

Out of 65 eligible studies identified, 39 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The analgesic regimen for lumbar laminectomy should include paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor administered preoperatively or intraoperatively and continued post-operatively, with post-operative opioids for rescue analgesia. In addition, surgical wound instillation or infiltration with local anaesthetics prior to wound closure is recommended. Some interventions-gabapentinoids and intrathecal opioid administration-although effective, carry significant risks and consequently were omitted from the recommendations. Other interventions were also not recommended because there was insufficient, inconsistent or lack of evidence.

Conclusion

Perioperative pain management for lumbar laminectomy should include paracetamol and NSAID- or COX-2-specific inhibitor, continued into the post-operative period, as well as intraoperative surgical wound instillation or infiltration. Opioids should be used as rescue medication post-operatively. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of our recommendations.

### Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis: evaluation and management [^112AgmNy]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is caused by mechanical factors and/or biochemical alterations within the intervertebral disk that lead to disk space collapse, facet joint hypertrophy, soft-tissue infolding, and osteophyte formation, which narrows the space available for the thecal sac and exiting nerve roots. The clinical consequence of this compression is neurogenic claudication and varying degrees of leg and back pain. Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is a major cause of pain and impaired quality of life in the elderly. The natural history of this condition varies; however, it has not been shown to worsen progressively. Nonsurgical management consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and epidural steroid injections. If nonsurgical management is unsuccessful and neurologic decline persists or progresses, surgical treatment, most commonly laminectomy, is indicated. Recent prospective randomized studies have demonstrated that surgery is superior to nonsurgical management in terms of controlling pain and improving function in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YRTwY]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

Two reviewers (LD, LK) independently used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess study quality and risk of bias. The tool was piloted on three excluded studies to test agreement of decision-making. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer where required (GJ).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (LD, LK) independently extracted data using a standardised form; consensus was used to resolve any discrepancies. The following information was extracted: author, year, country, characteristics of participants (e.g. age, duration, severity of symptoms), diagnostic criteria, physiotherapy and control intervention (type, frequency and duration). Outcomes were extracted at baseline and follow-up time points. Primary outcomes of interest were pain (e.g. numerical pain rating scale) and disability (e.g. Oswestry disability index). Secondary outcomes were global perceived effect, quality of life, change in neurological function, psychological parameters, adverse events, and dropout rates. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted for each outcome. If alternative summary statistics were provided, we transformed the data using recommended calculations. If available, outcomes were extracted for different time points, and grouped according to time after randomisation as: short term (< 3 months); medium-term (> 3 months but < 12 months) or long-term (≥ 12 months). If multiple terms were reported within one period, the outcome closest to 7 weeks, 6 months and 12 months was used. When more than one body part was used to assess pain (e.g. leg and back pain), the highest score at baseline was used to reflect patients' dominant symptoms. When more than one outcome measure was used within a trial for a specific outcome of interest, the outcome measure described by the trial authors as their primary measure was used.

Literature Review

An analysis of five RCTs (643 participants) comparing surgical to nonsurgical care concluded that the evidence could not support that surgery was superior to nonoperative care. However, this study included a mix of both open decompression surgeries as well as indirect decompression surgery with spinous process spacers. In a randomized trial of lumbar laminectomy with or without fusion compared to nonsurgical management for LSS with degenerative spondylolisthesis, Weinstein et al showed that surgically treated patients had greater pain relief and functional improvement for 4 years. Athiviraham and Yen reported on a nonrandomized cohort of 125 consecutive patients with lumbar stenosis followed for 2 years. Most patients undergoing open decompression with or without fusion reported that they were better after surgery; however, residual symptoms were common. The majority of patients who declined surgery had persistent symptoms and 12.5% reported worsening of symptoms at 2 years. Most of the debate has focused on whether open decompression should be augmented with fusion. The remaining RCTs have compared open decompression alone to decompression with fusion to assess safety and efficacy.

Evidence Ranking

Consensus Point 10: The MIST recommends open decompression with or without fusion when the physician feels the risk:benefit ratio is favorable, and in the setting of a rapidly progressive neurological decline. Grade A; Level of certainty high; Level of evidence 1-A

### Managing chronic pain of spinal origin after lumbar surgery: the role of decompressive surgery [^116GEbA7]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A literature review was conducted.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based approach for patients with neurogenic symptoms after lumbar surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Patients may present with chronic pain of spinal origin after lumbar surgery. Failure to decompress the involved neural structures adequately or progression of the underlying degenerative condition may lead to neurologic symptoms.

Methods

A literature search of peer-reviewed publications that investigate etiologies and treatments for neurogenic pain in patients who have undergone previous spinal surgery was conducted.

Results

In the absence of profound or progressive neurologic deficits, most patients with chronic back and leg pain who have undergone previous spinal surgery should be treated nonoperatively. Additional decompressive surgical intervention may be justified in patients with well-defined, discrete pathology amenable to surgical correction who have been refractory to conservative care. The surgery typically will include meticulous decompression of the affected neural structures and may include arthrodesis to address any deformity or instability.

Conclusions

In a patient presenting with neurogenic symptoms after lumbar surgery, a meticulous workup is required to elucidate the source of these symptoms. Surgical indications are similar to those for primary lumbar spinal surgery and include a well-defined anatomic source of neural compression that is amenable to a surgical solution.

### The optimal patient profile and appropriate role of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for patients with persistent spinal pain syndrome-type 1 (PSPS-T1) not suitable for spine surgery: a European modified Delphi consensus [^1112vQK6]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, the treatment approach should include multimodal intensive conservative treatment, conventional medical management, and interventional pain therapy, where eligible, prior to considerations of further treatment (Figure 3).

Across Europe, there is a need to identify patients with refractory pain who may benefit from SCS. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommends SCS for patients who continue to experience chronic pain (measuring at least 50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale) for at least six months despite appropriate CMM. European consensus recommendations published in 2020 indicate that the inclusion criteria for SCS should include age ≥ 18 years; chronic low back/leg pain with a duration of at least six months and at least moderate severity impact on QoL; presence of complex regional, neuropathic, or ischemic pain syndromes; failure of previous CMM and/or minimally invasive treatments; and where there are no clear benefits from spine surgery.

The diverse composition of SCS patient cohorts has made patient subtype characterization more complicated. For example, some HCPs proposed radiofrequency ablation following CMM. However, the respondents in this study displayed mixed opinions, reflecting the heterogeneity of patient subgroups. Most studies on radiofrequency ablation focused on lumbar facet joints and sacroiliac joints. There is therefore a need to use both real-world and clinical evidence, including a European PSPS-T1 registry, to better identify patient subgroups suitable for SCS and refine pain management protocols.
3. Spine surgery should be performed if clear indications associated with anatomical targets are presented, including neural compression or instability, lumbar disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis, and the risk/benefit of surgery is considered favorable; otherwise, SCS can be a treatment of choice for patients who are ineligible for spine surgery (Figure 3).

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^1169ykHD]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Postoperative low back pain — education interventions: After laminectomy, an RCT (n = 86) found moderate to large benefits of a targeted cognitive behavioral therapy–based rehabilitation approach compared with a general postoperative education program for back and leg pain intensity, disability, and pain interference at 3 months after surgery, but not immediately posttreatment. In patients undergoing lumbar fusion, an RCT (n = 96) found no additional benefit of a preoperative cognitive behavioral intervention compared with standard preoperative education for pain or disability 1 year following surgery, although the reduction in disability was achieved much faster in the intervention group. Following first-time discectomy, an RCT (n = 129) found no additional benefit of a biopsychosocial evidence-based educational booklet compared with a biomedical-based booklet for pain intensity or disability outcomes 2 months after surgery.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^112qBJwr]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Previous economic evaluations were found not to be generalisable to this analysis due to differences in setting, perspective, and interventions tested. A comparison between lumbar epidural steroid injection and placebo reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £44 701 per QALY gained (provider perspective, which most closely reflects the NHS). By contrast, NERVES used the preferable transforaminal route because the injectate is much nearer to the site of pathology, the prolapsed disc, and involved nerve root.

The safety profiles of both treatments were different. Four patients in the surgery group required prolonged hospitalisation, revision surgery, or repair of meningocoele. One (1%) of the 105 patients who had surgery suffered a complete foot drop, despite a negative exploratory procedure within the first 24 h (no obvious cause for the nerve dysfunction could be identified). By contrast, no patients in the TFESI group suffered any serious adverse events.

For the first time, NERVES reports that use of TFESI as the initial invasive treatment is similarly effective to surgical microdiscectomy at reducing pain and disability from sciatica with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months. Given the safety of TFESI, along with the unlikely cost-effectiveness of surgery as a first invasive treatment, we recommend that treating physicians strongly consider the use of TFESI as a stepwise invasive treatment for sciatica without neurological deficit of up to 12 months' duration. Surgery is still likely to be required for a considerable number of patients for whom TFESI might not be as effective.

### Early multimodal rehabilitation following lumbar disc surgery: a randomised clinical trial comparing the effects of two exercise programmes on clinical outcome and lumbar multifidus muscle function [^113nL4Hs]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal components of postoperative exercise programmes following single-level lumbar discectomy have not been identified. Facilitating lumbar multifidus (LM) function after discectomy may improve postoperative recovery. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and muscle function outcomes of patients randomised to receive early multimodal rehabilitation following lumbar discectomy consisting of exercises targeting specific trunk muscles including the LM or general trunk exercises.

Methods

We included participants aged 18 to 60years who were scheduled to undergo single-level lumbar discectomy. After two postoperative weeks, participants were randomly assigned to receive an 8-week multimodal exercise programme including either general or specific trunk exercises. The primary outcome was pain-related disability (Oswestry Index). Secondary outcomes included low back and leg pain intensity (0–10 numeric pain rating scale), global change, sciatica frequency, sciatica bothersomeness and LM function measured with real-time ultrasound imaging. Treatment effects 10weeks and 6months after surgery were estimated with linear mixed models.

Results

61 participants were randomised to receive a general trunk (n = 32) or specific (n = 29) exercise programme. There were no between-group differences in clinical or muscle function outcomes. Participants in both groups experienced improvements in most outcome measures.

Conclusions

Following lumbar discectomy, multimodal rehabilitation programmes comprising specific or general trunk exercises have similar effects on clinical and muscle function outcomes. Local factors such as the individual patient characteristics identified by specific assessment findings, clinician expertise and patient preferences should direct therapy selection when considering the types of exercises tested in this trial for inclusion in rehabilitation programmes following lumbar disc surgery.

### Failed back surgery syndrome: current perspectives [^115bEacN]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Back pain is a highly prevalent condition that can have a tremendous social, financial, and psychological impact on a patient's life. Low back pain is a worldwide problem, with an estimated 9.4% global incidence, creating more disability than any other condition in the world. Prevalence of low back pain increases with age, so it is understandable that there is an increasing rate of surgeries to treat back pain in accordance with an aging population demographic. It is estimated that from 2000 to 2007, the total number of adults in the United States with chronic back pain increased by 64% (from 7.8 million to 12.8 million) with a mean age increasing from 48.5 to 52.2 years. Considering the significant increase in the prevalence of back pain over time, it is understandable that there are similar trends in increasing rates of surgeries to treat it. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual number of hospital discharges for primary lumbar fusions increased by 170.9% from 77,682 to 210,407. During the same period, the rate of laminectomies increased by 11.3% from 92,390 to 107,790 (Table 1). However, sometimes surgery fails to provide relief or provides only temporary relief of the patient's pain. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) as:

Lumbar spinal pain of unknown origin either persisting despite surgical intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal pain originally in the same topographical location.

Patients with FBSS have had chronic longstanding back pain, with or without referred or radicular symptoms and have had one or more surgical interventions that have failed to treat the pain. Unfortunately, this happens all too often, with conservative estimates at 20% but other estimates as high as 40%. A recent systematic literature review of discectomies for lumbar disc herniation in patients under the age of 70 years demonstrated a range of recurrent back or leg pain in 5%–36% of patients after 2 years. Another prospective study by Skolasky et alinvolving 260 patients who underwent a surgical laminectomy with or without fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative changes demonstrated that 29.2% of patients had either no change or increased pain after 12 months. Improved outcomes associated with FBSS will rely more on comprehensive knowledge of the physician in order to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat FBSS.

### Persistent spinal pain syndrome: new terminology for a new era [^114xkvwD]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain medicine and treatment of chronic pain have evolved, with many new treatment options developed just in the past decade. Leaders in pain medicine recognize that terminology needs to keep up with our understanding of disorders, their pathophysiologies, and their treatment. In the 1990s, the term "complex regional pain syndrome" (CRPS) emerged from the work of an expert group convened by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The goal was an improved term for the conditions previously labeled "reflex sympathetic dystrophy" and "causalgia" that was more general and not specific to a certain pathophysiology. This effort also delineated the subtypes of complex regional pain syndrome. Despite the expert recommendation, there were objections from several fronts to the terminology, and adoption of the term was slow. An analysis of publications from 2001 to 2012 identified that 79% used the new terminology, with a gradual increase over the time period.

The terms "post-laminectomy syndrome" and "failed back surgery syndrome" (FBSS) were coined in the 1970s and then gained traction in the 1980s amid a discussion in the literature of approaches to treat persistent pain after spinal surgery. However, the terms are ambiguous, addressing a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the commonality of chronic pain and the experience of prior surgery after which pain either recurs or persists.

In a 2015 analysis, Al-Kaisy et al noted that the term "failed back surgery syndrome" is pejorative and ought to be changed. Without doubt, the term is rife with ethical implications. Progressively, it is apparent that patients with nonspecific back and other types of chronic pain are stigmatized and marginalized. Compounding matters, it has been argued that this stigmatization and marginalization has likely been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The impact of stigmatization and marginalization of these unfortunate patients has been devastating, including the deterioration of pain sufferers' trust in health care professionals, quality of the pain care that patients receive, perceived injustice (which has recently been empirically related to greater pain severity and increased functional impairment), and exacerbated psychological distressincluding increased depression and anxiety.

### Disease applications of spinal cord stimulation: chronic nonmalignant pain [^11766jAb]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic back pain is one of the most common health problems and causes significant burden on individuals and society. Chronic back pain is generally felt at the lower back, between the lower rib and gluteal fold, for which no specific neural compression or insult can be designated. Persistent Spinal Pain Syndrome (PSPS), previously called FBSS, or post-laminectomy syndrome is a term used to define an unsatisfactory outcome of a patient who underwent spinal surgery, irrespective of type or intervention area, with persistent pain in the lumbosacral region with or without it radiating to the leg.

In 2007 Kumar et al. published the results of an international, multicenter, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes of traditional low-frequency 49 ​Hz (± 16.4) SCS plus conservative management versus conservative management alone in adults diagnosed with failed back surgery syndrome (PSPS) (PROCESS trial). Their primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 50 ​% or more pain relief in the legs, while secondary outcomes were improvement in back and leg pain, health-related quality of life, functional capacity, use of pain medication and non-drug pain treatment, level of patient satisfaction, and incidence of complications and adverse effects. Included patients were followed for 1 year after randomization to implantation (n ​ = ​52) or conservative management (n ​ = ​48) which included epidural injections, physical therapy and opioid analgesia. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 6 months, 24 patients in the SCS group (48 ​%) and 4 patients in the conservative group (9 ​%) (p ​ < ​0.001) achieved the primary outcome. The within–SCS group mean back VAS decreased from 54.5 (± 24.3) at baseline to 40.6 (± 24.9), and the between-group mean difference was −11.0 (99 ​% confidence interval [CI] ​ = ​−25 to 3.0), with a group mean Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) difference of −11.2 (99 ​% CI ​ = ​−21.2 to −1.3). By 12 months, n ​ = ​30 participants in the conservative group crossed over to the SCS treatment arm. The authors were able to perform a post-hoc analysis considering crossovers treatment failures according to their initial randomization order and showed that n ​ = ​17 patients in the SCS, but only n ​ = ​3 in the conservative group achieved the primary outcome (leg pain reduction).
