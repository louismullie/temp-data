## Question

Potassium of 2.7 in clinic, treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage a potassium level of 2.7 mmol/L in the outpatient clinic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity classification and immediate risk. Then, I should verify whether urgent IV therapy is indicated versus oral repletion. Next, I will review dosing, infusion parameters, and safety monitoring. After that, I need to check for concurrent electrolyte issues, especially magnesium, and correct them. Then, I should plan follow-up labs and monitoring cadence. Finally, I will consider etiologic workup and prevention of recurrence, including medication review and dietary counseling, and I will double-check special populations like CKD or heart failure where targets may differ.

> Let me first confirm the severity and risk profile. A potassium of 2.7 mmol/L is severe hypokalemia by standard definitions, and it carries increased risk of neuromuscular weakness and malignant ventricular arrhythmias, with observational data showing substantially higher event rates when potassium is ≤ 3.5 mmol/L compared with 4.1–4.9 mmol/L, particularly in cardiovascular populations, so I should not minimize this finding [^116XgbM2].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold for IV therapy. I initially thought the cutoff was 2.5 mmol/L, but hold on, I should verify the FDA labeling and guideline nuance. The FDA labeling for oral potassium chloride advises IV replacement when serum potassium is < 2.5 mEq/L, yet multiple authoritative sources treat 2.5–3.0 mmol/L as severe and recommend IV repletion when there are symptoms, ECG changes, or ongoing losses, so at 2.7 mmol/L with any concerning features, IV therapy is appropriate; if the patient is asymptomatic and reliable for close follow-up, high-dose oral therapy with expedited rechecking may be acceptable, but I need to ensure safety first [^112AewMC] [^112jCLAA] [^115h7Ejq] [^116c8DvS].

> I will now examine the need for an ECG. Even in the outpatient setting, severe hypokalemia warrants a 12-lead ECG to look for T-wave flattening, ST depression, U waves, or QT prolongation, because these changes heighten arrhythmic risk and would push me toward IV repletion with continuous cardiac monitoring rather than oral therapy alone [^111QJpsS] [^113NFDQ5].

> Next, I should review IV dosing and infusion parameters. For severe hypokalemia, typical practice is 10–20 mEq KCl diluted in 100–250 mL saline, infused at 10–20 mEq/hour via peripheral IV, with continuous ECG monitoring when rates exceed 10 mEq/hour. The FDA label supports up to 10 mEq/hour for potassium > 2.5 mEq/L, and some protocols allow higher rates in critical care with central access and telemetry, but I need to ensure institutional policy alignment and patient-specific risk before exceeding 10 mEq/hour [^116hrden] [^115Epgy2] [^114xZWQf].

> Hold on, I should verify magnesium status before and during potassium repletion. Hypomagnesemia impairs potassium reuptake and correction, and in patients at risk for torsades or with prolonged QT, magnesium repletion is prioritized. A reasonable approach is 1–2 g IV magnesium sulfate, often given as a bolus, while concurrently correcting potassium, with subsequent magnesium monitoring to guide further dosing [^114pPBqW] [^115Epgy2].

> Let me consider oral repletion only if the patient is asymptomatic, has a normal ECG, and is reliable for close follow-up. Standard adult oral dosing is 40–100 mEq/day in divided doses, not exceeding 40 mEq per dose, with total daily dose capped at 200 mEq; I should instruct to take with meals and dilute liquid formulations to reduce GI irritation and ensure adherence [^112AewMC] [^112jCLAA].

> I need to ensure a safe monitoring plan. If using IV therapy, check potassium every 2–4 hours initially, then space out as levels stabilize; if using oral therapy, recheck within 24–48 hours given the severity, and sooner if symptoms develop. I should also monitor for rebound hyperkalemia after aggressive repletion, especially if renal function is impaired or if potassium-sparing agents are introduced [^113NFDQ5] [^115h7Ejq].

> Next, I should review the etiologic workup to prevent recurrence. I will now examine medication contributors such as loop and thiazide diuretics, laxatives, and beta-agonists; assess GI losses from diarrhea or vomiting; and screen for endocrine causes like hyperaldosteronism or Cushing's if hypertension and hypokalemia coexist. If urinary potassium wasting is suspected, a 24-hour urine potassium or spot urine potassium with creatinine can help distinguish renal from non-renal causes, guiding targeted therapy [^115h7Ejq] [^116uEiHT].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or heart failure where potassium targets differ. In heart failure and other high-risk cardiovascular states, maintaining potassium around 4.0–5.0 mmol/L is often advised to mitigate ventricular arrhythmias, and recent randomized data suggest that actively increasing potassium to the high-normal range in ICD patients reduces arrhythmic events and death, so I should individualize the target and consider closer surveillance in these populations [^111pXPM7] [^1151NvTA].

> I should double-check dietary counseling. For chronic prevention, emphasizing adequate potassium intake from whole foods is reasonable unless there is a compelling contraindication, and in patients with persistent hypokalemia from renal wasting, adding a potassium-sparing diuretic such as spironolactone or amiloride can reduce urinary potassium losses while maintaining blood pressure control, though I must monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^113NFDQ5] [^115h7Ejq].

> Let me reconsider the immediate action summary to ensure nothing is missing. Obtain an ECG now, start IV potassium chloride 10–20 mEq in 100–250 mL saline at 10 mEq/hour with continuous monitoring if symptomatic or if ECG is abnormal, otherwise use high-dose divided oral potassium with a plan to recheck within 24–48 hours, correct magnesium concurrently, and arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to review causes and adjust long-term prevention [^116hrden] [^113NFDQ5] [^112AewMC].

---

For a potassium of 2.7 mmol/L in clinic, **immediate oral potassium repletion** is indicated if the patient is asymptomatic and has no ECG changes [^115h7Ejq]; give 40–60 mEq orally in divided doses and recheck potassium in 2–4 hours. If symptomatic or with ECG changes, **urgent IV potassium** is required: 10 mEq KCl in 100 mL saline over 1 hour with continuous cardiac monitoring, repeating until potassium is ≥ 3.0 mmol/L. Always correct magnesium if low, and address underlying causes (e.g. diuretics, GI losses, endocrine disorders) to prevent recurrence [^112fF8mn].

## Clinical significance of potassium 2.7 mmol/L

Potassium 2.7 mmol/L is **severe hypokalemia** and carries a significant risk of cardiac arrhythmias, neuromuscular impairment, and renal complications [^111QJpsS]. Immediate evaluation and treatment are essential to prevent these complications.

---

## Indications for urgent treatment

Urgent treatment is indicated if any of the following are present:

- **Symptoms**: Muscle weakness, cramping, fatigue, or palpitations [^115h7Ejq].
- **ECG changes**: Flattened T waves, U waves, ST depression, or prolonged QT interval [^111QJpsS].
- **Concurrent conditions**: Arrhythmias, heart failure, renal impairment, or medications that increase hypokalemia risk (e.g. diuretics, beta-agonists) [^115KhjSU].

---

## Recommended treatment strategies

### Oral potassium supplementation (preferred for asymptomatic patients without ECG changes)

- **Dose**: 40–60 mEq orally in divided doses (e.g. 20 mEq every 4–6 hours) [^notfound].
- **Formulations**: Potassium chloride tablets or liquid.
- **Monitoring**: Recheck serum potassium 2–4 hours after each dose.
- **Goal**: Achieve serum potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L.

---

### Intravenous potassium supplementation (required for symptomatic patients or ECG changes)

- **Initial dose**: 10 mEq potassium chloride diluted in 100 mL saline, infused over 1 hour [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous cardiac monitoring during infusion.
- **Repeat dosing**: Reassess potassium after each infusion; repeat until potassium ≥ 3.0 mmol/L.
- **Maximum rate**: 10 mEq/hour via peripheral IV; higher rates require central access and continuous monitoring [^114xZWQf].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and considerations

- **Magnesium correction**: Hypomagnesemia impairs potassium repletion; correct magnesium if low [^112fF8mn].
- **Address underlying causes**: Identify and treat causes such as diuretic use, gastrointestinal losses, or endocrine disorders [^116uEiHT].
- **Dietary counseling**: Encourage potassium-rich foods once potassium stabilizes [^115h7Ejq].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check serum potassium every 2–4 hours initially, then daily until stable.
- **Continuous cardiac monitoring**: For symptomatic patients or those receiving IV potassium.
- **Long-term management**: Address underlying causes and monitor for recurrence [^115h7Ejq].

---

## Potential complications of untreated severe hypokalemia

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death [^111QJpsS].
- **Neuromuscular impairment**: Severe muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory compromise [^113NFDQ5].
- **Renal complications**: Impaired renal function and chronic kidney disease progression [^113NFDQ5].

## Treatment of severe hypokalemia (potassium 2.7 mmol/L)

| **Clinical scenario** | **Treatment** | **Monitoring** | **Goal** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Asymptomatic, no ECG changes | Oral potassium 40–60 mEq divided doses | Potassium every 2–4 hours | ≥ 3.5 mmol/L |
| Symptomatic or ECG changes | IV potassium 10 mEq over 1 hour | Continuous cardiac monitoring, potassium every 2–4 hours | ≥ 3.0 mmol/L |
| Hypomagnesemia present | Magnesium sulfate 1–2 g IV | Magnesium and potassium levels | Normalize magnesium |

---

Potassium 2.7 mmol/L is severe hypokalemia requiring **prompt treatment**. Oral repletion suffices for stable, asymptomatic patients, whereas IV therapy with continuous monitoring is indicated for symptomatic patients or those with ECG changes. Correcting magnesium and addressing underlying causes are essential to prevent recurrence.

Potassium disorders are common in patients with kidney disease, particularly in patients with tubular disorders and low glomerular filtration rate. A multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinicians met in October 2018 to identify evidence and address controversies in potassium management. The issues discussed encompassed our latest understanding of the regulation of tubular potassium excretion in health and disease; the relationship of potassium intake to cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, with increasing evidence showing beneficial associations with plant-based diet and data to suggest a paradigm shift from the idea of dietary restriction toward fostering patterns of eating that are associated with better outcomes; the paucity of data on the effect of dietary modification in restoring abnormal serum potassium to the normal range; a novel diagnostic algorithm for hypokalemia that takes into account the ascendency of the clinical context in determining cause, aligning the educational strategy with a practical approach to diagnosis; and therapeutic approaches in managing hyperkalemia when chronic and in the emergency or hospital ward. In sum, we provide here our conference deliberations on potassium homeostasis in health and disease, guidance for evaluation and management of dyskalemias in the context of kidney diseases, and research priorities in each of the above areas.

### Potassium phosphates [^114xZWQf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Important Administration Instructions

Check serum potassium and calcium concentrations prior to administration. Normalize the calcium before administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, use an alternative source of phosphorus.
Do not infuse with calcium-containing intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The 100 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol (phosphorus 0.15 mmol/mL) and potassium 22 mEq (potassium 0.22 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central vein.
The 250 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol and potassium 22 mEq (phosphorus 0.06 mmol/mL and potassium 0.088 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central OR peripheral vein.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose of potassium phosphates and are intended for most patients who weigh 40 kg or greater. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose.
The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consider overall volume status of the patient when determining whether Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is an appropriate product for phosphorus replacement.
Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

Selection of the ready-to-use container solution concentration and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The infusion rate may also be adjusted based on patient characteristics and the specific institution policy.

The maximum recommended concentration and infusion rates for Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection are shown in Table 2 for adults and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater.

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of additional doses, assess the patient clinically, obtain serum phosphorus, calcium, and potassium concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^1118kpFz]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Data to directly support the use of potassium-enriched salt outside the clinical hypertension setting are more limited though the totality of the available evidence suggests that the use of potassium-enriched salt would also reduce BP among the general population. The chief concern about the population-wide use of potassium-enriched salt relates to the possibility that individuals with undiagnosed advanced kidney disease might use potassium-enriched salt and develop hyperkalemia as a consequence. While trials that test this question directly have not been done, high-quality modeling studies suggest a large net benefit from population-wide use of potassium-enriched salt, even under worst-case assumptions about harm from hyperkalemia. The benefit-risk balance is defined primarily by the high global prevalence of hypertension (about 32% of adults), the low prevalence of chronic kidney disease (about 10%with only 2% at late-stage end-stage kidney disease), and the potential for patients with chronic kidney disease to benefit from BP lowering, not just be harmed by hyperkalemia. Other data also suggest that concerns about hyperkalemia from dietary potassium consumption may be overestimated. A 2023 study of 367 patients with stage 1 to 4 chronic kidney disease reported no association between dietary potassium consumption and blood potassium levels. This is a finding directly comparable to that observed in 212 patients with dialysis- and nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease reported a few years earlier.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Serum potassium and outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a post-hoc analysis of the PARAGON-HF trial [^116zioZH]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Study treatment, follow‐up and laboratory measurements

Serum potassium and creatinine levels were measured at screening, during the run‐in period, at randomisation, 1 and 4 months following randomisation, and in 4‐month intervals thereafter at each study site. eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

By protocol, a patient with a serum potassium > 5.3 mmol/L at any time after randomisation required confirmation in a non‐haemolysed sample and further checks of potassium concentration until the potassium was stable and not rising into the range of concern (≥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L) or potential danger (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). Guidance was given on modification of trial treatment (including dose reduction or discontinuation), concomitant therapy and diet, to correct elevation in potassium. Hypokalaemia was managed at the discretion of the treating physician.

Endpoints

In the present analysis we studied the associations of serum potassium (categorical and continuous, using both the screening and time‐updated values) with: (i) the trial primary endpoint, a composite of total (first and recurrent) heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; (ii) total heart failure hospitalisations; (iii) cardiovascular death; (iv) non‐cardiovascular death; and (v) all‐cause death. There were too few sudden cardiac deaths and 'pump failure' deaths for meaningful analysis.

### Potassium and its discontents: new insight, new treatments [^112XawKj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is common in patients with impaired kidney function or who take drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. During the past decade, substantial advances in understanding how the body controls potassium excretion have been made, which may lead to improved standard of care for these patients. Renal potassium disposition is primarily handled by a short segment of the nephron, comprising part of the distal convoluted tubule and the connecting tubule, and regulation results from the interplay between aldosterone and plasma potassium. When dietary potassium intake and plasma potassium are low, the electroneutral sodium chloride cotransporter is activated, leading to salt retention. This effect limits sodium delivery to potassium secretory segments, limiting potassium losses. In contrast, when dietary potassium intake is high, aldosterone is stimulated. Simultaneously, potassium inhibits the sodium chloride cotransporter. Because more sodium is then delivered to potassium secretory segments, primed by aldosterone, kaliuresis results. When these processes are disrupted, hyperkalemia results. Recently, new agents capable of removing potassium from the body and treating hyperkalemia have been tested in clinical trials. This development suggests that more effective and safer approaches to the prevention and treatment of hyperkalemia may be on the horizon.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ZQiCr]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 POTASSIUM MANAGEMENT AND POTASSIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD

In the FIDELIO‐DKD and the FIGARO‐DKD trials, hyperkalemia was reported using thresholds of > 5.5 mmol/L for mild hyperkalemia and > 6.0 to < 6.5 mmol/L for moderate hyperkalemia, in accordance with the latest KDIGO guidance based on the protocol. The earliest time point after which serum potassium was measured in both trials was 1 month after treatment initiation. The second scheduled assessment of serum potassium was at the fourth month after treatment initiation and at 4‐month intervals thereafter. The frequency of potassium monitoring in both trials was consistent with that recommended in the KDIGO guidelines for patients with CKD (3–4 times per year for patients with UACR > 300 mg/g and eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 2–3 times per year for patients with UACR 30–300 mg/g and eGFR 15–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In both trials, the risk of hyperkalemia from finerenone (14.0%) versus placebo (6.9%) was more than doubled. This occurred despite the fact that potassium‐increasing drugs other than ACE inhibitors and ARBs were prohibited and subjects with baseline potassium concentrations > 4.8 mmol/L were excluded from the trials.

Finerenone had a predictable impact on serum potassium concentrations in both trials with a maximum difference in mean serum potassium between groups of 0.23 mmol/L in FIDELIO‐DKD and 0.16 mmol/L in FIGARO‐DKD. Given the higher mean eGFR in the FIGARO‐DKD trial compared with the FIDELIO‐DKD trial (68 vs. 44 ml/min/1.73 m 2), the incidence of hyperkalemia with finerenone treatment was lower in the former (10.8% vs. 18.3%), despite the longer median follow‐up (3.4 vs. 2.6 years). Of note, a post‐hoc analysis of the FIDELIO‐DKD data showed that independent risk factors for mild hyperkalemia were higher serum potassium, lower eGFR, increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio, younger age, female sex, ß‐blocker use, and finerenone assignment. Diuretic or SGLT2 inhibitor use reduced risk.

### Additional evidence for the treatment of potassium disorders… [^114pPBqW]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: I commend Dr. Kim and colleagues for addressing such a broad and important topic. 2–4 When hypokalemia is suspected, administer 1 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate in an intravenous bolus to decrease the risk of torsades de pointes because it is quicker than intravenous potassium and is analogous to administering calcium gluconate in the setting of hyperkalemia. For hyperkalemia, use 5 units of intravenous insulin because this is equally effective as 10 units, with a lower hypoglycemia risk. When contemplating between diuresis or dialysis for hyperkalemia, consider the "nephron bomb, " which includes: ○ Loop diuretic, ○ Thiazide diuretic. ○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6. 1 The literature does suggest differing recommendations for targeted goal serum potassium of
3. 5 vs. 4 to 5 mEq per L. We chose to highlight the recommendation for patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure because this is the area with the strongest available evidence; however, its limitations are reflected in the Strength of Recommendation evidence rating of B. The references used in your letter examined potassium levels in patients with myocardial infarction. One reference only included patients with acute heart failure exacerbation. 4 The current evidence does not definitively favor one resuscitative fluid for each clinical scenario. In the most critically ill adults, balanced crystalloids such as lactated ringers have favorable outcomes.

5 The recommendation for dosing of isotonic bicarbonate in patients who have hyperkalemia with metabolic acidosis and other important considerations are provided in Table 6. Although the described strategy of maximum dosing of three diuretics and fludrocortisone is aligned with the importance of kaliuresis in emergent hyperkalemia, the supporting article does not provide references for the specific recommendations. Fludrocortisone should be used with caution in patients with heart failure and is associated with significant long-term effects.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114sTgDs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

Figure 3 — Mineralocorticoid antagonists for chronic HF advises selecting an initial dose and increasing the dose at least every 2 weeks until maximum tolerated or target dose is achieved, and to monitor electrolytes (especially potassium) and kidney function at 1–2 weeks following initiation, then 7 days after initiation/titration, followed by monthly checks for 3 months and every 3 months for a year, with closer monitoring as warranted by clinical status.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115WWEfb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

In our study, patients treated with patiromer experienced sustained reductions in their serum potassium level (mean [SD] reduction, 0.50 [0.56] mEq/L, an 8.5% decrease from baseline) within the first 6 hours of administration (mean [SD] blood sample obtainment time, 2.9 [1.8] hours) in all care settings, suggesting that its onset of action may be faster than previously reported. Furthermore, the association of patiromer with reduced serum potassium levels persisted across all baseline potassium ranges, with infrequent use of additional potassium control measures (such as insulin or repeated potassium binder doses) within the initial 24 hours after patiromer administration. The incidence of hypokalemia was low in our study, with patients experiencing mild hypokalemia (serum potassium level, < 3.5 mEq/L) in 0.2% of encounters compared with approximately 4.7% in clinical trial data. The incidence of hypomagnesemia (10.0%) was similar to that in clinical trial data (9.0%), although our study's cutoff was 1.7 mg/dL vs 1.4 mg/dL and we did not evaluate serum magnesium levels at baseline or a change in magnesium levels. Of interest, recently published rates of decreased potassium and magnesium levels from a 4-year global pharmacovigilance database of adverse drug events in patients who were prescribed patiromer in clinical practice were 0.45% and 0.16%, respectively. The variance in these rates across trial data, ambulatory surveillance, and institutional settings likely reflects different hyperkalemia causes, patient populations, and monitoring patterns.

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^111GoG94]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to low-potassium diet, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to offer expert assessment by a registered or specialist renal dietitian and advice on dietary strategies to modify potassium intake in patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia with serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112fF8mn]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte management in ventricular arrhythmias — administration of potassium and magnesium has been proposed as helpful adjuncts in the prevention of VA; in patients with torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first-line therapy, and when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate potassium repletion. For potassium targets, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest death rates were seen with serum potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and the rates of VA did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A large randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post-MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30-day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post-MI period.

### Potassium chloride [^115Epgy2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dosage of potassium chloride IV for treatment of hypokalemia in adults (severe) is:

- **Loading**: 5–10 mEq/h IV bolus over 15–30 minutes, repeated until hemodynamically stable with a resolution of ECG changes and serum potassium level > 3 mEq/L
- **Subsequently**: 10 mEq/h IV continuous infusion for 2–4 hours (via a peripheral line)

### Timing of dialysis in acute kidney injury using routinely collected data and dynamic treatment regimes [^111bCgiC]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Further, the thresholds used in our study are values in patients who already received maximal conservative (non-RRT) measures to control pH, potassium, and/or achieve adequate diuresis, as stipulated in the standardized operating protocols in our ICU. The clinical question we intended to address our target trial emulation reported in our paper is thus "in a patient with criterion X (e.g. persisting oliguria) despite maximal non-RRT treatment (e.g. diuretics) is it better to postpone RRT initiation or start immediately". It is important to note that another relevant clinical question such as "is it better to immediately start RRT or start diuretics in oliguric patients with AKI stage 2" cannot be answered by a target trial emulation based on our current dataset, simply because there would be no or only ample reference cases where no diuretics would have been tried before RRT was considered.

Last, we conducted our observational analysis within a target trial emulation framework to generate hypotheses about optimal treatment strategies, which should ideally be validated in an RCT. As a consequence, our results should also be tested in a large multicentric RCT.

In conclusion, our results provide potential thresholds for the absolute criteria to start RRT. They indicate that in patients with KDIGO-AKI stage ≥ 2, initiation of RRT could be postponed until serum potassium > 7.0 mEq/l, or persisting or worsening oliguria as indicated by the oliguria criterion of KDIGO-AKI stage 3, whereas for pH, the threshold is 7.2 for oliguric and 7.0 for non-oliguric patients. As target trials based on observational data are hypothesis generating, the proposed DTR should be validated in an RCT.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^116tDQbo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Both absolute and relative potassium reduction from baseline varied across baseline potassium level categories (Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement) but not by care setting (eFigures 4 and 5 in the Supplement). In addition, there appeared to be a trend toward a greater relative reduction in potassium levels associated with patiromer doses of 16.8 g or more compared with 8.4 g at greater than 12 to 24 hours (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).

Figure 2.
Absolute Serum Potassium Level Reduction by Hyperkalemia Severity

Whiskers indicate SEs.

In the 24 hours after the initial administration of patiromer, in 725 encounters (82.3%), patients received no further doses of potassium binders, whereas in 137 encounters (15.5%), patients received 1 additional dose and in 19 encounters (2.2%), patients received 2 or more additional doses (Table 2). Of those receiving additional binder doses, the mean (SD) time to administration was 14.8 (5.7) hours. In addition, in 76 encounters (8.6%), patients received at least 1 dose of insulin in the 24 hours after patiromer administration, which was administered within a mean (SD) of 13.5 (6.7) hours from the initial patiromer dose. Other subsequent standard-of-care measures for hyperkalemia included furosemide treatment (77 encounters [8.7%]), hemodialysis (8 [0.9%]), and intravenous calcium treatment (91 [10.3%]). In the sensitivity analysis, which excluded any laboratory results obtained after adjunct potassium control measures, the overall trends in potassium levels after patiromer administration remained largely unchanged (eFigures 7–9 in the Supplement).

Table 2.
Evaluation of Outcomes Associated With Patiromer, Including Potassium Measurement Trends

In 2 encounters (0.2%), patients experienced a hypokalemia episode (serum potassium level, < 3.5 mEq/L), and in 68 encounters (10.0%), patients developed hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium level, < 1.7 mg/dL) after patiromer administration. Both episodes of hypokalemia were mild and asymptomatic, with a serum potassium concentration between 3.2 and 3.4 mEq/L.

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of POKONZA™ in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Potassium homeostasis in health and disease: a scientific workshop cosponsored by the National Kidney Foundation and the American society of hypertension [^116bwBmz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

While much emphasis, and some controversy, centers on recommendations for sodium intake, there has been considerably less interest in recommendations for dietary potassium intake, in both the general population and patients with medical conditions, particularly acute and chronic kidney disease. Physiology literature and cohort studies have noted that the relative balance in sodium and potassium intakes is an important determinant of many of the sodium-related outcomes. A noteworthy characteristic of potassium in clinical medicine is the extreme concern shared by many practitioners when confronted by a patient with hyperkalemia. Fear of this often asymptomatic finding limits enthusiasm for recommending potassium intake and often limits the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney diseases. New agents for managing hyperkalemia may alter the long-term management of heart failure and the hypertension, proteinuria, and further function loss in chronic kidney diseases. In this jointly sponsored effort between the American Society of Hypertension and the National Kidney Foundation, 3 panels of researchers and practitioners from various disciplines discussed and summarized current understanding of the role of potassium in health and disease, focusing on cardiovascular, nutritional, and kidney considerations associated with both hypo- and hyperkalemia.

### Acute treatment of hyperkalemia… [^117LTsys]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best acute treatment of an elevated serum potassium level. Evidence-Based Answer According to disease-oriented evidence, insulin and intravenous glucose, inhaled albuterol, and dialysis are the best treatment options; the first two may be given in combination. Bicarbonate or resins are not recommended for routine use, particularly without one of the more effective agents listed above. Practice Pointers Acute treatment of hyperkalemia falls into the still considerable "widely used but little studied" category of medical interventions. No study has reported outcomes that matter to patients, such as the likelihood of death or cardiac arrhythmias. The available literature focuses largely on the ability of interventions to lower serum potassium levels acutely. The Cochrane review by Mahoney and colleagues applies to patients with a significantly elevated potassium level.

Each patient acts as his or her own control, so it is possible to have a much smaller sample size and still obtain statistically significant results. Only four studies used blinding, and only four concealed allocation to treatment groups adequately. Most of the patients studied had acute or chronic renal failure and were receiving hemodialysis. Nebulized or inhaled albuterol proved effective; a dose of 20 mg was more effective than 10 mg in lowering potassium levels, and both doses were better than placebo. Intravenous albuterol and levalbuterol were no more effective than inhaled albuterol. The combination of insulin with intravenous glucose was effective, as was dialysis. In one study, the combination of insulin, glucose, and inhaled albuterol was more effective than insulin and glucose alone. Although potassium-binding polystyrene resins such as Kayexalate are widely used, only one study evaluated their effectiveness in the acute setting, and they proved ineffective.

Adding bicarbonate to insulin and glucose was helpful in one study but not in another. A review of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Website did not identify any practice guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. Recommendations from textbooks vary considerably. For example, Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2005 1 recommends dextrose and insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene resins but does not mention inhaled beta agonists.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### Increasing the potassium level in patients at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias [^1151NvTA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia and even low-normal plasma potassium levels increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias among patients with cardiovascular disease. An assessment of a strategy of actively increasing plasma potassium levels to the high-normal range is needed.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label, event-driven, randomized superiority trial conducted in Denmark, we enrolled participants at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias (defined as those with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]) and with a baseline plasma potassium level of 4.3 mmol per liter or lower. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a treatment regimen aimed at increasing the plasma potassium level to a high-normal level (4.5 to 5.0 mmol per liter) by means of potassium supplementation, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or both plus dietary guidance and standard care (high-normal potassium group) or to standard care only (standard-care group). The primary end point was a composite of documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization (> 24 hours) for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis.

Results

Among the 1200 participants who underwent randomization (600 assigned to each group), the median duration of follow-up was 39.6 months (interquartile range, 26.4 to 49.3). A primary end-point event occurred in 136 participants (22.7%; 7.3 events per 100 person-years) in the high-normal potassium group, as compared with 175 participants (29.2%; 9.6 events per 100 person-years) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.95; P = 0.01). The incidence of hospitalization for hyperkalemia or hypokalemia was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among participants with any cardiovascular disease who had an ICD and were at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias, a treatment-induced increase in plasma potassium levels led to a significantly lower risk of appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause than standard care.

Internists routinely replete potassium to a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction to reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. Recent literature demonstrates that a potassium goal of > 3.5mmol/L likely coincides with the lowest risk of mortality. Based on these data, internists should individualize potassium goals rather than routinely aiming for a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^1139Tryh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The understandably strong impulse to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia should therefore be tempered by consideration of the less visible risk of post-dialysis hypokalaemia. Pragmatically therefore one can conclude the following general principles:

Firstly, pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia should be controlled, though an overly tight range may be counterproductive, so the previously recommended target for pre-dialysis potassium still seems optimal (4.0–6.0mmol/L). Caveats to interpreting this range should be noted: firstly, achievement of pre-dialysis potassium within this range does not necessarily mean that dialysate potassium is optimal, and secondly, consistent adherence to treatment is most likely just as important as specifics of the potassium range or dialysis prescription.

Secondly, non-dialysate approaches to hyperkalaemia may sometimes be more favourable. Dietary reduction may be preferable if it can be achieved without an adverse effect on protein-calorie intake, and other dialysis changes may be appropriate, such as increasing blood flow, duration or frequency. Consideration could also be given to potassium binding resins.

Thirdly, lower dialysate potassium does increase the removal of potassium during each session, and based on the risk of arrhythmias due to hyperkalaemia, dialysate potassium should be reduced if other measures are not possible or successful. However, dialysate potassium should be no lower than is necessary to achieve this goal – individualization does therefore seem necessary, so that each patient uses the highest dialysate potassium which still controls pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. This pragmatic approach has probably driven the steady increase in the use of higher potassium dialysates, and reduction in the use of concentrations below 2.0mmol/L, over the 5 DOPPS phases between 1996 and 2015.

Finally, and particularly for measurements taken remote from the laboratory, the relatively high frequency of measurement errors (for example due to in vitro haemolysis) should be remembered when interpreting potassium levels.

PARADIGM‐HF

The design, methods and principal results of the PARADIGM‐HF trial have been previously reported. 13 In brief, the trial was a randomized, double‐blind, prospective comparison of the effect of sacubitril (97 mg) and valsartan (103 mg) administered twice daily (LCZ696, 200 mg twice daily) and that of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) in 8399 patients with chronic HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II–IV] and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40%. Prior to randomization, all participants underwent single‐blind, sequential run‐in periods to ensure the tolerability of both study drugs at target doses. Eligible patients were those treated with an appropriate regimen of background HF medications at stable doses for at least 4 weeks, including an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (at a dose equivalent to enalapril 10 mg/day or greater) and a beta‐blocker (unless not tolerated). The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was left to the discretion of the investigators but was encouraged if tolerated. Key exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 100 mmHg at screening or 95 mmHg at randomization, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 at screening/randomization or a decrease in the eGFR of > 25% (amended to 35%) between screening and randomization, and a serum K + level of > 5.2 mmol/L at screening or > 5.4 mmol/L at randomization. Serum K + was measured at every study visit (Supplementary material online, Table S1). The protocol recommended that any patient with serum potassium of > 5.3 mmol/L after randomization required regular, repeated checks of potassium concentration (beyond that prescribed in the protocol) until it was clear that the potassium concentration was stable and not rising to levels of concern (≥ 5.5 mmol/L and < 6.0 mmol/L) or potential danger (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). 13 No recommendation for dose adjustment in the setting of hypokalaemia was given. The primary composite endpoint was death from cardiovascular (CV) causes or first hospitalization for HF (CV death/HF hospitalization). The present analysis also examines CV, all‐cause and sudden cardiac death (or resuscitated cardiac arrest). The median follow‐up time was 810 (range: 564–1069) days or 116 (range: 81–153) weeks. The trial was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating site, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.

### Disorders of potassium [^114WHxyU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Dispelling myths and misconceptions about the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^111gKdBN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Effects of hyperkalaemia and non-adherence to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure in Italy: a propensity-matched study [^116oYwEP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Restrictions in RAASi therapy in chronic HF patients who either feature HK or high potassium levels, even if often still in the 'normal range' (i.e. potassium level from 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L), are suggested by current guidelines and observed in real‐world clinical practice; however, questions were raised whether this is justified and appropriate. 16 Indeed, previous results showed that potassium levels or increases in potassium levels during RAASi up‐titration within the relative 'normal' range did not interfere with the beneficial effects of these therapies and was not associated with worse outcomes, 17 being tolerated by patients. On the contrary, previous results from the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) showed that, regardless of the fact that HK did not interfere with the beneficial effects of spironolactone, it was associated with higher mortality rates. 18 This was confirmed by a population‐based, time‐series analysis of health care Canadian databases after RALES publication: spironolactone prescriptions highly increased in HF patients treated with ACEi, leading to a rise by a factor of about three of both the rate of hospital admission involving a diagnosis of HK and the rate of HK associated with in‐hospital death among these patients (P < 0.001). 19 In such a perspective, ESC guidelines recommend to strictly monitor potassium level during RAASi therapy and to lower/discontinue RAASi treatment to minimize risks associated with HK. However, discontinuation or lowering of ACEi/ARB dosages was associated with more adverse outcomes, 7, 15 suggesting that high potassium levels could contribute to severely adverse outcomes. These findings might have implications for clinical practice, suggesting that lowering potassium levels in patients with HK might lead to improved guideline‐directed treatment with ACEi and ARB. These data are important considering the availability of new potassium‐lowering drugs, 20 effective in keeping potassium levels within the normal range. 21, 22 Hence, data on RAASi therapy and HK must be interpreted in the context of the benefits of RAASi with regard to CV mortality, always controlling for elevated potassium. 23, 24, 25

At present, a tenable approach to maintain optimal RAASi dosages together with adequate potassium levels could be a more frequent, periodic, monitoring of serum potassium which is currently poor, 26, 27 along with electrocardiogram, to catch the signs of impending threshold events. Assessment of renal function could also be performed at the same time intervals.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116AU5Ci]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

RAASi/MRA management in CKD with hyperkalemia includes a stepwise approach: Optimize serum bicarbonate levels; Consider potassium-exchange agents; Third-line (Last resort): Reduce or discontinue RAASi/MRA; restart in future if patient condition allows. Providers may consider reducing or stopping ACEI/ARB when eGFR drops below a given eGFR threshold or when hyperkalemia develops, but hyperkalemia associated with use of ACEI/ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping ACEI/ARB. Protocols for RCTs of finerenone held the medication at potassium > 5.5 mmol/L; however, it may be appropriate to continue these medications in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/L. We recommend involvement of nephrology when there is consideration of continuing ACEI/ARB/MRA when potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. The International Society of Nephrology provides an Optimization of RAASi Therapy Toolkit that includes guidance for managing hyperkalemia in patients on RAASi.

### Elevated potassium levels in patients with congestive heart failure: occurrence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes: a Danish population-based cohort study [^114qwQcd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) affects > 37 million adults worldwide and is a leading cause of hospitalizations and death. 1, 2 Despite improvements in HF therapy and prognosis, 3 hospitalizations with HF remain frequent, and comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus and renal disease, have become more common. 2, 3, 4, 5

Hyperkalemia, usually defined as blood potassium level > 5.0 mmol/L, is a concern in patients with HF in everyday clinical practice and can be a life‐threatening condition. 6, 7 Hyperkalemia with high potassium levels (eg, > 6.0 mmol/L) may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death, 8 but even potassium levels of > 5.0 mmol/L have been associated with increased mortality in patients with acute‐care hospital admission 6 and in patients with HF. 9, 10

Knowledge is scarce on the occurrence of hyperkalemia and associated outcomes in patients with HF in the real‐world setting. 11, 12 Patients with kidney disease have an increased risk of hyperkalemia, 7 and a dynamic association between heart and kidney dysfunction has been described in the cardiorenal syndrome, 13 with evidence of chronic kidney disease in more than half of patients with HF. 14 Moreover, several drugs commonly used for treating HF may lead to hyperkalemia 15 by interfering with renal potassium excretion, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and potassium‐sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. 11, 16

To understand the potential impact of new drug therapies for hyperkalemia, 8, 17 it is important to assess the true burden of hyperkalemia among people with HF and to assess associated patient characteristics, current treatment practices, and clinical outcomes in real‐world settings. We, therefore, undertook a large population‐based cohort study in Denmark to examine occurrence, risk factors, and outcomes of hyperkalemia in patients with HF.

### Hyperkalemia | AAFP… [^111ysrgx]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism should be considered in patients with diabetes and hyperkalemia, who generally have a low serum aldosterone. A trial of oral fludrocortisone is generally the most practical way to empirically establish this diagnosis; if the patient has hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, potassium levels will return to normal in a day or two after initiation of fludrocortisone. ACUTE TREATMENT Urgent treatment of hyperkalemia includes stabilizing the myocardium to protect against arrhythmias and shifting potassium from the vascular space into the cells. After the serum potassium level is reduced to safe levels, treatment focuses on lowering total body potassium. In patients who do not require urgent treatment, lowering total body potassium may be the only step necessary. LOWERING TOTAL BODY POTASSIUM Treatments that shift potassium into the cells have no effect on total body potassium.

Potassium can be eliminated by renal excretion, gastrointestinal elimination, or dialysis. The agents taken to lower total body potassium can interfere with tests to determine the cause of hyperkalemia. Thus, spot urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolality levels should be obtained before the agents are initiated; however, treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results. Excretion of renal potassium can be increased with the use of diuretics, particularly loop diuretics. Patients with decreased kidney function may be relatively resistant to the effects of diuretics. If the patient is volume depleted, saline can be given with the diuretic. Hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy are the treatments of last resort, with the exception of patients already receiving these therapies. LONG-TERM TREATMENT Long-term treatment should be tailored to correcting the underlying cause of hyperkalemia.

Low-potassium diets should be discussed with patients, and medications that precipitated hyperkalemia should be discontinued if possible. The use of loop diuretics or fludrocortisone will be needed for patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism whose hyperkalemia recurs or is chronic. The principal side effects are hypertension and f luid retention, which may respond to an added diuretic. Although the question of appropriate treatment duration with f ludrocortisone has never been studied, one approach to management would be to slowly taper f ludrocortisone on an outpatient basis, and reinstate f ludrocortisone if potassium rises.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115GDr43]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^116uEiHT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^115vJBMb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the subcutaneous form of furosemide has been developed in recent years. These subcutaneous injections are particularly useful in at‐home hospital settings as they are logistically demanding and do not require the hurdle/inconvenience of repeated venous puncture.

Careful consideration should be paid to dyskalaemia following the IV diuretic session. Briefly, with this protocol, only patients with prior IV diuretic potassium > 4 mEq/L (regardless of renal function) or patients with K + > 3.7 if creatinine is 2.0 mg/dl (175 µmol/L) or above will not receive potassium supplements during the IV diuretic sessions (Figure 4). In our experience, these patients with low serum potassium should receive MRAs whenever possible. Indeed, patients receiving IV diuretic sessions are likely to have increased doses of oral diuretics in the following weeks, which could further decrease serum potassium levels.

Of importance, guideline‐recommended drugs should not be withheld during this IV diuretic period, unless symptomatic hypotension occurs. Indeed, as already emphasized above, RAAS is a key driver of sodium/water retention.

There are sparse data assessing the optimal number of diuretic sessions. Very early follow‐up overviewed by a physician should be undertaken to assess the clinical efficacy of the IV sessions (ideally within 48–72 h). Additional sessions should be performed if substantial congestion persists. Clinical deterioration or a decrease in diuretic efficacy should prompt in‐hospital admission in most instances. Our general threshold to discontinue iterative ambulatory IV diuretics is reported in Figure 3, and includes a mixture of clinical response, objective evaluation, and laboratory testing (which can include natriuretic peptide quantification).

### Efficacy of potassium supplementation in hypokalemic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: a randomized controlled trial [^111SbW8q]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been associated with increased risks of peritonitis and death. Whether correction of hypokalemia improves these outcomes is unknown.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Adult (aged ≥ 18 years) PD patients with hypokalemia (defined as at least 3 values or an average value < 3.5 mEq/L in the past 6 months). Randomization was stratified according to center and residual urine output (≤ 100 or > 100 mL/day).

Interventions

Random assignment to either protocol-based potassium supplementation (titratable dose of oral potassium chloride to maintain serum potassium of 4–5 mEq/L) or conventional potassium supplementation (reactive supplementation when serum potassium is < 3.5 mEq/L) over 52 weeks. Treatment groups were compared using intention-to-treat analyses implemented using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Outcome

The primary outcome was time from randomization to first peritonitis episode (any organism). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and conversion to hemodialysis.

Results

A total of 167 patients with time-averaged serum potassium concentrations of 3.33 ± 0.28 mEq/L were enrolled from 6 PD centers: 85 were assigned to receive protocol-based treatment, and 82 were assigned to conventional treatment. The median follow-up time was 401 (IQR, 315–417) days. During the study period, serum potassium levels in the protocol-based treatment group increased to 4.36 ± 0.70 mEq/L compared with 3.57 ± 0.65 mEq/L in the group treated conventionally (mean difference, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53–0.79] mEq/L; P < 0.001). The median time to first peritonitis episode was significantly longer in the protocol-based group (223 [IQR, 147–247] vs 133 [IQR, 41–197] days, P = 0.03). Compared with conventional treatment, the protocol-based group had a significantly lower hazard of peritonitis (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.93]) but did not differ significantly with respect to any of the secondary outcomes. Asymptomatic hyperkalemia (> 6 mEq/L) without characteristic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 3 patients (4%) in the protocol-based treatment group.

Limitations

Not double-masked.

Conclusions

Compared with reactive potassium supplementation when the serum potassium level falls below 3.5 mEq/L, protocol-based oral potassium treatment to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4–5 mEq/L may reduce the risk of peritonitis in patients receiving PD who have hypokalemia.

### A serum potassium level above 10 mmol / L in a patient predisposed to hypokalemia [^115YCYRh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 58-year-old man, previously diagnosed with Bartter's syndrome, presented with a short history of vomiting, diarrhea and weakness. He had severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels > 10 mmol/l), which was successfully managed. Post hoc investigation suggested that the patient had Gitelman's rather than Bartter's syndrome.

Investigations

Physical examination, urine and blood analyses, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, renal ultrasound, and genetic analysis focusing on the SLC12A3 gene, which encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter.

Diagnosis

Gitelman's syndrome and hyperkalemia secondary to acute renal failure plus exogenous potassium supplementation.

Management

Intravenous calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose administration. Temporary continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Genetic confirmation of the underlying molecular defect. Long-term treatment for Gitelman's syndrome with oral potassium and magnesium supplements and epithelial sodium channel-blocking drugs. Review of patient education regarding renal salt-wasting syndromes.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes related to hypo-and hyperkalemia in patients with severe heart failure treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^113Toagh]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure but can cause hyperkalemia, which contributes to reduced use of these drugs. Hypokalemia also leads to worse outcomes in patients with heart failure and may be attenuated by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Methods and Results

We assessed incidence and predictors of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mmol/L) and the relationship to outcomes in 1663 patients with class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% randomized to treatment with spironolactone 25 mg or placebo in the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) trial. All-cause mortality rates and the influence of potassium levels on the effectiveness of spironolactone were assessed in a landmark analysis and in relation to time-varying potassium levels. After 1 month, mean potassium levels increased in the spironolactone group but not in the placebo group (4.54 ± 0.49 versus 4.28 ± 0.50 mmol/L; P < 0.001) and remained elevated during the trial. Although the extremes of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia at 4 weeks were associated with increased risk of mortality in both treatment arms, participants in the spironolactone arm had lower mortality rates at all potassium levels throughout the duration of the trial. The treatment benefit of spironolactone was maintained at least until potassium exceeded 5.5 mmol/L.

Conclusions

With appropriate surveillance of potassium and creatinine, the use of spironolactone was associated with less hypokalemia and improved survival in patients with severe heart failure even in the setting of moderate hyperkalemia.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute treatment of hyperkalaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116HEr1A]. Resuscitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a life-threatening electrolyte disturbance and also a potential cause of cardiac arrest. The objective was to assess the effects of acute pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in patients with and without cardiac arrest.

Methods

The review was reported according to PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023440553). We searched OVID Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL on September 9, 2024 for randomized trials, non-randomized trials, observational studies, and experimental animal studies. Two investigators performed abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and bias assessment. Outcomes included potassium levels, ECG findings, and clinical outcomes. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Results

A total of 101 studies were included, with two studies including patients with cardiac arrest. In meta-analyses including adult patients without cardiac arrest, treated with insulin in combination with glucose, inhaled salbutamol, intravenous salbutamol dissolved in glucose, or a combination, the average reduction in potassium was between 0.7 and 1.2 mmol/l (very low to low certainty of evidence). The use of bicarbonate had no effect on potassium levels (very low certainty of evidence). In neonatal and paediatric populations, inhaled salbutamol and intravenous salbutamol reduced the average potassium between 0.9 and 1.0 mmol/l (very low to low certainty of evidence). There was no evidence to support a clinical beneficial effect of calcium for treatment of hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

Evidence supports treatment with insulin in combination with glucose, inhaled or intravenous sal-butamol, or the combination. No evidence supporting a clinical effect of calcium or bicarbonate for hyperkalaemia was identified.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Effects of presentation and electrocardiogram on time to treatment of hyperkalemia [^114y6bmm]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the time to treatment for emergency department (ED) patients with critical hyperkalemia and to determine whether the timing of treatment was associated with clinical characteristics or electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of ED patients with the laboratory diagnosis of hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients presenting in cardiac arrest or who were referred for hyperkalemia or dialysis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed to find whether patients received specific treatment for hyperkalemia and, if so, what clinical attributes were associated with the time to initiation of treatment.

Results

Of 175 ED visits that occurred over a 1-year time period, 168 (96%) received specific treatment for hyperkalemia. The median time from triage to initiation of treatment was 117 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 59 to 196 minutes). The 7 cases in which hyperkalemia was not treated include 4 cases in which the patient was discharged home, with a missed diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Despite initiation of specific therapy for hyperkalemia in 168 cases, 2 patients died of cardiac arrhythmias. Among the patients who received treatment, 15% had a documented systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 90 mmHg, and 30% of treated patients were admitted to intensive care units. The median potassium value was 6.5 mmol/L (IQR = 6.3 to 7.1 mmol/L). The predominant complaints were dyspnea (20%) and weakness (19%). Thirty-six percent of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were abnormal in 83% of patient visits, including 24% of ECGs with nonspecific ST abnormalities. Findings of peaked T-wave morphology (34%), first-degree atrioventricular block (17%), and interventricular conduction delay (12%) did not lead to early treatment. Vital sign abnormalities, including hypotension (sBP < 90 mmHg), were not associated with early treatment. The chief complaint of "unresponsive" was most likely to lead to early treatment; treatment delays occurred in patients not transported by ambulance, those with a chief complaint of syncope and those with a history of hypertension.

Conclusions

Recognition of patients with severe hyperkalemia is challenging, and the initiation of appropriate therapy for this disorder is frequently delayed.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^116XgbM2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes according to potassium level

There was a U‐shaped relationship between baseline potassium level and the clinical outcomes of interest. Patients in the lowest baseline potassium category (≤ 3.5 mmol/L) had higher event rates in comparison with patients with potassium in the normal range (4.1–4.9 mmol/L), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables (Table 2). This was also true for those in the highest potassium category (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in relation to the mortality outcomes, although the magnitude of the elevation in risk was smaller than that seen in the lowest potassium category (Table 2).

Table 2
Events, event rates and hazard ratios for baseline and time‐updated potassium levels for the various outcomes

This overall pattern was generally more pronounced in the time‐updated models. For the primary outcome, the HR for a potassium level of 3.6–4.0 mmol/L was 1.25 (95% CI 1.06–1.47) and the HR for a potassium concentration of ≤ 3.5 mmol/L was 1.91 (95% CI 1.41–2.61), compared with the reference category (potassium 4.1–4.9 mmol/L). The HR for a potassium level of 5.0–5.4 mmol/L was 1.08 (95% CI 0.92–1.27) and for a potassium level of ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was 1.38 (95% CI 1.06–1.78).

2.2 Dosage for Administration in Intravenous Fluids to Correct Hypophosphatemia

POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION provides phosphorus 3 mmol/mL (potassium 4.7 mEq/mL).

The dosage is dependent upon the individual needs of the patient, and the contribution of phosphorus and potassium from other sources.

Initial or Single Dose

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose and are intended for most patients. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose. The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium serum concentrations.

cup to a maximum of phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) as a single dose.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

The concentration of the diluted solution and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter.

Peripheral administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 6.4 mmol/100 mL (potassium10 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 6.4 mmol/hour (potassium 10 mEq/hour).

Central administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 18 mmol/100 mL (potassium 28.2 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 15 mmol/hour (potassium 23.5 mEq/hour).

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates of potassium higher than 10 mEq/hour in adults and 0.5 mEq/kg/hour in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of
additional doses, assess the patient clinically and obtain serum phosphorous, calcium and potassium
concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

### Potassium disorders – clinical spectrum and emergency management [^113AgffA]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are common and may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias or cardiopulmonary arrest. They are an anticipated complication in patients with renal failure, but may also occur in patients with no previous history of renal disease. They have a broad clinical spectrum of presentation and this paper will highlight the life-threatening arrhythmias associated with both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. Although the medical literature to date has provided a foundation for the therapeutic options available, this has not translated into consistent medical practice. Treatment algorithms have undoubtedly been useful in the management of other medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest and acute asthma. Hence, we have applied this strategy to the treatment of hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia which may prove valuable in clinical practice.
