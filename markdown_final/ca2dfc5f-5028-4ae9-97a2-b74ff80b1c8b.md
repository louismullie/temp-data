## Question

Are there any specific symptoms that would suggest an aneurysm as the cause of tinnitus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tinnitus features should trigger suspicion for an aneurysm and what the appropriate evaluation and imaging pathway should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the tinnitus phenotype because pulsatile versus non-pulsatile changes pretest probability. Then, I should verify which accompanying symptoms and exam findings raise concern for vascular etiologies, including aneurysm. Next, I will review guideline-based red flags that mandate imaging. After that, I need to check the optimal imaging modalities for suspected aneurysm in the setting of pulsatile tinnitus. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and counseling points, while double-checking for exceptions and low-yield scenarios to avoid unnecessary testing.

> Let me first confirm the tinnitus phenotype because pulsatile tinnitus is the key clinical clue that elevates the likelihood of a vascular cause, including aneurysm, whereas non-pulsatile tinnitus is far more commonly nonvascular and often idiopathic or sensorineural in origin. I should confirm that guidelines consistently prioritize pulsatility in triage and imaging decisions, which they do [^111qVqL7] [^11353XiU] [^115U5VuD].

> Now, I will examine the specific features that heighten suspicion for aneurysm-related tinnitus. Pulsatile tinnitus that is synchronized with the heartbeat, unilateral rather than bilateral, and of new or recent onset are the principal red flags, and I should also actively look for associated vascular or neurologic symptoms such as new headache, cranial neuropathy, focal deficits, or Horner syndrome, because these co-features materially increase the pretest probability of aneurysm or dissection and are repeatedly emphasized in vascular and neuro-otologic guidance [^1133DCje] [^113kWrQJ] [^113stWLL] [^114DRvgj].

> Wait, let me verify the role of objective findings on exam. Auscultation over the mastoid, orbit, or neck may reveal a bruit or venous hum, and careful otoscopy may show a retrotympanic vascular-appearing mass or pulsations suggesting a paraganglioma or aberrant carotid anatomy, which, while not aneurysm per se, are critical mimics or concomitant vascular lesions that warrant vascular imaging when pulsatile tinnitus is present [^1124MY8y] [^1129JRm4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging for everyone with tinnitus. I need to ensure I apply guideline-based triggers for neuroimaging, which consistently recommend imaging when tinnitus is pulsatile, unilateral, or accompanied by focal neurologic deficits or asymmetric hearing loss, and conversely recommend against routine imaging in bilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus without these red flags due to low yield and potential harms [^115U5VuD] [^114Lur98] [^111umS98] [^11353XiU].

> Next, I should review the optimal imaging strategy. For suspected aneurysm in the setting of pulsatile tinnitus, high-quality vascular imaging with CTA or MRA of the head and neck is indicated, and if a retrotympanic lesion is suspected on otoscopy, temporal bone CT can characterize bony variants while CTA/MRA define the vascular anatomy. I should double-check that ACR endorses combined parenchymal and vascular imaging for pulsatile tinnitus without a retrotympanic mass, which it does, and that AHA/ASA supports CTA/MRA for unruptured intracranial aneurysm detection when clinically suspected [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4] [^112bPLKh].

> But wait, what if the tinnitus is non-pulsatile and bilateral? I need to ensure I do not over-image in low-yield scenarios, as guidelines advise against head/neck imaging in bilateral non-pulsatile tinnitus without focal deficits or asymmetric hearing loss, and the diagnostic yield of MRI for asymmetric tinnitus without sensorineural hearing loss is extremely low, so I should reserve imaging for those with clear red flags or asymmetric findings after audiologic assessment [^115jycCa] [^115U5VuD] [^115A1YDF].

> I will now synthesize a practical approach: if the tinnitus is pulsatile, unilateral, or accompanied by focal neurologic signs or asymmetric hearing loss, I should obtain urgent audiometry and proceed to vascular imaging with CTA or MRA of the head and neck, adding temporal bone CT if a retrotympanic abnormality is seen. If the tinnitus is non-pulsatile and bilateral without red flags, I should prioritize comprehensive audiologic evaluation and avoid imaging unless new concerning features emerge, documenting this shared decision-making to mitigate unnecessary radiation, contrast, cost, and incidental findings [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4] [^115U5VuD] [^116KTQrW].

> Let me consider important differentials and mimics so I do not anchor prematurely. Glomus tumors, dural arteriovenous fistulas, venous sinus stenosis or diverticula, carotid stenosis, and fibromuscular dysplasia can all produce pulsatile tinnitus and may coexist or be confused with aneurysm, so the imaging protocol should be broad enough to survey the relevant vasculature and adjacent structures when pulsatility is present [^113kWrQJ] [^113stWLL] [^11353XiU].

> I should confirm urgency and referral pathways. Sudden or unexplained hearing loss with tinnitus warrants same-day audiology and expedited otolaryngology, new focal neurologic deficits or thunderclap headache require emergency evaluation, and new pulsatile tinnitus merits urgent otolaryngology and vascular imaging, aligning with VA/DoD and AAO-HNS red flag algorithms and the ACR imaging criteria for pulsatile tinnitus [^111qVqL7] [^115U5VuD] [^11353XiU].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling is accurate. I should explain that pulsatile tinnitus is a symptom with a broad differential that includes potentially serious vascular causes, that imaging is pursued when specific red flags are present rather than for routine tinnitus, and that many causes are treatable once identified, which helps set expectations and supports adherence to the evaluation plan [^115U5VuD] [^113m6uze].

Tinnitus is not a reliable indicator of an aneurysm, but **pulsatile tinnitus** — especially when unilateral, synchronous with the heartbeat, and accompanied by neurologic deficits or asymmetric hearing loss — raises concern for a vascular lesion such as an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation [^115V3KfP] [^113kWrQJ]. Non-pulsatile tinnitus is far more common and usually non-vascular [^notfound]. If pulsatile tinnitus is present, **prompt vascular imaging** (CTA/MRA) is recommended to exclude aneurysm or other serious vascular causes [^11353XiU] [^115U5VuD].

---

## Clinical features of tinnitus associated with aneurysm

Tinnitus linked to aneurysm typically reflects turbulent blood flow or mass effect; the following features should raise suspicion:

- **Pulsatile tinnitus**: Rhythmic, synchronous with the heartbeat, often unilateral; strongly suggests a vascular etiology such as aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or carotid stenosis [^113kWrQJ] [^114CEAaL].

- **Unilateral tinnitus**: More likely to indicate a localized vascular lesion, including aneurysm, than bilateral tinnitus [^116KTQrW] [^114CEAaL].

- **Associated neurologic symptoms**: Cranial nerve palsies, focal deficits, or Horner syndrome may accompany aneurysm-related tinnitus [^113zZTEF].

- **Sudden onset**: New, rapidly progressive pulsatile tinnitus warrants urgent evaluation for vascular causes, including aneurysm [^111qVqL7].

---

## Differentiating aneurysm-related tinnitus from other causes

Tinnitus is common and usually non-vascular; the following distinctions help identify aneurysm-related cases:

| **Feature** | **Aneurysm-related tinnitus** | **Non-vascular tinnitus** |
|-|-|-|
| Character | Pulsatile, synchronous with heartbeat | Non-pulsatile, continuous or intermittent |
| Laterality | Often unilateral | Often bilateral |
| Associated symptoms | Neurologic deficits, cranial nerve palsies, Horner syndrome | Hearing loss, vertigo, otalgia, otorrhea |
| Onset | Sudden or rapidly progressive | Gradual or intermittent |
| Risk factors | Hypertension, connective tissue disorders, family history | Noise exposure, ototoxic medications, age-related hearing loss |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When aneurysm-related tinnitus is suspected, **targeted diagnostic testing is indicated**:

- **Imaging**: CTA or MRA of the head and neck are first-line to detect aneurysms or other vascular lesions [^11353XiU] [^112bPLKh].

- **Audiologic assessment**: Comprehensive audiometry to evaluate hearing loss and characterize tinnitus [^116KTQrW].

- **Neurologic examination**: Identify focal deficits or cranial nerve involvement suggestive of aneurysm [^1124MY8y].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **selective imaging** for tinnitus: obtain vascular imaging for pulsatile tinnitus, unilateral tinnitus with asymmetric hearing loss, or focal neurologic deficits; avoid routine imaging for non-pulsatile bilateral tinnitus without red flags [^115U5VuD] [^115jycCa]. Pulsatile tinnitus warrants a thorough vascular workup, including imaging, to exclude aneurysm or other serious vascular lesions [^113kWrQJ] [^11353XiU].

---

## Conclusion

Tinnitus alone is not specific for aneurysm; **pulsatile tinnitus**, particularly when unilateral and accompanied by neurologic deficits or asymmetric hearing loss, should prompt vascular imaging to exclude aneurysm or other serious vascular lesions [^115U5VuD] [^11353XiU].

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113kWrQJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus — etiologies and evaluation emphasize vascular and neoplastic causes and specify when comprehensive workup is warranted. Pulsatile tinnitus can be caused by intracranial hypertension, neoplasms, and vascular disorders and deserves special attention during the directed history and examination. Although most of these tumors are in the abdomen, 3% of nonadrenal paragangliomas are in the head and neck, and glomus tumors are rare but are the most common tumor of the middle ear. Patients with glomus tumors commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus (80%), whereas some present with hearing loss (60%), and tinnitus from these lesions is usually unilateral. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and fistulae can cause tinnitus, and serious consequences, including intracerebral hemorrhage, may occur without treatment. Although debated, a systematic review found vascular loop compression of the eighth cranial nerve was 80 times more common in patients with pulsatile tinnitus than those with nonpulsatile tinnitus. Less serious phenomena can also cause pulsatile tinnitus, including venous hums, aberrant carotid arteries, and carotid transmissions, many of which are unilateral; venous hums are caused by turbulent blood flow through the jugular bulb and can be associated with sigmoid sinus diverticulum or dehiscence, and carotid transmission can result from stenosis or transmitted heart murmurs. In light of these issues, the patient with pulsatile tinnitus should have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out systemic cardiovascular or neurologic disease.

Statement 2A. Prompt audiologic examination — Clinicians should obtain a comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, associated with hearing difficulties, or persistent (≥ 6 months). Recommendation based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over risk. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies. Level of confidence in the evidence: Moderate, as literature about the effect of prompt audiologic assessment on tinnitus management is scant. Intentional vagueness: The term prompt is used to emphasize the importance of ordering a timely test and ensuring that it is done within 4 weeks of assessment, preferably. Audiologic examination is ideally obtained within 4 weeks of initial patient presentation, and sudden SNHL may occur along with tinnitus, and this condition warrants audiologic testing preferably at the time of presentation, or otherwise no later than 2 weeks after presentation. Unilateral tinnitus, as compared to bilateral tinnitus, is more likely to be a symptom of a vascular lesion or VS; vestibular schwannoma classically presents with unilateral SNHL with or without tinnitus; vestibular schwannoma has an annual incidence of about 2 per 100,000 in the United States, representing 5% to 10% of intracranial tumors in adults; in patients with VS, tinnitus is unilateral in 95% of cases; however, only 2% of patients with asymmetric or unilateral SNHL and tinnitus will actually have VS. Policy level: Recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^1129JRm4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain temporal bone CT in patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus with a suspected retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy to evaluate for lesions, such as glomus tympanicum, glomus jugulotympanicum, and vascular variants like aberrant internal carotid artery, dehiscent jugular foramen, and persistent stapedial artery.
Consider obtaining dedicated vascular imaging with head/head and neck CTA and head CTV because thin-section bony reconstructions from the raw data show bony details of the temporal bone and can characterize most retrotympanic lesions.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112AMb9E]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus patient education and counseling — policy and core messages emphasize that management strategies for persistent, bothersome tinnitus do exist, clinicians should engage the patient or the patient's proxy in decision making with awareness of the natural history, prognosis, and management options, and clinicians should point out that there is no established cure but avoid statements that may exacerbate negative reactions. Patient education should emphasize that tinnitus is a symptom and not a dangerous disease, counseling should include the association with hearing loss, relevant lifestyle factors, hearing protection from noise including the association between noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus, and patients should be encouraged to return for follow-up if symptoms persist, remain bothersome, or worsen. Evidence notes counseling and sound therapy can benefit patients, and self-help brochures and books provide benefit; clinicians can inform and educate by providing brochures, suggesting self-help books, and describing counseling and sound therapy options. The benefit–harm assessment was a preponderance of benefit, risks were direct cost and time, and the policy level was recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^114uFmDo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Role and performance of audiologic testing in persistent tinnitus: Since tinnitus symptoms of 6 months or longer are less likely to improve spontaneously, audiologic testing is indicated to identify coexisting hearing loss, to detect hearing loss that may have been unsuspected or unnoticed by the patient, and to identify unilateral or asymmetric hearing loss that may indicate a more serious underlying problem. Documenting the baseline hearing status in a patient with persistent tinnitus allows future comparisons to detect progressive or fluctuating hearing loss and can also be useful for patient education.

Tinnitus — physical examination key details and implications emphasize targeted findings linked to actions. Objective tinnitus is noted as "Rarely, tinnitus can be heard by the clinician as well as the patient", with the implication that "Objective tinnitus may be caused by identifiable diseases, such as vascular abnormalities and myoclonus". Cardiovascular findings such as "Heart murmurs, carotid bruits, or vascular sounds" indicate that "Cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions may cause tinnitus", and that "Treatment of the underlying disease may help tinnitus symptoms" and can "require appropriate evaluation and treatment". "Focal neurologic signs" mean that "Tinnitus patients should undergo neurologic assessment" with "Referral to appropriate specialists… which may include imaging of the central nervous system". "Otorrhea" signifies "Sign of middle ear infection or otitis externa", where "Treatment of otitis media/externa may improve tinnitus as well as associated hearing difficulties". For "Signs of other external or middle ear disease on examination and/or otoscopy", simple problems like "cerumen impaction or otitis media can be detected", and "Appropriate referral can be made… Imaging can be performed when indicated". "Head and neck masses" associated with ipsilateral tinnitus "requires prompt investigation", with "Referral to appropriate specialists; imaging when indicated".

### Avanafil [^115eF2J1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss

Use of PDE5 inhibitors has been associated with sudden decrease or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by tinnitus or dizziness. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients experiencing these symptoms should be advised to stop taking avanafil and seek prompt medical attention.

5.6 Alpha-Blockers and Other Antihypertensives

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for avanafil to augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and other antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, including avanafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).

Consideration should be given to the following:

- Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating treatment with a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.

- In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose (Avanafil 50 mg).

- In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.

Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112wg7UP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Vestibular schwannoma (VS) epidemiology in unilateral tinnitus is described, noting unilateral tinnitus is more likely to be a symptom of a vascular lesion or VS, and VS classically presents with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with or without tinnitus. The burden of VS is characterized by an annual incidence of about 1 case per 100,000 in the United States, representing 5% to 10% of intracranial tumors in adults, and in patients with VS, tinnitus is unilateral in 95% of cases. Despite this association, only 2% of patients with asymmetric or unilateral SNHL and tinnitus will actually have VS.

Tinnitus — general examination approach specifies core components and associated comorbidity assessment. A routine examination of the head and neck, including careful otoscopy, is the focus of such an examination, and a focused neurologic examination should exclude motor and/or sensory deficits as well as cranial nerve issues that may accompany central nervous system lesions. When pulsatile tinnitus is reported, the examination should focus on identification of cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions, and a full head and neck examination, a general cardiovascular examination, and auscultation/palpation of the head and neck, the skull and mastoid prominences, and orbits should be part of this evaluation. The examination may find treatable otologic conditions that cause tinnitus; cerumen impaction or other ear canal obstructions are diagnosed with otoscopy. Tinnitus can occur in patients with middle ear disease, with or without resultant conductive hearing loss, such as that caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction, otitis media, or otosclerosis, and disorders of the cochlear or vestibular apparatus, such as Ménière's disease (endolymphatic hydrops) and superior canal dehiscence, can cause tinnitus. Vestibular schwannoma can cause tinnitus as well, and tinnitus can occur with medical conditions not directly associated with the ear, including vascular tumors, palatal/middle ear myoclonus, intracranial hypertension, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Emotional distress and/or disturbance of sleep are often associated with severe tinnitus, and the initial history and physical examination should also include assessment of possible associated emotional disturbance or psychiatric illness, which is crucial for patients who may be severely depressed.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^114CEAaL]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — etiologies, noise exposure effects, and neuroimaging are described: Tinnitus can arise from infections (bacterial, viral, fungal), autoimmune hearing loss, Meniere's disease, endolymphatic hydrops; neoplasms (vestibular schwannoma or cholesteatoma); head or neck trauma/injury; genetic predisposition; ototoxicity from medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, valproate, cisplatin, loop diuretics, or heavy metals such as lead; and from cardiovascular conditions (hypertension, arteriosclerosis, cerebral aneurysm, cerebrovascular accident), metabolic conditions (anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus), and musculoskeletal abnormalities such as temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Acute tinnitus immediately after exposure to loud sounds — such as gunfire, explosions, or very loud music — results from mechanical damage to stereocilia on the tops of hair cells within the cochlea, and repeated exposures without the proper use of protective devices (e.g., earplugs, earmuffs) can cause permanent damage to cochlear structures or permanent hearing loss that can contribute to the onset and persistence of chronic tinnitus. Imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron-emission tomography have demonstrated that the perception of chronic tinnitus usually occurs as a result of abnormal hyperactivity within central auditory areas of the human brain, especially the auditory cortex.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1124MY8y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 7 — physical examination in the tinnitus patient outlines examination targets and related actions. Rarely, tinnitus can be heard by the clinician as well as the patient, and objective tinnitus may be caused by identifiable disease, such as vascular abnormalities and myoclonus. Cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions may cause tinnitus, and cardiovascular disease can have morbidities more substantial than tinnitus and requires appropriate evaluation and treatment. Tinnitus patients should undergo neurologic assessment, and any focal neurologic deficits will dictate additional evaluation and treatment with referral to appropriate specialists and workup that may include imaging of the central nervous system. Otorrhea indicates possible middle ear infection or otitis externa, and treatment of otitis media/externa may improve tinnitus as well as associated hearing difficulties. Simple external or middle ear problems such as cerumen impaction or otitis media can be detected by otoscopy, and uncommon middle ear disorders (eg, cholesteatoma, glomus tumors) can be identified, prompting appropriate referral and imaging when indicated. A head and neck mass associated with ipsilateral tinnitus requires prompt investigation, with referral to appropriate specialists and imaging when indicated.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114DRvgj]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Clinical diagnostic challenges and symptom profile — because symptoms are often nonspecific, diagnosis is challenging; in a statewide study, 31% of patients were seen in the emergency department for possible related symptoms in the 14 days preceding diagnosis. Evaluation for suspected cervical artery dissection should include a detailed symptom history, questions about minor trauma, and a detailed neurological examination. Common initial symptoms include facial pain, headache (< 65%), and neck pain (≈50%), and isolated pain without cerebral ischemia occurs in 8% to 12% of diagnosed cases. In carotid dissection, pain may be associated with a (partial) Horner syndrome (≈25%) and cranial nerve palsies (≈12%), and both carotid and vertebral dissection can be associated with pulsatile tinnitus (≈8%). A partial Horner syndrome with new or worsening headache may suggest a carotid dissection diagnosis, and headache characteristics are not specific but can rarely be acute and of thunderclap nature.

Appendix B: Routine care — initial evaluation and characterization — Patients who report tinnitus during a clinical evaluation should be asked additional questions regarding initial onset, frequency of occurrence, duration, and laterality, and in some cases such as unilateral or pulsatile tinnitus, the patient should be referred for a medical workup. The provider must also determine whether the patient is bothered by their tinnitus and the extent to which it interferes with daily activities or quality of life (QoL), and when such problems are reported the patient is characterized as having bothersome tinnitus and might need additional evaluation to facilitate appropriate recommendations and referrals.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112dPPGu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

VA/DoD Tinnitus CPG — Module A initial evaluation algorithm begins when an "Adult patient presents with complaint of or is seeking care for tinnitus", after which the "Health care provider completes history and physical examination (see Sidebar 1)". The next decision is "Does the patient have sounds in their ear or ears or their head that last for at least five minutes?"; if "No", classify as "Transient ear noise; no need for further evaluation". If "Yes", assess "Any red flags identified? (see Sidebar 2)". When red flags are present, "Refer patient for appropriate specialty urgent/emergent evaluation (see Sidebar 2)", then confirm "Have red flags been addressed?"; if "Yes", "Refer to audiology as appropriate for evaluation of hearing and tinnitus impact", and if "No", proceed with "Patient referred to appropriate care until red flags resolved". If no red flags are identified, "Refer to audiology as appropriate for evaluation of hearing and tinnitus impact", with the footnote that "If the patient has already been referred to audiology and does not indicate a need for care, then referral to audiology is unnecessary".

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^116UHnpQ]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Headache and pulsatile tinnitus in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are common; significant headache was reported in 67.5% of patients, with migraines the most frequent type (38% of patients in the US Registry; 28% in ARCADIA), and pulsatile tinnitus was reported as a presenting symptom in 32% of patients. For migraine in FMD, management may include lifestyle modification, preventive therapies, and abortive medications, but particular caution is advised in prescribing triptans, ergots, and other vasoconstrictive agents, especially in those with prior cervical artery dissection (CeAD) or SCAD in whom these agents may be contraindicated; consultation with audiology and otolaryngology may help evaluate hearing and other causes of pulsatile tinnitus.
