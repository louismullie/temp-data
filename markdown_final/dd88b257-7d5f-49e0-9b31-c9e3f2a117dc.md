## Question

What should I know about bacterial vaginosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what they should know about bacterial vaginosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and prevalence ranges. Next, I will confirm diagnostic standards and reconcile Amsel versus Nugent and molecular tests. After that, I need to review first-line treatment and single-dose options. I will then examine recurrence data and contributors, followed by pregnancy-specific guidance. Next, I should assess partner management strategies. I will also review complications and sequelae, consider emerging therapies and biofilm paradigms, and finally integrate these into a practical clinical decision framework with follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core pathophysiology. Bacterial vaginosis is best characterized as a vaginal dysbiosis with a shift from Lactobacillus-dominant flora to diverse anaerobes rather than a single-pathogen infection, commonly involving Gardnerella, Prevotella, Atopobium, and others, leading to malodorous discharge and elevated vaginal pH, which aligns with contemporary microbiome understanding and prior clinical summaries [^112iwPBi] [^111aLKtC].

> I need to verify the epidemiology without overgeneralizing. Prevalence varies widely based on population and diagnostic criteria, typically cited between 15% and 50% among reproductive-age women, and it is a leading cause of symptomatic vaginal discharge, which is consistent across high-quality reviews and trial cohorts, so I should be cautious to state ranges rather than a single point estimate [^1146PqoV] [^111aLKtC].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic criteria precisely. Clinically, Amsel criteria remain validated and endorsed, while Gram stain with Nugent scoring is the laboratory standard; molecular diagnostics are increasingly used but complement, rather than replace, these standards in most practices [^116ecoQF] [^111hK5ws] [^112iwPBi]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the Nugent threshold for "diagnosis" in all contexts was ≥ 7; that is correct for defining BV on Gram stain in research and many labs, with 0–3 normal, 4–6 intermediate, and 7–10 BV, but I should double-check FDA trial inclusion where some studies defined eligibility as Nugent ≥ 4 alongside clinical features, which reflects trial entry criteria rather than redefining the BV gold standard, so I must correct that conflation here [^112iwPBi] [^113VnMeJ] [^1151SPZz].

> Next, I should review first-line treatment regimens and confirm parity of options. Standard therapy includes oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, intravaginal metronidazole 0.75% gel daily for 5–7 days, or clindamycin 2% cream nightly for 7 days; guideline concordance is strong, and selection should be individualized by adherence likelihood, side effects, and patient preference, with single-dose options such as secnidazole 2 g PO and single-dose intravaginal agents expanding adherence-friendly choices [^116ecoQF] [^112MoFA8] [^116LmS3w] [^113VnMeJ] [^1151SPZz] [^115SVHdb] [^117Xmr7W].

> I will now examine the critical issue of recurrence, since that is often the clinical pain point. Recurrence remains common, with about 30–50% recurring by 3–6 months and up to ~50–70% by 6–12 months depending on population and criteria; host, behavioral, and microbiologic drivers are implicated, including persistence of Gardnerella and Prevotella signatures post-therapy, failure to re-establish Lactobacillus, and possible contribution of partner-associated exchange of BV-associated bacteria, so I need to counsel patients realistically about this risk and plan proactive mitigation where appropriate [^111aLKtC] [^112xu3YB] [^111hK5ws] [^111nhBpc] [^1125B53B] [^111wBKTy] [^113LgHuK] [^116zQFCV].

> Let me think about pregnancy-specific management carefully. I should confirm that symptomatic pregnant patients warrant testing and treatment for symptom relief, whereas routine screening and treatment to prevent adverse outcomes is not recommended for the general pregnant population without risk factors; when treatment is indicated, oral metronidazole or oral clindamycin are preferred, and evidence for preventing preterm birth is mixed overall with possible benefit only in selected higher-risk settings or earlier treatment windows, so individualized risk assessment is key [^1118uXGb] [^113N2LYx] [^11187FjD] [^114pLHUK] [^1145wKx4] [^111Y9niF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about partner treatment. I almost recommended treating male partners routinely to reduce reinfection risk, but I should confirm guideline positions and trial results; high-quality guidelines advise against routine treatment of male partners, and the best-designed RCT showed no overall reduction in female recurrence, although adherence-sensitive post hoc signals suggest nuances that do not overturn the no-routine-treatment recommendation, while female partners with BV should be treated based on their own diagnosis [^114Dz9ZQ] [^116ecoQF] [^112CQfWe] [^113ZE7fJ].

> Next, I should review complications and sequelae to ensure patients are adequately counseled. BV is associated with increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes such as chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, postoperative infections, and associations with preterm birth in observational data, as well as increased acquisition of HIV and other STIs, highlighting that BV carries implications beyond nuisance symptoms and warrants thorough evaluation for co-infections when appropriate [^111aLKtC] [^112iwPBi] [^114gb27d].

> I need to check emerging strategies aimed at recurrence reduction. Probiotic L. crispatus CTV-05 (Lactin-V) reduced recurrence versus placebo post-metronidazole in a rigorously conducted trial, supporting microbiome restoration as an adjunct strategy, and the biofilm paradigm is driving development of antibiofilm agents, although most data remain preclinical; meanwhile, pragmatic choices like single-dose nitroimidazoles or clindamycin per WHO can help with adherence when multidose regimens are challenging [^1146PqoV] [^112fqYRd] [^111HNDm7] [^114n4Gn7].

> Let me consider evidence-informed options for recurrent BV specifically. Suppressive intravaginal metronidazole gel twice weekly after an induction course reduces recurrences, albeit with increased candidiasis risk that should be anticipated and managed, and longer initial metronidazole courses improve short-term cure without sustained benefit unless maintenance strategies are used; guidelines also allow recurrent intravaginal metronidazole as a reasonable option, and adjunctive probiotic strategies may further reduce recurrence risk in appropriate candidates [^114xe75Z] [^116XWrAk] [^112B4ctM] [^1146PqoV].

> I should double-check a practical clinical framework to tie this together. Diagnose with Amsel or Nugent as available, consider NAAT panels where accessible, treat with any first-line regimen per CDC, SOGC, or IUSTI/WHO guidance, and tailor to adherence and preferences; in pregnancy, treat symptomatic patients and avoid routine screening unless at increased risk for preterm birth; do not routinely treat male partners; for recurrent disease, consider induction plus suppressive metronidazole gel, discuss probiotic options like Lactin-V when accessible, and arrange follow-up with objective reassessment if symptoms recur rather than repeated empiric antibiotic courses [^116ecoQF] [^111hK5ws] [^116LmS3w] [^113N2LYx] [^115AVAen] [^1146PqoV].

> But wait, what if diagnostic uncertainty persists or mixed vaginitis is possible? I should confirm exclusion of candidiasis and trichomoniasis, use microscopy or molecular panels when feasible, and remember that persistent or recurrent symptoms warrant repeat objective testing rather than assumption of BV alone, given the overlap in presentations and the risks of unnecessary antibiotics that can worsen dysbiosis and candidiasis [^116ecoQF] [^114gb27d] [^1156TcnZ].

> Final synthesis: BV is a polymicrobial dysbiosis diagnosed clinically or by Gram stain scoring, treated effectively by several equivalent antibiotic options, with recurrence driven by biofilm biology, microbial persistence, and behavioral factors; individualized plans that incorporate adherence-friendly regimens, suppressive strategies for recurrences, pregnancy-specific risk stratification, and avoidance of routine male partner treatment align with current evidence and guidelines, while emerging microbiome restoration and antibiofilm approaches offer promising adjuncts to improve sustained cure [^112iwPBi] [^116ecoQF] [^112MoFA8] [^114Dz9ZQ] [^1146PqoV] [^112fqYRd] [^111HNDm7].

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial vaginal dysbiosis with **high recurrence** and **biofilm persistence** that complicate management. Diagnosis relies on **Amsel or Nugent criteria**, with molecular tests as adjuncts [^111hK5ws] [^112iwPBi]. First-line treatment is **metronidazole or clindamycin**, but recurrence is common; suppressive metronidazole gel or probiotics (e.g. Lactin-V) can reduce recurrence [^116ecoQF] [^114xe75Z] [^1146PqoV]. BV increases risk of HIV/STIs and adverse pregnancy outcomes, so treat symptomatic pregnant women and consider screening high-risk pregnancies [^113N2LYx] [^1118uXGb]. Partner treatment is **not routinely recommended**, but consistent condom use and avoiding douching may help prevent recurrence [^114Dz9ZQ] [^112xu3YB].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

BV is characterized by a **shift from Lactobacillus dominance to anaerobes** such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and Mobiluncus spp [^111aLKtC]. Biofilm formation, especially by Gardnerella, protects bacteria from antibiotics and the immune system, contributing to persistence and recurrence [^117Ft2sr]. Sexual activity, multiple partners, and douching are associated with BV; however, it is not classified as an STI [^111aLKtC].

---

## Clinical presentation

BV often presents with **thin, grayish-white, malodorous discharge** and vaginal irritation, itching, or burning [^111aLKtC]. Many women are asymptomatic, which complicates diagnosis and management [^111aLKtC].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on the **Amsel clinical criteria** or the **Nugent score** [^111hK5ws]. Amsel criteria require **three of four findings**: homogeneous discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, positive whiff test, and clue cells on microscopy [^111hK5ws]. Nugent scoring uses Gram-stained smears to assess bacterial morphotypes [^111hK5ws]. Molecular diagnostics, including NAATs, are increasingly used to improve accuracy [^112iwPBi].

---

## Treatment

First-line treatments include **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days**, metronidazole gel 0.75% intravaginally once daily for 5 days, or clindamycin cream 2% intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days [^116ecoQF]. Alternative regimens include clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, clindamycin ovules 100 mg intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days, secnidazole 2 g orally as a single dose, or tinidazole 2 g orally once daily for 2 days [^114fsSas].

---

## Recurrence and management

BV recurrence is common, with rates up to 50% within 6 months [^112xu3YB]. Factors contributing to recurrence include **biofilm persistence**, reinfection from untreated partners, and failure to restore Lactobacillus dominance [^112xu3YB]. Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel significantly reduces recurrence [^114xe75Z]. Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus crispatus (Lactin-V), have shown promise in preventing recurrence [^1146PqoV].

---

## Complications

BV is associated with **increased risk of HIV and other STIs**, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, miscarriage, and postpartum endometritis [^111aLKtC]. Treatment of symptomatic pregnant women is recommended to prevent adverse outcomes.

---

## Prevention

Prevention strategies include **consistent condom use**, avoiding douching, and maintaining a healthy vaginal microbiome. Partner treatment is not routinely recommended but may be considered for recurrent cases.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include antibiofilm agents, probiotics, and **vaginal microbiome transplantation** [^113Sasc2]. These approaches aim to disrupt biofilms, restore Lactobacillus dominance, and reduce recurrence [^1114nKdN].

---

Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal dysbiosis with significant health implications. Effective management requires **accurate diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and strategies to prevent recurrence**.

### High recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis over the course of 12 months after oral metronidazole therapy and factors associated with recurrence [^112xu3YB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine the recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis (BV) after treatment over a 12-month period and to identify factors associated with recurrence.

- **Methods**: Women with symptomatic BV, defined by a Nugent score (NS) of 7–10 or an NS of 4–6 with ≥ 3 Amsel criteria, were enrolled. BV was treated with 400 mg of oral metronidazole administered twice daily for seven days. Participants filled out a questionnaire, and vaginal swabs were collected at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The study endpoint was an NS of 7–10.

- **Results**: A total of 121 (87%) women with an NS of 7–10 and 18 (13%) with an NS of 4–6 combined with ≥ 3 Amsel criteria were enrolled. Of these, 130 (94%) returned at least one vaginal sample. Sixty-eight women (58% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 49%-66%]) experienced a recurrence of BV (NS 7–10), while 84 (69% [95% CI, 61%-77%]) had a recurrence of abnormal vaginal flora (NS 4–10) by 12 months. Recurrence of BV and abnormal vaginal flora was significantly associated with a past history of BV, having a regular sex partner throughout the study, and having female sex partners according to multivariate analysis. The use of hormonal contraception was negatively associated with recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: The recommended treatment did not prevent the recurrence of BV or abnormal vaginal flora in the majority of women. Identified factors associated with recurrence suggest a possible role for sexual transmission in the pathogenesis of recurrent BV.

### Suppressive antibacterial therapy with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114xe75Z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of suppressive vaginal metronidazole in reducing symptomatic episodes of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Study design**: This multicenter prospective study involved an initial 10-day open-label metronidazole gel course. Asymptomatic responders were randomly assigned to receive either twice-weekly metronidazole vaginal gel or a placebo for 16 weeks, followed by 12 weeks off therapy.

- **Results**: Of the 157 eligible women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis, 112 out of 127 returning evaluable women (88.2%) responded clinically and were randomly assigned. During suppressive therapy, recurrent bacterial vaginosis occurred in 13 women (25.5%) receiving metronidazole and 26 women (59.1%) receiving placebo (MITT analysis, relative risk [RR] 0.43, CI = 0.25–0.73, P = .001). Over the entire 28-week follow-up, recurrence occurred in 26 women (51.0%) on treatment compared with 33 women (75%) on placebo (RR 0.68, CI = 0.49–0.93, P = .02). The probability of remaining cured was 70% for metronidazole compared with 39% for placebo, declining to 34% and 18%, respectively, by 28 weeks follow-up. Adverse effects were uncommon; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis occurred significantly more often in metronidazole-treated women (P = .02).

- **Conclusion**: Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel significantly reduces the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis is a common occurrence.

### State of the art for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^112iwPBi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among reproductive-age women. It is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, including an increased risk of acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in addition to adverse birth outcomes. While it is known that BV is a vaginal dysbiosis characterized by a shift in the vaginal microbiota from protective Lactobacillus species to an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria, its exact etiology remains unknown.

The purpose of this minireview is to provide an updated overview of the range of tests currently used for the diagnosis of BV in both clinical and research settings. This article is divided into two primary sections:

- **Traditional BV diagnostics**:
	- This section discusses the conventional methods used for diagnosing BV.

- **Molecular diagnostics**:
	- Molecular diagnostic assays, particularly 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are specifically highlighted, in addition to multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), given their increasing use in clinical practice. These methods are applicable to both NAATs in clinical settings and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and FISH in research studies regarding the vaginal microbiota and BV pathogenesis.

We also provide a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of BV diagnostic tests and discuss future challenges in this field of research.

### Randomized trial of Lactin-V to prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis [^1146PqoV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis affects 15 to 50% of women of reproductive age, and recurrence is common after treatment with an antibiotic agent. The high incidence of recurrence suggests the need for new treatments to prevent recurrence.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial to evaluate the ability of Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 (Lactin-V) to prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. Women 18 to 45 years of age who had received a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and who had completed a course of vaginal metronidazole gel as part of the eligibility requirements were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive vaginally administered Lactin-V or placebo for 11 weeks; follow-up occurred through week 24. The primary outcome was the percentage of women who had a recurrence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12.

- **Results**: A total of 228 women underwent randomization: 152 to the Lactin-V group and 76 to the placebo group; of these participants, 88% in the Lactin-V group and 84% in the placebo group could be evaluated for the primary outcome. In the intention-to-treat population, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12 occurred in 46 participants (30%) in the Lactin-V group and in 34 participants (45%) in the placebo group (risk ratio after multiple imputation for missing responses, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.87; P = 0.01). The risk ratio for recurrence by week 24 (also calculated with multiple imputation for missing responses) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.92).

Regarding the medical management of bacterial vaginosis, specifically concerning the management of sexual partners, the IUSTI/WHO 2018 guidelines recommend that treatment should not be offered to male sexual partners of patients diagnosed with BV. However, treatment should be offered to female partners if they also have BV.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, characterized by a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, along with a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113yDc2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal condition, affecting 30% of women globally. BV is associated with an increased risk of a broad range of gynaecological and obstetric sequelae, including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss in IVF, and HIV/STI acquisition and transmission. Although up to half of BV-affected women do not experience symptoms, for those who do, the symptoms, including malodour and vaginal discharge, cause significant distress and impact their quality of life and relationships.

Evidence indicates that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome characterized by a shift in the composition of the vaginal microbiota from 'optimal' to 'non-optimal' This non-optimal microbiological state involves a reduction in protective lactobacilli, and an increase in bacterial diversity and facultative and strict anaerobes, including Gardnerella spp. Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and others, referred to as BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). While the exact pathogens responsible for BV are still debated, a recent conceptual model hypothesized that virulent strains of Gardnerella, as well as Prevotella bivia and A. vaginae, play a central role.

### Solosec [^113VnMeJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) with similar designs were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Solosec 2 gram for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence of all the following: (a) off-white (milky or gray), thin, homogeneous vaginal discharge; (b) a vaginal pH ≥ 4.7; (c) Clue cells ≥ 20% of the total epithelial cells on a microscopic examination of the vaginal saline wet mount; (d) a positive "whiff" test (detection of amine odor upon adding 10% KOH solution to a sample of the vaginal discharge); and (e) a Nugent score ≥ 4.

- **Trial 1 details**: Enrolled 144 non-pregnant female patients aged 19 to 54 years.
- **Trial 2 details**: Enrolled 189 non-pregnant females aged 18 to 54 years. Black or African American subjects represented 54% in both trials.

Efficacy was assessed by clinical outcomes evaluated 21 to 30 days following a single dose of Solosec. A clinical responder was defined as having "normal" vaginal discharge, a negative "whiff" test, and Clue cells < 20%. Additional endpoints included Nugent score cure (Nugent score of 0–3) and therapeutic outcome. A therapeutic responder was defined as a clinical responder with a Nugent score cure. In Trial 2, the endpoints were also assessed on Day 7–14.

- **Results**: In both trials, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients experienced clinical response, Nugent score cure, and therapeutic response at 21 to 30 days following a single dose of Solosec compared to a placebo. Test results were statistically significant for the endpoints evaluated.

### Treatment of male sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112CQfWe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine if the treatment of male sexual partners of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) using oral metronidazole twice a day for 7 days (i.e. multidose metronidazole) significantly decreased BV recurrence rates in females.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Women with recurrent BV and a diagnosis by Amsel and Nugent criteria were enrolled. Multidose metronidazole for 7 days was dispensed to the women. Male partners were randomized to receive either placebo or multidose metronidazole for 7 days and were asked to refrain from unprotected sex for 14 days. Female follow-up visits were conducted on day 21 and at 8 and 16 weeks. Male follow-up visits occurred between days 14–21. BV cure was defined as meeting 0–2 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 0–6 in the female partner, with the primary endpoint at 16 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 214 couples were enrolled. In the intent-to-treat population, there was no significant difference between treatment arms for the primary outcome. BV treatment failure occurred in 81% and 80% of women in the metronidazole and placebo arms through the third follow-up visit, respectively (P > .999). However, women whose male partners adhered to the study medication were less likely to experience treatment failure (adjusted relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.99; p = 0.035). This finding persisted in post hoc comparisons in the metronidazole arm.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, the study did not find that treating male partners with multidose metronidazole significantly reduces BV recurrence in female partners, though women whose partners adhered to the multidose metronidazole regimen showed reduced treatment failure.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116Ac4vJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recommended first-line antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole or clindamycin, provide broad anaerobic coverage and are administered orally or intravaginally. These regimens have similar efficacy and cure approximately 70–85% of women with BV within 1 month; however, more than 50% experience recurrence of symptoms and/or BV on microscopy within 6 months.

The low rate of sustained cure highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence. This issue compounds women's distress and frustration, leading to repeated presentations to health services or the adoption of unproven home remedies. Factors, including persistence of a BV-associated biofilm, failure to recolonize the vagina with lactobacilli, reinfection from an untreated partner, and host genetic and/or immune factors, may all play a role in recurrence.

Frustratingly for both clinicians and patients, the contribution of reinfection and vaginal relapse cannot be separated, as the clinical presentation of both mechanisms of recurrence is identical. Point-of-care laboratory tests cannot resolve this issue yet, and molecular methods, including next-generation sequencing, are unable to identify a unique or specific microbial signature to separate the two routes of recurrence.

While persistence or resistance of BVAB or BV biofilm following antibiotic therapy is likely to be the dominant mechanism among some women, there is a robust body of evidence to support the exchange of both optimal and detrimental bacteria between partners during sexual activity. These data suggest that reinfection of women with patho…

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^111Y9niF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes, particularly preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (May 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trials and extracted data independently. We contacted study authors for additional information.

- **Main results**: We included fifteen trials of good quality, involving 5888 women. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.20; 10 trials, 4357 women). Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (Peto OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 15 trials, 5888 women) or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) (Peto OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.28; four trials, 2579 women). However, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation may reduce the risk of preterm birth less than 37 weeks (Peto OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.84; five trials, 2387 women).

### A randomized trial of the duration of therapy with metronidazole plus or minus azithromycin for treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis [^116XWrAk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginitis worldwide. Currently recommended treatments have poor efficacy and are associated with high rates of BV recurrence. We examined whether a longer duration of treatment with metronidazole or combination therapy with metronidazole and azithromycin would enhance the cure rates for BV. In addition, we examined factors other than drug therapy associated with cure.

- **Methods**: Women with symptomatic BV (defined by a modified Amsel criteria) were enrolled in a 4-arm study that compared metronidazole for 7 days versus 14 days, plus or minus azithromycin on days 1 and 3. Data regarding interim behaviors were also obtained, as were vaginal specimens for Gram staining.

- **Results**: At the first follow-up visit (7 days after the completion of therapy), there was a significant difference in cure rates among patients who received 7 days of metronidazole therapy, compared with those who received 14 days of therapy, combined across azithromycin therapy (P = .0003). There was no effect associated with azithromycin therapy. There were no differences in cure rates between any of the treatment groups at 21 days after completion of therapy. Abstinence or protected sex, refraining from douching, and a lower baseline Nugent score for the vaginal Gram stain were all significantly associated with cure.

- **Conclusions**: Cure rates for BV were significantly improved by 14 days of metronidazole treatment (compared with 7 days of treatment), but the effects were not sustained, suggesting that relapse or reinfection occurred.

### Treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis with tinidazole [^111CnSQY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent bacterial vaginosis is a difficult clinical condition. In women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis, relapses are common, even after prolonged courses of maintenance therapy. Because of its spectrum of activity, tinidazole was used in a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.

- **Case**: A 23-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives had a single sexual partner. She was treated for recurrent bacterial vaginosis with multiple courses of metronidazole gel 0.75%, including regimens of maintenance therapy. The patient experienced repeated recurrences shortly after stopping treatment. A single course of oral tinidazole resulted in a prolonged period where she was free of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment options for recurrent bacterial vaginosis are currently limited. Tinidazole may be a useful option in women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114gb27d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole Vaginal Gel is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).

- **Note**: For the purpose of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that: (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include: (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absence or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113Sasc2]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Ultimately, however, the pathogenesis of BV recurrence is complex, with reinfection likely to be important but not the sole driver of recurrence (Fig. 1). In some women, vaginal relapse, i.e. the re-emergence or persistence of BVAB, may be the dominant mechanism. There has been considerable focus recently on new therapeutic approaches aimed at biofilm eradication, thereby removing the protected sanctuary containing bacterial pathogens and potentially eliminating a mechanism of BVAB persistence, and some are included as alternative treatments in guidelines.

Similarly, evidence of antimicrobial resistance is reported; however, its contribution to recurrence is unclear, and new antimicrobial drug classes have not been forthcoming. The development of new molecular assays, which diagnose BV based on the specific pathogenic bacterial strains or the presence of antimicrobial resistance, may ultimately result in more precise and targeted therapies to improve cure.

Given the failure of therapeutic solutions, the approach of partner treatment to prevent reinfection is justified. However, it is apparent to clinicians and researchers that a combination of strategies is likely to be required to achieve sustained cure and support the restoration of vaginal microbiota associated with optimal sexual and reproductive health. This may involve the combined use, for example, of agents to disrupt BV biofilm, more effective delivery of antibiotics, partner treatment, vaginal microbiome transplantation from 'healthy' donors with a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota, and the use of more promising therapies.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111nhBpc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a secondary analysis of vaginal microbiota data and accompanying clinical and behavioral data collected from women who participated in three clinical trials conducted at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), Australia, that evaluated new interventions for improving BV cure. The trials included were Strategies to prevent BV (SToPBV), StepUp-1, and StepUp-2. The parent trials have been described elsewhere. In brief, SToPBV was an open-label, randomized controlled trial of combined oral contraceptive pill use following first-line antibiotic treatment to prevent BV recurrence. StepUp-1 and StepUp-2 were open-label, single-arm pilot studies that assessed the acceptability and tolerability of male partner treatment for BV and its impact on the genital microbiota of couples. The Supplementary Material details the interventions assessed in the parent studies.

Across the three studies, women presenting to MSHC were eligible to participate if they were diagnosed with BV, defined as having ≥ 3 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score (NS) of 4–10, and received first-line treatment. This involved oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for seven days, or if contraindicated, clindamycin 2% vaginal cream applied intravaginally nocte for seven nights or metronidazole 0.75% gel applied intravaginally nocte for five nights. Additional study-specific eligibility criteria were applied. Notably, women were eligible for SToPBV if they were not currently using hormonal contraception and had no combined oral contraceptive pill–related contraindications. Women were eligible for the StepUp studies based on different criteria.

### Treatment considerations for bacterial vaginosis and the risk of recurrence [^1117pJbh]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) have similar efficacy; thus, the choice of treatment should consider additional factors such as the risk of BV recurrence and the side effect profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate BV recurrence rates and rates of acquiring vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) after different BV treatments in a commercially insured population.

- **Methods**: Private administrative insurance claims from 2004 to 2006 were used. Study subjects were continuously enrolled females 12–50 years of age who filled prescriptions for BV treatment (n = 32,268). The four BV treatments (single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%), multiple-dose clindamycin vaginal regimens, vaginal metronidazole, and oral metronidazole) were compared for rates of BV recurrence (reBV) and VVC after treatment using multivariate analyses. Covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Overall, the rate of BV recurrence (2.7%) and VVC post-treatment (2.9%) were low. Women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) showed no significant difference from women treated with oral metronidazole in the likelihood of BV recurrence. However, women who received other vaginal treatments were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared with women who received oral metronidazole (p < 0.01). Moreover, women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) and vaginal metronidazole were significantly less likely to have VVC compared with those treated with oral metronidazole (p < 0.01).

### Treatment of bacterial vaginosis before 28 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the incidence of preterm labor [^114H3Y9u]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the benefits of treating bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy to reduce the incidence of preterm labor (PTL).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether treatment of BV with vaginal clindamycin or oral metronidazole before 28 weeks of pregnancy reduces PTL incidence.

- **Search strategy**: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL, and SciELO databases were searched until December 30, 2017. Search terms included "bacterial vaginosis" and "preterm labor". No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials that evaluated treatment of BV with clindamycin or metronidazole to reduce PTL incidence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The risk of PTL was evaluated by the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous data from each study were combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel model.

- **Main results**: Nine reports were included in the systematic review, with eight reports included in the meta-analysis. No reduction in the incidence of PTL was found for either metronidazole (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71–1.25) or clindamycin (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75–1.36).

- **Conclusions**: Use of oral metronidazole or vaginal clindamycin to treat BV before 28 weeks of pregnancy did not reduce the incidence of PTL. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018086173.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113ZE7fJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

There are additional challenges when recruiting couples to male-partner treatment trials. Women are often reluctant to disclose their symptoms to men and may require educational material and support to increase their confidence in discussing their bacterial vaginosis (BV) and the associated morbidities with their partner. Motivating male partners to participate is also complicated by the fact that most men do not experience symptoms themselves.

Notably, men participating in partner treatment trials have reported BV to have little impact on themselves beyond their concerns for their partner's health, self-esteem, and confidence. Interestingly, some men identified that the diagnosis of BV in their female partner led to improved communication within the partnership about sex and sexual health. Accepting partner treatment showed they were committed to the relationship and could be a supportive partner. Further research to identify the factors that may motivate male participants to participate in BV treatment trials is required.

Fundamentally, we still do not know what the most appropriate and effective antibiotic agents are to use in male partners. Nearly all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate partner treatment used oral metronidazole. Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic with broad activity against anaerobic bacteria, achieves 1-month cure rates of over 80% among women. Less than 1% of anaerobic bacteria isolated from women pre-treated with a 5-day intravaginal metronidazole regimen demonstrated resistance.

### Vaginitis: Diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing.

- **Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis**: Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain.

- **Treatment of bacterial vaginosis**: Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin.

- **Diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis**: The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy. DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida.

- **Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis**: Treatment involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification tests for.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^112uReir]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a neglected and poorly treated condition with a significant burden for women worldwide. In Australia, a BV prevalence of 12% was reported, compared to 30% in North America and over 50% in southern and eastern Africa. Most affected are women of reproductive age.

BV is a polymicrobial condition with a complex pathophysiology, where the native vaginal microbiome, mainly Lactobacillus species, is disrupted by increased numbers of Gardnerella species, such as G. vaginalis and G. swidsinskii/leopoldi. These species grow together in biofilms with Prevotella species, such as P. bivia. Significant adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes are associated with BV, such as miscarriage, preterm labor, preterm rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

BV treatment has changed very little since metronidazole was first introduced 40 years ago. Due to teratogenic concerns with metronidazole during that time, clindamycin was added as an alternative in the late 1980s. Standard-of-care treatment with one of these antibiotics can achieve an initial cure rate between 80% and 90%. However, more than half of all patients experienced recurrence within 6 months, and up to 80% within 9 months of treatment. With the general increase in antimicrobial resistance, repeated use of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent BV is clearly unsustainable.

Several factors are believed to play a role in the high recurrence rates, such as ineffective penetration of these antibiotics.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^1145wKx4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes, particularly preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2004).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed trials and extracted data independently. We contacted study authors for additional information.

- **Main results**: Thirteen trials involving 5300 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.24, nine trials of 3895 women). Treatment was not significant in reducing the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03, thirteen trials of 5300 women, and there was significant heterogeneity between trials, p-value 0.002), preterm birth before 34 weeks (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.19, five trials of 851 women), and preterm birth before 32 weeks (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.70, four trials of 3565 women).

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116zQFCV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal condition that affects approximately 30% of reproductive-aged women globally. While the etiology of BV has not been established, the vaginal microbiota of women with BV is typically deficient in optimal Lactobacillus spp (e.g. Lactobacillus crispatus), with high diversity and high abundance of anaerobes. Recommended treatment for BV involves antibiotic therapy with metronidazole or clindamycin, both of which provide broad coverage of anaerobes. One-month cure post-treatment is approximately 70%–85%; however, up to 50% of women experience BV recurrence within 12 weeks following antibiotics. BV recurrences are distressing for women and result in repeat presentations to clinical services and repeated antibiotic use. Furthermore, the sequelae associated with BV carry significant implications for a woman's reproductive and sexual health and impose a large economic burden.

There has been little progress made toward improving long-term BV cure, partly because the mechanisms driving BV recurrence are multifactorial and incompletely understood. Prior studies exploring the association between microbial signatures of the vaginal microbiota (i.e. diversity metrics, community types, and individual taxa) and BV treatment outcomes have produced mixed results regarding the contribution of bacterial diversity to treatment failure. Interestingly, a number of studies have reported a positive association between BV recurrence and high relative and absolute abundance of Gardnerella (or individual Gardnerella spp) pretreatment.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^117P7t9y]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Therapeutic agents were classified into seven groups based on their mechanisms of action. Antibiotics were investigated in approximately a quarter of the publications (n = 9). Enzymes (n = 8), cationic peptides (n = 7), probiotics (n = 7), antiseptics (n = 5), and surfactants or their components (n = 2) were also frequently investigated as potential anti-BV biofilm treatments. Most studies (n = 28, 80%) investigated treatment efficacy, while the remaining 20% (n = 7) additionally evaluated safety.

Given the lack of standardization in measuring efficacy outcomes, these were broadly grouped into five categories: biofilm cell viability (n = 20), biofilm biomass (n = 15), direct growth inhibition (n = 14), biofilm morphology (n = 6), and molecular quantification (n = 3). Safety was measured in only seven studies, and measures of safety were grouped into three mutually exclusive categories: vaginal epithelial cell changes (n = 4), tolerance of lactobacilli to therapeutics (n = 2), and adverse events and tolerability (human studies, n = 1).

Findings, including specific agents within each therapeutic class, are summarized in further detail. Seven preclinical studies investigated the effect of antibiotics on preformed in vitro biofilms: amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, subtilisin A, and tobramycin. Earlier studies reported significant efficacy of two antibiotics against preformed single-species G. vaginalis biofilms, including complete biofilm eradication with clindamycin and a two-log reduction or complete biofilm eradication.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111wBKTy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We explored the relationship between bacterial vaginosis (BV) recurrence and the ratio of nonoptimal to optimal bacteria present in the vaginal microbiota both before and immediately after treatment. Pretreatment, the ratios of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) to Lactobacillus and Gardnerella to L. iners were not associated with BV recurrence. However, immediately posttreatment, higher levels of total BVAB relative to Lactobacillus spp. and higher levels of Gardnerella relative to L. iners were both linked to increased odds of BV recurrence (AOR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.81], P = .017 and AOR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.09–1.95], P = .012). The ratio of pathobionts to Lactobacillus was not associated with recurrence at either timepoint.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^114Cnv2i]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this review

To our knowledge, this is the first review to detail research evidence on different anti-BV biofilm treatments. These findings inform clinicians about developments in the field and, in turn, offer their patients hope of a long-term cure.

Several limitations of this review should be acknowledged. While publication bias was not specifically assessed, it was noted that the majority of publications reported on effective compounds. Quite likely, significant research work that has found investigative compounds ineffective remains unpublished and was consequently not captured by this review. Additionally, the heterogeneity of study designs made comparisons among findings difficult since observations in laboratory cultures and animal models are not often reflected in human subject research.

### The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women [^115sSA9Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common cause of vaginitis associated with a high incidence of obstetric and gynecological complications and increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. This has led to renewed research interest in its treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents on BV in non-pregnant women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and African Healthline (December 2007); and proceedings of relevant international conferences (from 1981 at the time of writing).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing any two or more antimicrobial agents, or antimicrobial agents with placebo or no treatment, in women with clinical or Gram-stain criteria of BV.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the original publications, while a third author cross-checked the data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four trials involving 4,422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analyzed results by intention to treat; we re-analyzed the remainder. Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow-up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse effects.

### Clindesse [^1151SPZz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Clindesse for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that: (a) has a pH greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include: (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study involving 144 non-pregnant female patients aged 18 to 64 with a baseline Nugent score ≥ 4, Clindesse demonstrated statistically significantly higher cure rates over placebo. This was measured by therapeutic cure, clinical cure, and Nugent score cure assessed at 21–30 days after administration of the drug.

- **Therapeutic cure**: A composite endpoint requiring both clinical cure and Nugent score cure.
- **Clinical cure**: Required normal vaginal discharge, vaginal pH < 4.7, < 20% clue cells on wet mount preparation, and a negative "whiff" test (detection of amine odor on addition of 10% KOH solution to a sample of the vaginal discharge).
- **Nugent score cure**: A Nugent score of 0–3 was considered a cure. The Nugent scoring is based on microscopic examination of Gram's stained vaginal smears for quantification of specific bacterial morphotypes.

Cure rates were consistently higher for Clindesse compared to placebo.

### Rapid and profound shifts in the vaginal microbiota following antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis [^1118PQ7X]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common polymicrobial disease associated with numerous negative reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus acquisition. BV is treatable with antibiotics, but relapse is common. A more detailed understanding of bacterial dynamics during antibiotic therapy for BV could identify conditions that favor establishment, maintenance, and eradication of BV-associated bacterial species, thereby improving treatment outcomes.

- **Methods**: We used mathematical models to analyze daily quantitative measurements of 11 key bacterial species during metronidazole treatment for 15 cases of BV.

- **Results**: We identified complete reorganization of vaginal bacterial composition within a day of initiating therapy. Although baseline bacterial levels predicted a longer time to clearance, all anaerobic species were eliminated rapidly within a median of 3 days. However, reemergence of BV-associated species was common following treatment cessation. Gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobe, was cleared more slowly than anaerobic BV-associated species, and levels of G. vaginalis often rebounded during treatment. We observed gradual Lactobacillus species growth, indicating that untargeted microbes fill the transient vacuum formed during treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Under antibiotic pressure, the human microbiome can undergo rapid shifts on a scale of hours. When treatment is stopped, BV-associated bacteria quickly reemerge, suggesting a possible role for intermittent prophylactic treatment.

### The biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: Implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment [^117Ft2sr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Recent evidence supports the view that bacterial vaginosis presents as a polymicrobial biofilm infection. This has far-reaching implications for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Recent findings**: Gardnerella vaginalis is presumably the first species to adhere to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere. Not all G. vaginalis strains form biofilms; G. vaginalis can be present in the vagina in a planktonic or in a biofilm mode of growth. The presence of planktonic (dispersed) or biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis can be reliably shown in urine sediments in both women and men, and there is an absolute concordance in the carriage of biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis between women with bacterial vaginosis and their partners. In-vitro data suggest that selected probiotic lactobacilli might be an effective means to conquer the biofilm.

- **Summary**: Future epidemiological research may benefit significantly from biofilm-based urine diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. The search for novel therapeutic agents can now be more directed towards the biofilm-breaking agents, but is currently hampered by the lack of a proper in-vitro model of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences, including an increased risk of acquiring other infections, and the transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus-2. They also pose risks to reproductive and mental health, with implications for cervical cancer risk.

Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower educational attainment or those experiencing poverty. These are the groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatments.

We propose an empirical, single-dose, point-of-care treatment strategy. This approach, novel to the US, is evidence-based and consistent with international guidelines. It addresses the current deficiencies in the availability of inexpensive and accurate point-of-care diagnosis, as well as the substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow-up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### Cervicovaginal bacterial count and failure of metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis [^114yhUrf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the total bacterial count in cervicovaginal fluid is associated with the failure of metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis.

In a cross-sectional study, women attending a primary health center in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, for routine cervical screening between September 2012 and October 2013 were enrolled. Women who tested positive for bacterial vaginosis, as determined by the Nugent classification, were offered oral metronidazole. Women who completed metronidazole treatment, along with an equal number of control women with normal vaginal flora at initial screening, were included in analyses of total bacterial count, which was assessed by flow cytometry of cervicovaginal fluid samples.

Of the 287 women who enrolled, 49 were excluded because they tested positive for trichomoniasis, chlamydial endocervicitis, gonorrhea, or candidiasis. Among the remaining 238 women, 85 (35.7%) had bacterial vaginosis. At follow-up, among the 36 women who were evaluated, 23 (63.9%) had successfully restored lactobacilli-dominant flora, 12 (33.3%) had persistent bacterial vaginosis, and 1 (2.8%) had vaginal candidiasis (excluded from flow cytometry). Total bacterial count did not differ between the 35 women with bacterial vaginosis and the 35 with normal vaginal flora (P = 0.62). Additionally, total bacterial count at enrollment did not differ between women who had persistent bacterial vaginosis and those who had successful treatment (P = 0.78).

In conclusion, the failure of oral metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis was not associated with the total bacterial count in cervicovaginal fluid.

### Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114yUGwt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2019 to examine recent literature addressing updates in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STIs. This article summarizes recent data in each of these key topic areas as they pertain to bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge.

The evidence reviewed primarily focused on updates in the global epidemiology of BV, risk factors for BV, data supportive of sexual transmission of BV-associated bacteria, BV molecular diagnostic tests, and novel treatment regimens. Additionally, recent literature on alcohol abstinence in the setting of 5-nitroimidazole use was reviewed.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^1125B53B]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we identified specific vaginal taxa that were associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) recurrence within one month of treatment. Specifically, we found that a higher abundance of Prevotella spp immediately prior to treatment and Gardnerella spp immediately following treatment were both associated with increased odds of BV recurrence. Additionally, women who experienced recurrence had increased levels of BV-associated bacteria (primarily representing Gardnerella) relative to Lactobacillus spp (primarily representing L. iners) present in their vaginal microbiota immediately post-treatment compared to women who did not experience recurrence. Neither bacterial diversity nor the degree of compositional change following treatment were associated with BV recurrence. These data provide insight into key taxa that may play a role in treatment failure following recommended BV therapy.

Prevotella and Gardnerella are commonly recovered from the vaginal microbiome of women with BV, and species from both genera possess characteristics that are important for BV initiation and persistence. In vitro, Prevotella bivia has been shown to produce ammonia and amino acids, which enhance the growth of other BV-associated bacteria, including Gardnerella spp and Peptostreptococcus spp. Gardnerella, in turn, produces amino acids which stimulate the growth of P. bivia. Additionally, both Gardnerella spp and Prevotella spp produce sialidases, and there is evidence that Prevotella may be a dominant source of vaginal sialidase. One early study found that sialidase activity in women with BV was attributable to…

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1114nKdN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The ongoing search for new therapeutics against bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been complicated by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and the role of biofilms. Numerous promising agents are being investigated, and their findings indicate that the application of anti-BV biofilm agents may very likely bring a potential breakthrough in the treatment of BV; however, this is still an evolving field predominantly in the preclinical stages of research. With concerns of antibiotic resistance, action is urgently needed to move the study of these diverse antibiofilm agents into animal and human trials, although the absence of optimal animal models for BV is slowing the momentum of this much-needed development.

### Antimicrobial resistance associated with the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [^114Geo5n]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken to evaluate antimicrobial susceptibility of vaginal anaerobic bacteria before and after treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Study design**: A randomized clinical trial of 119 nonpregnant women with bacterial vaginosis receiving either intravaginal metronidazole for 5 days or clindamycin for 3 days was performed. Women had 1 baseline and 3 follow-up visits at which quantitative vaginal cultures were performed. Anaerobic isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

- **Results**: Complete susceptibility data was available on 95 women (47 metronidazole and 48 clindamycin). Of 1059 anaerobic bacterial isolates, less than 1% demonstrated resistance to metronidazole. In contrast, 17% demonstrated baseline clindamycin resistance, and 53% demonstrated resistance to clindamycin after therapy. Women exposed to clindamycin (but not metronidazole) had high frequencies (80%) of clindamycin-resistant anaerobic bacteria that persisted for 90 days after treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment of bacterial vaginosis with clindamycin is associated with marked evidence of antimicrobial resistance among vaginal anaerobic bacteria. This may increase the vaginal reservoir of macrolide-resistant bacteria.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^117Vf9oX]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

The study results and associated clinical data were previously published, and all data provided were de-identified to this study. The original clinical study protocol was approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (IRB) (Pro #00006122) with a waiver of oversight from the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT01347632). A total of 69 women were screened from symptomatic discharge, and 35 women were enrolled in the study. Vaginal microbiota data were generated by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, providing taxonomic resolution at the general level.

Thirty-three women completed all three visits. BV was evaluated by vaginal microbiota compositional data (molecular-BV). After biological samples were obtained at visit 1 (V1), women with BV were prescribed twice daily, 500-mg MNZ for 7 days. Participants returned for visit 2 (V2) 7–10 days after completing the course of MNZ therapy and visit 3 (V3) 28–32 days after completing treatment. At all three visits, samples were obtained to evaluate vaginal semen [ABAcard, West Hills, CA], vaginal pH, gram stain for Nugent score, and semiquantitative vaginal flora culture. CVLs were collected, followed by vaginal swabs and three full-thickness biopsies.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^113LgHuK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal dysbiosis that often recurs following first-line antibiotics. We investigated if vaginal microbiota composition was associated with BV recurrence. We analyzed samples and data from 121 women who participated in three published trials evaluating novel interventions for improving BV cure, including concurrent antibiotic treatment of regular sexual partners (RSPs). Women diagnosed with BV received first-line antibiotics and self-collected vaginal swabs pretreatment and the day after finishing antibiotics (immediately posttreatment). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on vaginal samples, and logistic regression explored associations between BV recurrence and features of the vaginal microbiota pre- and posttreatment.

Sixteen women (13% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 8%–21%]) experienced BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Women with an untreated RSP were more likely to experience recurrence than women with no RSP (P = .008) or an RSP who received treatment (P = .011). A higher abundance of Prevotella pretreatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05–1.91]) and Gardnerella immediately posttreatment (AOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.03–1.49]) were associated with increased odds of BV recurrence.

Having specific Prevotella spp prior to recommended treatment and persistence of Gardnerella immediately posttreatment may contribute to the high rates of BV recurrence. Interventions that target these taxa are likely required to achieve sustained BV cure.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^1156TcnZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is a frequent reason that women seek medical care; its accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate treatment and for preventing recurrence. The three most common causes are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis.

- **Bacterial vaginosis**: Diagnosed based on Amsel's or Nugent criteria.
- **Vulvovaginal candidiasis**: Criteria include budding yeast or pseudohyphae on wet mount or positive culture, with or without compatible clinical findings.
- **Trichomoniasis**: Diagnosed through observation on wet mount, in culture, or via biochemical detection through antigen, nucleic acid hybridization, or nucleic acid amplification-based assays.

Standard of care testing relies heavily upon microscope equipment and training and requires certification per the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. In addition, the majority of real-world diagnoses are empirical, with less than half of all treatments based on objective assays. This can result in incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Molecular assays that target bacterial vaginosis spp. have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to result compared to culture-based methods. This may be especially important for bacterial vaginosis, which involves multiple organisms of the vaginal microbiota.

The Food and Drug Administration-approved BD MAX vaginal panel (investigational test; Becton, Dickinson and Company, BD Life Sciences — Diagnostic Systems), using the BD MAX system, involves amplification-based DNA detection for all three common causes of vaginitis.

### Changes in the vaginal microenvironment with metronidazole treatment for bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy [^114azSq2]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with preterm delivery, but there is little evidence that treatment improves pregnancy outcomes. We examined whether oral or vaginal metronidazole treatment for BV in early pregnancy was more effective in restoring the normal vaginal environment.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing oral and intravaginal metronidazole for treatment of BV in early pregnancy (< 20 weeks). Vaginal samples collected at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment were evaluated using gram stain, culture, colorimetric detection of sialidase, and immunoassay for measurement of proinflammatory cytokines interleukins-1beta, -6, -8 (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). We compared the effect of treatment between groups using chi-square and t test, and within individuals using McNemar's test.

- **Results**: Of 126 subjects, 108 (86%) completed follow-up (55 oral, 53 intravaginal). Of the study population, 34% achieved therapeutic cure, and this was not different between treatment groups. BV-associated bacteria were significantly reduced in both groups, but few subjects regained colonization with protective lactobacilli. Among women who achieved therapeutic cure, the level of IL-1beta dropped significantly (p < 0.001) and SLPI increased (p = 0.003). More women in the vaginal treatment group had undetectable sialidase after treatment (p = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with oral or intravaginal metronidazole in early pregnancy reduced colonization with BV-associated bacteria but was not effective in achieving the…

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: A systematic review [^1142qKYq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Symptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) can be treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Topical alternatives include vaginal metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream. In recurrent cases of BV, longer therapeutic courses are often recommended. Since BV treatment is based on the presence of abnormal vaginal discharge and the standard syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), asymptomatic pregnant women may tend to remain untreated due to this therapeutic approach.

In the past, several risk factors have been associated with BV, including race and ethnicity, low socio-economic status, antibiotic therapy, multiple sex partners, smoking, and young or teenage age. However, the risk factors for BV during pregnancy are inconsistent, underreported, and often overlooked. Hence, BV risk factors are typically more prevalent among pregnant women and require further exploration. Clinicians need to understand the risk factors, symptoms, and potential sequelae of BV to monitor and treat women of reproductive age effectively.

The existence of BV among pregnant women has momentously attracted the attention of both clinicians and the scientific community due to its potential link with adverse clinical outcomes during pregnancy. BV has been associated with a higher risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery, miscarriage, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and transmission or acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and STIs. Increasing evidence indicates that vaginal microbiota (VMB) dysbiosis may be the causative reason behind premature rupture of membranes.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117VSfPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is clear that therapies directed solely at women have failed to achieve a high rate of sustained cure. By continuing to ignore the potential risk of sexual transmission and reinfection when evaluating the efficacy of treatments, the effectiveness of these strategies is likely to be consistently underestimated. When managing a patient with bacterial vaginosis (BV), incorporating the regular partner, who may be a source of reinfection, provides an opportunity to make an impact on treatment outcomes.

We need to continue to assess how antimicrobials change the genital microbiomes of both women with BV and their partners to ensure the most effective regimens are utilized. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of past partner treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we need innovative ways to engage women with BV and their partners. This will ensure recruitment of monogamous couples and promote adherence to treatment. Continued research into the pathogenicity of bacteria that are shared between couples may assist us in developing new treatment strategies, as well as providing evidence to support partner treatment as an adjunctive therapy to improve health outcomes for women.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^111HNDm7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is difficult to eradicate due to BV biofilms protecting BV bacteria, such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, and other genera. With the growing understanding of biofilms, we systematically reviewed the knowledge on the efficacy of anti-BV biofilm agents.

- **Methods**: We searched literature in the Scopus, Medline, and Embase databases for empirical studies investigating substances for the treatment of BV biofilms or prevention of their recurrence, as well as their efficacy and/or safety.

- **Results**: Of 201 unique titles, 35 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Most studies (89%) reported on preclinical laboratory research on the efficacy of experimental antibiofilm agents (80%) rather than their safety. Over 50% were published within the past 5 years. Agents were classified into seven groups: antibiotics, antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants/surfactant components. Enzymes and probiotics were most commonly investigated. Earlier reports of antibiotics having anti-BV biofilm activity have not been confirmed. Some compounds from other classes demonstrated promising anti-BV biofilm efficacy in early studies.

- **Conclusions**: Further research is anticipated on successful antibiofilm agents. If confirmed as effective and safe in human clinical trials, they may offer a breakthrough in BV treatment. With rising antibiotic resistance, antibiofilm agents will significantly improve the standard of care for BV management.

### Characterization and treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114h7Zfb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition, with a number of effective treatments available, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole, clindamycin, and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within one year of treatment for incident disease. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections can lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of the recurrence of BV are not well known.

Recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days). If ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by twice-weekly use for 3–6 months, is an alternative treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to its one-time dosing.

Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise, but further research is necessary before they can be used clinically. Despite limitations, antimicrobial therapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for recurrent BV for the foreseeable future.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116DDyx9]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Since these two systematic reviews were published, we have results from a recently conducted RCT. Schwebke et al. treated women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) with the first-line regimen of a 7-day oral metronidazole 500 mg bid. Their male sexual partners were randomized to concurrent treatment with the same regimen or an oral placebo. This trial was the most thoroughly designed and addressed the limitations of prior trials, with sufficient sample size, clear power calculations, appropriate randomization methods, blinding, and inclusion of data on antibiotic adherence. However, the trial was stopped early due to futility, as the primary intention-to-treat analysis showed partner treatment did not improve cure by 16 weeks post-randomization.

Even though these findings appear to be yet another notch against male-partner treatment, there are important considerations to note. The overall recurrence rate was 80% in women in both groups, which is higher than prior studies and may suggest the study population had underlying risk factors that placed them at high risk of recurrence or persistent BV biofilm that is refractory to oral metronidazole. Further, post hoc analyses revealed that among couples where the man was 100% adherent to metronidazole treatment, the female partners were significantly less likely to recur (73% vs. 97% recurrence in women whose partners were 100% vs. less than 100% adherent, respectively, p < 0.001). These findings suggest a modest effect of oral treatment in highly adherent males, but it is important to consider that oral therapy alone may also not…

### Solosec [^117Xmr7W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage for bacterial vaginosis**: The recommended dosage of Solosec for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in female patients 12 years of age and older is a single 2-gram packet of granules taken once orally, without regard to the timing of meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Recommended dosage for trichomoniasis**: The recommended dosage of Solosec for the treatment of trichomoniasis in patients 12 years of age and older is a single 2-gram packet of granules taken once orally, without regard to the timing of meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Since trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease, treat sexual partners with the same dose and at the same time [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

- **Instructions for the preparation and administration of Solosec**: Open the Solosec packet by folding over the corner (marked by an arrow) and tearing across the top. Sprinkle the entire contents of the Solosec packet onto applesauce, yogurt, or pudding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The granules will not dissolve. Consume all of the mixture within 30 minutes without chewing or crunching the granules. A glass of water may be taken after the administration of Solosec to aid in swallowing. The granules are not intended to be dissolved in any liquid. Avoid consumption of alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol during treatment with Solosec and for at least 2 days after completing therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^115cZtpP]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

This study adds to the knowledge on the dismal effect of antibiotic use on vaginal dysbiosis. We suggest medical professionals take this into account when counseling patients known to have recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) when they need antibiotics for another condition.

Furthermore, we suggest that general practitioners prioritize in-person consultation over repeat prescriptions in patients with recurrent complaints. Critical evaluation of the previous diagnosis is justified using standardized criteria, such as Amsel criteria, and warrants microbiological testing before treatment is initiated again to prevent unnecessary prescriptions and further development of antibiotic resistance.

In conclusion, the present study provides tools for general practitioners to better recognize patients at risk of developing recurrent complaints and re-evaluate their approach to the diagnosis and treatment of reBV.
