## Question

Why would I draw 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and why to order 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D testing, and how to interpret its results in different clinical situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology and why 1,25(OH)2D differs from 25(OH)D. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications and common pitfalls in ordering. Next, I will examine specific clinical scenarios where 1,25(OH)2D is informative, including hypercalcemia, granulomatous disease, hypophosphatemic disorders, and advanced CKD. After that, I should review emerging or investigational contexts like HSCT. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check areas where confusion commonly occurs.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical distinction, because this drives correct test selection. 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects total body stores and has a long half-life of about 2 to 3 weeks, whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the active hormone with a short half-life of roughly 4 to 8 hours and is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphate, and kidney function, so it is not a marker of vitamin D stores and can be normal or high even when deficiency exists [^112zzYJM] [^112Tpe7y] [^1128upyg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines consistently advise against using 1,25(OH)2D to assess vitamin D status. The Endocrine Society explicitly recommends measuring 25(OH)D to evaluate deficiency and advises against ordering 1,25(OH)2D for that purpose, and the American Academy of Family Physicians echoes this, emphasizing that 1,25(OH)2D levels are often normal or elevated in deficiency due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can mislead clinicians if misordered [^11417Mw1] [^1123HSa4] [^114HFRtg].

> I need to check the core indications where 1,25(OH)2D is actually useful. The clearest is hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH, where unregulated extrarenal 1α-hydroxylase activity produces 1,25(OH)2D autonomously. Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and other granulomatous diseases are classic causes, and the ATS sarcoidosis guideline supports measuring both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D when vitamin D metabolism assessment is needed, particularly to decide whether vitamin D repletion is safe or could worsen hypercalcemia [^113Q522X] [^114HFRtg].

> Next, I should review hypophosphatemic disorders. In X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and related phosphate-wasting syndromes, 1,25(OH)2D is inappropriately low or normal despite hypophosphatemia due to impaired renal 1α-hydroxylase responsiveness, so documenting low or low-normal calcitriol in the face of low phosphate helps confirm the diagnosis and pathophysiology. Historical data show supranormal 25(OH)D with subnormal 1,25(OH)2D in treated XLH, reinforcing the diagnostic value of the active hormone level in this context [^113ZBgH4] [^111mX2An].

> Let me consider advanced CKD and dialysis next. As kidney function declines, renal 1α-hydroxylase activity is impaired, so 1,25(OH)2D is typically low, contributing to secondary hyperparathyroidism. While 25(OH)D is the substrate we replete, measuring calcitriol can contextualize mineral metabolism abnormalities and guide active vitamin D analog therapy in CKD-MBD, though it is not a screening test for nutritional deficiency [^112bosT7] [^1126NgsJ].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is post-transplant or HSCT outcomes. Emerging cohort data suggest that peritransplant 1,25(OH)2D levels may predict treatment-related mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, independent of 25(OH)D, indicating a potential prognostic role; however, I should confirm that this remains investigational and not yet a standard indication, so ordering for this purpose should be framed as research or hypothesis-generating rather than routine care [^1121BXFK] [^117Dpizi] [^111Cr23E].

> I should double-check common pitfalls and misorders. Many clinicians mistakenly request 1,25(OH)2D to "check vitamin D status", but that test can be normal or high in deficiency and low in hypercalcemia of malignancy, so it neither diagnoses nor excludes nutritional deficiency. Quality-improvement data show that restricting 1,25(OH)2D orders to appropriate indications and educating on the difference from 25(OH)D reduces inappropriate utilization substantially [^114HFRtg] [^111PNBgk] [^111xiGWB].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Order 1,25(OH)2D when hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH suggests calcitriol-mediated etiologies, when evaluating suspected hypophosphatemic rickets or related phosphate-wasting disorders, or when managing advanced CKD with complex mineral metabolism where calcitriol physiology is central. Do not order it to screen for or diagnose vitamin D deficiency, to monitor repletion, or in routine osteoporosis care where 25(OH)D suffices, and consider it in sarcoidosis or granulomatous disease when assessing safety of vitamin D repletion or confirming dysregulated calcitriol production [^113Q522X] [^111vVZHD] [^11417Mw1].

> I will now examine interpretation and follow-up. In hypercalcemia of granulomatous disease, elevated 1,25(OH)2D with low PTH supports the diagnosis and argues against vitamin D repletion until calcium is controlled; in hypophosphatemic disorders, inappropriately low or normal calcitriol despite hypophosphatemia supports a primary renal phosphate handling defect; in CKD, low calcitriol aligns with expected reduced 1α-hydroxylation and may inform the need for active vitamin D analogs, with ongoing monitoring of calcium, phosphate, and PTH to avoid hypercalcemia and adynamic bone disease [^114HFRtg] [^113ZBgH4] [^112bosT7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 1,25(OH)2D might help in suspected secondary hyperparathyroidism from deficiency, but I should correct that — because PTH upregulates 1α-hydroxylase, calcitriol is often normal or high in deficiency, so ordering 1,25(OH)2D there can be misleading. Stick to 25(OH)D for deficiency assessment and reserve calcitriol for the specific scenarios above to avoid misinterpretation and unnecessary cost [^114HFRtg] [^111vVZHD] [^1123HSa4].

You would draw 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D when evaluating **hypercalcemia with low or inappropriately normal PTH** [^114HFRtg] to detect **extrarenal calcitriol production** (e.g. sarcoidosis, lymphoma, granulomatous disease) [^113ZBgH4] or **hereditary 1α-hydroxylase deficiency** [^113ZBgH4]. It is also indicated for suspected **vitamin D–resistant rickets** [^111mX2An], **hypophosphatemic disorders** [^113ZBgH4], or **impaired renal 1α-hydroxylation** (advanced CKD, hypoparathyroidism) [^112Tpe7y]. Do not use 1,25(OH)2D to assess vitamin D status [^11417Mw1]; order 25-hydroxyvitamin D for that purpose [^1123HSa4] [^111Pgz2L].

## Clinical indications for measuring 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D

### Hypercalcemia of malignancy and granulomatous diseases

- **Hypercalcemia with low or inappropriately normal PTH**: Measure 1,25(OH)2D to detect extrarenal calcitriol production in sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or other granulomatous diseases [^113ZBgH4] [^114HFRtg].

- **Sarcoidosis and granulomatous disease**: Macrophages produce calcitriol autonomously, causing hypercalcemia; elevated 1,25(OH)2D supports the diagnosis [^113ZBgH4] [^114HFRtg].

- **Hereditary 1α-hydroxylase deficiency**: Low 1,25(OH)2D with normal 25(OH)D indicates impaired renal activation [^113ZBgH4].

---

### Vitamin D–resistant rickets and hypophosphatemic disorders

In vitamin D–resistant rickets (VDRR), **low or inappropriately normal 1,25(OH)2D** with elevated 25(OH)D suggests resistance to calcitriol action [^113ZBgH4]. In **hypophosphatemic disorders**, low 1,25(OH)2D with hypophosphatemia indicates impaired renal phosphate handling or 1α-hydroxylation defects [^111mX2An].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypoparathyroidism

In CKD stages 3–5, **impaired renal 1α-hydroxylation** leads to low 1,25(OH)2D despite normal or high 25(OH)D; measuring 1,25(OH)2D helps guide active vitamin D therapy [^112bosT7] [^114HFRtg]. In hypoparathyroidism, **low PTH** reduces renal 1α-hydroxylase activity, resulting in low 1,25(OH)2D; measurement supports diagnosis and management [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Short half-life**: 1,25(OH)2D has a short half-life (~4–8 hours) [^112zzYJM] and fluctuates with calcium, phosphate, and PTH; interpret results cautiously [^1128upyg].

- **Not a marker of vitamin D stores**: 1,25(OH)2D does not reflect vitamin D status; use 25(OH)D for that purpose [^11417Mw1] [^111Pgz2L].

- **Assay variability**: 1,25(OH)2D assays are less standardized than 25(OH)D assays; use reliable laboratories and clinical context when interpreting results [^113Vi78J] [^111hjMCj].

Vitamin D supplementation and serum measurements in the patients of the discovery cohort

All HSCT recipients in the discovery cohort received oral high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation (Vigantol oil, 20.000 IU/ml, Merck) consisting of a 50.000 IU-dose upon admission to hospital (d-16 to d-6) followed by daily administration of 10.000 IU. To monitor 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels, blood was drawn repeatedly during inpatient stay and thereafter during routine outpatient visits. To avoid hypercalcemia, serum calcium levels were assessed twice a week. The described supplementation dose was maintained until patients reached 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels of 150–200 nmol/L with subsequent dose adjustment to avoid 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels > 150–200 nmol/L. Vitamin D levels were analyzed immediately or from sera stored at −80 °C by the Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center of Regensburg. From May 2012 to October 2014, 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels were determined by means of chemiluminescence immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Immunodiagnostic systems, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). After validation for comparability, from November 2014 on, 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry as described elsewhere. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 concentrations were measured using a radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Immunodiagnostic systems, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) by the Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center of Regensburg.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113ZBgH4]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of 1,25(OH) 2 D may contribute to the diagnosis of conditions with low calcitriol levels, such as 1α-hydroxylase deficiency, or those associated with high 1,25(OH) 2 D levels, such as hereditary vitamin D–resistant rickets, granulomatous conditions (sarcoidosis and tuberculosis), and the hypophosphatemic syndromes.

Available evidence to date is rather limited to determine whether free or bioavailable 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH) 2 D is the better biomarker of 25(OH)D availability to local tissues and of its effect on target organs in special situations. The extremely low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D found in mice and humans with genetic absence of DBP without implications on calcium homeostasis is the best argument for the free "vitamin D" hypothesis.

Assessment of Other Metabolites

Improvements in LC-MS/MS have triggered a revolution in small-molecule clinical chemistry, particularly the analysis of steroid hormones. The additional sensitivity and selectivity provided by the recently emerged LC-MS/MS techniques make it now feasible to measure most of the circulating vitamin D metabolites of value to clinicians and physiologists in human and animal studies. A comprehensive analysis can now assay 8 metabolites simultaneously (cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D, 3-epi-25(OH)D, 24,25(OH) 2 D, 25,26(OH) 2 D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, 1,24,25(OH) 3 D, and 25(OH)D-26,23-lactone) by judicious use of liquid-liquid-extraction and immune-extraction steps. Besides specific clinical situations, a few previous reports have also highlighted a potential role for vitamin D metabolites, in particular of the 24,25 to 25(OH)D ratio, in better-predicting fracture risk as compared to only 25(OH)D levels.

Measurement of vitamin D

25OHD levels are measured in ng/ml or nmol/l (1 ng/ml is equivalent to 2.5 nmol/l). However, several technical problems should be recognised when measuring vitamin D levels:
There are two main types of assays used for measuring 25OHD-the immune-based assay (commonly used in clinical practice) and the chromatography-based assay (commonly considered the gold standard for research). The utilisation of different methods among laboratories obviously leads to a great variability in test results. This has therefore led to the recent introduction of the standard reference material for vitamin D by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the USA.
Total circulating 25OHD is the sum of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3, but not all the immunoassays used in clinical practice are able to detect 25OHD2, which can lead to underestimation of 25OHD levels.
Potential confounders of 25OHD measurement may be present, which can falsely elevate 25OHD, such as other vitamin D metabolites, which are relatively abundant and can account from 2 to 20% of the 25OHD measured.

The assessment of circulating 25(OH)D and, to a lesser degree, 1,25(OH)2D is rapidly becoming an important clinical tool in the diagnosis and management of many diverse pathologies. At present, the reference ranges for circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are 32 to 100 ng/mL and 16 to 56 ng/mL, respectively, and are largely based on clinical data derived from the FDA-cleared DiaSorin assay procedures.

### Don't routinely measure 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D unless the patient… [^114HFRtg]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Many practitioners become confused when ordering a vitamin D test. Because 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the active form of vitamin D, many practitioners think that measuring 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D is an accurate means to estimate vitamin D stores and test for vitamin D deficiency, which is incorrect. Current Endocrine Society guidelines recommend screening for vitamin D deficiency in individuals at risk for deficiency. Serum levels of 1, 25-dihyroxyvitamin D have little or no relationship to vitamin D stores but rather are regulated primarily by parathyroid hormone levels, which in turn are regulated by calcium and/or vitamin D. In vitamin D deficiency, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels go up, not down. Unregulated production of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D is an uncommon cause of hypercalcemia; this should be suspected if blood calcium levels are high and parathyroid hormone levels are low and confirmed by measurement of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

The enzyme that activates vitamin D is produced in the kidney, so blood levels of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D are sometimes of interest in patients on dialysis or with end-stage kidney disease. There are few other circumstances, if any, where 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D testing would be helpful. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may be overused, but when trying to assess vitamin D stores or diagnose vitamin D deficiency, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the correct test.

### Hypovitaminosis D and morbidity in critical illness: is there proof beyond reasonable doubt? [^113VDAos]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, the study adds to the burgeoning volume of literature on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in critically ill patients and the resulting potential for adverse outcomes. Where do we go from here? There have been calls for universal vitamin D supplementation in critically ill patients. Given the present evidence, this would be premature as a number of caveats still remain.

The criteria for definitions of vitamin D sufficiency are based on bone health; the optimal level for pleiotropy remains unclear. Moreover, little data exist on the bio-active form, 1,25-dihydroxy-D3, in critical illness and association with outcomes. Reports of supra-physiological levels of 1,25-dihydroxy-D3 following inflammatory response in critically ill patients and, more recently, evidence of extra-renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy-D3 have been published. Furthermore, the high degree of protein binding of 25-hydroxy-D3 and consequently the relevance of free levels, particularly in the context of altered pharmacokinetics associated with critical illness, remain to be elucidated.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^111PTBx8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

CKD stages 3–5D vitamin D testing and repletion — In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, we suggest that calcidiol (25[OH]D) might be measured, with repeat testing determined by baseline values and therapeutic interventions (2C). We suggest that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency be corrected using treatment strategies recommended for the general population (2C). Substrate vitamin D deficiency has been variably defined as 25(OH)D level < 10–20 ng/mL, and insufficiency as 25(OH)D level higher than the limits for deficiency but < 32–35 ng/mL. A reasonable approach is to periodically measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with CKD and initiate treatment if the level is low, with general-population repletion specifying a cholecalciferol dose of 1,000–2,000 IU/d; however, a more aggressive dosing regimen may be used in patients with CKD. The KDOQI bone guideline provided a recommendation for supplementation in patients with CKD stages 3–4 with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), orally dosed according to 25(OH)D level; this has not been tested in patients with CKD stage 5, 5D, or T, and monitoring calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH levels can guide subsequent dose adjustments. This represents a change from prior KDOQI guidance that limited measuring 25(OH)D to patients with CKD stages 3–4 and elevated PTH level, and these recommendations are applicable to the United States.

CKD-MBD testing in CKD stages 3–5 and 5D — adults: In adults, recommend monitoring serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and ALP beginning in CKD stage 3. In CKD stages 3–5D, suggest measuring 25(OH)D levels and suggest that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency be corrected using treatment strategies recommended for the general population; by contrast, KDOQI 2003 stated that in CKD stages 3–4, measure 25(OH)D, if PTH is above target range for stage of CKD and that if serum 25(OH)D level < 30 ng/mL (~75 nmol/L), supplementation with vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) should be initiated. KDIGO 2009 also suggests using individual serum calcium and phosphorus values rather than the mathematical construct of Ca × P, whereas KDOQI 2003 recommended Ca × P < 55 mg2/dL2 in CKD stages 3–5. Commentary notes include "Suggestion for using ALP as adjunct test" and "Suggestion for expanded testing of 25(OH)D".

### Reducing overutilisation of serum vitamin D testing at a tertiary care centre [^111PNBgk]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Testing of 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D serum levels has increased drastically in recent years and much of it is considered inappropriate based on current guidelines.

Methods

In consultation with our physician groups (experts and frequent orderers), we modified existing guidelines and implemented a rational policy for 25-OH vitamin D testing and 1,25 dihydroxy (1,25 di-OH) vitamin D testing at a tertiary care centre. A computer decision support tool requiring selection of one of five acceptable testing indications was created for each test as part of a computerised physician order entry system.

Results

As a result of our intervention, we observed a 27% decrease in the average monthly test volume for 25-OH vitamin D from 504 ± 62 (mean ± SD) tests per month to 370 ± 33 (p < 0.001). 1,25 di-OH vitamin D testing decreased 58% from 71 ± 18to 30 ± 10 (p < 0.001). The departments ordering the tests were similar during the preintervention and postintervention periods, and further audits, patient chart reviews and individualised physician feedback were required to ensure appropriate ordering of 1,25 di-OH vitamin D. The most common ordering reasons selected were malabsorption/dietary concerns (46%) for 25-OH vitamin D and renal failure (42%) for 1,25 di-OH vitamin D.

Conclusions

Limitations of our computer decision support tool include a dependence on an honour system in selecting the testing indication and an inability to limit ordering frequency. Periodic monitoring of test volumes will be required to ensure adherence to guidelines. Despite these limitations, we have improved appropriate utilisation of these tests and reduced costs by approximately $C60375 per year.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Decalcitrol® cholecalciferol (vitamin d3) 1.25… [^114E5614]. FDA (DailyMed) (2017). Low credibility.

Inactive Ingredients: Silica, magnesium stearate, cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose The in vivo synthesis of the major biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of ergocalciferol takes place in the liver and the second in the kidneys. Vitamin D metabolites promote the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus by the small intestine, thus elevating serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to permit bone mineralization. Vitamin D metabolites also mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone and probably increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate by the renal tubules. There is a time lag of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active metabolites in the liver and kidneys.

Colecalciferol Tablets are essential for absorption of calcium and necessary for healthy and strong bones. Cholecalciferol Tablets are indicated for use in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, refractory rickets, also known as vitamin D resistant rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Geriatric requires seek their primary care physician before starting vitamin D therapy. Hypervitaminosis D is characterized by effects on the following organ system: Metabolic: Mild acidosis, anemia, weight loss. The effects of administered vitamin D can persist for two or more months after cessation of treatment. Hypervitaminosis D is characterized by: DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED UNDER CLOSE MEDICAL SUPERVISION. Calcium intake should be adequate.

Blood calcium and phosphorus determinations must be made every 2 weeks or more frequently if necessary. X-rays of the bones should be taken every month until condition is corrected and stabilized SWALLOW TABLETS. DO NOT CHEW. Take as directed by your physician. Each tablet contains 50000 IU Vitamin D3 equivalent to 1. 25 mg. Vitamin D3 50, 000 IU is essential for absorption of calcium and necessary for healthy bones and a healthy immune system.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115GCzBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### Use and indication of vitamin D and vitamin D analogues in patients with renal bone disease [^112bosT7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and treatment of renal bone disease. Vitamin D levels decline in the early phase of renal failure, however, through a compensatory mechanism parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3), calcitriol) to return it to normal circulating concentrations. Nevertheless, resistance to calcitriol is observed and may be related to the decreased presence of the heterodimeric, DNA-binding partner for the vitamin D receptor protein. In end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) the circulating levels of calcitriol are invariably low. The indications of vitamin D therapy are the replacement of the missing hormone vs suppression of hyperparathyroidism (HPT) requiring daily low-dose oral vs intermittent 'pulse' or oral administration. However, this therapy must be accompanied by careful patient monitoring to avoid hypercalcaemia and low bone turnover. Low bone turnover is not merely a histologic entity, but a clinical condition associated with a high risk of extraosseous calcifications, in particular in the cardiovascular system, leading to increased morbidity. Thus, determination of bone turnover in patients with ESKD is essential. Bone biopsy is the gold standard to assess bone turnover, however, it is not always available and nephrologists rely on PTH levels. The intact PTH assay measures PTH(1–84) and large C-PTH fragments, which may antagonize the PTH(1–84) effects on bone. An assay that measures exclusively PTH(1–84) has recently become available and a calculated PTH(1–84)/C-PTH fragment ratio has been shown to be the best predictor of bone turnover in patients with ESKD not treated with vitamin D or with other medications known to affect bone metabolism. 1,25-dihydroxy-22-oxavitamin D(3) (22-oxacalcitriol, OCT) is a vitamin D analogue that could control serum PTH concentrations without deleterious effects on bone.

Vitamin D — general adults younger than 50 years (testing): In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing. In this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### Toward clarity in clinical vitamin D status assessment: 25 (OH) D assay standardization [^111hjMCj]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Widespread variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) assays continues to compromise efforts to develop clinical and public health guidelines regarding vitamin D status. The Vitamin D Standardization Program helps alleviate this problem. Reference measurement procedures and standard reference materials have been developed to allow current, prospective, and retrospective standardization of 25(OH)D results. Despite advances in 25(OH)D measurement, substantial variability in clinical laboratory 25(OH)D measurement persists. Existing guidelines have not used standardized data and, as a result, it seems unlikely that consensus regarding definitions of vitamin D deficiency, inadequacy, sufficiency, and excess will soon be reached. Until evidence-based consensus is reached, a reasonable clinical approach is advocated.

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)", specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years", and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)". For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses". The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications", citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings". The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology".

### Assessment and interpretation of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the clinical environment [^114J61kR]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The unique cis-triene structure of vitamin D and related metabolites makes it susceptible to oxidation, ultraviolet (UV) light-induced conformational changes, heat-induced conformational changes, and attacks by free radicals. Vitamin D(2) is much less bioactive than vitamin D(3) in humans. Metabolic activation and inactivation of vitamin D are well characterized and result in a plethora of metabolites, of which only 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) provide any clinically relevant information. 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3) are commonly known as calcifediol and the 1,25(OH)(2)D metabolites as calcitriol. In this review the current state of the science on the clinical assessment of circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D is described.

### Pathology consultation on vitamin D testing [^112724wm]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen a substantial increase in clinical interest in vitamin D deficiency and of laboratory testing for vitamin D status. Many clinical laboratories in the United States have seen requests for vitamin D testing increase 100% or more in the last 5 years. The most common laboratory test to assess vitamin D nutritional status is total 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations. Laboratory professionals are often confronted with challenges related to vitamin D testing, including controversy over optimal and target vitamin D concentrations, variable reference ranges across marketed assays and reference laboratories, lack of standardization of vitamin D assays, and misordering of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D testing. This article presents a common clinical case scenario regarding vitamin D and an up-to-date discussion and review of the literature on vitamin D testing.

### 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 but not the clinically applied marker 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 predicts survival after stem cell transplantation [^11663aQs]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although treatment-related mortality (TRM) was substantially reduced among patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) over the past decade, the risk for TRM still remains high. Up to now, it is not possible to individually predict TRM at time of transplantation independent of known pretransplant variables as disease-associated risk factors, donor relationship, and comorbidity. An issue of debate is vitamin D3. In some studies, the impact of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels on adverse events of allogeneic HSCT was evaluated, but results are inconsistent. In one prospective trial, safety and efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation after HSCT was evaluated and no significant impact on overall survival was found.

25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 is a precursor of the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3. The conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 is mainly performed by the kidney, but also by immune cells. Little is known about the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 levels with regard to HSCT and aGvHD. In rat bone marrow transplantation, an analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been shown to prevent aGvHD. In humans, polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor, mediating the biological activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3, were shown to correlate with survival and aGvHD in HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT. Recently, Carrillo-Cruz et al. reported a reduced incidence of cGvHD in response to vitamin D supplementation of patients with a certain VDR genotype.

We thus set out to investigate the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and for comparison also 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels measured repeatedly shortly before and during the first 100 days after HSCT on 1-year TRM in a discovery cohort of 143 patients. We then tested our findings in overall 365 patients from three different cohorts in order to replicate our findings in independent data and to generalize it for different clinical settings.

Advocacy for routine screening is contingent upon demonstrating that screenings can effectively identify individuals with low 25(OH)D who might not be detected through traditional risk factor assessments and that vitamin D supplementation after identifying a low 25(OH)D level leads to improvements in clinical outcomes; moreover, screening generally healthy adults would involve testing large numbers of people with important health system implications.

Screening and testing vitamin D status — conclusions

Screening the general population for vitamin D deficiency is very expensive and does not result in practical clinical benefits. 25(OH)D measurements have primarily been indicated in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, but the increased awareness of potential pleiotropic effects has widened the interest in screening, although without any definitive evidence.

The most important risk factors in the general population, as identified by recent studies, include low ambient UV radiation, low vitamin D intake, and gene polymorphisms. Their inclusion as primary risk factors in risk stratification approaches to assess vitamin D status will help effectively target 25(OH)D assessment in those most in need and at risk. Finally, further studies — including those with health economic measures — are warranted to best identify all the situations in which the assessment of vitamin D status is actually needed — or not.

Methods: Assays, Thresholds, and Standardization

Accuracy and precision of vitamin D measurements are crucial to properly use the values obtained in biological fluids. The laboratory methods should be detailed in clinical trials, scientific papers, and even in the reports released to physicians and patients. The measurements could be obtained by either antibody-based methods (chemiluminescent or immunoenzymatic) or by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS or LC-MS/MS), with the latter giving more consistent and accurate results; regardless, the reference material should also be indicated in the report. The laboratory should define the reference values considering the method used for analyzing the molecule(s). The unit of measure (molar or mass) should be clearly indicated. The mol/L unit should be preferred as the SI standard unit; alternatively, both mol/L and ng/mL should be reported. Moreover, the critical difference (or least significance change), or reference change values, that is, the value (percentage) testifying to a real modification of the molecule(s) concentration between 2 consecutive measurements, assayed with the same method, in the same patient, and, on the contrary, that the modification is not only dependent from analytical and biological variability (natural oscillation of values in individuals), should be known and properly considered.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

Mean 25-OH-D2 level was 129. 5 ±

5. 8 ng/mL. These values were significantly higher than in normal subjects. Serum 1, 25–2D was 16. 9 ±
8. 5 pg/ml in the eight patients, significantly lower than 47 ± 16 pg/mL in 27 age-matched controls. Values indicative of significant demineralization were found in seven of the eight phosphate-treated patients, who had no radiologic evidence of rickets. These results suggest that any theory of the pathogenesis of this disorder must account for inappropriate renal vitamin D metabolism and for renal hyperphosphaturia.

The failure of high-dosage oral phosphate and ergocalciferol to fully correct demineralization may suggest a role for calcitriol 2D3) as a therapeutic agent.

Vitamin D screening considerations in generally healthy adults — The panel noted that low vitamin D status has been linked to a number of important health problems and agreed that adverse effects may manifest only after a long latency period, with early detection plausibly improving long-term outcomes; they emphasized that the condition has a latent (preclinical) phase and that persons with positive screening results would be managed differently from those with negative results. They agreed that vitamin D supplementation is widely available, inexpensive, and highly effective at raising 25(OH)D levels, and that high- or moderate-certainty evidence supports acceptable screening test accuracy, although there is still considerable variability of 25(OH)D assays. The systematic review did not identify any studies showing that 25(OH)D testing is harmful, and the panel did not identify harms related to screening other than financial costs; additional considerations included that effective management improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent phase and that any screening strategy should be cost-effective, acceptable to stakeholders, and feasible to implement. This section addresses whether to screen with a 25(OH)D test in generally healthy populations and does not specifically address how those with documented low levels of 25(OH)D should be evaluated or treated.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.

The number of assessments of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] for diagnostic purposes has increased significantly during the past 5 y. Over the years, techniques for quantifying 25(OH)D have increased and evolved. Some changes have been for the better and some have not. Most current methods appear to provide valid results as long as the operator of the given technique is properly trained and motivated. In addition, any laboratory that assesses circulating 25(OH)D for clinical diagnosis needs to participate in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme. Finally, research has shown that circulating 25(OH)D is extremely stable in stored serum or plasma samples; this characteristic makes accurate, long-term epidemiologic studies of circulating 25(OH)D possible. In this article, I provide an overview of the techniques available for measuring 25(OH)D, compare these techniques with one another, and assess their clinical utility. I also briefly discuss the stability of 25(OH)D in biological media and present an overview of the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme.

Discussion

Our data of altogether 508 patients undergoing HSCT highlighted higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 levels at the time of HSCT to be a strong predictor for one-year TRM independent of severe aGvHD. This predictor was independent of baseline characteristics known to affect TRM and independent of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels. We identified the optimal threshold of 139.5 pM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 to detect patients at high risk for TRM and replicated our finding in independent replication data consisting of 365 patients from three different clinical settings.

To our knowledge, our present study is the first study on 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 in the context of allogeneic HSCT and with 508 patients the largest study on vitamin D metabolites in the context of allogeneic HSCT. Up to now, all published studies on vitamin D included less patients.

Existing studies on vitamin D in the context of allogeneic HSCT are dealing with the role of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3, the precursor of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3. A number of reports has described insufficiency for 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. As a consequence, we and others used different approaches to increase vitamin D levels in patients undergoing HSCT. At present, the role of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 for survival after HSCT has been examined in eight studies. In four studies early low 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels were associated with increased overall mortality. In contrast, no significant impact of early 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels on overall survival was described in four studies. In line, also in our study low peritransplant 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels were no risk factor for mortality. However, the primary endpoint of our analysis was TRM, not overall mortality. Conflicting data have also been published looking at 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 and association with aGvHD and cGvHD. When we tested for an association of severe aGvHD or cGvHD with 1,25(OH)2D3 levels, respectively, no significant association was detected.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1114js6Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — empiric vitamin D use and 25(OH)D testing: The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years, for adults aged 75 years and older, for those who are pregnant, and for those with high‑risk prediabetes because of its potential to lower disease risks noted on the page. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests daily administration rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower disease risk in healthy adults younger than 75 years, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered because routine screening lacks supporting clinical trial evidence (including in those with obesity or dark complexion) and no clear preventive target level was identified. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs and do not apply to those with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Similarly, for 1,25 di-OH vitamin D, we did not have any balancing measures to ensure we did not decrease appropriate testing. We also did not observe any change in the percentage of results falling into the low, normal and high categories as a result of our intervention (figure 5C). Because the total number of 1,25 di-OH vitamin D tests decreased, there would have been fewer patients with low or high 1,25 di-OH vitamin D levels who would have received testing due to our efforts. The consequences of this are not clear. We do not know what percentage of low or high 1,25 di-OH vitamin D results were acted on before or after the intervention. We know that we were able to decrease 1,25 di-OH vitamin D test orders by the gastroenterology department, which were meant to be 25-OH vitamin D tests related to malabsorption. Thus, there were inappropriate orders dealt with as a result of our intervention. We also took every effort in the study design to ensure that appropriate orders for 1,25 di-OH vitamin D testing would be permitted.

Another limitation of our intervention is that while it forces the healthcare provider to enter a reason for testing from a limited list, it does not ensure the accuracy of the indication or prevent the provider from choosing a false indication to circumvent the restrictions. Specifically, by auditing the data and performing chart reviews for the individual patients we did identify some healthcare providers who selected testing indications that did not apply to their patients, largely based on misunderstanding of the differences between the 25-OH vitamin D and 1,25 di-OH vitamin D tests. Furthermore, many patients being assessed in clinic have electronic orders placed at a physician's written or verbal request by clerical staff unfamiliar with the specific indications in the drop-down lists, who may then randomly select reasons. Because of the time involved in identifying abuses of the system, only anomalies that stand out blatantly are likely to be investigated and addressed.

### Contemporary diagnosis and treatment of vitamin D-related disorders [^116eSfsw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Plasma 25(OH)D has emerged as a valuable biomarker for the many varied health-related effects of vitamin D in the clinic mainly because of the recognition of the importance of the enzyme, CYP27B1, or the 25(OH)D-alpha-hydroxylase in the extrarenal, target cell production of calcitriol. This review briefly assesses current methodology for plasma 25(OH)D assay focusing mainly on currrent controversies surrounding the definition of the normal range and performance characteristics of the assay, separate measurement of both 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3), and quality assurance tesing of laboratories offering the test. Clinicians have two main types of 25(OH)D assay based on either high-performance liquid chromatography with UV or mass detection or higher throughput kits based on protein (competitive protein binding assay or radioimmunoassay) binding. Based on 30 yr of experience with measuring 25(OH)D levels, it is concluded that, in the hands of appropriately trained experts, both types of assay provide reliable and accurate results, but all laboratories providing 25(OH)D data need frequent external quality assurance service to ensure that this performance is maintained.

Vitamin D supplementation and 25(OH)D testing in adults aged 75 years and older — the panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation and issued a conditional recommendation, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in adults aged 75 years and older. The systematic review did not find evidence suggesting that the benefit is restricted to those with 25(OH)D below a threshold, and the panel judged that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity. In trials informing falls and fracture outcomes, the estimated weighted average intervention vitamin D dosage was approximately 990 IU/day (23 μg/day), participants were permitted to remain on vitamin D supplements up to 800 IU (20 μg)/day, and the median dosage of calcium used was 1000 mg per day (500–1500 mg/day).

### Standardizing vitamin D assays: the way forward [^1172k3oe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

For a number of years it has been widely assumed that measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the best approach to assessing an individual's vitamin D status. However, it has also been recognized that there is substantial within-assay variation in 25(OH)D measurement and even greater between-assay variability. Such assay variation clearly confounds attempts to define what constitutes the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Importantly, assay variability makes pooling of 25(OH)D results from different studies in systematic reviews for the specific purpose of determining dose-response and/or clinical cut points at best problematic. Therefore, to develop and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, it is essential that 25(OH)D measurement be standardized in both clinical and research laboratories. In this Perspective we outline a way forward toward achieving this goal-the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Vitamin D testing: advantages and limits of the current assays [^111CcFYg]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has become a pandemic health problem with a consequent increase of requests for determining circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. However, the analytical performance of these immunoassays, including radioimmunoassay and ELISA, is highly variable, and even mass spectrometric methods, which nowadays serves as the gold standard for the quantitatively determination of 25(OH)D, do not necessarily produce comparable results, creating limitations for the definition of normal vitamin D status ranges. To solve this problem, great efforts have been made to promote standardization of laboratory assays, which is important to achieve comparable results across different methods and manufacturers. In this review, we performed a systematic analysis evaluating critically the advantages and limits of the current assays available for the measure of vitamin D status, i.e., circulating 25(OH)D and its metabolites, making suggestions that could be used in the clinical practice. Moreover, we also suggest the use of alternatives to blood test, including standardized surveys that may be of value in alerting health-care professionals about the vitamin D status of their patients.

### Reducing overutilisation of serum vitamin D testing at a tertiary care centre [^113XyVZW]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

The northern latitude in Canada results in many Canadians receiving insufficient sun exposure to synthesise adequate 25-OH vitamin D endogenously. Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) (a national campaign to reduce unnecessary testing and treatments in the Canadian healthcare system), recommends against routine measurement of 25-OH vitamin D in most individuals and instead recommends routine supplementation. Measurement of 25-OH vitamin D levels should be limited to patients who are more likely to require more aggressive therapy, such as patients with osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, or malabsorption.

Orders for 25-OH vitamin D testing may be considered inappropriate not only due to the indication for testing, but also due to frequency of testing. Osteoporosis Canadarecommends waiting 3–4 months after adequate supplementation before repeating the 25-OH vitamin D measurement and not repeating the test once an optimal level (≥ 75 nmol/L) is achieved. Therefore, both the reason for testing and the frequency of testing were aspects that we felt could potentially be targeted at our site to reduce unnecessary orders for 25-OH vitamin D and 1,25 di-OH vitamin D testing.

There have been efforts to try to restrain the surge in 25-OH vitamin D testing. In 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care limited eligibility for coverage of 25-OH vitamin D testing at private laboratories to patients with osteoporosis/osteopenia, rickets, malabsorption syndromes, or renal disease, or patients on medications that affect vitamin D metabolism. In 2010, British Columbia published a guideline on appropriate 25-OH vitamin D testing and restricted coverage of 25-OH vitamin D testing to orders from specialists or patients less than 19 years old. Based on the efforts in Ontarioand British Columbia, Alberta released its guideline for 25-OH vitamin D testing in 2014. Furthermore, in 2015, Alberta implemented a policy whereby coverage for 25-OH vitamin D testing had to be requested by a new provincial requisition form that had one of the following acceptable indications checked off: metabolic bone disease, abnormal blood calcium, malabsorption syndromes, chronic renal disease, or chronic liver disease. This initiative resulted in a 91% decrease in testing. In all of these situations, patients could pay out of pocket for the test if they did not meet the provincial testing criteria.

### Genome-wide association study of circulating vitamin D levels [^115Fs2uw]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The primary form of circulating vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], is a modifiable quantitative trait associated with multiple medical outcomes, including osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, selected malignancies, and especially colorectal cancer, with rickets being the most common expression of severe clinical vitamin D deficiency in children. The concentration of 25(OH)D in blood, which reflects endogenous generation through ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure as well as exogenous dietary and supplemental vitamin D intake, is considered the best indicator of vitamin D status. Following metabolic activation to 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] through multiple hydroxylation steps, vitamin D has pleiotropic effects in addition to its traditional role in calcium homeostasis; for example, vitamin D receptor response elements directly or indirectly influence cell cycling and proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

Calcitriol

Calcitriol is the active hormonal form of vitamin D and the natural VDR ligand. It promotes active intestinal calcium absorption and suppresses PTH secretion. Calcitriol has a short half-life of around 5 to 8 hours; therefore, it should be administered daily (or with intermittent regimens) and sometimes in lower doses distributed over a 24-hour period. As calcitriol is not an organic micronutrient, its use in clinical practice requires careful monitoring. Calcitriol increases the activity of CYP24A1, which stimulates the degradation of 25(OH)D. This results in serum 25(OH)D not being useful as a marker of adequate vitamin D supplementation and reduced potential benefits of physiological extrarenal/local production of calcitriol due to reduced substrate availability. Moreover, some studies have reported a more significant incidence of adverse events such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Thus, there is a need to monitor serum and urine calcium and phosphate. Because of these safety and clinical practicality issues, there is consensus that calcitriol use should be limited to hormone replacement for patients with limited/absent renal tubular 1-α-hydroxylase activity, as their capacity to produce calcitriol is severely limited. Indeed, calcitriol was first used to treat patients with vitamin D–resistant rickets type 1. Other indications are X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, chronic hypoparathyroidism, as an alternative to the use of the native missing hormone PTH, and moderate-to-severe kidney failure when calcitriol production is impaired or to suppress excessive PTH secretion. This use helps to control secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone diseases. However, as calcitriol use is associated with frequent hypercalcemia, its use could be replaced by analogues with less calcemic activity approved for use in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure, in particular maxacalcitol (22-oxa-1,25(OH) 2 D 3) and falecalcitriol (1,25(OH) 2–26,27-F6-D 3), which are currently available in Japan, and paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25(OH) 2 D 2) and doxercalciferol (1α(OH)D2), available in the United States. Calcitriol has also been proposed for the treatment of osteoporosis, but it is not approved in this setting.

### Reducing overutilisation of serum vitamin D testing at a tertiary care centre [^111xiGWB]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Problem

The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care reported that in Ontario approximately 29 000 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D tests were performed in 2004 and more than 700 000 were performed in 2009, representing an increase of approximately 2500%. Other provinces in Canada, as well as other countrieshave also reported dramatic increases in 25-OH vitamin D testing over the past two decades.

The Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine is responsible for laboratory testing for several hospitals within the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) and St. Joseph's Healthcare London (SJHC) organisations. In total, these hospitals provide tertiary care to a population of approximately 1.5 million in the region of London, Ontario, Canada. At LHSC/SJHC, we began analysing 25-OH vitamin D in-house in January 2009 and since that time, our test volumes had continued to rise from 2130 in 2009 to 6108 in 2017, which is an increase of almost threefold in 8 years.

We decided to develop and implement a rational policy for 25-OH vitamin D testing at LHSC/SJHC to ensure testing was being limited to appropriate clinical indications. We chose to include 1,25 dihydroxy (1,25 di-OH) vitamin D testing in our initiative because of the higher costs associated with this assay and the concern that it might sometimes be ordered in error when 25-OH vitamin D would be the indicated test.

Serum 25OHD Levels and Screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care. For upper levels of serum 25OHD, sparse data are available, particularly regarding long-term effects of chronically high concentrations, and a margin of safety for public health recommendations is prudent. Thus, serum 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter) should raise concerns among clinicians about potential adverse effects.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

### Blood biomarkers of vitamin D status [^111Pgz2L]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

In the past quarter century, more than 50 metabolites of vitamin D have been described. To date, only a few of these have been quantified in blood, but this has widened our understanding of the pathologic role that altered vitamin D metabolism plays in the development of diseases of calcium homeostasis. Currently, awareness is growing of the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in the general population in association with an increased risk of several diseases. However, for many researchers, it is not clear which vitamin D metabolites should be quantified and what the information gained from such an analysis tells us. Only 2 metabolites, namely, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], have received the greatest attention. Of these, the need for measuring serum 1,25(OH)2D is limited, and this metabolite should therefore not be considered as part of the standard vitamin D testing regimen. On the other hand, serum 25(OH)D provides the single best assessment of vitamin D status and thus should be the only vitamin D assay typically performed. Currently, numerous formats exist for measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This article reviews the currently available methods for serum 25(OH)D quantitation and considers important issues such as whether both the D2 and the D3 forms of the vitamin should be assayed, whether total or free concentrations are most important, and what measures should be taken to ensure the fidelity of the measurements.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### The noncalciotropic actions of vitamin D: recent clinical developments [^111Xr76t]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recently described actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D beyond its function in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism.

Recent Findings

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates the innate immune system, facilitating the clearance of infections such as tuberculosis. Hypovitaminosis D has been associated with several autoimmune disorders, various malignancies, and cardiovascular risk factors in a number of recent epidemiologic reports. Based on these observational reports, vitamin D and its analogues are being evaluated for the prevention and treatment of a variety of conditions, with early findings showing mixed results.

Summary

The broad tissue distribution of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1alpha-hydroxylase enzyme and the vitamin D receptor establish a role for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the pathophysiology of various disease states and provide new therapeutic targets for vitamin D and its analogues.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

Conclusions

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the VDR has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of the evaluation of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international societies and guidelines can differ due to the different approaches used, including clinical perspectives (level of cutoff at which no individual has an undesirable outcome) or public health perspectives (level of cutoff at which 97.5% of individuals do not have an undesirable outcome). Another critical issue is the lack of an accepted laboratory test assay standardization, and this prevents a proper interpretation of data reported by different studies, resulting in enabling rational data pooling and implementation of meta-analyses focused on vitamin D influence in various clinical outcomes of interest. Thus, 25(OH)D laboratory assays should be monitored in their performance through external quality assessment plans providing target reference values from standardized measurement procedures.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

### Reducing overutilisation of serum vitamin D testing at a tertiary care centre [^115hTbFa]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

One of the limitations of our method is that we did not include any specific balancing measures. While we believe that our approach targeted inappropriate testing of 25-OH vitamin D or 1,25 di-OH vitamin D rather than reducing appropriate testing, we cannot prove it. We also cannot be sure there were no unintended consequences. However, our project was designed to ensure that appropriate reasons for 25-OH vitamin D or 1,25 di-OH vitamin D testing would be allowed. We consulted other published guidelines when preparing our lists of acceptable testing indications and sought input from a large number of individuals (physician experts, frequent orderers and dieticians).

There were no significant differences in the percentage of 25-OH vitamin D results falling into each category as a result of our intervention (figure 5B), but because the total amount of 25-OH vitamin D testing decreased, there were fewer patients in the deficient or insufficient range who would have received testing. However, for 25-OH vitamin D, it is well-recognised that much of the Canadian population has suboptimal levels and CWC recommends routine supplementation over routine testing. There is also a variety of evidence to suggest that even when 25-OH vitamin D is measured and found to be low, it often does not result in improvement in the patient's 25-OH vitamin D level. Wei et al observed that in patients who had 25-OH vitamin D measured and then re-measured 300–400 days later at a healthcare centre in California, only 8% more patients had 25-OH vitamin D levels considered sufficient (≥ 75 nmol/L) approximately 1 year after the initial testing. Similarly, Quaggiotto et al noted that while 25-OH vitamin D testing increased 730% between 2001 and 2010 in Australia, no significant difference in the rate of deficiency (≤ 50 nmol/L) or insufficiency (51–75 nmol/L) was observed over this period. Thus, there is little evidence that measurement of the 25-OH vitamin D level results in improvement of the patient's level. We do not have any information about the rates of vitamin D supplementation prior to or following our intervention.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, AACE/ACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to prescribe vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000–2,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily in most patients, to keep the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 30 ng/mL.

### Vitamin D metabolites and the gut microbiome in older men [^111zGYdH]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We report robust correlations between the vitamin D metabolites, 1,25(OH) 2 D and 24,25(OH) 2 D, and the gut microbiome in 567 older men representing six geographic sites across the United States. Those men with higher levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D had greater α-diversity, even after adjusting for previously characterized determinants of microbial diversity including age, geographical origin, race, PPI, and antibiotic use. Notably, 1,25(OH) 2 D levels exhibited a much greater effect size on α-diversity than these other covariates. Similar findings were found with 1,25(OH) 2 D and β-diversity.

When examining those with the highest levels of each of the vitamin D measures compared to those with the corresponding lowest levels, men with the highest 1,25(OH) 2 D and/or activation ratios were more likely to harbor specific genera known to be butyrate producers or to provide the substrate for bacteria that produce butyrate.

Strikingly, 25(OH)D was not strongly associated with any microbiota measures, whether assessing α-diversity, β-diversity, or specific sOTUs. Serum 25(OH)D is the preferred clinical measure used because it is representative of overall body stores of vitamin D; however, our results suggest that it is the regulation of VDM, reflected by the active hormone and metabolic ratios rather than body stores that may have the most health implications. The most recent evidence to date does not support global vitamin D supplementation in community-dwelling adults in the general population unless it is targeted at those with pre-existing skeletal disease and 25(OH)D levels in the deficient range. Further complicating the clinical understanding of whether there is an indication for prescribing vitamin D supplementation, the largest randomized controlled trial of vitamin D3 2000 IU versus placebo daily to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer in over 25,000 older adults reported no benefit.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1111gZrQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — 25(OH)D assay considerations emphasize that measurement of serum 25(OH)D is challenging because assay variability is high and between-assay calibration is poor, with intra- and interassay variability much greater at lower 25(OH)D levels. Although mean serum 25(OH)D differs depending on the assay method (RIA, chemiluminescence, or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), the relative ranking is similar between assays; the International Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme is an effort to harmonize 25(OH)D assays, and the latitude between reference and toxic levels is quite wide.

For the analysis, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 values were categorized according to the time of blood sampling: at hospital admission (day −16 to −6, baseline), around HSCT (day −2 to 7, peritransplant), early follow-up around day 14 (day 11 to 17), day 21 (day 18 to 24), day 28 (day 25 to 31), and late follow-up (day 32 to 100). Missing baseline levels for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 were observed for 16 or 19, respectively, out of 143 patients; these were imputed by the median of existing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 baseline levels (82 pM or 43.5 nM, respectively). In the discovery cohort, median levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 at baseline were 172.0 pM and 54.0 nM, respectively. At the time of HSCT (day −2 to 7), at least one serum value for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and for 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 was available for each patient due to our inclusion criteria. If multiple serum values within baseline, peritransplant or early follow-up intervals (until day 31) were available, the measurement closest to day −10, 0, 14, 21, or 28, respectively, was used. For the late follow-up (day 32 to 100), the median of the available 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 or 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 serum levels, respectively, was used.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11521r9m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — 25(OH)D testing and targets indicates that serum 25(OH)D measurement is recommended in men at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, including men with osteomalacia, osteoporosis, malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, bariatric surgery, etc.), and liver disease, as well as older men with a history of falls and those taking medications that alter vitamin D status, such as some anticonvulsants. Many experts support a minimum desirable 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) for bone health, whereas a committee of the IOM concluded that 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) was adequate for bone health; it should be noted that the IOM recommendations are for healthy individuals and may not be appropriate for patients with osteoporosis, and for men at high risk of fracture, we are recommending a target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/ml, consistent with The Endocrine Society 2011 Clinical Practice Guidelines on Evaluation, Treatment, and Prevention of Vitamin D Deficiency.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 but not the clinically applied marker 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 predicts survival after stem cell transplantation [^114YWG77]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of the current study is that retrospective studies are unable to correct for changes in practice at each facility over time. Each cohort was transplanted at different times and under different protocols. Furthermore, historical controls are used and there are limitations to using such controls for studies. However, a clear strength of our data are our independent replication stage that replicates the initial finding and generalizes the effect to other clinical settings including other modes of vitamin D supplementation or other clinical approaches towards concomitant therapy. This overcomes the potentially perceived limitation of the discovery cohort, that the high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation administered to the discovery cohort patients is not standard care of HSCT patients. While each of the replication cohorts is not large and thus we refrained from statistical testing by replication cohort separately, the joint replication data with 365 HSCT patients are substantial and results are stable between discovery and replication as well as across different analyses approaches and models with different baseline risk factor control. Therefore, our data suggests 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 at the time of HSCT as a predictive factor for TRM.

In summary, our data highlight the apparently underestimated role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and its value to predict outcome of allogeneic HSCT. Whether supplementation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 analogs could improve patient survival needs to be addressed in future prospective studies.

### IOM committee members respond to endocrine society vitamin D guideline [^113736uM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

Replication cohorts support the predictive value of peritransplant 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 for 1-year TRM independent of severe aGvHD

To replicate our finding from the discovery cohort, we collected serum for the relevant time interval, peritransplant, from three independent replication cohorts. Peritransplant 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and, for comparison, also peritransplant 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 were measured yielding an analyzable replication dataset of 365 patients. Our replication stage was designed to replicate our initial finding and to generalize to other clinical settings. Of note, the type of vitamin D3 supplementation varied between the three cohorts: same high-dose supplementation as in the discovery cohort (replication cohort I), moderate supplementation (replication cohort II), or no supplementation (replication cohort III). The level of supplementation was reflected in the cohort-specific levels of peritransplant 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 (Table 2). When separating the 365 patients in the joint replication data by the optimal cutoff for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 at 139.5 pM, we found a larger proportion of TRM among patients with low vs. high levels (24.2% vs. 8.9%, Fig. 3a). This was also observed for each of the three replication cohorts separately (33.3% vs. 8.2%, 28.0% vs. 9.4%, 19.4% vs. 10.3%, respectively, Fig. 3b-d). We also found clearly separated Kaplan–Meier survival curves in each of the replication cohorts and overall.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^111jHwZu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 5: Micronutrients — vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outlines threshold definitions, testing, supplementation, and safety. Some, but not all, guidelines have defined insufficiency of vitamin D by serum 25(OH)D level between 20 and 29 ng/mL, deficiency as 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency as serum 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/mL. Both the KDOQI and KDIGO reports recommend checking and supplementing low serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CKD and dialysis patients. In the most recent update of the KDIGO guideline on MBD, it is suggested based on low-quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 1–5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be individualized according to baseline values and interventions; however, there was no clear suggestion on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed. Current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1–5D and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population, and it has been recommended for 1,000 to 2,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol for vitamin D repletion for the general population, although KDOQI acknowledges that patients with CKD may require a more aggressive therapeutic plan. Because in CKD there is no clear evidence about the superiority of cholecalciferol, clinicians should use the form commercially available in the context of their clinical practice. The tolerable upper intake level proposed by the IOM for the general population is 4,000 IU/d, there is no recommendation of a safe dose of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol supplementation to prevent toxicity or adverse effects such as hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in CKD, and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered, especially for patients who are using calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D active analogues.
