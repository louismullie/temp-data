## Question

Kidney stones treatments

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about kidney stone treatments, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify stones and frame the clinical scenario. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Next, I will consider acute management, including analgesia and medical expulsive therapy. After that, I need to evaluate surgical indications and modality selection by stone size, location, and composition. I will then examine prevention strategies, including diet, fluids, and pharmacotherapy, and reconcile conflicting evidence on thiazides. Finally, I should address special populations, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness, and close with a concise decision framework that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification and clinical context because treatment hinges on stone type, size, location, symptoms, and patient factors; calcium oxalate predominates, uric acid stones are radiolucent and pH-dependent, struvite implies infection, and cystine reflects a genetic disorder, while size thresholds like ≤ 10 mm, 10–20 mm, and > 20 mm, and location such as lower pole, ureter, or kidney, drive procedural choice and urgency of intervention [^117KsZFW] [^113iGja4] [^114HaT5Z].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment; noncontrast CT is the gold standard for acute suspected stones, ultrasound is first-line to avoid radiation and is preferred in pregnancy, and KUB is useful for tracking known radio-opaque stones, with MRI reserved for select cases; I should also confirm that labs include urinalysis, urine culture when infection is suspected, and basic metabolic panel, reserving 24-hour urine for prevention workups rather than acute management [^113iGja4] [^117GnFPB] [^1123ooAc].

> I need to ensure acute pain control is addressed immediately; NSAIDs are first-line for renal colic, with opioids as second-line when NSAIDs are contraindicated or insufficient, and I should double-check that NSAIDs are avoided in significant CKD or bleeding risk, while ensuring adequate hydration if dehydrated and initiating observation for uncomplicated ureteral stones ≤ 10 mm with close follow-up imaging [^113iGja4] [^1123ooAc] [^116GM3CA].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of medical expulsive therapy; alpha-blockers can be offered for distal ureteral stones, especially 5–10 mm, to modestly increase stone-free rates and shorten time to passage, but I need to confirm that MET is not a substitute for urgent intervention in the presence of infection, obstruction with a solitary kidney, intractable pain, or high-risk anatomy, and that reimaging is prudent if passage is suspected or management would change [^113b1knd] [^1123ooAc] [^116GM3CA].

> Let me consider when to intervene surgically; I should confirm that indications include persistent symptoms after 4–6 weeks of observation/MET, stones > 10 mm, obstructing stones with infection, a solitary kidney, or high-risk anatomy, and I need to remember that asymptomatic calyceal stones may be observed unless they grow, cause obstruction, infection, or pain, aligning with guideline triggers for active treatment [^114thHXV] [^111Q4Jqe] [^1164Nh8z].

> Next, I should review modality selection for ureteral stones; for ≤ 10 mm distal ureteral stones, observation with or without MET is reasonable, and if that fails, ureteroscopy achieves higher single-session stone-free rates than SWL though with greater invasiveness, so shared decision-making is essential, and I should double-check that SWL is less effective for dense or impacted stones and in certain anatomic configurations [^113b1knd] [^114thHXV].

> For renal stones, let me think about size-based algorithms; for ≤ 10 mm non–lower pole stones, SWL or URS are both acceptable with URS favored for faster stone clearance and lower retreatment, for 10–20 mm stones URS or PCNL are preferred with PCNL offering higher stone-free rates but more morbidity, and for > 20 mm or staghorn calculi PCNL is first-line given superior clearance, with SWL generally not recommended as first-line in this size range; I should confirm exceptions such as severe obesity where URS may be preferred and when PCNL is not feasible, SWL or flexible URS are alternatives despite higher likelihood of secondary procedures [^113JN6HC] [^116AWQyb] [^114RydjN] [^116n7mRa] [^117XtmUZ].

> But wait, what about lower pole stones; I should verify that SWL is less effective in the lower pole due to fragment clearance limitations, so for > 10 mm lower pole stones PCNL achieves the highest stone-free rate albeit with greater morbidity, while URS is a reasonable alternative when minimizing invasiveness is prioritized, and patients should be counseled on trade-offs including potential stent placement and retreatment [^1133KTYX] [^113qqnmP].

> I will now examine stone composition–specific considerations; for uric acid stones, alkalinization with potassium citrate to target urine pH around 6.0–6.5 is first-line and can dissolve stones, whereas allopurinol is not first-line if urine remains acidic, for cystine stones I need to ensure aggressive hydration, sodium and protein restriction, and alkalinization to pH ~7.0, adding a thiol agent like tiopronin if needed, and for struvite stones surgical removal is primary with acetohydroxamic acid reserved for residual or recurrent stones when surgery is not feasible [^115kZGcy] [^112aqggd] [^111yT3ym] [^1178fxqJ].

> Let me reconsider prevention because recurrence is common; I should confirm that all patients benefit from high fluid intake targeting > 2–2.5 L/day urine output, dietary sodium restriction, normal dietary calcium rather than restriction, moderation of animal protein, and tailored oxalate guidance, with 24-hour urine testing guiding pharmacotherapy such as potassium citrate for hypocitraturia or low pH, thiazides for hypercalciuria, and allopurinol for hyperuricosuria in calcium oxalate formers [^1158TN5x] [^1123ooAc] [^115SoG9a] [^1119afhY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought thiazides were broadly effective for recurrent calcium stones, but I should double-check newer evidence; recent high-quality data including the NOSTONE RCT and contemporary meta-analyses suggest thiazide monotherapy does not significantly reduce recurrence versus placebo, so I need to correct my earlier assumption and advocate a more restrictive, selective use of thiazides, reserving them for confirmed hypercalciuria and ensuring close monitoring for metabolic and cardiovascular adverse effects [^112hGQg7] [^116xC9P1] [^111Tf3Vk].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence; after initiating preventive therapy, a single 24-hour urine at about 6 months is reasonable, then annually if stone activity persists, with consideration of tapering or stopping therapy if the patient remains stone-free for years, and I need to ensure repeat stone analysis if the clinical course changes or response is suboptimal to detect shifts in composition [^1114hkZw] [^113GACcT] [^114j2TZd].

> Next, I should review special populations; in pregnancy, ultrasound is preferred and radiation-sparing strategies are prioritized, in children with stones > 15–20 mm PCNL achieves better clearance than URS though both are acceptable, and in patients on anticoagulation, URS is generally preferred over SWL or PCNL; I need to ensure shared decision-making incorporates these nuances and local expertise [^117GnFPB] [^1123efKW] [^114TfmUt].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of cost-effectiveness; while not dictating bedside decisions, awareness that endourologic approaches have supplanted SWL in many settings due to evolving technology and outcomes, and that tubeless or totally tubeless PCNL may reduce length of stay and pain, can inform systems-level choices and patient counseling, though evidence certainty varies and local resources matter [^116jcm9n] [^114BYKyM].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework; classify stone by size, location, and composition, assess symptoms, infection, obstruction, and kidney function, choose observation with MET versus intervention based on guideline thresholds and patient preference, select SWL, URS, or PCNL according to size, location, anatomy, and comorbidities, and embed prevention from the outset with fluids, diet, and targeted pharmacotherapy, correcting course with 24-hour urine feedback and repeat stone analysis as needed [^113iGja4] [^114HaT5Z] [^1158TN5x].

---

Kidney stone treatment is individualized by stone size, location, composition, and patient factors, with **observation and medical expulsive therapy** for small ureteral stones [^113b1knd], and **ureteroscopy or shockwave lithotripsy** for larger or persistent stones [^114thHXV] [^116jcm9n]. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is used for **large (> 2 cm) or complex stones** [^114RydjN], while open surgery is rare [^116jcm9n]. Prevention focuses on high fluid intake, dietary sodium restriction, and targeted pharmacologic therapy (thiazides, allopurinol, potassium citrate) based on metabolic evaluation [^1158TN5x] [^1119afhY] [^115x1LvW]. Recurrence is common, so **ongoing metabolic monitoring and patient education** are essential [^113GACcT] [^117KsZFW].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for **small, non-obstructing stones** or for patients who are poor surgical candidates.

- **Observation**: Small asymptomatic stones (< 5 mm) may be observed with periodic imaging and clinical follow-up [^1164Nh8z] [^1123ooAc] [^111WEH6Z].

- **Hydration**: Increased fluid intake to maintain urine output > 2.2 L/day reduces recurrence risk [^115SoG9a] [^115x1LvW].

- **Dietary modifications**: Sodium restriction, normal calcium intake, and moderation of animal protein are recommended [^1119afhY].

- **Medical expulsive therapy (MET)**: Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin) facilitate passage of distal ureteral stones ≤ 10 mm [^113b1knd] [^116GM3CA].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy aims to prevent recurrence by targeting underlying metabolic abnormalities identified on **24-hour urine testing** [^111bF2gs].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | Hypercalciuria | Reduce urinary calcium excretion [^113osJRF] |
| Allopurinol | Hyperuricosuria | Reduces uric acid production [^notfound] |
| Potassium citrate | Hypocitraturia, uric acid/cystine stones | Alkalinizes urine, inhibits crystal formation [^114LZj7F] [^112aqggd] |
| Acetohydroxamic acid | Struvite stones | Inhibits bacterial urease, prevents stone growth [^notfound] |

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical options are selected based on stone size, location, composition, and patient factors [^113iGja4].

Key differences include:

| **Aspect** | **Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (swl)** | **Ureteroscopy (urs)** | **Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Indication | Non-lower pole renal stones ≤ 20 mm; ureteral stones ≤ 10 mm [^113JN6HC] [^1157iSWb] | Ureteral and renal stones; particularly effective for lower pole stones and hard stones [^113qqnmP] | Large (> 2 cm) or complex renal stones [^114RydjN] |
| Advantages | Non-invasive, outpatient procedure | High stone-free rates, ability to treat all stone types | High stone-free rates for large stones |
| Limitations | Lower efficacy for lower pole stones, hard stones, or obese patients [^1133KTYX] | Invasive, potential for ureteral injury, need for anesthesia [^notfound] | Invasive, potential for significant complications (e.g. bleeding, infection) [^114BYKyM] |

---

### Open and laparoscopic surgery

Open and laparoscopic surgery are reserved for rare cases with **complex anatomy**, failure of minimally invasive techniques, or very large stones [^1173XcdF].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **miniaturized PCNL** techniques (mini-micro) that reduce invasiveness while maintaining efficacy [^1133KTYX], and **digital health** tools — mobile apps and telemedicine — that support adherence and monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention focuses on **lifestyle and medical measures**:

- **Fluid intake**: Maintain urine output > 2.2 L/day [^115SoG9a].

- **Dietary changes**: Sodium restriction, normal calcium intake, moderation of animal protein [^1119afhY].

- **Medical therapy**: Thiazides, allopurinol, potassium citrate based on metabolic evaluation [^1123ooAc].

- **Regular follow-up**: Annual 24-hour urine testing and imaging to monitor recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Age and comorbidities**: Influence surgical risk and choice of intervention [^112AsZq1].

- **Stone composition**: Determines medical therapy and surgical approach [^113iGja4].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential [^111yjKAT].

---

## Complications and side effects

Complications and side effects vary by modality: **SWL** may cause hematoma, infection, and residual fragments; **URS** carries risks of ureteral injury, bleeding, and infection; and **PCNL** may lead to bleeding, infection, and organ injury. Medical therapy can cause gastrointestinal upset, electrolyte disturbances, and hypersensitivity reactions.

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence rates

Recurrence is common: **5-year recurrence is 35–50%** without prevention, and 20–30% with preventive measures. Prevention with hydration, diet, and medical therapy significantly reduces recurrence [^115eHVq4] [^115x1LvW].

---

Kidney stone management spans conservative, medical, and surgical approaches, with **treatment tailored to stone and patient factors** and prevention central to reducing recurrence.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis [^113iGja4]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The European Association of Urology urolithiasis guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease. Given the complexity and variability of stone formation, individualised patient management is emphasised.

Methods

The guidelines incorporate evidence from the latest research and focus on risk assessment, imaging techniques, pharmacological management, and surgical interventions. A research librarian conducted literature searches for urolithiasis in the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase databases via Dialog-Datastar. The strength of recommendations is also rated.

Key Findings and Limitations

Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, biochemical evaluation, and imaging, with ultrasound as the first-line modality and low-dose computed tomography as the gold standard for precise stone assessment. Stone composition and burden influence treatment decisions with algorithms primarily based on stone size, location, and composition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended for first-line pain management, with opioids reserved as a secondary option. Medical expulsive therapy with α-blockers may be considered for selected patients with ureteral stones. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy remain the primary intervention modalities, with selection based on stone characteristics and patient factors. Advances in multiplanar imaging have improved assessment of the stone burden, although further research is needed to refine predictive models. Genetic testing is recommended for high-risk patients to guide personalised treatment.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making while acknowledging the need for continued advances in urolithiasis.

Context

The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney stone disease.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

Both original and review articles were found via PubMed search reporting on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of kidney stones. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field.

Conclusion

Nephrolithiasis remains a major economic and health burden worldwide. Nephrolithiasis is considered a systemic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease, bone loss and fractures, increased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. Further understanding of the pathophysiological link between nephrolithiasis and these systemic disorders is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^1158TN5x]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — medical management of kidney stones — scope and evidence base: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature. The primary source of evidence was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) on recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults, and to augment the AHRQ report the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori; in total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions. Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of a screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients. Kidney stone disease burden is highlighted as affecting nearly 1 in 11 individuals in the United States and as likely to recur, with at least 50% of individuals experiencing another stone within 10 years of the first occurrence. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identify high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is likely to be effective in reducing stone recurrence.

### An overview of kidney stone imaging techniques [^117GnFPB]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone imaging is an important diagnostic tool and initial step in deciding which therapeutic options to use for the management of kidney stones. Guidelines provided by the American College of Radiology, American Urological Association, and European Association of Urology differ regarding the optimal initial imaging modality to use to evaluate patients with suspected obstructive nephrolithiasis. Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis consistently provides the most accurate diagnosis but also exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Traditionally, ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT, but does not require use of radiation. However, when these imaging modalities were compared in a randomized controlled trial they were found to have equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department. Both modalities have advantages and disadvantages. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) plain film radiography is most helpful in evaluating for interval stone growth in patients with known stone disease, and is less useful in the setting of acute stones. MRI provides the possibility of 3D imaging without exposure to radiation, but it is costly and currently stones are difficult to visualize. Further developments are expected to enhance each imaging modality for the evaluation and treatment of kidney stones in the near future. A proposed algorithm for imaging patients with acute stones in light of the current guidelines and a randomized controlled trial could aid clinicians.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^115TyouV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Kidney stones are a common health care problem, and their prevalence and incidence are increasing worldwide. The prevalence of kidney stones in the United States is estimated to be approximately 12% in men and 10% in women. Kidney stones can be extremely painful, relapse frequently, and cause enormous health care expenditure, excess morbidity, and reduced quality of life. –

There are a variety of treatment options for kidney stones, including surgical intervention and conservative management. Despite satisfactory outcomes after the intervention, the recurrence rate of kidney stones was high. Without specific treatment, the 5- and 20-year recurrence rates are 40% and 75%, respectively. Kidney stone recurrence is defined as the visible passage of a stone with or without accompanying typical symptoms, a stone requiring urological intervention for removal, or the appearance of new stones or enlargement of preexisting stones on radiological imaging. However, many stones pass without symptoms and are not noticed by patients.

With the increased use of radiologic examinations and the promotion of regular health screening, the detection of asymptomatic kidney stones as incidental findings has become increasingly common. Although the treatment indications for kidney stones are well established, the management strategy for small, nonobstructing, and asymptomatic kidney stones remains controversial. The latest European Association of Urology guidelines for urolithiasis recommend active surveillance with annual follow-up imaging for asymptomatic calyceal stones. In a systematic review of patients with asymptomatic kidney stones undergoing active surveillance, spontaneous stone passage rates varied from 3% to 29%, symptom development from 7% to 77%, stone growth from 5% to 66%, and surgical intervention from 7% to 26%. However, data on the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited. This study aimed to assess the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones as a secondary analysis of prospective data from the randomized multicenter NOSTONE trial, including computed tomography (CT) scan evaluations at the beginning and end of the trial, and to identify covariates for asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage.

### Effectiveness of treatment modalities on kidney stone recurrence [^1119afhY]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is highly prevalent across all demographic groups in the Western world and beyond, and its incidence rates are rising. In addition to the morbidity of the acute event, stone disease often becomes a lifelong problem that requires preventative therapy to diminish ongoing morbidity. Across the majority of stone types, increased fluid intake and targeted dietary modifications are mainstays of therapy. Specific dietary interventions associated with reduced calcium stone risk include adequate dietary calcium intake and restriction of sodium, protein, and oxalate intake, among others. Pharmaceutical therapy may be required if lifestyle changes are insufficient to minimize risk of stone recurrence, and must be targeted to the specific metabolic abnormalities portending risk for a given patient. Therapeutic options for idiopathic calcium stone disease include thiazides, citrate salts, and uric acid-lowering agents. Alkali salts are also the treatment of choice for uric acid stone disease. Management of struvite stone disease is largely surgical, but acetohydroxamic acid is a proven second line therapy. Cystinuria requires lifestyle modifications and may call for thiol-binding agents. Significant heterogeneity of the clinical population with stone disease has previously limited opportunities for large randomized controlled trials. However, as clinical phenotypes and genotypes are increasingly clarified, there are mounting opportunities for targeted randomized controlled trials in stone prevention. In the meantime, the currently available evidence for both lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions is reviewed herein.

### EAU guidelines on interventional treatment for urolithiasis [^116jcm9n]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Management of urinary stones is a major issue for most urologists. Treatment modalities are minimally invasive and include extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), ureteroscopy (URS), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL). Technological advances and changing treatment patterns have had an impact on current treatment recommendations, which have clearly shifted towards endourologic procedures. These guidelines describe recent recommendations on treatment indications and the choice of modality for ureteral and renal calculi.

Objective

To evaluate the optimal measures for treatment of urinary stone disease.

Evidence Acquisition

Several databases were searched to identify studies on interventional treatment of urolithiasis, with special attention to the level of evidence.

Evidence Synthesis

Treatment decisions are made individually according to stone size, location, and (if known) composition, as well as patient preference and local expertise. Treatment recommendations have shifted to endourologic procedures such as URS and PNL, and SWL has lost its place as the first-line modality for many indications despite its proven efficacy. Open and laparoscopic techniques are restricted to limited indications. Best clinical practice standards have been established for all treatments, making all options minimally invasive with low complication rates.

Conclusion

Active treatment of urolithiasis is currently a minimally invasive intervention, with preference for endourologic techniques.

Patient Summary

For active removal of stones from the kidney or ureter, technological advances have made it possible to use less invasive surgical techniques. These interventions are safe and are generally associated with shorter recovery times and less discomfort for the patient.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^116XjQ6s]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology in order to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group therefore was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature in order to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

Methods

Extensive reviews of the literature together with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics, by a working group including of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

Results and Conclusions

Recommendations are given for the management of patients with acute stone colic and for active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, the principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^111yjKAT]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This Guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to Surgical Management of Stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society Guideline. Please refer to Part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the Guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

Results

The Panel identified 12 adult Index Patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional Index Patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, Guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management.

Conclusions

Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This Guideline is intended for use in conjunction with the individual patient's treatment goals. In all cases, patient preferences and personal goals should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^1157PFNL]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Kidney stones have a substantial psychosocial impact, with recurring kidney stone events resulting in limitations to life participation. However, the impacts may be effectively managed by empowering people with kidney stones with consistent and clear guidance on management, particularly nutrition, and acknowledging and addressing the wide-reaching effects of kidney stone related pain. The involvement of people with kidney stones in developing guidelines is critical to identifying the topics and outcomes to ensure their relevance, ultimately enhancing the quality of care and outcomes through supporting self-management of kidney stones.

### Kidney stones: pathophysiology and medical management [^114YWGjd]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The formation of stones in the urinary tract stems from a wide range of underlying disorders. That clinicians look for the underlying causes for nephrolithiasis is imperative to direct management. There are many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, medical prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. Here, I provide a brief general background and focus mainly on pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones. Although important advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single gene defects, the understanding of polygenetic causes of kidney stones is still largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on urinary luminal chemical composition of the precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and needs further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand the pathophysiology.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^1178fxqJ]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — struvite stones notes that clinicians may offer acetohydroxamic acid to patients with residual or recurrent struvite stones only after surgical options have been exhausted (Option; Evidence Strength: Grade B). It adds that struvite stones occur as a consequence of urinary infection with a urease-producing organism and that patients treated for struvite stones may still be at risk for recurrent UTI after stone removal, and in some patients surgical stone removal is not feasible.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116Vb7hr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature.

Materials and Methods

The primary source of evidence for this guideline was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults. To augment and broaden the body of evidence in the AHRQ report, the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori. In total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Results

Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of a screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients.

Conclusions

A variety of medications and dietary measures have been evaluated with greater or less rigor for their efficacy in reducing recurrence rates in stone formers. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identify high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is likely to be effective in reducing stone recurrence.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111r56we]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to give novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

Methods

The webpages of the 61 members of the Societé Internationale d'Urologie were analysed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies.

Results

Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While 7 national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and 11 to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we also identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

Conclusions

Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis. While there is a high grade of consensus for most stone scenarios, we also detected some discrepancies between different guidelines. These are, however, controversial situations where adequate evidence to assist with decision-making has yet to be elicited by further research.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^115kZGcy]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — first-line therapy for uric acid stones states that clinicians should not routinely offer allopurinol as first-line therapy to patients with uric acid stones (Expert Opinion). Reduction of urinary uric acid excretion with the use of allopurinol in patients with uric acid stones will not prevent stones in those with unduly acidic urine, and therefore first-line therapy for patients with uric acid stones is alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate.

### Kidney stones: treatment and prevention [^1123ooAc]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Kidney stones are a common disorder, with an annual incidence of eight cases per 1,000 adults. During an episode of renal colic, the first priority is to rule out conditions requiring immediate referral to an emergency department, then to alleviate pain, preferably with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The diagnostic workup consists of urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess for conditions requiring active stone removal, such as urinary infection or a stone larger than 10 mm. Conservative management consists of pain control, medical expulsive therapy with an alpha blocker, and follow-up imaging within 14 days to monitor stone position and assess for hydronephrosis. Asymptomatic kidney stones should be followed with serial imaging, and should be removed in case of growth, symptoms, urinary obstruction, recurrent infections, or lack of access to health care. All patients with kidney stones should be screened for risk of stone recurrence with medical history, basic laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Lifestyle modifications such as increased fluid intake should be recommended for all patients, and thiazide diuretics, allopurinol, or citrates should be prescribed for patients with recurrent calcium stones. Patients at high risk of stone recurrence should be referred for additional metabolic assessment, which can serve as a basis for tailored preventive measures.

### Pharmacologic treatment of kidney stone disease [^115cvkA5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews the data on pharmacologic treatment of kidney stone disease, with a focus on prophylaxis against stone recurrence. One of the most effective and important therapies for stone prevention, an increase in urine volume, is not discussed because this is a dietary and not a pharmacologic intervention. Also reviewed are medical expulsive therapy used to improve the spontaneous passage of ureteral stones and pharmacologic treatment of symptoms associated with ureteral stents. The goal is to review the literature with a focus on the highest level of evidence (ie, randomized controlled trials).

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART II [^112buQNK]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This Guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents Part II of the two-part series dedicated to Surgical Management of Stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society Guideline. Please refer to Part I for introductory information and a discussion of pre-operative imaging and special cases.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the Guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

Results

The Panel identified 12 adult Index Patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional Index Patients were also created to describe the more commonly encountered special cases, including pediatric and pregnant patients. With these patients in mind, Guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management.

Conclusions

Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This Guideline is intended for use in conjunction with the individual patient's treatment goals. In all cases, patient preferences and personal goals should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^112AsZq1]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A range of procedures is in use for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment strategies are mainly based on stone location and size, and the patient's comorbidities and preferences. Guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment in controversial situations. Several institutions around the world have issued guidelines incorporating the latest evidence.

However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points, such as cut-off values for stone size and recommendations for the treatment of choice. Ambiguities and discrepancies between different guidelines may result from different interpretations of the evidence available and possible methodological differences in guideline creation. Therefore, careful analysis of the similarities and differences between different sources can provide additional insight.

We aimed to determine how many guidelines on the surgical management of urolithiasis actually exist and the urological associations that recommended them. We systematically analysed the criteria proposed for decision-making and the recommended surgical approaches in each guideline. In addition, we aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines, with particular attention to the two major guidelines, those of the EAU and AUA.

This work provides a systematic analysis of the recommended surgical management of urolithiasis worldwide, and gives novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^111Tf3Vk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

HOW SHOULD PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT CALCIUM KIDNEY STONES BE MANAGED IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE RECENT FINDINGS?

We propose to invest energy and time in patient education, such as dietary and physical behavior changes, as first line intervention. If this does not suffice, pharmacological measures should be discussed on a case-to-case basis. Citrate salts are a valid option, although high quality trial evidence is limited. Additionally, CaP stone formation may be triggered by alkali administration, necessitating careful monitoring of treatment and urine pH. In patients with calcium kidney stones that are intolerant, or not responsive to citrate supplementation as monotherapy, long-acting thiazides such as chlorthalidone or indapamide may be tried. Importantly, however, there are currently only theoretical considerations and no robust trial data demonstrating an advantage of these thiazide-like compounds over hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Close monitoring of the patient should be started, and if there is no relevant change in stone activity after 2–3 years of treatment, discontinuation should be explored. The combination of thiazides and alkali therapy may be promising, but has not been tested rigorously so far. Benefits and potential risks associated with long-term use of thiazides should be discussed carefully with each patient.

### Outcomes of dissolution therapy and monitoring for stone disease: should we do better? [^113vasgB]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Surgical management is the cornerstone of urolithiasis treatment, but high recurrence rates and associated complications necessitate the existence of medical treatment options, aiming at dissolution of kidney stones and prevention of recurrence. The purpose of this review is to present the most recent knowledge existing in scientific literature, regarding dissolution therapy and ways of monitoring nephrolithiasis patients.

Recent Findings

A number of laboratory studies have been performed testing experimental treatments (tolvaptan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, a-lipoic acid, glucosaminoglycans, plant extracts), to reduce kidney stone formation and cellular damage and showed encouraging results. Uric acid stones is the main target of dissolution therapy, but until last years, existing level of evidence was low. A number of prospective and randomized studies, proved the efficacy and safety of oral chemolysis for radiolucent stones and associated prognostic features of success. Tolvaptan and a-Lipoic acid were also tested in patients with cystinuria and resulted in reduction of recurrence. Finally, some new diagnostic markers are suggested as tests for the monitoring of urolithiasis patients, with satisfying accuracy and discriminative ability.

Summary

Medical dissolution therapy for nephrolithiasis is an effective option, especially for patients with radiolucent/uric acid stones. In the future, we need clinical trials to confirm the encouraging results of pilot studies testing several agents for patients with cystinuria.

### Nonpharmacologic methods of stone risk reduction: diet and supplements [^113QV5Fb]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article provides background and a rationale for patient-centered, individualized, nonpharmacologic risk reduction for the most common types of kidney stones. An appreciation for the heterogeneity of urolithiasis and how it is expressed across stone formers is reviewed. Evidence-based strategies to address urinary and dietary risk factors are reviewed. Strategies to target risk factors are provided. For appropriate lithogenic risk factors, targeted nonpharmacologic therapies, informed by individualized assessment and consideration of patient-centered factors, is encouraged.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^112hGQg7]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

Kidney stones are the most common condition affecting the kidney, and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (thiazides) are commonly prescribed to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. This review offers a comprehensive up-to-date assessment of the evidence supporting the use of thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention, highlights potential harms associated with treatment, and identifies areas of knowledge that require further investigation.

Recent findings

The clinical routine to prescribe thiazides for kidney stone prevention has recently been challenged by the findings of the large NOSTONE trial that failed to show superiority of hydrochlorothiazide at doses up to 50 mg daily over placebo in preventing a composite of clinical or radiological recurrence in patients at high risk of recurrence. Yet, adverse events such as new onset diabetes mellitus and gout were more common in patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared to placebo. As demonstrated by a novel meta-analysis presented in this review encompassing all randomized placebo-controlled trials with thiazide monotherapy, current trial evidence does not indicate that thiazide monotherapy is significantly better than placebo in preventing kidney stone recurrence.

Summary

Given the limited efficacy and possible adverse effects, we advocate for a restrictive use of thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Clearly, there remains a high unmet medical need for effective, targeted therapies to prevent recurrence of kidney stones.

### The role of open and laparoscopic stone surgery in the modern era of endourology [^1173XcdF]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for kidney stones and ureteral stones have evolved considerably over the past several decades, to the point where almost any stone can now be considered for treatment with a noninvasive or a minimally invasive approach including shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The safety and morbidity associated with these techniques are favourable relative to traditional open surgical approaches to stone removal. However, they also require unique skillsets, access to instrumentation and relatively high maintenance costs, potentially limiting their use on a global scale. Coincident with the emergence of endourology have been considerable improvements in laparoscopic surgical techniques to the point that nearly any open surgery can be performed in a minimally invasive laparoscopic fashion. Such approaches, including those with robotic assistance, have potential application for the treatment of upper urinary tract stones, particularly in complex senarios as well as in areas where access to endourological instruments might be limited.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^113ADUtm]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — epidemiology and risk factors note that the overall prevalence of self-reported kidney stones from 2007–2010 was 8.8%, with a higher prevalence among men (10.6%) than women (7.1%), representing a 70% increase over the last reported prevalence (5.2%) derived from an NHANES sample (1988–1994). Although historically kidney stones have occurred more commonly in men than women, by any number of metrics the gender gap is closing, and the impact of obesity was found to be greater in women than men. Overweight/obesity, hypertension and diabetes have all been shown to be associated with an increased risk of stone disease, and diet and lifestyle affect the risk of developing stones. Some drug therapies have been shown to be superior to placebo, or no-treatment control groups, in randomized trials, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating drug treatments are relatively sparse; diet therapy has never been compared head-to-head with pharmacologic therapy, so recommendations incorporate both diet therapy and pharmacotherapy until the superiority of one over the other can be demonstrated.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^114wACvc]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis. While there is generally a high grade of consensus for most stone scenarios, we also detected some relevant discrepancies between different guidelines. In particular, lower consensus was found for the treatment of proximal ureteral stones and hierarchical levels of recommended treatments for specific situations. These are, however, controversial situations where adequate evidence to assist with decision-making has yet to be elicited by further research.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^116xC9P1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The incidence of recurrence is high in patients with kidney stones. Initial treatment focuses on dietary and behavioral interventions, but this approach is difficult to implement on the long-term and frequently fails to adequately suppress stone formation, necessitating pharmacological treatment. Thiazides have been one of the standard medical treatments for kidney stone prevention. The evidence supporting their use for this indication was largely based on observational data and small trials with methodological limitations. Recent findings challenge this long-held practice. Based on the results of a novel meta-analysis provided in this review that encompasses all double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to date, thiazide monotherapy does not confer a greater advantage over placebo in preventing the recurrence of calcium-containing kidney stones. There is currently also no head-to-head data showing an advantage of thiazide-like compounds, such as chlorthalidone or indapamide compared to hydrochlorothiazide. Given the limited efficacy and possible adverse effects associated with long-term use, we advocate for a restrictive use of thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention. Collectively, these recent findings underscore the high unmet medical need for effective therapies in patients with kidney stones.

### Totally tubeless, tubeless, and tubed percutaneous nephrolithotomy for treating kidney stones [^114BYKyM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is the standard of care for removing large kidney stones (> 2 cm). Once the procedure is complete, different exiting strategies exist to manage the percutaneous tract opening, including placement of an external nephrostomy tube, placement of an internal ureteral stent, or no external or internal tube. The decision to place or not place a tube is handled differently among clinicians and may affect patient outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of tubeless PNL (with ureteral stenting), totally tubeless PNL (without ureteral stenting or nephrostomy), and standard PNL (nephrostomy only) for the treatment of kidney stones in adults.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search in multiple biomedical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science), as well as in two clinical trial registries. We also handsearched reference lists of relevant publications and conference proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. The latest search update was conducted in September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled and quasi-randomized controlled trials of adult patients who received tubeless, totally tubeless, or standard PNL for treating kidney stones. We defined tubeless PNL as no nephrostomy tube, but ureteral stenting, while totally tubeless PNL meant no nephrostomy tube or ureteral stenting. Both interventions were compared to standard PNL with placement of a nephrostomy tube (only). We considered access tubes of any sizes. We only considered unilateral PNL with single-tract access. There were no exclusions on stone composition, size, or location.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were severe adverse events and postoperative pain, and secondary outcomes were operating time, length of hospital stay, and stone-free rate. We used the random-effects model for meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 10 studies in the review. Participant age varied among studies, ranging from 20 to 60 years. Detailed information on stone characteristics was rarely presented. Tubeless PNL versus standard PNL We are very uncertain whether there is a difference in severe adverse events (SAEs) between tubeless PNL and standard PNL (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 16.46; I² = 42%; 2 studies, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tubeless PNL may have little to no effect on pain on postoperative day one (mean difference (MD) 0.56 lower, 95% CI 1.34 lower to 0.21 higher; I² = 84%; 4 studies, 186 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably results in little to no difference in operating room time (MD 0.40 longer (in minutes), 95% CI 4.82 shorter to 5.62 longer; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 81 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tubeless PNL may reduce length of hospital stay (MD 0.90 shorter, 95% CI 1.45 shorter to 0.35 shorter; I² = 84%; 6 studies, 238 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect of tubeless PNL on blood transfusions (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.52; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 161 participants; very low-certainty evidence), sepsis or fever (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.75; I² = not applicable; 2 studies, 82 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or readmissions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.21; I² = not applicable, 1 study, 24 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Totally tubeless versus standard PNL Totally tubeless PNL may result in lower SAE rates (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.25; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence) and pain on postoperative day one (MD 3.60 lower, 95% CI 4.24 lower to 2.96 lower; I² = Not applicable; 1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). Totally tubeless PNL may result in little to no difference in operating room time (MD 6.23 shorter (in minutes), 95% CI 14.29 shorter to 1.84 longer; I² = 72%; 2 studies, 174 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and sepsis or fever (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.97; I² = not applicable; 1 study, 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). Totally tubeless PNL likely shortens the length of hospital stay (MD 1.55 shorter, 95% CI 1.82 shorter to 1.29 shorter; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 274 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect of totally tubeless PNL on blood transfusions (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.48; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 274 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or readmissions (RR not estimable, 95% CI not estimable; I² = not applicable; 1 study, 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no studies comparing tubeless mini versus standard mini-PNL or totally tubeless mini versus standard mini-PNL.

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing tubeless to standard PNL with regard to the predefined primary outcomes of this review, there may be little difference in early postoperative pain, while we are very uncertain of the effect on SAEs. People treated with tubeless PNL may benefit from a reduced length of stay compared to standard PNL. When comparing totally tubeless to standard PNL, early postoperative pain and severe adverse events may be reduced with totally tubeless PNL. The certainty of evidence by outcome was mostly very low (range: moderate to very low) for the comparison of tubeless to standard PNL and low (range: moderate to very low) for the comparison of totally tubeless to standard PNL. The most common reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence were study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. We did not find randomized trial evidence for other comparisons. Overall, further and higher-quality studies are needed to inform clinical practice.

### Kidney stone disease: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^117KsZFW]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common health condition affecting the kidney and urinary tract and constitutes a major global health-care problem. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased substantially over the past five decades, irrespective of age, sex or ethnicity. Kidney stones cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life and enormous health-care expenditure, largely due to their frequent recurrence. Furthermore, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a systemic condition associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and low bone mass. Nephrolithiasis exhibits marked pathophysiological heterogeneity. Dietary and environmental exposures interact with genetic predisposition to shape individual disease risk. Calcium oxalate stones are most prevalent, commonly driven by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and low urine volume, whereas the formation of uric acid and calcium phosphate stones is commonly linked to urinary pH. A comprehensive clinical evaluation can uncover underlying metabolic abnormalities, distinguish idiopathic, secondary and Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis, identify systemic disease associations and guide therapy. Recurrence prevention requires individualized strategies that combine dietary and pharmacological interventions. For established stones, surgical management is effective, with ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieving high stone-free rates. Despite its considerable clinical and societal burden, nephrolithiasis remains under-recognized, underserved and under-researched. Greater awareness and investments in research, innovation and education are urgently needed.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116N6MPx]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — empiric therapy when no metabolic abnormality persists states that clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics and/or potassium citrate to patients with recurrent calcium stones in whom other metabolic abnormalities are absent or have been appropriately addressed and stone formation persists (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). It adds that thiazides and potassium citrate therapy have been shown to prevent recurrent stones in patients with normal range urinary calcium and citrate, respectively, and therefore it may be appropriate to utilize these therapies for patients with recurrent stones who do not demonstrate specific urinary abnormalities, with potassium citrate possibly preferred first-line in patients with no identified risk factors for nephrolithiasis given its relatively low side effect profile.

### Medical management of renal stones [^112UBVsk]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The prevalence of kidney stones is increasing in industrialized nations, resulting in a corresponding rise in economic burden. Nephrolithiasis is now recognized as both a chronic and systemic condition, which further underscores the impact of the disease. Diet and environment play an important role in stone disease, presumably by modulating urine composition. Dietary modification as a preventive treatment to decrease lithogenic risk factors and prevent stone recurrence has gained interest because of its potential to be safer and more economical than drug treatment. However, not all abnormalities are likely to be amenable to dietary therapy, and in some cases drugs are necessary to reduce the risk of stone formation. Unfortunately, no new drugs have been developed for stone prevention since the 1980s when potassium citrate was introduced, perhaps because the long observation period needed to demonstrate efficacy discourages investigators from embarking on clinical trials. Nonetheless, effective established treatment regimens are currently available for stone prevention.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^112oFfcS]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney stones affect about 10% of the adult population, and the incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. About 35% to 50% of people with kidney stones experience recurrence within five years. Kidney stones cause debilitating symptoms, such as vomiting, nausea and pain. Emergency departments are burdened by the presentation of acute pain due to kidney stones, with one of the highest rates of representation at these services. People with kidney stones have reported impaired quality of life, with kidney stones recurrence causing anxiety and low mood. Kidney stones can also limit life participation through impacts on the ability to work, leading to financial concerns and family impacts.

Whilst there are guidelines on the management of kidney stones, they may not address the areas that are relevant to people who have had kidney stones. Integrating patient perspectives and priorities in clinical practice guidelines is now widely advocated to ensure they are meaningful and relevant to patients. The Caring for Australians and New ZealandeRs with kidney Impairment (CARI) Guidelines have also demonstrated that the involvement of people with lived experience of disease broadens the scope of clinical practice guidelines and enhances their relevance and translation.

We convened workshops to identify people with kidney stones perspectives on topics and outcomes to integrate into the CARI Guidelines update on kidney stones management. We also aimed to describe reasons for their selection of topics and outcomes and discuss how their input was integrated by the guideline Working Group into the guideline.

AUA/Endourological Society guideline — non-lower pole renal stones ≤ 20 mm advises that in symptomatic patients with a total non-lower pole renal stone burden ≤ 20 mm, clinicians may offer shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) or ureteroscopy (URS). For stone burdens < 20mm, stone-free rates of both URS and SWL are acceptable and have less morbidity compared to PCNL, and of the two options, URS is associated with a lower likelihood of repeat procedure; therefore, the patient will become stone-free quicker than with SWL. While SWL and URS are acceptable modalities, treatment selection process must include a shared decision-making approach.

### Urolithiasis in kidneys with abnormal lie, rotation or form [^115B2yDM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The treatment options in urolithiasis in kidneys with abnormalities of form and location can be challenging due to abnormal anatomy (calyceal and renal orientation), relative immobility interfering with movement of equipment, and abnormal relation with other visceral organs.

Recent Findings

In this review, we focus on the different techniques and results of various treatment modalities. The approach to managing these stones should be individualized. We also allude to the results of a few recent series and emphasize various treatment options.

Summary

Ultrasound helps in gaining access in ectopic kidneys, in addition to being a diagnostic tool. Computerized tomography is pivotal in helping to decide the management and choosing the method of treatment in anomalous kidneys. Flexible ureteroscopy can be a useful tool in stones less than 2 cm in size with the availability of smaller flexible ureteroscopes and access sheaths. However the surgeon should consider complete 'on table' clearance in these patients as the drainage is likely to be impaired. Ultrasound guided percutaneous approaches for ectopic kidneys should be performed by surgeons well versed with it. Laparoscopic assisted percutaneous nephrolithotomy has shown good clearance rates with minimal morbidity and less likelihood of ancillary procedures. Although adequate fragmentation can be achieved with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, the drainage of fragments might be impaired due to the anatomical abnormalities. The choice of shock wave lithotripsy as a treatment option should be made prudently.

### Medical management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical guideline [^115x1LvW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Optimum management to prevent recurrent kidney stones is uncertain.

Purpose

To evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurrent kidney stones.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane, and other databases through September 2012 and reference lists of systematic reviews and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).

Study Selection

28 English-language RCTs that studied treatments to prevent recurrent kidney stones and reported stone outcomes.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data, a second checked accuracy, and 2 independently rated quality and graded strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

In patients with 1 past calcium stone, low-strength evidence showed that increased fluid intake halved recurrent composite stone risk compared with no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84]). Low-strength evidence showed that reducing soft-drink consumption decreased recurrent symptomatic stone risk (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.98]). In patients with multiple past calcium stones, most of whom were receiving increased fluid intake, moderate-strength evidence showed that thiazides (RR, 0.52 [CI, 0.39 to 0.69]), citrates (RR, 0.25 [CI, 0.14 to 0.44]), and allopurinol (RR, 0.59 [CI, 0.42 to 0.84]) each further reduced composite stone recurrence risk compared with placebo or control, although the benefit from allopurinol seemed limited to patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Other baseline biochemistry measures did not allow prediction of treatment efficacy. Low-strength evidence showed that neither citrate nor allopurinol combined with thiazide was superior to thiazide alone. There were few withdrawals among patients with increased fluid intake, many among those with other dietary interventions and more among those who received thiazide and citrate than among control patients. Reporting of adverse events was poor.

Limitations

Most trial participants had idiopathic calcium stones. Nearly all studies reported a composite (including asymptomatic) stone recurrence outcome.

Conclusion

In patients with 1 past calcium stone, increased fluid intake reduced recurrence risk. In patients with multiple past calcium stones, addition of thiazide, citrate, or allopurinol further reduced risk.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^111WEH6Z]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Kidney stones are highly prevalent and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thus, kidney stones not only cause pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life but also incur tremendous health care costs. However, a significant number of kidney stones pass without symptoms and are not noticed by the patient. Currently, data regarding the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited. This study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones and factors associated with asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage in patients with recurrent calcium-containing stones. We found that a high number of patients (209 of 383; 55%) experienced a stone event within a relatively short follow-up period of 3 years. Interestingly, 36% (158 of 442) of the spontaneous kidney stone passages were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was significantly associated with a higher number of stones on CT at randomization.

With advances in imaging technology, the possibility of detecting asymptomatic kidney stones has increased. Treatment options for kidney stones include active surveillance, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, a treatment strategy for asymptomatic kidney stones is yet to be established. In several guidelines, kidney stones ≤ 5 mm have been considered insignificant; however, the extent to which stone-related events can occur and surgical intervention should be performed in these small stones. According to previously published data, approximately half of patients with asymptomatic kidney stones will have symptoms during the first stone passage, regardless of the size of the stone. However, the number of stones that never passed, and thus did not cause any symptoms, was unknown in this analysis. By contrast, our study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones in recurrent calcium-containing stone formers by using CT imaging at baseline and at the end of follow-up. Thus, we were able to obtain an accurate evaluation of the natural history of all (presumably calcium-containing) kidney stones, including those resulting from asymptomatic stone passage.

### Percutaneous nephrolithotomy vs ureteroscopy for kidney stones in children [^1123efKW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter prospective cohort study that compared percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy for children and adolescents with kidney and/or ureteral calculi, there were no differences in stone clearance, but patient experiences were better for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In a priori heterogeneity of treatment effect analyses, children and adolescents undergoing treatment for large calculi (> 15 mm) with percutaneous nephrolithotomy had better stone clearance than those undergoing ureteroscopy. Shockwave lithotripsy was rarely used for large stones at 31 medical centers in North America, despite American Urological Association guidelines supporting shockwave lithotripsy as a first-line option for large kidney stones. These results strengthen the evidence base supporting percutaneous nephrolithotomy as the first-line surgical intervention for pediatric patients with kidney stones larger than 15 mm and underscore the low contemporary use of shockwave lithotripsy for large kidney stones.

Current US guidelines recommend percutaneous nephrolithotomy and shockwave lithotripsy as first-line surgical treatment for pediatric patients with large kidney stones based on expert opinion. Although we initially proposed to compare shockwave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy to align with clinical guidelines, only 5 patients underwent shockwave lithotripsy for stones larger than 15 mm. This supports our finding of surgeon preferences, wherein many urologists across the US and Canada did not consider shockwave lithotripsy a viable option for large stones, emphasizing the lack of clinical equipoise for these treatments. Instead, urologists considered either percutaneous nephrolithotomy or ureteroscopy, despite limited evidence to support decisions between these treatment modalities. Prior studies that compared alternative treatments of large kidney stones in children and adolescents, are limited by retrospective design, heterogenous outcome definitions, and/or lack of generalizability. Our study addresses many of these uncertainties, further supporting greater stone clearance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy compared with ureteroscopy for stones larger than 15 mm.

### Challenges in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nephrolithiasis [^111bF2gs]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of renal stones is rising along with the costs and morbidity associated with this condition. With careful evaluation and management, the great majority of recurrent stones are preventable. The cornerstone of this evaluation remains the 24-h urine collection. This review details the physiological rationale for commonly requested urine studies and details how these results should guide therapy with special emphasis on recent advances in the understanding of risk factors for stone disease. Challenges associated with the complicated patient will be addressed.

Recent Findings

Long-term follow-up and repeated evaluations are effective at preventing recurrent stones and increasing patient satisfaction. There is growing appreciation of the complexity of dietary risks for stone disease, and traditional risk-factors such as dietary oxalate must be reevaluated.

Summary

The key to stone prevention is the individualization of therapy to specific patient risk factors with a recognition that these factors can change over time leading to a need for alterations in preventive therapies.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^114VRDFN]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric renal stones with total renal stone burden > 20mm — interventional options: In pediatric patients with a total renal stone burden > 20mm, both percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) are acceptable treatment options (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C). Reported outcomes include SWL stone-free rates of 73–83% in pediatric patients and PCNL series that have approached 90% success rates; complication rates are somewhat higher with ureteroscopy (URS), estimated at 12.4%-20.5% in reviews, whereas complication rates may be somewhat lower with SWL at 8%-10%. If SWL is performed, placement of a ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube is recommended to prevent post-procedural obstruction. Selection should consider stone composition and attenuation, stone location, body habitus, collecting system anatomy, relation of the kidney to surrounding viscera, medical co-morbidity, and parental preference, and the utilization of smaller instruments for PCNL (mini-PCNL, micro-PCNL) may limit the risk of hemorrhage.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^116JHNf2]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g., calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate]), and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention. Medications, such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones. However, weight loss could undermine prevention of kidney stones if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration. For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH. Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

Prospective randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that potassium citrate therapy is associated with reduced risk of recurrent calcium stones in patients with low or low normal urinary citrate excretion, calcium stone-forming patients with normal citrate excretion but low urinary pH may also benefit, and potassium citrate is preferred over sodium citrate, as the sodium load in the latter may increase urine calcium excretion.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) remains the treatment of choice for large and complex renal stones. The technological advances over the past several decades gave birth to different varieties of minimally invasive PCNLs, including the mini-PCNL, ultra-mini PCNL, super mini-PCNL, and micro-PCNL, with indications being extended to stones even larger than 20 mm. This article provides an update of all these available techniques of miniaturized PCNL along with its anatomic and physiologic impact. This should assist urologists in providing a personalized approach to the patient based on various patient- and stone-related factors to provide the best of all available technology for treatment.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^116qDkY9]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Concerning hierarchical recommendations, all guidelines give treatment options in multiple scenarios, listed as equal or, in some cases, as first-, second- or third-line surgical treatment. To prevent the loss of recommended second- or third-line surgical therapies in our comparative analysis, we included all surgical procedures proposed as "standard procedures", regardless of their hierarchical position in the guideline text.

Our consensus tree showed a high degree of consensus for most recommended procedures in nearly all ureteral and renal stone scenarios. We did, however, detect some significant differences, mainly concerned with the rating of SWL, where little consensus between guidelines for larger renal, distal ureteral and small proximal ureteral calculi was found. One reason for that might be geographical discrepancies in the technical performance of interventions, such as the strict use of X-ray-localisation systems for SWL in the United States compared to the widely available ultrasound guidance in Europe. Considering the rapid technological improvements of URS and PNL, further evidence seems to be required here.

While the mode tree showed a high degree of agreement for lower pole renal stones of < 10 mm and 10–20 mm and distal ureteral stones, a low level of agreement was found for proximal ureteral stones. This can be explained by the AFU and SUA guidelines also recommending PNL for proximal ureteral stones, and the SAU guidelines also recommending open surgery. However, the reason for this might be rather missing updates of some guidelines in the recent past, than a real lack of evidence for these scenarios. Thus, the last revisions of the SUA and AFU guidelines were issued in 2001 and 2004 and do not, therefore, reflect the latest developments.

All other guidelines clearly focus on SWL and URS in such cases. However, at this point it must be mentioned, that EAU guidelines consider a percutaneous approach for proximal ureteral calculi under the term "antegrade URS" and state that percutaneous antegrade removal of ureteral stones should be considered in selected cases.

Lower pole stones > 10 mm — patient counseling and primary treatment: Clinicians should inform patients with lower pole stones > 10 mm in size that PCNL has a higher stone-free rate but greater morbidity (Index patient 10). Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade B, and treatment options include PCNL, retrograde URS, and SWL; randomized trials demonstrated that PCNL is associated with superior single-treatment stone-free rates, but with greater morbidity, and PCNL should be considered the primary treatment for most cases, with smaller access sheaths (mini-PCNL or micro-PCNL) potentially allowing similar outcomes with lower complication rates; when considering SWL, clinicians should consider collecting system anatomy, stone attenuation, and skin-to-stone distance as they can significantly impact results; when considering URS, clinicians should inform patients about potential inaccessibility due to lower pole anatomy or renal anomalies, and that stones larger than 10mm may require laser treatment in the lower calyx with increased risk of laser fiber failure and ureteroscope damage.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline nomenclature — statement types and evidence strength — defines three recommendation levels and two non-graded statement types. Strong Recommendation applies when 'Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)' and 'Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial'; with 'Evidence Strength C (Low Certainty)' it is 'rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation'. Moderate Recommendation is used when 'Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)' and 'Net benefit (or net harm) is moderate'. Conditional Recommendation reflects 'Benefits = Risks/Burdens', where the 'Best action depends on individual patient circumstances', and when certainty is low the 'Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear' and 'Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable'. Evidence strata are labeled 'Evidence Strength A (High Certainty)', 'Evidence Strength B (Moderate Certainty)', and 'Evidence Strength C (Low Certainty)'. Non-graded statements are defined as Clinical Principle — 'A statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature' — and Expert Opinion — 'A statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence'.

### Dusting, fragmenting, popcorning or dustmenting? [^115TMGWX]. Current Opinion in Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review identifies the latest scientific investigations within the fields of fragmenting and dusting to discuss optimizing treatment. In addition, new settings such as 'popcorning' are scrutinized carefully.

Recent Findings

During the past years, endoscopic techniques have continuously developed and changed the management of the treatment of kidney stones using ureteroscopy (URS). The most currently used energy source for stone disintegration is holmium laser lithotripsy. This technique offers different options for the surgeons to treat their patients suffering from kidney stones.

Summary

URS with the holmium laser allows surgeons to use a variety of different strategies for treating urinary stones. There are two techniques which are most frequently used within this field: firstly fragmenting, using low frequencies and high pulse energy to break stones into small fragments before removal. On the other hand, dusting has been popularized in the field of endourology in recent years. This uses high frequencies and low pulse energy to form fine dust particles which then pass spontaneously down the ureter.

### Clinical effectiveness of calcium oxalate stone treatments [^113osJRF]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lowering kidney stone risk and urine calcium oxalate supersaturation is a primary clinical focus for kidney stone prevention and can be achieved with multiple strategies. Common strategies include advice to increase fluid intake, restrict dietary sodium, or prescribing a thiazide-type diuretic. We investigated how physicians make these decisions in real-world practice and evaluate their efficacy based on 24-h urine collections.

Methods

We reviewed medical charts for 203 kidney stone formers with idiopathic calcium stones from University of Chicago Kidney Stone Clinic between 2005 and 2020. Patients had three 24-h urines before an initial pre-treatment clinic visit and one follow-up 24-h urine. We analyzed changes in urine composition based on treatment advice using t tests and ANOVA.

Results

Patients who received advice to increase fluid intake had lower urine volume at baseline (1.5 vs. 2.5 L/day, p < 0.001) and larger increase in urine volume at follow-up (0.6 vs. 0.1 L/day, p < 0.001) compared to those who did not receive the advice. Patients who were advised to restrict dietary sodium had a higher urine sodium at baseline (208 vs. 139 mEq/day, p < 0.001), a larger reduction in urine sodium (-28 vs. 13 mEq/day, p = 0.002), and larger reduction in urine calcium (-74 vs. -28 mg/day, p = 0.005) compared with those not advised to restrict dietary sodium. Patients started on a thiazide had a higher baseline urine calcium (281 vs. 213 mg/day) and larger reduction in urine calcium (-83 vs. -9 mg/day, p < 0.001) compared with patients not started on a thiazide. In combination, thiazide prescriptions with dietary sodium restriction reduced urine calcium by 99 mg/day and reduced calcium oxalate supersaturation from 8.0 to 5.5 and calcium phosphate supersaturation from 1.4 to 1.0.

Conclusion

Providers use 24-h urine data to guide treatment strategy decisions. These strategies achieved the intended effects on urine composition and lowered kidney stone risk.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^117YBPHs]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The comparison of the EAU and AUA guidelines as the most commonly cited guidelines worldwide revealed several discrepancies. In general, the EAU guidelines give more therapeutic options for specific situations, delegating the choice of the appropriate treatment to the urologist and patient's preference.

Since several approaches may be appropriate in specific situations, guidelines also rate procedures hierarchically in such cases. Our analysis of these hierarchical listings revealed a number of discrepancies between guidelines, showing that for the choice between SWL and URS, available data might have been interpreted differently. While the AUA guidelines refer to an unpublished systematic review conducted by the guidelines-panel, the EAU guidelines recommendation is based on a meta-analysis and a work carried out by Hong et al.

Moreover, PNL is mentioned as a treatment option for all renal calculi by all guidelines, except for the AUA and SUA guidelines, which do not recommend it for the treatment of smaller non-lower pole renal calculi. Although recent developments in minimal invasive PNL techniques are mentioned in the EAU and AUA guidelines, these procedures are not yet listed separately in the recommendations. The comparison of recent advances in PNL is particularly difficult because different approaches are associated with substantially different degrees of invasiveness and technical complexity.

### Leave no stone unturned: defining recurrence in kidney stone formers [^114THyft]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Established guidelines provide recommendations on the management of kidney stones to prevent recurrence. However, clear and clinically useful terminology for recurrence of kidney stones is needed. This review describes the various manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and the reported rates of kidney stone recurrence in various clinical settings.

Recent Findings

Kidney stone recurrence has a wide range of symptomatic and radiographic presentations. Symptomatic recurrence may include characteristic symptoms of stone passage via the ureter (renal colic and gross hematuria). This may be self-managed or result in clinical care, with or without confirmation of an obstructing stone on imaging. Radiographic recurrence has been variably defined as new stone formation, stone growth, or stone disappearance (from passage with or without symptoms). Studies have used inconsistent definitions of recurrence, and recurrence rates vary substantially. Stone free rates and residual stone fragment size after surgical interventions are useful predictors of symptomatic recurrence.

Summary

The recurrence rate of kidney stones has been assessed in stone formers from sub-specialty clinics, the general community, and clinical trials. The definition of recurrence is quite heterogenous between studies, but the rate of recurrence generally increases as more manifestations are included in the definition.

Urolithiasis is a condition where crystalline mineral deposits (stones) form within the urinary tract. Urinary stones can be located in any part of the urinary tract. Affected children may present with abdominal pain, blood in the urine or signs of infection. Radiological evaluation is used to confirm the diagnosis, to assess the size of the stone, its location, and the degree of possible urinary obstruction.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different medical and surgical interventions in the treatment of urinary tract stones of the kidney or ureter in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles and conducted an electronic search for conference abstracts for the years 2012 to 2017. The date of the last search of all electronic databases was 31 December 2017 and we applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at interventions for upper urinary tract stones in children. These included shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, ureterorenoscopy, open surgery and medical expulsion therapy for upper urinary tract stones in children aged 0 to 18 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures according to Cochrane guidance. Two review authors independently searched and assessed studies for eligibility and conducted data extraction. 'Risk of bias' assessments were completed by three review authors independently. We used Review Manager 5 for data synthesis and analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 14 studies with a total of 978 randomised participants in our review, informing eight comparisons. The studies contributing to most comparisons were at high or unclear risk of bias for most domains. Shock wave lithotripsy versus dissolution therapy for intrarenal stones: based on one study (87 participants) and consistently very low quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of SWL on stone-free rate (SFR), serious adverse events or complications of treatment and secondary procedures for residual fragments. Slow shock wave lithotripsy versus rapid shock wave lithotripsy for renal stones: based on one study (60 participants) and consistently very low quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of SWL on SFR, serious adverse events or complications of treatment and secondary procedures for residual fragments. Shock wave lithotripsy versus ureteroscopy with holmium laser or pneumatic lithotripsy for renal and distal ureteric stones: based on three studies (153 participants) and consistently very low quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of SWL on SFR, serious adverse events or complications of treatment and secondary procedures. Shock wave lithotripsy versus mini-percutaneous nephrolithotripsy for renal stones: based on one study (212 participants), SWL likely has a lower SFR (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97; moderate quality evidence); this corresponds to 113 fewer stone-free patients per 1000 (189 fewer to 28 fewer). SWL may reduce severe adverse events (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98; low quality evidence); this corresponds to 66 fewer serious adverse events or complications per 1000 (74 fewer to 2 fewer). Rates of secondary procedures may be higher (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.20; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to 85 more secondary procedures per 1000 (1 more to 294 more). Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy versus tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotripsy for renal stones: based on one study (23 participants) and consistently very low quality evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy on SFR, serious adverse events or complications of treatment and secondary procedures. Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy versus tubeless mini-percutaneous nephrolithotripsy for renal stones: based on one study (70 participants), SFR are likely similar (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; moderate-quality evidence); this corresponds to 28 more per 1,000 (66 fewer to 132 more). We did not find any data relating to serious adverse events. Based on very low quality evidence we are uncertain about secondary procedures. Alpha-blockers versus placebo with or without analgesics for distal ureteric stones: based on six studies (335 participants), alpha-blockers may increase SFR (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.54; low quality evidence); this corresponds to 199 more stone-free patients per 1000 (94 more to 317 more). Based on very low quality evidence we are uncertain about serious adverse events or complications and secondary procedures.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on mostly very low-quality evidence for most comparisons and outcomes, we are uncertain about the effect of nearly all medical and surgical interventions to treat stone disease in children. Common reasons why we downgraded our assessments of the quality of evidence were: study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness, and imprecision. These issues make it difficult to draw clinical inferences. It is important that affected individuals, clinicians, and policy-makers are aware of these limitations of the evidence. There is a critical need for better quality trials assessing patient-important outcomes in children with stone disease to inform future guidelines on the management of this condition.

### Renal stones: evolving epidemiology and management [^116Fq2UC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of renal stones in adults has increased significantly over time. Although published evidence is somewhat limited, during the last 10 years, there have been reports of 4-fold increase in the number of children evaluated for nephrolithiasis, and of those, a 7-fold increase in diagnosis of stone disease. The etiology of stone formation has shifted over time, with a transition from infectious causes to metabolic causes. It was our goal in this review of the literature on pediatric renal stone disease to further highlight the changing epidemiology and etiology as well as provide a framework for appropriate clinical evaluation and use of diagnostic tools when approaching a patient with suspected renal stone disease. We also provide guidance regarding treatment and prevention of renal stone disease in children.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^111yT3ym]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — cystine-binding therapy indicates that clinicians should offer cystine-binding thiol drugs, such as alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine (tiopronin), to patients with cystine stones who are unresponsive to dietary modifications and urinary alkalinization, or have large recurrent stone burdens (Expert Opinion). It further notes that first-line therapy for patients with cystine stones is increased fluid intake, restriction of sodium and protein intake, and urinary alkalinization, and if these modifications are not sufficient, cystine-binding thiol drugs constitute the next line of therapy, with tiopronin possibly more effective and associated with fewer adverse events than d-penicillamine and should be considered first.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^113GACcT]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — ongoing metabolic monitoring states that after the initial follow-up, clinicians should obtain a single 24-hour urine specimen annually or with greater frequency, depending on stone activity, to assess patient adherence and metabolic response (Expert Opinion), and if patients remain stone free for an extended period of time on their treatment regimen, discontinuation of follow-up testing may be considered.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^114JKdBk]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone prevention evidence and implementation — both dietary manipulation and medications such as thiazides, allopurinol and citrate have "been shown to have efficacy in kidney stone prevention", although "the relative merits of diet and medications have never been compared head-to-head". The effort to prevent stones "needs to be broadened to other populations of practitioners", as "Primary care practitioners and physician extenders are adept at counseling weight loss, exercise and smoking cessation", and "Implementation of stone prevention regimens could also be extended to emergency rooms and primary care offices". Overall, "Strong evidence from an admittedly low number of clinical trials demonstrates that stones are indeed preventable".

### Citrate salts for preventing and treating calcium containing kidney stones in adults [^114LZj7F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Kidney stones affect people worldwide and have a high rate of recurrence even with treatment. Recurrences are particularly prevalent in people with low urinary citrate levels. These people have a higher incidence of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate stones. Oral citrate therapy increases the urinary citrate levels, which in turn binds with calcium and inhibits the crystallisation thus reduces stone formation. Despite the widespread use of oral citrate therapy for prevention and treatment of calcium oxalate stones, the evidence to support its clinical efficacy remains uncertain.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy and adverse events associated with citrate salts for the treatment and prevention of calcium containing kidney stones.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 29 July 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy and adverse events associated with citrate salts for the treatment and prevention of calcium containing kidney stones in adults treated for a minimum of six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed studies for inclusion in this review. Data were extracted according to predetermined criteria. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We included seven studies that included a total of 477 participants, most of whom had oxalate stones. Of these, three studies (247 participants) compared potassium citrate with placebo or no intervention; three (166 participants) compared potassium-sodium citrate with no intervention; and one (64 participants) compared potassium-magnesium citrate with placebo. Overall, quality of the reporting of the included studies was considered moderate to poor, and there was a high risk of attrition bias in two studies. Compared with placebo or no intervention, citrate therapy significantly reduced the stone size (4 studies, 160 participants: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.05). New stone formation was significantly lower with citrate therapy compared to control (7 studies, 324 participants: RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.68). The beneficial effect on stone size stability was also evident (4 studies, 160 participants: RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.26). Adverse events were reported in four studies, with the main side effects being upper gastrointestinal disturbance and one patient reported a rash. There were more gastrointestinal adverse events in the citrate group; however this was not significant (4 studies, 271 participants: RR 2.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 9.16). There were significantly more dropouts due to adverse events with citrate therapy compared to control (4 studies, 271 participants: RR 4.45, 95% CI 1.28 to 15.50). The need for retreatment was significantly less with citrate therapy compared to control (2 studies, 157 participants: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.89).

Authors' Conclusions

Citrate salts prevent new stone formation and reduce further stone growth in patients with residual stones that predominantly contain oxalate. The quality of reported literature remains moderate to poor; hence a well-designed statistically powered multi-centre RCT is needed in order to answer relevant questions concerning the efficacy of citrate salts.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^114TfmUt]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to choice of procedure, renal stones, AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend to offer ureteroscopy as first-line therapy in most patients requiring stone intervention in the setting of uncorrected bleeding diatheses or continuous anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115SoG9a]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Kidney stones — Recommend low-sodium diet and sufficient fluid intake to produce urine output > 2.2 L/day. Dietary calcium restriction is not recommended even for calcium stones; send stones for analysis when available; manage symptomatic stones with analgesics, hydration, and alpha-blockers initially and refer to urology for persistent symptoms or obstructive nephrolithiasis; and refer to nephrology for metabolic evaluation/management of recurrent nephrolithiasis.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^112aqggd]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — uric acid and cystine stones alkalinization states that clinicians should offer potassium citrate to patients with uric acid and cystine stones to raise urinary pH to an optimal level (Expert Opinion). The solubility of uric acid and cystine is increased at higher urinary pH values, potassium citrate therapy provides an alkali load that leads to increased urine pH, and for uric acid stone formers, urine pH should be increased to 6.0, and for cystine stone formers, a urine pH of 7.0 should be achieved.

### Kidney stones: prevention options… [^113k8N12]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best approach to prevent recurrent kidney stones. Bottom Line Increased fluid intake or decreased soft drink intake may prevent further kidney stones in patients with a single episode of a calcium stone, but other dietary interventions are not effective. Thiazides and citrates with increased fluid intake decrease recurrence in patients with multiple past stones, as does allopurinol in patients with high uric acid levels. Combinations — allopurinol and citrates with a thiazide — are no more effective than thiazides alone. Synopsis The researchers conducting this systematic review searched several databases, including the Cochrane library, and identified 28 English-language randomized trials that compared approaches to prevent recurrent kidney stones. The studies primarily evaluated patients with calcium stones, and included patients with a single incidence or with multiple recurrences.

One reviewer abstracted the data and a second author checked for accuracy. Two reviewers independently rated the quality of the identified research. For patients with a single recurrence, low-quality evidence showed that increased fluid intake or reduced soft drink consumption halved the recurrence of stones compared with no treatment. Decreased-protein diets or high-fiber diets and multicomponent diet changes were all ineffective. In patients with recurrent calcium stones, six moderate-quality studies showed that thiazide treatment, combined with high fluid and decreased oxalate intake, decreased stone recurrence by one-half and decreased rates of lithotripsy.

Treatment with citrates and increased fluid intake also decreased composite stone recurrence. Allopurinol decreases composite stone recurrence in patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Combinations with thiazides were no more effective than a thiazide alone.

### Patient information: kidney stones… [^116GM3CA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

While small kidney stones may pass freely through the urinary system, larger kidney stones can become lodged within a ureter, which is the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. Symptomatic kidney stones typically cause sudden onset of severe flank or back pain on one side of the body that can radiate to the groin and may result in blood in the urine, pain with urination, increased frequency of urination, fever and chills, and nausea and vomiting. The preferred imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of kidney stones is a noncontrast abdominal computed tomography scan, which provides information about the size and location of the stones. Ultrasonography may be an alternative option for individuals who are pregnant or for patients who need frequent imaging due to recurrent kidney stones. Initial treatment for symptomatic kidney stones involves pain control.

Nonopioid analgesics, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as intravenous ketorolac, are often used to treat renal colic in patients without kidney disease. Opioids may be prescribed for pain control in individuals with severe renal colic. Patients with symptomatic kidney stones who are dehydrated should be treated with intravenous fluids. For patients with a kidney stone that is 10 mm in diameter or smaller, typical outpatient management involves a 4- to 6-week trial of straining the urine to capture a passed kidney stone. Patients who are not at risk of developing low blood pressure may be treated with an alpha-adrenergic blocker medication to help expel ureteral stones. Surgical treatment is recommended for patients with symptomatic kidney stones larger than 10 mm in diameter.

Surgery may also be considered for patients with smaller symptomatic kidney stones who have fever, uncontrolled nausea or pain, or only 1 functioning kidney and for those who prefer early intervention or who have not spontaneously passed the kidney stone after 4 to 6 weeks. All patients with symptomatic kidney stones should increase their fluid intake and eat a low-sodium, normal-calcium, moderate-protein diet. Patients at high risk of recurrent symptomatic kidney stones may also benefit from treatment with a thiazide diuretic medication and potassium citrate. The composition of kidney stones and urine collected over 24 hours may be analyzed to help guide preventive therapy for some patients.
