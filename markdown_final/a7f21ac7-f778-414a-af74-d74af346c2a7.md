## Question

What laboratory monitoring is recommended for novel oral anticoagulants?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about laboratory monitoring of DOACs/NOACs, including when to test, which assays to choose, how to interpret results, and practical constraints in availability and turnaround time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that DOACs are designed for fixed dosing without routine monitoring. Then, I should define the clinical scenarios that trigger testing. Next, I will map drug class to the right laboratory assays and scrutinize the performance of conventional coagulation tests. After that, I need to appraise DOAC‑specific quantitative assays, their availability, and standardization hurdles. Finally, I will assemble pragmatic algorithms for emergencies, adherence concerns, and renal dysfunction, and close with reversal considerations and a concise synthesis, making sure I verify threshold concepts and cite the best available evidence along the way.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle before getting into exceptions. DOACs have predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that enable fixed dosing without scheduled laboratory monitoring, which is why guidelines and trials favor them over VKAs for most indications, particularly given their lower rates of intracranial bleeding and simpler use; I should emphasize that this is the default, not an absolute prohibition against testing when clinically indicated [^1155dUxX] [^115cTzmA] [^114Cu5Ue].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because there are well‑defined situations where assessing DOAC effect or level is useful; I need to check that I capture major bleeding, emergent or urgent procedures, suspected overdose, malabsorption or adherence concerns, significant drug‑drug interactions via P‑gp/CYP3A4, extremes of body weight, advanced CKD, and thrombolysis decisions in acute ischemic stroke, all of which recur across contemporary reviews and guidance documents [^116gToSn] [^112Fp2To] [^112psHL9].

> Next, I will now examine the mechanistic classes, because assay choice hinges on target. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin (IIa) inhibitor, whereas rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are direct factor Xa inhibitors; this simple bifurcation determines whether anti‑IIa or anti‑Xa activity should be measured when we need quantitative information [^1155dUxX] [^115cTzmA].

> Wait, let me verify the performance of routine coagulation assays before recommending them as screens. PT/INR is insensitive to dabigatran and variably sensitive to Xa inhibitors depending on the reagent, while aPTT shows a non‑linear, imprecise relationship with dabigatran and is insufficient for Xa inhibitors; by contrast, thrombin time (TT) is highly sensitive to tiny amounts of dabigatran, such that a normal TT effectively rules out clinically significant dabigatran effect, but none of these conventional tests reliably quantify drug exposure for dosing decisions [^112Fp2To] [^1136kfi4] [^1163Rd8w].

> I should confirm the validated, drug‑specific assays now. For dabigatran, dilute thrombin time and ecarin‑based assays (ecarin clotting time or ecarin chromogenic) correlate linearly with plasma concentrations across therapeutic and supratherapeutic ranges when properly calibrated; for factor Xa inhibitors, chromogenic anti‑Xa assays require drug‑specific calibrators and likewise show strong linearity, which is why they are the recommended quantitative methods in clinical scenarios where levels inform care [^112Fp2To] [^116gToSn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost assumed these tests are universally accessible; I need to check availability and standardization. In the United States, DOAC‑specific assays are inconsistently available and FDA‑cleared options are limited, leading to reliance on send‑outs or non‑drug‑calibrated anti‑Xa with cautious interpretation; expected peak and trough intervals exist from PK studies but are reference intervals rather than therapeutic targets, and while LC‑MS/MS is the reference for precise quantification, its turnaround time precludes emergent decision‑making in most centers [^112xxa2M] [^115o9Aas] [^112Fp2To] [^116gToSn].

> Let me think about a pragmatic emergency approach, but I should double‑check I don't overstate any screening test. In life‑threatening bleeding or urgent procedures, a rapid qualitative screen can help: TT for suspected dabigatran where a normal result essentially excludes relevant drug effect, and a sensitive PT or a quickly available anti‑Xa activity can suggest presence of a factor Xa inhibitor, although I should not claim that a normal PT reliably rules out Xa inhibitor effect because reagent sensitivity is inconsistent; when available, proceed to quantitative testing with dilute TT/ecarin for dabigatran or drug‑calibrated anti‑Xa for Xa inhibitors, and interpret results against published expected peak/trough intervals while recognizing that commonly cited thresholds such as approximately 30 ng/mL for procedural safety or thrombolysis are based on limited data and show imperfect test performance, particularly for apixaban near that cutoff [^112Fp2To] [^113fsTi6] [^1118hUbo].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential self‑correction here: I initially thought PT is an acceptable rule‑out test for all Xa inhibitors at therapeutic doses, but given marked reagent variability and lower sensitivity for apixaban, PT can be falsely normal despite clinically relevant levels; therefore, if qualitative screening is necessary, anti‑Xa activity or a drug‑calibrated assay is preferable when time and availability permit, with the caveat that heparin‑calibrated anti‑Xa can only be reported as detected or not detected with locally validated limits until proper drug calibrators are in place [^1136kfi4] [^113fsTi6] [^117FfHNP].

> Next, I should review how to assess suspected under‑exposure or adherence problems. Sampling at trough just before the next dose at steady state provides the most informative snapshot of minimum exposure; when drug‑specific quantitative assays are available, results can be compared to published expected trough intervals to contextualize potential under‑ or over‑anticoagulation, whereas in the absence of assays, clinical assessment plus renal function serves as an imperfect surrogate and should prompt reconsideration of dosing or agent choice in high‑risk patients, with emerging observational data linking very low trough levels to higher thromboembolic risk that warrants cautious interpretation [^114pDwJ3] [^114cfZ9K] [^114v2sqy].

> I need to ensure I integrate renal impairment because it materially alters exposure. All DOACs undergo renal elimination to varying degrees, most notably dabigatran, followed by edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, so baseline and periodic renal function assessment is essential, with dose adjustments per labeling and, when feasible, selective use of quantitative levels to exclude accumulation during acute or chronic kidney function changes [^1132Atef] [^112psHL9].

> Let me verify the cadence of routine safety monitoring apart from coagulation assays. A reasonable framework is to assess renal and hepatic function, complete blood count, and bleeding or adherence issues at initiation, again at 1 to 3 months, and then every 6 to 12 months or sooner if clinical status changes, recognizing that these checks are integral to safe DOAC therapy even though routine coagulation testing is not required [^113njy2S] [^1155dUxX].

> I will now examine reversal considerations and how they intersect with assays, but I should confirm assay interference risks. Idarucizumab rapidly neutralizes dabigatran, making pre‑reversal levels useful to confirm need and post‑reversal levels typically uninformative, while andexanet alfa for Xa inhibitors can interfere with anti‑Xa measurements, so baseline levels can support antidote stewardship whereas post‑reversal testing is generally discouraged due to assay confounding and limited clinical utility in the acute phase [^116pTTH9] [^116gToSn].

> But wait, what if specific assays are unavailable in real time. In that case, time since last dose, renal and hepatic function, and selective use of insensitive screens with appropriate caution can guide decisions, and for time‑critical interventions such as thrombolysis or urgent surgery, local protocols may adopt conservative decision thresholds or transfer pathways to centers with DOAC‑specific testing, acknowledging that the evidence base for numeric cutoffs near 30 to 50 ng/mL remains limited and assay‑dependent [^116m8kyp] [^1118hUbo] [^114cfZ9K].

> Final synthesis: Laboratory monitoring for DOACs is indication‑driven, not routine, and when triggered, it should be anchored to the drug class with dilute TT or ecarin‑based assays for dabigatran and drug‑calibrated chromogenic anti‑Xa assays for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, while recognizing the limitations of PT/INR and aPTT for quantification, the constrained availability of specific assays, and the tentative nature of commonly cited decision thresholds; throughout, periodic renal and hepatic safety checks, thoughtful attention to drug interactions and adherence, and targeted use of reversal agents with awareness of assay interference preserve safety and accuracy in clinical decision‑making [^112Fp2To] [^1155dUxX] [^113fsTi6] [^112psHL9].

Routine coagulation monitoring is not required [^1155dUxX] for NOACs due to their predictable pharmacokinetics [^115cTzmA], but **renal function monitoring** is essential at baseline [^1132Atef], annually, and more frequently in patients with CKD, elderly [^112psHL9], or those on interacting drugs [^113njy2S]. Liver function monitoring is recommended at baseline [^113njy2S] and periodically, especially in **hepatic impairment** [^1155dUxX] [^1132Atef]. In emergencies (bleeding, urgent surgery, suspected overdose, or adherence issues) [^114cfZ9K], use **drug-specific assays**, such as dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran [^112Fp2To], and calibrated anti-Xa assays for factor Xa inhibitors [^112psHL9]. Routine PT/INR [^1136kfi4] or aPTT [^112Fp2To] are unreliable for NOACs and should not guide management [^115cTzmA]. Regular clinical assessment for bleeding, thromboembolism, and adherence is necessary [^1132Atef], with more frequent monitoring in high-risk patients [^113njy2S].

---

## Routine laboratory monitoring

- **Renal function monitoring**: Essential at baseline, annually [^1132Atef], and more frequently in patients with CKD, elderly [^112psHL9], or those on interacting medications [^113njy2S] [^1155dUxX].

- **Liver function monitoring**: Recommended at baseline [^113njy2S] and periodically, especially in patients with hepatic impairment [^1155dUxX] [^1132Atef].

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular evaluation for bleeding, thromboembolic events [^1132Atef], and adherence is necessary [^113QqZGj].

---

## Situations requiring laboratory assessment

Although routine monitoring is unnecessary, **specific clinical scenarios** require laboratory assessment:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended laboratory tests** |
|-|-|
| Major bleeding or urgent surgery | - Dabigatran: Dilute thrombin time (dTT) or ecarin clotting time (ECT) [^112Fp2To] <br/> - Factor Xa inhibitors: Calibrated anti-Xa assays [^112psHL9] [^114cfZ9K] |
| Suspected overdose or non-adherence | - Dabigatran: dTT or ECT [^112Fp2To] <br/> - Factor Xa inhibitors: Calibrated anti-Xa assays [^112psHL9] [^1163Rd8w] |
| Renal or hepatic impairment | - Renal function tests (serum creatinine, eGFR) [^1132Atef] <br/> - Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) [^1155dUxX] [^113njy2S] |
| Extremes of body weight | - Drug-specific assays (dTT, ECT, anti-Xa) [^112psHL9] [^1155agDb] |
| Suspected drug interactions | - Drug-specific assays (dTT, ECT, anti-Xa) [^112psHL9] [^116m3Ji8] |

## Limitations of standard coagulation tests

Standard coagulation tests such as PT/INR and aPTT are **unreliable for NOACs** [^112Fp2To]. PT/INR is **insensitive to dabigatran** [^1136kfi4] and variably affected by factor Xa inhibitors, which can yield misleading results [^115cTzmA]. aPTT is also variably affected by NOACs and is **not reliable for quantifying anticoagulant effect** [^1136kfi4] [^112Fp2To].

---

## Recommended frequency of monitoring

- **Renal function**: At baseline, annually [^1132Atef], and more frequently in patients with CKD, elderly, or those on interacting medications [^112psHL9] [^113njy2S].

- **Liver function**: At baseline and periodically [^113njy2S], especially in patients with hepatic impairment [^1155dUxX] [^1132Atef].

- **Clinical assessment**: Regularly [^1132Atef], with increased frequency in high-risk patients [^113QqZGj].

---

## Clinical implications of inadequate monitoring

Inadequate monitoring can have **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Particularly in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly, or those on interacting medications [^1155dUxX].

- **Increased thromboembolic risk**: Due to non-adherence, underdosing, or drug interactions [^114v2sqy] [^113QqZGj].

- **Delayed detection of adverse events**: Such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, leading to complications [^1155dUxX].

## Summary of laboratory monitoring recommendations

| **Parameter** | **Routine monitoring** | **Situational monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Renal function | Baseline, annually, more frequent in CKD/elderly/interacting drugs | ∅ |
| Liver function | Baseline, periodic | ∅ |
| Clinical assessment | Regularly, more frequent in high-risk patients | ∅ |
| Drug-specific assays | Not routine | Major bleeding, urgent surgery, overdose, non-adherence, renal/hepatic impairment, extremes of body weight, drug interactions |

NOACs **do not require routine coagulation monitoring** [^1155dUxX], but regular renal and liver function tests and clinical assessments are essential [^113njy2S]. Drug-specific assays are reserved for specific clinical scenarios [^112Fp2To], and standard coagulation tests are unreliable for NOACs [^115cTzmA].

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: A systematic review [^112Fp2To]. Chest (2017). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or noncancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

- **Results**: We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.67–0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.78–1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Conclusions**: An ideal test, offering both accuracy and precision for measurement of any DOAC, is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^1136kfi4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International Normalized Ratio (INR) tests give misleading results with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Dabigatran inhibits coagulation by directly and specifically binding to thrombin (factor IIa). In contrast, rivaroxaban and apixaban directly and specifically bind to factor Xa (FXa). These modes of action differ from that of warfarin, making the results of PT/INR tests unreliable in patients treated with these newer agents.

The INR is relatively insensitive to dabigatran-induced anticoagulation, yielding normal or near-normal results at therapeutic dabigatran plasma concentrations and only slight increases at higher drug levels. INR testing with point-of-care devices in dabigatran-treated patients is similarly unreliable. The FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have been reported to give variable results with PT tests, which are relatively insensitive to FXa inhibitor-induced changes in coagulation. Therefore, for a patient treated with dabigatran, the PT will not provide valid information and could give the erroneous impression that the patient's coagulation status is normal or near-normal.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1132Atef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Patient-specific comorbidities, particularly those affecting the systemic exposure of medication, must be considered when managing patients on DOAC therapy. Comorbidities can alter the DOAC elimination rate, thereby increasing the risk of thromboembolic or bleeding events. Among the many factors to consider, three pertinent patient comorbidities are renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and extreme body weights.

- **Renal insufficiency**: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events. Historically, warfarin has been the preferred anticoagulant for severe CKD; however, robust data supporting its efficacy and safety are lacking. Concerns about warfarin-induced vascular calcifications and worsening nephropathy have prompted the search for more appropriate alternatives. The presence of coexisting renal impairment often leads to uncertainty in selecting the best DOAC. All DOAC therapies are renally eliminated to varying degrees, and alterations in renal clearance must be considered when dosing these agents. Dabigatran is the most renally eliminated, accounting for 80% of its clearance pathway, followed by edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and betrixaban at 50%, 35%, 27%, and 11%, respectively. Clinical decisions regarding treating patients with DOACs require assessing renal function, which should be frequently monitored, at least annually or more often if necessary.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112psHL9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamic monitoring is an important advantage of DOACs over warfarin, as there is no need for regular monitoring. However, in certain clinical situations, the use of an anti-IIa assay for dabigatran or an anti-Xa assay calibrated for factor Xa-inhibitors may be required. These situations include:

- **Major bleeding**: Occurrence of significant bleeding.
- **Emergent surgery**: Situations requiring immediate surgical intervention.
- **Concerns about drug absorption or adherence**: Issues pertaining to the effectiveness or regular intake of medication.
- **Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers**: Interaction with other medications that affect drug metabolism.
- **Morbid obesity**: Patients with extreme obesity may have different pharmacokinetics.
- **Advanced CKD**: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

A detailed description of anticoagulant reversal is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116gToSn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an effective and easy-to-use treatment option for conditions that require long-term anticoagulation. Although the fixed-dose scheme omits the requirement of routine coagulation assessment, testing may be needed under certain clinical conditions, such as before surgery or invasive procedures, in cases of trauma or bleeding, or if thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is evaluated.

Ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) remains the criterion standard for the exact quantification of DOAC concentrations, but limited availability and slow turnaround times prevent the routine clinical implementation of this method. Hence, if coagulation testing is deemed necessary, clinical practice guidelines advise using DOAC-specific coagulation assays, i.e. diluted thrombin time or ecarin clotting time (ECT) for dabigatran, and chromogenic anti-Xa assays (AXA) for factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors like rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. For all of these assays, quantitative assessment of DOAC concentrations can be achieved with the help of substance-specific calibrators.

A special situation arises for the FXa inhibitors: AXA is set up in many institutions, but calibrations are mostly limited to the traditional indication of therapeutic drug monitoring during low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. If DOAC-specific calibration is not available, different cut-offs for AXA have been proposed, below which unimpaired coagulation can be expected (see Methods for details).

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^112upCeZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We studied samples obtained in two prospective observational trials with blinded outcome assessment (Clinical Trial Registration Information unique identifiers: NCT02371044 and NCT02371070). Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Tübingen University Hospital (protocol‐no 259/2013BO1 and 270/2015B01). The studies were performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment. ME and SP had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis. The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online data supplements.

- **Setting and eligibility criteria**: The studies were conducted at the Department of Neurology & Stroke and the Department of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine of Tübingen University Hospital, a tertiary care facility, between July 2013 and November 2015. Patients enrolled were receiving first doses of apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran. Exclusion criteria were known coagulopathy, abnormal coagulation at baseline (Quick 37 seconds), intake of vitamin K antagonist or NOAC within 14 days, low‐molecular‐weight heparins within 24 hours, or unfractionated heparin within 12 hours before DOAC intake. Use of antiplatelet agents was permitted. Predominantly low dabigatran concentrations in these samples required inclusion of additional samples from patients on maintenance therapy.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112xxa2M]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

For the US, there is only one FDA-approved method for measuring DOACs. Instrumentation Laboratory received an FDA reclassification order for HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa for measuring apixaban in bleeding patients or patients at risk for bleeding. However, under the "labeling" section of this document, the FDA requires that the manufacturer must include "a prominent statement that the device is not intended for use in monitoring patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors".

There are two existing IFUs for this reagent: one without apixaban information (HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa, product 0020302602, Insert revision 06/2017), and the other including apixaban information (HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa, product 0020302602, Insert revision 12/2020). For the Instrumentation Laboratory reagent including apixaban information, the intended use statement indicates, "… the following situations where measurement of apixaban levels could be useful to have as additional information: - Patients at risk for major bleeding - Patients experiencing a bleeding episode".

The assay is not a stand‐alone test, and the results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings. It is noted that the use of this kit is specific to a certain class of instruments; therefore, using this kit on other instruments would be considered a modification to the IFU and thus an LDT.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of the next generation of oral anticoagulants [^115cTzmA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). High credibility.

In contrast to vitamin K antagonists, which reduce the functional levels of several coagulation factors, the new oral anticoagulants specifically target either thrombin or factor Xa. These new agents have such predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that routine coagulation monitoring is unnecessary. However, there are still some situations in which measurement of anticoagulant effect may be required.

The coagulation assays that are used to monitor heparin derivatives or vitamin K antagonists may not always accurately reflect the anticoagulant activity of the new oral anticoagulants, and specialized assays may be needed. In this article, we:

- **Identify situations**: In which assessment of anticoagulant effect may aid treatment decisions.
- **Describe effects**: Effects of the new oral anticoagulants on various coagulation tests.
- **Review specialized assays**: Review the specialized coagulation assays developed to measure the anticoagulant effects of the new oral anticoagulants.
- **Provide clinical perspective**: Provide a clinical perspective on the role of coagulation testing in the clinical management of patients treated with the new oral anticoagulants.

### Overview of the new oral anticoagulants: opportunities and challenges [^115fJxv8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are replacing warfarin for many indications. These agents include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, which inhibit factor Xa. All four agents are licensed in the United States for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and for treatment of venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are also approved for thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty. The NOACs are at least as effective as warfarin, but are not only more convenient to administer — as they can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring — but also safer due to their association with less intracranial bleeding.

As part of a theme series on the NOACs, this article:

- **Compares the pharmacological profiles**: Of the NOACs with that of warfarin.
- **Identifies the doses of the NOACs**: For each approved indication.
- **Provides an overview**: Of the completed phase III trials with the NOACs.
- **Briefly discusses the ongoing studies**: With the NOACs for new indications.
- **Reviews the emerging real-world data**: With the NOACs.
- **Highlights the potential opportunities**: For the NOACs and identifies the remaining challenges.

### Balancing ischaemia and bleeding risks with novel oral anticoagulants [^112Bfyad]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have long been the standard of care for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite their efficacy, their use requires frequent monitoring and is complicated by drug-drug interactions and the need to maintain a narrow therapeutic window. Since 2009, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have become alternative options to VKAs owing to their predictable and safe pharmacological profiles.

- **Clinical effect**: The overall clinical effect of these drugs, which is a balance between ischaemic benefit and bleeding harm, varies according to the clinical scenario. As adjunctive therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome, NOACs are associated with incremental bleeding risks and modest benefits.

- **VTE treatment**: For the treatment of VTE, NOACs have a safer profile than VKAs and a similar efficacy.

- **Thromboprophylaxis in AF**: In thromboprophylaxis in AF, NOACs are associated with the greatest benefits by reducing both ischaemic events and haemorrhagic complications and might reduce mortality compared with VKAs.

The role of NOACs continues to evolve as these drugs are evaluated in different patient populations, including those with renal impairment or with AF and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^1113EGUa]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

To find the optimal dose-effect for DOACs, it is necessary to further optimize and standardize laboratory tests. These DOAC-specific drug level tests, such as thrombin generation assays, ROTEM, anti-Xa assays for the inhibitors, and diluted thrombin time for dabigatran, are becoming increasingly available in hospitals. Currently available tests are mostly performed in plasma or whole blood. New point-of-care tests that are being developed for DOAC level or activity measurements may be useful, but there are still many uncertainties about the associations of these tests with drug intake and whether blood and urine levels correlate.

Furthermore, it is crucial to determine if risk models for thromboembolism and major bleeding, like HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc, can be enhanced by incorporating anticoagulation levels into the prediction scores. This includes predicting the risk not only in a landmark analysis (e.g. around the time of diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism) but also through time (i.e. dynamic prediction). Studies examining whether DOAC-specific measurements, taken either once or over time, correspond with the risk of bleeding or thromboembolism could be performed using large prospective studies or existing data from trials and registry data where patients on DOACs have been tested on DOAC plasma levels. If an optimal target and subsequent dose for DOAC exist in patient populations or subgroups, the final step would be to set up endpoint studies to guide dose regimen selection and DOAC titration in clinical trials.

### Laboratory testing in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: A practical guide for clinicians [^114pDwJ3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

One of the key benefits of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is that they do not require routine laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, assessment of DOAC exposure and anticoagulant effects may become useful in various clinical scenarios. The five approved DOACs — apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have different characteristics impacting assay selection and the interpretation of results.

- **Advantages and limitations**: This article provides an updated overview of which test to use, their advantages and limitations, when to assay DOAC levels, how to interpret the results relating to bleeding risk, emergency situations, and perioperative management, and what the impact of DOACs is on routine and specialized coagulation assays. Assays for anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity are the preferred methods when quantitative information is useful, although the situations in which to test for DOAC levels are still debated. Different reagent sensitivities and variabilities in laboratory calibrations impact assay results. International calibration standards for all specific tests for each DOAC are needed to reduce inter-laboratory variability and allow inter-study comparisons.

- **Impact on testing**: The impact of the DOACs on hemostasis testing may cause false-positive or false-negative results; however, these can be minimized by using specific assays and collecting blood samples at trough concentrations. Finally, prospective clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.

### Novel assay based on diluted prothrombin time reflects anticoagulant effects of direct oral factor Xa inhibitors: Results of multicenter study in Japan [^112fMMhv]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants targeting factor Xa (DXaIs) are administered as prophylaxis for various venothrombotic diseases without routine monitoring required. However, assessment of their anticoagulant effects is necessary to prevent severe events, including major bleeding and/or refractory thrombosis.

- **Objectives**: We examined the correlation of the ratio of inhibited thrombin generation (RITG), determined using a novel assay based on dilute prothrombin time (dPT), with coagulant markers and laboratory test results to show drug effects. In addition, the usefulness of RITG as a confirmation test for DXaI therapy was investigated.

- **Methods**: Citrated plasma samples were obtained from patients treated with rivaroxaban (n = 882), apixaban (n = 1214), or edoxaban (n = 820) at four different institutions in Japan. Laboratory tests, including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, and plasma concentrations of DXaIs, were conducted, with drug concentrations divided into peak and trough groups, within and after 5 hours of administration.

- **Results**: In each DXaI group, RITG was positively correlated with PT, APTT, and drug concentration, and negatively with D-dimer. RITG fluctuation during the peak and trough periods reflected the anticoagulant activity characteristic of each DXaI, which was different from blood concentration fluctuations. RITG showed a significant decrease in cases with thrombosis, while that was increased in those with hemorrhage.

- **Conclusion**: We developed RITG, a novel measurement method based on dPT. RITG represents residual coagulation activity and provides insights into the effects of DXaI therapy.

Why assess anticoagulant activity?

When a patient presents in the Emergency Department (ED) and is known or suspected to be on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, it is often helpful to measure the level of anticoagulation. Situations warranting this assessment include:

- **Unintentional or intentional overdose**: A patient may overdose on the OAC without related symptoms. For example, in the case of warfarin, routine monitoring might reveal an overly elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR) value due to overdose or pharmacological interaction.

- **Spontaneous bleeding episodes**: The patient is experiencing or suspected of experiencing spontaneous external or internal bleeding.

- **Injury-induced bleeding**: The patient has suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding.

- **Urgent surgical need**: When an urgent surgical or invasive procedure is deemed necessary due to trauma or acute illness, it is essential for the surgical team to know the patient's level of anticoagulation.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^114KX42i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is so widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) regularly, either for the same reasons as the population in general or due to the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails.

The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades. Recently, newer agents such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (collectively known as novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not provide an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs, and alternative tests are therefore needed for use in emergency settings.

This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: Evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Currently licensed direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) selectively target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (e.g. apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed to be administered in fixed doses without routine monitoring, DOACs have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions compared to vitamin K antagonists. In randomized controlled trials involving approximately 250,000 patients, they were at least as effective for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. The absolute benefits of DOACs over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications due to their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of DOACs are likely to be in patients previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of DOACs, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. DOACs are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease.

In this therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of DOACs, summarize the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for the development of these anticoagulants.

### Progress in the monitoring of direct oral anticoagulant therapy [^1155agDb]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

The availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has led to a paradigm shift in the field of anticoagulation, with DOACs increasingly being prescribed for patients in preference to vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin. Despite good experience with the use of these agents at fixed doses, there are clinical scenarios where monitoring is recommended. Data from phase III studies of the DOACs and small real-world studies suggest a relationship between DOAC concentration and clinical events. The DOACs have differing impacts on the common tests of haemostasis, and it is important that clinicians are familiar with the sensitivity of the reagents used in their laboratory to individual DOACs. The specific DOAC drug concentrations can be assayed in the laboratory, when required, to guide appropriate clinical decision-making. Studies from the real world with sufficient numbers evaluating the association of DOAC concentrations with outcomes should be a research priority in order to understand if we could do better through dose individualisation.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists: Pilot implementation of a near-real-time monitoring program in Italy [^11352KX1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The present study describes the pilot implementation of a monitoring program for newly marketed medications in the Lazio region and demonstrates the feasibility of such a framework to produce timely and valid evidence on the comparative safety and effectiveness of new drugs. In Italy, all healthcare–related data are routinely collected for administrative purposes, and the access does not imply any extra costs. Using these data for postmarketing surveillance is actually an added value, which requests an investment in human resources but not in data acquisition. Thus, a system based on routinely collected data is much more cost‐effective than any active data collection for monitoring purposes. Although active pharmacovigilance is based on cases reported by healthcare providers and thus depends on their awareness and willingness to actively feed the system, a system based on routine data can identify a much larger range of outcomes. A fully developed monitoring system will be a useful instrument for clinicians and healthcare decision-makers, defining the net incremental value of new agents.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Cu5Ue]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Use of vitamin K antagonists, mainly warfarin, is characterized by frequent clinic visits for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, it involves the concurrent use of heparin for bridging and deals with the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions that require dose adjustments. Given these drawbacks, the use of warfarin can be cumbersome and may lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown the equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are few specific guidelines available to guide physicians on the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing the overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, the risk of fatal GIB. Additionally, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^1159t5FB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Prescribing information (PIs) from other regulatory agencies report much more information, which can help the clinician and the laboratory in the management of their patients. Nevertheless, there is currently no evidence that clinicians in these countries provide better patient management based on the availability of this information, nor that these measurements lead to better patient outcomes. To this aspect, a survey comparing the practice in the different regions of the globe could provide more insight on how the information provided in the region-specific PIs and the availability of methods for DOAC testing impact the patient's management.

### Safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists: Pilot implementation of a near-real-time monitoring program in Italy [^1139dH1e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In a context of rapidly accumulating postmarketing information, establishing a robust framework capable of generating valid, timely information on the safety and effectiveness of new medications is highly valuable. This framework can either support or limit evolving observed prescribing changes (Figure S1). We were interested in the pilot implementation of a medication-monitoring program and chose oral anticoagulants as a test case in response to a request by the regional healthcare government. This request was motivated by the absence of effectiveness and safety information on these agents as used in routine care in Italy. The ultimate goal is the creation of a monitoring framework that could promptly provide Italian prescribers with relevant clinical information on the safety and effectiveness of newly marketed drugs.

### The new era of anticoagulation [^112J3Jf4]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Warfarin has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for medical use as an anticoagulant for more than 60 years. Although it has been an effective anticoagulant, its use is accompanied by several pitfalls, which has led to research and the discovery of new additional groups of anticoagulants: direct thrombin inhibitors, such as dabigatran, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. These new anticoagulants are fast-acting, noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and do not require monitoring. More data are accumulating to support their use in the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism. This article reviews the literature on these novel anticoagulants, including their pharmacokinetics and treatment indications.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although laboratory monitoring is generally not required for new anticoagulants, measuring their activity is essential in specific clinical situations. Standardized tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran, which allow the measurement of a patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The impact of new anticoagulants on coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported, where a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients, such as prolonged PT and aPTT, and increased drug concentration in plasma.

These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship between assay results and bleeding or thrombotic complications. **Pros and cons**: Laboratory measurements are discussed.

### Shifting the paradigm: A population health approach to the management of direct oral anticoagulants [^113QqZGj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Until a decade ago, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, enjoyed nearly 60 years of market exclusivity as the only available oral anticoagulants. With their variable dosing, narrow therapeutic window, frequent laboratory monitoring, and numerous endogenous and exogenous factors impacting the quality of therapy, VKAs have represented a significant therapeutic challenge — requiring substantial resources to manage.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) first appeared on the US market in 2010 and have reshaped the anticoagulation landscape. With fixed dosing, predictable pharmacokinetics, and no intensive therapeutic monitoring requirement, DOACs are generally considered safer and more convenient than VKAs. Despite these advantages, DOACs are still associated with inappropriate prescribing and adverse events, leading to concerted efforts from regulatory agencies to improve anticoagulation safety.

The Joint Commission recently highlighted the need for DOAC vigilance via "Sentinel Event Alert 61" as well as updated National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) to "reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy". These safety concerns emphasize that while DOACs do not require traditional monitoring (i.e. frequent scheduled one-on-one interactions between anticoagulation care providers and individual patients), there is an increasing need for oversight. This increased demand presents a unique challenge for anticoagulation programs, especially when providing DOAC oversight within the traditional practice model.

### New oral anticoagulants: A view from the laboratory [^1174MV8J]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacological, biochemical, and clinical features distinct from those of warfarin. Focusing on laboratory perspectives, this article compares and contrasts the pharmacological and biochemical properties of the new oral anticoagulants with those of warfarin and uses this information to speculate on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the clinical features that differentiate the new agents from warfarin.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^111tAtEU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases, employed in fixed-dose regimens. Although their safety and efficacy profiles are considered optimal, clinical events still occur. Given that anticoagulation treatment is a delicate balance between clotting and bleeding, it is possible that an optimal target spot exists where the effect of anticoagulation minimizes both the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Other currently available anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists and heparins, provide important clues for this. If such a target spot exists, tailored DOAC therapy may further benefit patients.

This opinion article summarizes the available evidence suggesting that a tailored strategy could be effective. It also offers research suggestions for conducting studies in patient populations, such as those with extremes of body weight or impaired kidney function, to evaluate whether tailored treatment with DOACs could lead to better patient outcomes.

### Accidental rivaroxaban intoxication in a boy: Some lessons in managing new oral anticoagulants in children [^114u2Dja]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants offer equivalent or improved therapeutic profiles compared with warfarin, with less risk of bleeding, no interactions with food, and no need for routine laboratory monitoring. Caution must be exercised in using these drugs in certain patient populations, for example, renal insufficiency, those receiving additional antithrombotic therapy, those with questionable compliance, children, and those with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. One of the novel oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban, is a direct Factor Xa inhibitor, used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.

We report a child who presented abnormal coagulation tests after unintended ingestion of four tablets of rivaroxaban. The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma, admitted to intensive care, and improved several hours later. We discuss his presentation and review the literature on this topic.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: Antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112wE1G3]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to summarize the published literature concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral anticoagulant drugs that are currently available for clinical use and other aspects related to their management.

- **Methods**: We carried out a standard review of published articles focusing on the laboratory and clinical characteristics of the vitamin K antagonists; the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate; and the direct factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban.

- **Results**: The antithrombotic effect of each oral anticoagulant drug, the interactions, and the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity are described in detail and discussed without providing specific recommendations. Moreover, we describe and discuss the clinical applications and optimal dosages of oral anticoagulant therapies, practical issues related to their initiation and monitoring, adverse events such as bleeding and other potential side effects, and available strategies for reversal.

- **Conclusions**: There is a large amount of evidence on laboratory and clinical characteristics of vitamin K antagonists. A growing body of evidence is becoming available on the first new oral anticoagulant drugs available for clinical use, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

### DOACs: Role of anti-Xa and drug level monitoring [^114cfZ9K]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring of anticoagulant effect, but measuring DOAC activity may be desirable in specific circumstances to detect whether clinically significant DOAC levels are present, such as prior to urgent surgery or to assess whether drug levels are excessively high or excessively low in at-risk patients, for example, after malabsorptive gastrointestinal surgery. Routine coagulation tests, including the international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), cannot accurately quantify drug levels but may provide a qualitative assessment of DOAC activity when considering the estimated time to drug clearance based on the timing of last drug ingestion and renal and hepatic function.

Drug-specific chromogenic and clot-based assays can quantify drug levels; however, they are not universally available and do not have established therapeutic ranges. In this review, we discuss our approach to measuring DOAC drug levels, including patient selection, interpretation of coagulation testing, and how measurement may inform clinical decision-making in specific scenarios.

### Prothrombin measurement using a patient self-testing system. Oral anticoagulation monitoring study group [^114WE1iB]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We enrolled 82 patients receiving oral anticoagulation in a pilot trial of a point-of-care (POC) prothrombin time (PT) device in a patient self-testing (PST) application at seven US and Canadian hospital-based anticoagulation centers. Properly selected and suitably trained patients were given the PT device to test at home for six weeks. They returned within three hours of the self-test to the hospital clinic where a repeated test was performed by a healthcare professional using the patient's POC device.

Blood specimens were obtained for routine laboratory PT determinations by the local hospital laboratory and a reference laboratory. The International Normalized Ratio agreement between the home test and the clinic test was excellent, and home results correlated well with reference laboratory results. Using the reference laboratory as a standard, 68% of hospital results and 66% of home results matched the patient's therapeutic range classification of the reference laboratory result. Participants overwhelmingly reported satisfaction and willingness to perform the self-test.

Our results confirm the equivalence of the PST PT and a reference laboratory result and suggest that PST PT technology is an appropriate and useful adjunct to routine oral anticoagulation monitoring methods.

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: no need for pharmacogenomics [^1111SqC1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data but present significant challenges. Patients receiving warfarin face potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions and require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that integrating pharmacogenomic information with clinical data would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin; however, trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113njy2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are no FDA-approved methods to monitor the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Qualitative coagulation assays such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time can be used as first-line tests if evaluation for medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect, as seen with INR in the management of VKA therapy. Quantitative measures, such as anti-factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time, exist to directly assess anticoagulation effects. However, quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established, and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes.

Other general monitoring parameters include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel, specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine. These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before initiation of a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter. More frequent follow-ups based on patient-specific characteristics are recommended in provider plans.

In addition to laboratory monitoring parameters, a comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach should include the following items assessed at each follow-up:

- **Health status**: Evaluate overall health to identify any changes that might affect DOAC efficacy or safety.
- **Adherence**: Assess medication adherence to ensure the patient is taking DOACs as prescribed.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^115o9Aas]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

**Essentials**: DOAC specific measurement is not widely implemented in the US, while it is more common in other areas of the world. The position of the Food and Drug Administration may explain this situation. Measurement of DOACs does not represent any technical difficulty and could be easily implemented in all laboratories. The fact that these laboratory tests are not available in some locations suggests disparities in patient care.

### Current challenges and future prospects in oral anticoagulant therapy [^111kZBiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The choice for oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy was previously limited to the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The advent of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) brought with it the expectation that oral anticoagulation would become simpler with the elimination of routine monitoring and introduction of a fixed-dose anticoagulant, and that the use of VKAs would be slowly phased out. Although DOACs have made anticoagulation more convenient and accessible, we are now faced with what can be described as a tyranny of choice, together with many unanswered questions relating to DOAC use. These include optimal DOAC selection and dosing, use in complex 'real-world' patients, the role for monitoring, and issues surrounding adherence. Warfarin remains the anticoagulant of choice in certain scenarios, such as metallic heart valves. The future holds much excitement; clinical studies are underway to expand the indications for DOACs and experience continues to grow outside the trial setting.

### Extensive skin necrosis in an elderly woman on dabigatran [^115zQnqW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Dabigatran, a novel oral anticoagulant, is a direct thrombin inhibitor and is increasingly used due to the advantage of dosing without the need for laboratory monitoring. While extensive skin necrosis is known to be associated with oral anticoagulants such as warfarin and factor Xa inhibitors, dabigatran toxicity typically manifests with bleeding, especially in the elderly. We describe a 70-year-old woman who was prescribed dabigatran for the treatment of unprovoked deep venous thrombosis. She developed bleeding diathesis along with extensive skin necrosis and acute kidney injury shortly after commencing the drug. Haemodialysis was administered in view of dabigatran toxicity and complications of kidney dysfunction, which resolved promptly over a week. However, the patient succumbed to severe sepsis from secondary skin infections. It is crucial to closely monitor for signs of dabigatran toxicity, especially in elderly patients.

### Novel anticoagulants: Bleeding risk and management strategies [^115GbY4Z]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to quantify novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC)-related gastrointestinal bleeding, summarize management strategies, and highlight knowledge gaps.

Recent findings have shown that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban differ from warfarin with their fixed oral dose and the lack of requirement for routine monitoring. Patients at the highest risk of thromboembolism benefit most from NOACs; however, there is a clinically significant risk for NOAC-related gastrointestinal bleeding. The management of NOACs in acute and elective settings differs from that used with warfarin.

The magnitude of gastrointestinal risk remains unclear due to the paucity of literature. Risk-stratification models are incomplete and cannot be used solely to predict future risk. Periendoscopic management requires an understanding of drug half-life, metabolism, and the patient's ability to excrete the agent. Management of acute bleeding relies on fluid resuscitation to promote renal excretion of the active metabolite, withholding doses, and timely management of endoscopic stigmata. The administration of coagulation factors, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant activated FVII, is more successful in reversing the activity of the upstream inhibitors of coagulation (rivaroxaban and apixaban) than dabigatran, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor.

### Low drug levels and thrombotic complications in high-risk atrial fibrillation patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants [^114v2sqy]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not currently require laboratory monitoring. In this study, DOAC-specific measurements were performed at trough in patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients who developed thromboembolic events demonstrated lower DOAC plasma levels, supporting the concept of measuring DOAC levels at steady state.

- **Background**: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are administered at fixed doses without the need for dose adjustment according to laboratory testing. High interindividual variability in drug blood levels has been shown with all DOACs. To evaluate a possible relationship between DOAC C-trough anticoagulant levels and thromboembolic events, a study enrolled 565 consecutive naive patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) within the START Laboratory Registry.

- **Methods**: DOAC-specific measurements (diluted thrombin time or anti-activated factor II calibrated for dabigatran; anti-activated FX calibrated for rivaroxaban or apixaban) at C-trough were performed locally at steady state within 15–25 days after the start of treatment. For each DOAC, the interval of C-trough levels, from the limit of quantification to the highest value, was subdivided into four equal classes. Results were attributed to these classes, and the median values of results were calculated. Thromboembolic complications occurring during 1 year of follow-up were recorded.

- **Results**: Thromboembolic events (1.8%) occurred in 10 patients who had C-trough levels in the lowest class of drug levels. The study recorded the incidence of thromboembolic events among these patients.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^114rRH41]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

For more than a decade, US laboratories have failed to implement solutions to help their clinicians in managing complex situations or patients on DOACs. The problem may find different origins, among which is the position of the FDA, which categorized these drugs as monitoring- and measurement-free, whereas other regulatory bodies were more conservative on the principle that the absence of proof (of monitoring/measurement benefits) is not proof of an absence (of monitoring/measurement needs). Pivotal clinical studies which led to the approval of DOACs were presented as devoid of such testing, although some companies considered monitoring as a solution to improve their benefit/risk ratio. Key opinion leaders and early guidelines on DOAC management also spread the message that these tests were not useful (if not harmful).

Nevertheless, numerous groups of experts in hemostasis laboratory practice have contributed to the general knowledge around DOACs by providing independent laboratory data on test method development, evaluation of drug levels in real life, and their association with clinical events. If we all agree that "monitoring" is not the adequate term to qualify the nature of the clinical need in the era of DOAC, "point measurement" is certainly more appropriate as almost all clinicians dealing with DOAC-treated patients may have needed to evaluate the residual anticoagulant activity in certain situations. More than a decade of development has also permitted the activation of smart laboratory solutions to qualify or quantify DOACs.

### Laboratory tests and the new oral anticoagulants [^116E9s2Y]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are ready to enter the scene on a massive basis for the treatment and prophylaxis of many cardiovascular diseases. Although they can be prescribed without dose adjustment based on laboratory testing, the laboratory is still an essential partner that may assist clinicians in managing anticoagulated patients. In principle, there are many tests that can be used to evaluate the anticoagulant effect of the new drugs. However, the choice should be made among those that are more readily available in emergencies and that are easy to run.

- **Linearity**: Linearity of dose-response and responsiveness to increasing doses, in addition to standardization, are other important issues to consider.

This article is aimed at reviewing the tests, their characteristics, and the most appropriate choice.

### Novel oral anticoagulant and kidney injury: Apixaban-related acute interstitial nephritis [^111SrP8V]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed due to their rapid action, predictable dose-related anticoagulation effect, and the absence of a need for routine laboratory monitoring, making them attractive options for patients and healthcare providers. All NOACs are at least partially excreted through the kidneys. Renal injury related to NOAC use is being increasingly reported. Although NOAC-related acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been reported once in the context of dabigatran use, we describe the first case of apixaban-related AIN. This case adds an important differential diagnosis that should be considered for any patient presenting with renal injury while being treated with NOACs.

### Direct oral anticoagulant monitoring: What laboratory tests are available to guide us [^1163Rd8w]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolism because of several advantages over vitamin K antagonists, including no need for laboratory monitoring. However, it has become increasingly important in certain clinical scenarios to know either actual DOAC concentration (quantitative) or presence of DOAC (qualitative). These clinical conditions include patients presenting with major bleeding or requiring urgent surgery who may need a reversal or hemostatic agent, extremes of body weight, and failed therapy.

- **Laboratory tests**:
	- Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are variably affected by factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) and direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), respectively, depending on reagents' sensitivity, and hence, they cannot be relied on confidently. Thrombin time is highly sensitive to very low amounts of DTI; thus, a normal value rules out a clinically significant amount. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry accurately measures DOAC levels but is clinically impractical.

- **Alternative assays**:
	- Dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays using appropriate calibrators/controls provide an accurate DTI level. Anti-Xa assay using corresponding FXaI calibrators/controls provides accurate drug levels. However, these assays are not readily available in the United States compared with some other parts of the world. Heparin assays using anti-Xa activity often have a linear relationship with calibrated FXaI assays, especially at the lower end of on-therapy levels, and they may provide rapid assessment of drug activity for clinical decision making.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^113fsTi6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

During treatment with direct oral anticoagulants, coagulation assessment is required before thrombolysis and surgery, as well as when anticoagulation reversal is being evaluated. Limited data support the accuracy of specific coagulation assays around the safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

- **Methods and results**: In 481 samples obtained from 96 patients enrolled at a single center, concentrations were measured using the Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay, Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay, or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran; the chromogenic anti-Xa assay for factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban); and ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry as the reference. All dabigatran-specific assays had high sensitivity to concentrations > 30 ng/mL. However, the specificity was lower for the Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay (78.2%) compared to the Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay (98.9%) and ecarin clotting time (94.6%). The chromogenic anti-Xa assay provided high sensitivity and specificity for rivaroxaban, but it showed low sensitivity for apixaban (73.8%; concentrations up to 82 ng/mL were misclassified as < 30 ng/mL). If no specific calibration is available, results twofold above the upper limit of normal indicate relevant rivaroxaban concentrations. For apixaban, all elevated results should raise suspicion of relevant anticoagulation.

- **Conclusions**: Specific tests differ considerably in diagnostic performance for concentrations close to the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold. Compared with the Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay and ecarin clotting time, the Hemoclot assay shows limited specificity.

### The laboratory's 2015 perspective on direct oral anticoagulant testing [^1173KaLd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The introduction of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy into clinical use over the past five years has significantly impacted the clinical laboratory. Clinicians' desire to determine plasma drug presence or measure drug concentration and recent observations regarding the limitations and utility of coagulation testing in the setting of DOAC treatment suggest that early published recommendations regarding laboratory testing should be reassessed.

These initial recommendations were often based on drug-spiked plasma studies rather than samples from patients receiving DOAC therapy. We have demonstrated that reagent sensitivity varies significantly when drug-spiked samples or samples from DOAC-treated patients are tested. Data from drug-enriched samples must, therefore, be interpreted with caution or be used as a guide only. We present laboratory assays that can be used to determine drug presence and measure drug concentration and provide recommended testing algorithms. As DOAC therapy may significantly impact specialty coagulation assays, we review those tests with the potential to give false-positive and false-negative results.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^117FfHNP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations for laboratory screening or quantifying**: If the laboratory is providing screening tests that are sufficiently sensitive to detect around 25–30 ng/ml of DOACs, there should be accompanying information with the test result to indicate laboratory-verified test sensitivity. For laboratories using LMWH-calibrated anti-FXa to screen for direct FXa inhibitors, it is suggested that the test be reported as "not detected" or "detected", with information provided that the lower limit of quantitation associated with LMWH is "estimated" to be a given concentration of FXa DOAC based on local laboratory findings.

Before implementing a DOAC quantitative assay, it is strongly recommended that the laboratory consult clinical stakeholders for feedback. Early recommendations suggest using trough time collections, although more recent studies suggest peak values may be associated with bleeding risks. For laboratories that provide quantitative DOAC measurements, the following is recommended: (1) Each DOAC should be a separate orderable test to ensure proper drug-calibrated testing is used; (2) each result should be accompanied by an expected "within therapy" range traceable to a clinical study or peer-reviewed publication based on collection time (peak or trough); and (3) results should be reported in ng/ml when properly drug calibrated. DOAC levels required for acute or emergent clinical needs should be reported within 30 minutes of receipt in the testing laboratory.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116Mi1EH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study evaluated the performance of DOAC-specific coagulation assays in real-life patient samples. Different from prior reports, our analyses focused on the diagnostic accuracy of the assays in the low concentration spectrum and their ability to discriminate between concentrations above and below the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

Previous publications by our group provided evidence that unspecific point-of-care tests and laboratory-based assays can help identify intact hemostatic function in patients presumably on DOAC treatment. However, the diagnostic performance of these unspecific tests is far from ideal, as only a limited fraction of patients with DOAC concentrations below 30 ng/mL could be detected. Our present analysis investigated guideline-recommended DOAC-specific tests that should theoretically provide better diagnostic accuracy.

In clinical practice, the question of whether it is safe to proceed with treatments that require intact hemostasis (e.g. surgery with high bleeding risk or thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke) is frequently encountered. Similar concerns arise when evaluating reversal therapy in DOAC-associated bleeding. Unnecessary reversal therapy comes at a considerable financial cost in the case of dabigatran, as idarucizumab is a safe yet expensive therapeutic option. The situation is even more complicated for FXa inhibitors, where prothrombin complex concentrate remains the mainstay of reversal therapy.

### Pros and cons of new oral anticoagulants [^111w1hwA]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

The availability of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) targeting either thrombin (dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis has been highly anticipated. NOACs offer major pharmacologic advantages over vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin), including rapid onset/offset of action, few drug interactions, and predictable pharmacokinetics, which eliminate the need for regular coagulation monitoring. Regulatory agencies have approved several NOACs for specific indications based on clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety that are at least as good as, if not better than, warfarin (for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism) or low-molecular-weight heparin, which is injectable (for initial treatment of venous thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty).

However, the adoption of this new therapeutic class into clinical practice has been slower than expected due to several factors. These include concerns regarding medication adherence without laboratory monitoring, uncertainty about dosing in certain patient populations (e.g. those with renal dysfunction or marked extremes of body weight), and higher drug costs compared with warfarin. Other issues include the absence of specific antidotes for NOACs and a lack of assays to measure drug levels at most centers. The indications for NOACs on the market are expected to expand, and at least one additional agent (edoxaban) is likely to gain approval within the next two years.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^114nSyx3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether the information in drug PI (or lack thereof) represents drivers for clinicians to seek DOAC measurements. The decision for a clinical laboratory to implement new testing may be based on numerous factors. For anticoagulation monitoring, the PI, sometimes referred to as drug labeling, may provide details about PK, PD, and impact on laboratory tests, and/or if monitoring is indicated or other precautions. However, it is likely that the clinical laboratory will respond to local clinicians' needs. As seen with Lovenox PI, when the PI started providing indications for drug monitoring (anti-FXa activity) and guidance documents reported the same, an increasing number of laboratories began reporting these assays.

There is a noted regional difference in DOAC testing availability for clinicians, and perhaps such testing availability is linked to regional DOAC PI. One indicator of testing availability in a given region is assessing External Quality Assurance (EQA) programs. EQA programs represent laboratory quality tools that assure the local laboratory meets performance expectations when testing blinded samples containing particular analytes, and where the locally reported results are compared with peer groups. EQA programs detail the number of enrolled participants, the test methodology used, and statistical thresholds for performance for acceptability (pass) or not (fail). Comparing the enrolled participants for DOAC measurements, the US laboratories are lagging behind their Australian, Canadian, and European counterparts.

### Brave new world: The current and future use of novel anticoagulants [^115LNPmo]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Advances in antithrombotic therapy began when traditional anticoagulant agents such as heparin and the vitamin K antagonists like Coumadin became commercially available in the 1940s and 1950s. Inherent limitations of these compounds, including the need for monitoring and multiple food and drug interactions with Coumadin, spurred the development of newer parenteral compounds like low molecular weight heparin, the pentasaccharide fondaparinux, and direct thrombin inhibitors such as hirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin, which offer advantages over traditional compounds. Despite the failure of the first oral anticoagulant in 50 years — the direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran — due to issues with liver toxicity, new oral agents such as the Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, YM-150, and DU-176b, as well as oral direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran, are in advanced stages of development. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are now approved for use outside of the United States for thromboprophylaxis in the setting of orthopedic surgery. These and other novel agents have the potential to greatly expand our armamentarium to treat thromboembolic disease, offering more targeted approaches to specific procoagulant complexes, a predictable anticoagulant response that does not require monitoring, and applicability in both acute and long-term treatment settings.

### Practical considerations in emergency management of bleeding in the setting of target-specific oral anticoagulants [^115yJwRc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The recent arrival of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) offers potential advantages in the field of anticoagulation. However, there are no rapid, accurate, and routinely available laboratory assays to evaluate their contribution to clinical bleeding. With the expanding clinical indications for TSOACs and the arrival of newer reversal agents on the market, the emergency clinician will need to be familiar with drug specifics as well as methods for anticoagulation reversal. This review offers a summary of the literature and some practical strategies for approaching patients taking TSOACs and managing bleeding in these cases.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^116w9xNv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) regularly, either for the same reasons as the population in general or as a result of the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails. The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades. However, recently, the newer agents dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (collectively known as novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management.

However, the INR does not give an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs, and alternative tests are therefore needed for use in emergency settings. This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### Laboratory monitoring of new anticoagulants [^111XkbFm]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Maintaining a balance between bleeding and clotting has always been a challenge in treating coagulation disorders. A perturbation in that balance can be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. As a result, anticoagulant monitoring is extremely important, and inappropriate testing may lead to complications. There are now a variety of new anticoagulant drugs in clinical use, including several direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) such as argatroban, bivalirudin, and hirudin, as well as a Factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux.

There are pitfalls associated with some of the currently used laboratory monitoring tests, and newer alternative laboratory monitoring tests have been investigated. In addition, laboratory testing can assist with transitioning patients from DTI to warfarin therapy.

### The myths behind doac measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112qMxuu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

The manuscript examines when a laboratory should provide services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that does not require routine monitoring. For decades, unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions have been monitored with dose adjustments based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and in some institutions, the anti-FXa activity. Similarly, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States, and longer elsewhere. Adjustments of the daily VKA dose are primarily based on the patient's INR result, with dietary intake and other factors also considered.

When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use in 1993 in the United States, the drug prescribing information (PI) indicated that "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, more recent enoxaparin labeling includes pharmacokinetic (drug level) data, and subsequent iterations suggest that monitoring of anti-FXa may be warranted in certain populations, including those with renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation became available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today, the clinical laboratory is faced with a familiar dilemma with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) comprising a direct thrombin inhibitor, dab.

### Is there a role for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-guided dosing for novel oral anticoagulants [^115zT2yG]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The novel direct oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in oral anticoagulant therapy and are replacing vitamin K antagonists as the preferred options for many indications. Given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring, they have been shown to be at least as effective in reducing thromboembolic stroke as dose-adjusted warfarin in phase 3 randomized trials and are less likely to cause hemorrhagic stroke. Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic subanalyses of the major NOAC trials in patients with atrial fibrillation have established relationships between clinical characteristics and drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses with both efficacy and safety. Based on these analyses, pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulatory authorities have provided contraindications and dosing recommendations based on clinical characteristics associated with drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses, stroke reduction, and bleeding risk to optimize the risk-benefit profile of the NOACs in the real world.

The fixed-dosing strategy of NOACs has triggered discussions about the potential value of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment in customizing drug exposure to further improve the safety and efficacy of the NOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation. As there is neither high-quality evidence nor consensus about the potential role of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment for the NOACs, a Cardiac Research Safety Consortium "Think Tank" meeting was held at the American College of Cardiology Heart House in December 2015 to discuss these issues.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^1118hUbo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

While firm evidence supports the efficacy of DOACs for long-term anticoagulation, reliable data on DOAC concentration thresholds that result in clinically significant coagulation impairment are lacking. Although this ambiguity is acknowledged, the safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL, which has been proposed for invasive procedures or thrombolysis in a number of recent guidelines and expert recommendations, seems to have been chosen with a focus on patient safety and is lower than previous recommendations. In cases of severe but less critical bleeding, a threshold of 50 ng/mL has been proposed to warrant antidote administration. Test accuracy calculations for this higher threshold were included in the study.

- **Threshold recommendations**: These recommendations are founded on an extrapolation based on retrospective analyses of existing trial data. Supporting these thresholds with better-quality clinical data is of paramount importance, as the number of DOAC-treated patients is steadily increasing. To accomplish this, concentration measurements using DOAC-specific assays in all patients who develop ischemic or hemorrhagic events seem advisable. Furthermore, the wide availability of DOAC-specific coagulation assays is crucial, both to guide further research and for the treatment of these patients.

Given the weak evidence for both thresholds, it seems likely that our understanding of what constitutes a relevant threshold will evolve.

### Anticoagulants: What is new and what is the standard [^112ysuoD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

### Is there a role for the laboratory monitoring in the management of specific antidotes of direct oral anticoagulants [^116pTTH9]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Given the growing number of patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the need for rapid neutralization is also increasing in case of major bleedings or urgent surgeries/procedures. Idarucizumab is commercialized as a specific antidote to dabigatran, while andexanet alfa has gained the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approval as an oral anti-factor Xa inhibitors antidote. Other antidotes or hemostatic agents are still under preclinical or clinical development, with the most advanced being ciraparantag. DOAC plasma level measurement allows for appropriate selection of patients for antidote administration and may prevent unnecessary prescription of expensive molecules in some acute clinical settings. However, these tests might be inconclusive after certain antidote administrations, namely andexanet alfa and ciraparantag. The benefit of laboratory monitoring following DOAC reversal remains unclear. We sought to provide an overview of key studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of DOAC reversal using the most developed/commercialized specific antidotes. Additionally, we discuss the potential role of laboratory monitoring in managing patients receiving DOAC-specific antidotes and highlight areas that deserve further investigation to establish the exact role of laboratory monitoring in the appropriate management of DOAC-specific antidotes.

### Recanalisation therapies for acute ischaemic stroke in patients on direct oral anticoagulants [^116m8kyp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Future research needs to elucidate the following aspects: first, availability of DOAC monitoring needs to be improved. Streamlining central laboratory measurement and reducing turnaround times seem feasible. Point-of-care measurement for DOACs should be among the top priorities. Second, although prior reversal of anticoagulation using a specific reversal agent seems to be a reasonable and safe approach, health economics (pricing) and advanced imaging selection (salvageable tissue), given the relatively small effect size of thrombolysis on functional outcome, should be considered. It seems unlikely that this approach should be generalized to all patients. Furthermore, other available approaches — using time since last intake and DOAC monitoring — seem to provide equally safe results.

Third, DOAC patients managed with IVT beyond the standard time thrombolysis window need to be explored. Fourth, although tenecteplase is not currently licensed for treatment of ischaemic stroke, several centres have reported off-label use of tenecteplase; however, experience of tenecteplase with DOAC pretreatment is limited.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^115HEAVb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Familiarity with warfarin may influence ED staff practices. As a result, many patients receiving NOACs who are treated in the ED may undergo standard coagulation testing. However, the results of standard prothrombin time (PT)/INR assays used to assess coagulation during warfarin therapy may not provide clinically meaningful results with the NOACs, unless, as with rivaroxaban, a specific reagent, neoplastin, is incorporated and the test calibrated accordingly. The results could lead to confusion over coagulation activity in patients who are taking one of the newer agents.

The evidence cited in this narrative review was assembled based on the author's clinical expertise, extensive reading of the relevant literature, and broad experience teaching emergency medicine. The reality is that at the present time, there is no definitive guidance on the management of medical emergencies due to NOAC-associated bleeding events. Therefore, in the absence of solid data from randomized clinical trials, the objective for this review was to develop a practical guide for clinicians in the field.

This article discusses the rationale for testing anticoagulant activity, examines why the INR is not appropriate for quantifying the extent of anticoagulation in patients on the NOACs, reviews the assay options that are or will soon be available for these agents, and discusses options for treatment of bleeding emergencies.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^116m3Ji8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Drug‐drug interactions are an important concern for any patient managed on DOAC therapy. Concomitantly administered drugs that alter DOAC plasma concentrations can lead to serious complications, with increased DOAC concentrations potentially resulting in bleeding events and decreased DOAC concentration placing the patient at risk for thrombus formation. Initially, DOACs were viewed as having minimal drug interactions, which has proven incorrect. When compared with VKAs, which are highly associated with substantial drug‐drug interactions, DOACs impart a lower risk; however, they still have significant risk of interactions. Three different types of drug interactions need to be evaluated when managing DOAC therapy: agents affecting renal clearance, agents affecting hepatic clearance, and agents concurrently affecting hemostasis.

- **Agents affecting renal clearance**: As all DOACs used for treatment of atherothrombosis rely on the kidneys for elimination to varying degrees, agents that hinder this organ's ability to clear DOAC may place the patient at increased risk for bleeding complications. Common agents to monitor are NSAIDs, diuretics, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and immunosuppressants (i.e. calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus). No DOAC‐specific dose adjustments are required, but warrant more frequent monitoring of renal function and possibly holding therapy or consideration for transition to an alternative therapy.
