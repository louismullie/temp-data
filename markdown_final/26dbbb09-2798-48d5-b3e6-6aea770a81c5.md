Pain neuroscience education

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE), specifically seeking a synthesis that covers its definition, theoretical foundation, evidence base across populations and time horizons, mechanisms of action, integration with exercise and other therapies, guideline positions and clinical recommendations, implementation details such as dose, delivery, and fidelity, as well as knowledge gaps and future directions, concluding with a balanced, clinically actionable summary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PNE and its theoretical foundation. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of the evidence base across populations and time horizons. Next, I will examine mechanisms of action and how PNE integrates with exercise and other therapies. After that, I need to appraise guideline positions and clinical recommendations. I will then consider implementation details such as dose, delivery, and fidelity. Finally, I should identify knowledge gaps and future directions, and close with a balanced, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the definition and theoretical basis so I don't jump to conclusions: PNE is a cognitive intervention that reconceptualizes pain as a protective output of the nervous system rather than a marker of tissue damage, aligning with contemporary biopsychosocial models and the central sensitization framework, and it is typically embedded within interdisciplinary care to address maladaptive pain cognitions and promote self-management [^1111Ak89] [^115nuRh3] [^114MdLww].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence signal before overgeneralizing: meta-analyses show small-to-moderate effects on pain intensity and psychological distress, with low-to-moderate certainty and notable heterogeneity. Combining PNE with exercise yields larger, more consistent short-term benefits on pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and catastrophizing than exercise alone, though long-term durability remains uncertain and some high-quality trials show no added benefit of exercise over PNE alone in specific populations [^116GAKzh] [^113vSbKF] [^111MdJRF] [^116NoaRh] [^113S7c2T].

> Hold on, I should verify population-specific nuances: in chronic low back pain, guidelines suggest PNE as an adjunct to exercise or manual therapy rather than a stand-alone, with small-to-moderate short-term benefits. In chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty, randomized trials show clinically meaningful improvements in roughly one-third of patients regardless of whether exercise is added to PNE, indicating that PNE alone can be effective in some contexts. In migraine, adding PNE to physiotherapy reduced migraine frequency more than physiotherapy alone without changing overall headache frequency. In fibromyalgia, higher-dose PNE may confer better outcomes, but evidence quality is limited and heterogeneous [^111CVeQ7] [^116pMfjD] [^116NoaRh] [^113S7c2T] [^113DVnmw] [^1113kzwd].

> I need to check mechanisms next to ensure the clinical logic holds: PNE appears to work by reconceptualizing pain, reducing pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia, and enhancing pain self-efficacy. Mediation analyses suggest reductions in kinesiophobia and central sensitization-related distress mediate improvements in disability, medication use, and quality of life, supporting a mechanism whereby cognitive change enables behavioral engagement and downstream functional gains [^116Heu4Z] [^113vSbKF] [^116oHysZ].

> Let me consider how PNE integrates with other therapies so I don't overstate its role: PNE is best positioned as a foundational element within multimodal, biopsychosocial programs that include exercise, manual therapy, stress management, and cognitive-behavioral strategies. When embedded in interdisciplinary care with consistent messaging, PNE can enhance coherence and patient empowerment, though adding extra standalone PNE sessions to already comprehensive programs may not yield additional short-term pain reduction despite improving knowledge [^1111Ak89] [^116vZCq2] [^113THUqr].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to avoid overreaching: major guidelines converge on using PNE as an adjunct within multimodal care for chronic low back pain, not as a stand-alone. The VA/DoD guideline rates evidence as insufficient for strong recommendations but suggests structured education including pain neurophysiology as part of self-management, while APTA guidance recommends delivering PNE alongside exercise or manual therapy for chronic LBP [^111raGQd] [^116G2Epx] [^111CVeQ7] [^116pMfjD].

> I will now examine implementation details because dose and delivery likely matter: a dose–response meta-analysis suggests approximately 150–200 minutes of PNE added to exercise exceeds minimal clinically important differences for pain and disability in chronic spinal pain. Pragmatic trials show training PTs in PNE improves pain self-efficacy even when functional gains are modest, underscoring the need for fidelity monitoring and competency-based delivery. Qualitative work emphasizes clear, repeated explanations, emotional support, and empowerment as key to success [^113twkFt] [^116oHysZ] [^115f25gZ].

> But wait, what about the quality and consistency of evidence — am I overstating certainty? Overviews of systematic reviews highlight critically low methodological quality, high overlap, and inconsistent effects across meta-analyses, so recommendations should be cautious; moreover, some high-quality RCTs in post-TKA show no superiority of adding exercise to PNE, reminding me not to assume additive effects in all contexts and to consider patient selection and ceiling effects from concurrent care [^111MdJRF] [^116NoaRh] [^113S7c2T].

> Let me think about future directions and research gaps so we don't stall: we need higher-quality, adequately powered RCTs with standardized PNE protocols, validated fidelity measures, and longer-term follow-up. Head-to-head comparisons of PNE alone versus combinations, mechanism-focused trials to clarify mediators, and precision approaches that match PNE dose and format to patient characteristics are priorities. Emerging areas like AI-supported personalization and integration with digital therapeutics warrant careful, ethically grounded exploration [^111MdJRF] [^1135W4ad] [^114mw15G] [^114GwoMx].

> Hold on, I should verify educational and workforce implications too: clinician pain knowledge deficits persist, so training in PNE delivery and biopsychosocial care should be prioritized. Fellowship curricula need strengthening in chronic pain mechanisms, interdisciplinary coordination, and longitudinal patient management to translate PNE into sustainable practice change [^1113kzwd] [^112tndE4] [^111yRDuJ].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a balanced clinical take-home: PNE is a safe, low-risk cognitive intervention with small-to-moderate effects on pain and distress and consistent benefits on pain cognitions. It is most impactful when embedded within multimodal programs that include exercise and behavioral strategies, and it should not be used as a stand-alone for chronic pain. Dosing in the 150–200 minute range appears optimal in spinal pain, and delivery quality, therapeutic alliance, and patient empowerment are critical modifiers of effect. Clinicians should set realistic expectations, monitor for minimal response, and adapt the plan accordingly [^113vSbKF] [^113twkFt] [^111CVeQ7] [^115f25gZ].

Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is a **cognitive intervention** that explains pain as a protective output of the nervous system rather than a direct marker of tissue damage [^1111Ak89]. It aims to **reconceptualize pain** by addressing maladaptive beliefs, fear-avoidance, and catastrophizing, thereby improving function and reducing disability in chronic pain [^116UHGp3]. PNE is best delivered within a **biopsychosocial framework** [^111mz2nw] and is most effective when combined with active therapies such as exercise or manual therapy, yielding small-to-moderate benefits in pain, disability, and psychological factors [^113vSbKF] [^117MRw26]. Evidence quality varies [^111MdJRF], and optimal dosing and delivery methods remain under study [^113twkFt]; nonetheless, PNE is recommended as an adjunct in chronic low back pain guidelines [^111CVeQ7] and is widely used in multidisciplinary programs [^116vZCq2].

---

## Theoretical foundations and core principles

PNE is grounded in contemporary pain neuroscience, emphasizing that pain is a **complex experience** shaped by peripheral, spinal, and central processes [^111mz2nw], with psychological and social factors modulating its perception and impact [^116VfT3D]. Core principles include:

- **Pain as a protective output**: Pain is a warning signal generated by the nervous system, not a direct measure of tissue damage [^115nuRh3].

- **Neuroplasticity**: Chronic pain reflects maladaptive neuroplastic changes, including central sensitization and altered pain modulation [^114MdLww].

- **Biopsychosocial model**: Pain is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors, requiring a holistic approach [^117H9dWf].

- **Reconceptualization**: Patients are guided to shift from a biomedical view ("pain = damage") to a neuroscience-informed understanding ("pain = protection") [^115nuRh3].

---

## Clinical applications and delivery methods

PNE is delivered in various formats, including **individual or group sessions**, face-to-face or online, and is often integrated with active interventions such as exercise or manual therapy [^111cecrh] [^113JtfSB] [^116pMfjD]. Common delivery methods include:

- **Verbal explanation**: Clinicians use simple language, metaphors, and analogies to explain pain mechanisms [^112oY8UF] [^116h21t6].

- **Visual aids**: Diagrams, animations, and videos illustrate neurophysiological concepts [^112oY8UF] [^116h21t6].

- **Written materials**: Handouts and workbooks reinforce key messages and support self-reflection [^116h21t6].

- **Interactive exercises**: Patients engage in activities that challenge maladaptive beliefs and promote adaptive coping [^117MRw26].

---

## Evidence of effectiveness

PNE has been evaluated across multiple chronic pain conditions, with **generally favorable but heterogeneous results** [^111MdJRF]:

| **Condition** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Chronic low back pain | Small-to-moderate improvements in pain, disability, and psychological factors when combined with exercise or manual therapy [^111CVeQ7] [^113vSbKF] |
| Fibromyalgia | Moderate evidence for reduced pain intensity and improved quality of life with higher-dose PNE [^1113kzwd] |
| Chronic musculoskeletal pain | Small-to-moderate effects on pain, disability, and psychological distress, particularly when combined with active therapies [^116GAKzh] [^113vSbKF] |
| Chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty | No superiority of PNE plus exercise over PNE alone, though clinically meaningful improvements occurred in ~1/3 of patients [^113S7c2T] |

---

Overall, PNE is **most effective when integrated with active treatments** and delivered within a biopsychosocial framework [^111CVeQ7] [^1111Ak89].

---

## Mechanisms of action

PNE exerts therapeutic effects through several **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Cognitive reconceptualization**: Shifting beliefs about pain reduces fear-avoidance and catastrophizing [^113vSbKF].

- **Emotional regulation**: Reduced fear and anxiety improve pain coping and function [^116Heu4Z].

- **Behavioral activation**: Increased willingness to engage in movement and exercise promotes recovery [^113uyaqx].

- **Neuroplastic changes**: Central sensitization and pain modulation may improve with sustained behavioral change [^117MRw26].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite growing evidence, PNE faces several **limitations and challenges**:

- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in content, delivery, and outcomes limits comparability and generalizability [^111MdJRF].

- **Optimal dosing**: The ideal duration, frequency, and intensity of PNE remain unclear [^1113kzwd].

- **Clinician training**: Effective delivery requires skilled clinicians with strong therapeutic alliances [^116h21t6].

- **Patient engagement**: Some patients may struggle to reconcile PNE with persistent pain, requiring careful, individualized delivery [^116h21t6].

---

## Integration with other interventions

PNE is **most effective when combined with active interventions**, such as:

- **Exercise therapy**: Graded, cognition-targeted exercise enhances functional outcomes [^117MRw26] [^113vSbKF].

- **Manual therapy**: Hands-on techniques may augment PNE by reducing pain and facilitating movement [^111CVeQ7].

- **Psychological therapies**: CBT and mindfulness-based approaches can reinforce adaptive coping and self-management [^114MdLww] [^114w6Ads].

- **Multidisciplinary programs**: Structured programs embedding PNE improve adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Current research trends and future directions

Current research focuses on **standardizing PNE content and delivery**, identifying patient characteristics that predict response, and exploring digital and AI-enhanced delivery to improve access and personalization [^116PV22h]. Future work should prioritize high-quality RCTs, long-term follow-up, and implementation studies to optimize real-world effectiveness [^1135W4ad].

---

Pain neuroscience education is a **valuable, evidence-based intervention** that reconceptualizes pain to reduce fear-avoidance and improve function in chronic pain. It is most effective when integrated with active therapies and delivered within a biopsychosocial framework, though evidence quality and optimal dosing require further study [^111CVeQ7] [^111MdJRF].

Effectiveness of a Pain Neuroscience Education and Therapeutic Exercise Program Delivered by Primary Care Physiotherapists to Patients With Chronic Nociplastic Spinal Pain ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The main objective of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness, in terms of quality of life, of a therapy based on an Active Coping Protocol for Non-Cancer Chronic Pain in the Primary Care setting. This approach involves no medications or invasive procedures and is based on pain neuroscience education and physical exercise, either alone or combined with treatment targeting body schema and somatosensory disturbances. The comparison will be made against a treatment involving thermotherapy and traditional physical exercise. One of the most well-documented national primary care experiences combining pain neuroeducation and physical exercise, with a detailed methodology, was carried out by the Health System of Castilla y León in Valladolid.

It yielded significant results using a protocol consisting of 6 sessions of pain neuroscience education and 18 sessions of group exercise. Effectiveness will be measured in terms of quality of life, pain intensity, satisfaction level, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, pressure pain threshold, disability index, medication reduction, and number of monthly medical appointments. Secondary objectives include evaluating, in both experimental groups compared to the control, the outcome variables: pain intensity, treatment adherence, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, pressure pain threshold, descending modulation system, lumbar disability index, severity level, anxiety, sleep quality, analgesic consumption, healthcare visits, and satisfaction with care received. A sample size of 135 patients has been calculated and will be randomized into the three study groups.

The control group will receive thermotherapy-electrotherapy and conventional therapeutic exercise. Experimental group 1 will follow the Active Coping Program for Chronic Pain. Experimental group 2 will receive somatosensory and body schema treatment along with the Active Coping Program. The study is evaluator-blinded. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS version 28 and R Core Team. Statistical significance will be set at p-values < 0.
05. Authorization will be requested from the relevant Research Ethics Committee. The results of this study may lead to updates of existing protocols, development of guidelines and manuals for managing chronic musculoskeletal pain, ongoing training for primary care professionals, and publication in high-impact scientific journals to disseminate knowledge.

### Can the assessment of the circadian rhythm of pain Be shortened? A study of community-dwelling participants with chronic pain [^113miWbS]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain, defined as "persistent or recurrent pain extending beyond a duration of 3 months", can be attributed to central nervous system pathologies, exemplification of the aberrant dorsal horn of the spinal cord excitability, or perturbation of pain-inhibitory mechanisms emanating from the cerebral cortex. Psychosocial factors, in addition to these central quandaries, evince an intimate association with pain. The management of chronic pain has proven to be an arduous endeavor in most cases. Consequently, the therapeutic approach to chronic pain gravitates toward enhancing the quality of life and facilitating routine activities rather than the absolute alleviation of pain. The pivotal role of pain management, which encompasses the engagement of pain during daily activities and physical exercise while considering unique pain patterns, has been underscored. Previous studies have demonstrated that a comprehensive, multidisciplinary intervention integrating patient education for pain management could ameliorate self-management and self-efficacy in patients with chronic pain due to diverse etiologies. Heightened physical activity levels correspond inversely with the occurrence of ancillary complications, such as fatigue and depression, in patients with chronic pain. Thus, it is imperative to develop educational interventions tailored to patients with chronic pain to enable the optimization of their daily activities and physical exercise regimens in tandem with the effective management of pain. The incorporation of the circadian rhythm of pain experienced by patients with chronic pain into the assessment process may aid in refining the precision and efficacy of such educational endeavors.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^115nuRh3]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last two decades, a therapeutic approach named pain neuroscience education (PNE) has evolved.PNE is an educational intervention aiming to change patients' understanding of what pain is, what function it serves and what biological processes are proven to underpin it. The fundamental message is that pain is a marker of the perceived need to protect bodily tissue and not a marker of damage or disease. If patients adapt a contemporary pain understanding and integrate this new understanding in their life and rehabilitation process, they are more likely to allow adaptive coping strategies and behaviors, are less fearful and have better function in daily life. If delivered in a combination with further interventions embracing a biopsychosocial framework PNE shows potential to reduce pain and disability.

In a recent meta-analysis looking at the effects of PNE for chronic musculoskeletal pain thirteen randomized controlled trials were considered. The results established low clinical relevance of PNE for pain and disability in short and medium term. For kinesiophobia (short term) and catastrophizing (medium term) clinically relevant results could be shown. Another meta-analysis looking at PNE for chronic low back pain (CLBP) found moderate evidence that PNE shows small to moderate effects on pain and low-level evidence of a small to moderate effect on disability in the short term and also that PNE shows small to moderate effects on pain and disability at three month follow up. The systematic review and meta-analysis by Wood and Hendrick derived that additional PNE to usual physiotherapy interventions in patients with CLBP does improve disability and pain in the short but not long term. They concluded that their results provide support for the addition of PNE to routine physiotherapy practice in CLBP. The divergent results of the mentioned publications might result from looking at PNE effects for CLBP compared to heterogeneous chronic musculoskeletal pain. Also, Watson et al mention to have made their conclusions on sufficient statistical power compared to the other published works.

Additionally, it can be hypothesized that dosage, context and style of content delivery are all pitfalls relevant to therapeutic efficacy of PNE. As recommended by Watson et althe influence of different PNE dosages needs to be further investigated and to our knowledge, only one studylooked at dosage response in patients. Amer-Cuenca et al concluded that in patients with fibromyalgia, a higher dosage of PNE does lead to better results for pain intensity at three month follow up compared to less intensive PNE or biomedical education. They suggest to explore those dosage effects in different patient populations. As guideline-based IMPT does already imply pain education content and the inclusion of PNE in a wider multidisciplinary pain management has long been supportedthe combination of both might result in better outcomes.

For the delivery of a contemporary PNE to patients, it is important to assure that the deliverers have a common depth of understanding of the topic. Research has shown that health care professionals (HCP) do have deficits in pain knowledge which implies a barrier for sufficient patient education about pain. If this is also true for HCP working in the context of IMPT is unknown. To ensure a homogenous, reproducible and an evidence-based pain education during an IMPT program, standardization of the content might be helpful. If the content is based on best available evidence it can avoid a mixed message (biomedical vs biopsychosocial) and assist the team in being consistent which, for physiotherapists, is known to be challenging in chronic pain patients.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of an additional, structured PNE lecture within an IMPT program. As some PNE topics are part of such programs this is the first study looking at the effects of a higher dosage of PNE applied to patients with chronic back pain. It is hypothesized that the additional PNE will produce superior results, especially less pain, compared to the same program without extra PNE. As secondary outcomes, knowledge about pain, disability, fear-avoidance, health-related quality of life (HrQoL), stress, depression and anxiety were analyzed.

### A call for improving research on pain neuroscience education and chronic pain: an overview of systematic reviews [^111MdJRF]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to summarize the evidence of the effects of pain neuroscience education delivered alone or combined with other interventions for chronic pain. DESIGN: An overview of systematic reviews with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), Embase, PsycINFO (via ProQuest), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched from their inception to November 14, 2022. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Systematic reviews (SRs) with meta-analyses including randomized clinical trials. The outcomes were pain and psychological symptoms. DATA SYNTHESIS: AMSTAR 2 assessed the methodological quality of SRs. The primary study overlap was evaluated by calculating the corrected covered area (CCA). RESULTS: We included 8 SRs including 30 meta-analyses of interest that comprised 28 distinct clinical trials. In some meta-analyses, pain neuroscience education delivered alone or combined with other interventions was more effective than control interventions for reducing pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms at some time points. However, other meta-analyses found a lack of effects of pain neuroscience education, and there were inconsistencies between meta-analyses covering the same outcome. The methodological quality of all SRs was critically low. The overlap, including all SRs, was high (CCA = 13%), and very high for SRs covering trials on chronic low back pain (CCA = 40%), chronic spine pain (CCA = 27%), and fibromyalgia (CCA = 25%). CONCLUSION: It is impossible to make clear clinical recommendations for delivering pain neuroscience education based on current meta-analyses. Action is needed to increase and improve the quality of SRs in the field of pain neuroscience education. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(6):1–16. Epub: 10 May 2023. doi:10.2519/jospt.2023.11833.

### Effectiveness of an interactive online group intervention based on pain neuroscience education and graded exposure to movement in breast cancer survivors with chronic pain: a randomised controlled trial [^113JtfSB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in women, and it is estimated that the incidence of new cases will increase worldwide in the next decades. Survival rates are also increasing, but the survivorship phase is often associated with several cancer-related symptoms such as chronic pain, which can affect women's quality of life and their social and professional reintegration. As a result, there is an increasing demand for health care that addresses the chronic sequelae of cancer survivorship (e.g. chronic pain, fatigue). In addition, the side effects associated with prolonged use of pain medication make the development and improvement of non-pharmacological treatments essential.

Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is a cognitive-based intervention that aims to reconceptualise pain by explaining the neurophysiological mechanisms of pain and empowering people to manage their pain experience. PNE has reported broad benefits in addressing chronic pain in different populations, whether applied in isolation or as an adjuvant therapy, but it has been scarcely investigated in breast cancer. González-Martín et al. pointed out that PNE is an effective intervention for reducing pain intensity and the level of catastrophizing in patients with cancer pain, but no benefits were found in relation to quality of life. These authors, together with other previous reviews, highlighted the need for further studies investigating the benefits of patient pain education programmes based on a biopsychosocial content focused on the understanding of acute and chronic pain mechanisms, the identification of the key factors related to each individual painful experience or the relationship between pain, and our lifestyle habits, among others.

### Pain education and knowledge (PEAK) consensus guidelines for neuromodulation: a proposal for standardization in fellowship and training programs [^114NTG6w]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Results: Consensus Statements and Evidence

Consensus Statement 1: Pain fellows should have a strong foundation in pain medicine, including the pharmacology of opioid and non-opioid analgesics, the principles of multimodal pain management, and experience in evaluating and managing chronic pain patients.

Understanding the foundations of pain diagnosis and the nuances of multimodal pain treatment is key to effectively treating pain and improving function. Fellows should be proficient in identifying pain states and mechanisms, anatomic sources of pain, functional limitations and contributors, and psychological confounders. Standardizing the core concepts of pain assessment and treatment taught during pain fellowship ensures that trainees are best equipped with the knowledge to safely and effectively provide advanced pain management care.

The first step in treating chronic pain is to assess and identify the causes of pain accurately. Therefore, history taking, physical examination, and test interpretation abilities are fundamental during pain fellowship training. The overall goal of multimodal pain treatment should be to treat the underlying cause of pain to provide relief while optimizing patient function.

Selecting effective, non-opioid medications for pain treatment requires understanding the mechanisms by which pain signals are transmitted. Vardeh et al describe five pain mechanisms and the types of medications that target them — nociceptive transduction, peripheral sensitization, ectopic activity, central sensitization, and central disinhibition. Different pharmacologic agents can target each of these mechanisms of pain transmission.

Opioids (both natural and synthetic) are among the most effective pain medications available. However, while opioids tend to be predictably effective in acute pain, the use of opioids for chronic pain is more complicated. Prolonged use of opioids is associated with a high risk of side effects, dependence, opioid use disorder, and overdose. As a result, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released updated guidelines and recommendations when using opioids for pain management. Understanding these guidelines is vital to understand the proper multimodal treatment.

### Exercise and pain neuroscience education for patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^113S7c2T]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Up to 20% of patients develop chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), yet there is a scarcity of effective interventions for this population.

Objective

To evaluate whether neuromuscular exercise and pain neuroscience education were superior to pain neuroscience education alone for patients with chronic pain after TKA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A superiority randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 outpatient clinics at Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark. Participants with moderate-to-severe average daily pain intensity and no signs of prosthesis failure at least 1 year after primary TKA were included. Participant recruitment was initiated on April 12, 2019, and completed on October 31, 2022. The 12-month follow-up was completed on March 21, 2023.

Interventions

The study included 24 sessions of supervised neuromuscular exercise (2 sessions per week for 12 weeks) and 2 total sessions of pain neuroscience education (6 weeks between each session) or the same pain neuroscience education sessions alone. The interventions were delivered in groups of 2 to 4 participants.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change from baseline to 12 months using the mean score of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, covering the 4 subscales pain, symptoms, activity of daily living, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS4; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better outcomes). The outcome assessors and statistician were blinded. All randomized participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

Among the 69 participants (median age, 67.2 years [IQR, 61.2–71.9 years]; 40 female [58%]) included in the study, 36 were randomly assigned to the neuromuscular exercise and pain neuroscience education group, and 33 to the pain neuroscience education-alone group. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no between-group difference in change from baseline to 12 months for the KOOS4 (7.46 [95% CI, 3.04–11.89] vs 8.65 [95% CI, 4.67–12.63] points; mean difference, -1.33 [95% CI, -7.59 to 4.92]; p = 0.68). Among the 46 participants who participated in the 12-month assessment in the 2 groups, 16 (34.8%) experienced a clinically important improvement (a difference of ≥ 10 points on the KOOS4) with no between-group difference. No serious adverse events were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, the results demonstrated that neuromuscular exercises and pain neuroscience education were not superior to pain neuroscience education alone in participants with chronic pain after TKA. Approximately one-third of the participants, regardless of intervention, experienced clinically important improvements. Future studies should investigate which patient characteristics indicate a favorable response to exercises and/or pain neuroscience education.

### Impact of enhanced pain knowledge on core outcomes in fibromyalgia patients with high self-reported pain education needs: a target trial emulation using the DANFIB registry [^114Gu1zR]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Therapeutic patient education aims to produce changes in knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to maintain or improve health and encourage adoption of self-management behaviours and lifestyles. Thus, patient education becomes a means to reach certain goals, including reduction in the patient's perceived disease impact on everyday life. Pain education is recommended as first-line care for a variety of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, and meta-analyses indicate that pain education has clinical benefits, particularly when combined with exercise interventions. The effects of patient education are not easily ascertained, as multiple contextual and personal factors may influence educational and subsequent long-term clinical outcomes. This includes variations in personal factors such as individual needs for learning about a given disease and the actual knowledge gained.

In fibromyalgia, the provision of patient education is recommended by evidence-based management guidelines, although the specific content, form and format are only sparsely evaluated, and the optimal approaches are yet to be determined. Pain neuroscience education (PNE), emphasising the role of the central nervous system and challenging prevailing biomedical pain beliefs, is increasingly recommended as a core component in educational programmes. At our institution, we provide a 2-day multidisciplinary patient education programme, which includes PNE, for patients with fibromyalgia. Patients are also invited to participate in the prospective research registry, DANFIB, with annual follow-up assessments via online questionnaires. The DANFIB registry was initiated in 2018 and until May 2023, it has enrolled more than 2200 patients. Hence, the DANFIB registry offers a valuable platform to evaluate whether long-term clinical outcomes improve more in individuals with fibromyalgia who have enhanced their understanding of the pain experience compared with those who have not increased their knowledge about pain.

### Opportunities for chronic pain self-management: core psychological principles and neurobiological underpinnings [^116UHGp3]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

One in five of the population lives with chronic pain. Psychological interventions for pain reveal core principles that can be used to create opportunities for chronic pain self-management in primary practice, across health-care settings, and at home. We highlight the different types of chronic pain and illustrate the psychoneurobiological mechanisms involved. We review core principles for psychological pain management, evaluate the evidence, and illustrate the underlying neurobiology involved. We provide practical advice for how to facilitate pain self-management in clinical practice. Finally, we discuss scientific caveats and practical obstacles to improvement, suggesting possible pathways to implementation.

### The lyceum for pain education: providing accessible education on chronic pain and headaches to a global audience [^117GvecD]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In the absence of evidence, academic speakers often informally comment on the vast array of treatments within their clinical practices, and the directors at the Lyceum of Pain Education have a policy of pushing back. As Holmes wrote regarding such comments, "those kind friends who suggest to a person suffering from a tedious complaint… are apt to enforce their suggestion by adding, that 'at any rate it can do no harm'. This may or may not be true as regards the individual. But it always does very great harm to the community to encourage ignorance, error, or deception in a profession which deals with the life and health of our fellow-creatures". All pain education should be held to the same high standard.

It is important that this analysis notes the recent relationships that we have developed with other entities that are also dedicated to improving the quality of and access to pain management education. First, as part of its affiliation with the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN), the Journal of Pain Research will collaborate with the Lyceum for Pain Education and its weekly Interdisciplinary Pain and Headache Rounds and consider selected contributions to the Interdisciplinary Pain and Headache Rounds for publication as articles in the journal. Having recently developed a new section on Education and Early Career Investigators, the publishers of the Journal have demonstrated a strong concern for improving pain education in the US and abroad, and the Journal's support is greatly appreciated. Second, the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN), the rapidly developing leader in worldwide pain management education, will continue to collaborate closely on the promotion of evidence-based pain education. Our weekly speakers over the past year have included a number of luminaries of ASPN, and this official association will ensure that much of the education that we provide in pain management will mirror the cutting-edge developments that this Society is pioneering. Our gratitude toward the Journal of Pain Research and ASPN for helping us foster this symbiosis cannot be overstated.

### Reviewing the potential role of artificial intelligence in delivering personalized and interactive pain medicine education for chronic pain patients [^116PV22h]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in patient pain medicine education has the potential to revolutionize pain management. By harnessing the power of AI, patient education becomes more personalized, interactive, and supportive, empowering patients to understand their pain, make informed decisions, and actively participate in their pain management journey. AI tailors the educational content to individual patients' needs, providing personalized recommendations. It introduces interactive elements through chatbots and virtual assistants, enhancing engagement and motivation. AI-powered platforms improve accessibility by providing easy access to educational resources and adapting content to diverse patient populations. Future AI applications in pain management include explaining pain mechanisms, treatment options, predicting outcomes based on individualized patient-specific factors, and supporting monitoring and adherence. Though the literature on AI in pain medicine and its applications are scarce yet growing, we propose avenues where AI may be applied and review the potential applications of AI in pain management education. Additionally, we address ethical considerations, patient empowerment, and accessibility barriers.

### Reflections on the role of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain: a shared solution for prescription opioid abuse and pain [^113dp4Z9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The growing numbers of patients with chronic pain, along with the increases in the abuse and overdoses from prescription opioids in the U.S. highlight the urgency to instate better education for healthcare providers in the management of chronic pain and addiction, but also the need to develop better systems for managing and treating chronic pain.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^116vZCq2]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT) programs for chronic back pain are effective and recommended. The patient-centered and biopsychosocial nature of IMPT is grounded in contemporary understanding that chronic pain states reflect heightened sensitization of the nervous system rather than an issue in the tissue. Teaching patients about pain is part of IMPT programs, though a clinical guideline is lacking. This study aims to answer the following question: Does the addition of an evidence-based pain neuroscience education (PNE) lecture for patients, into an IMPT program, produce superior results than the IMPT program itself?

Patients and Methods

A non-randomized, controlled intervention study was performed with 179 back pain patients indicated for IMPT. Intervention group (N = 102) received a four-week IMPT program, which contained 4 one-hour sessions PNE. Control group (N = 77) received the same IMPT without the additional PNE. Primary outcome was current pain after intervention. Pain knowledge, physical function, depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life and fear-avoidance were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Outcomes were defined as change of the parameter measured before and immediately after the four-week IMPT. For each outcome, linear regression models were used to estimate the raw and adjusted (sex, age and BMI) effect of additional PNE.

Results

Despite improvement in all outcomes for both groups during the treatment phase, the implemented PNE did not result in additional pain reduction (regression coefficient for PNE effect on pain level 0.34; 95% CI −6.23–6.97). Between-group differences could only be shown for pain-related knowledge in favor for the intervention group (0.78; 95% CI 0.35–1.20).

Conclusion

The additional PNE lecture did not lead to pain reduction beyond the usual IMPT. However, the PNE did increase pain-related knowledge and, therefore, might be helpful in coping with pain after the IMPT program.

### Exercise and pain neuroscience education for patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^1119LkaP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Patient and Public Involvement

Two patients with chronic pain after TKA assisted in designing the trial from a patient perspective. The patients gave feedback concerning study procedures, interventions, and outcome measures and how to describe and explain the study in layperson's terms to possible participants.

Randomization and Masking

The participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and allocated to 1 of 2 intervention arms, neuromuscular exercises and PNE or PNE alone. Randomization with treatment group concealment was done by the project manager (J.B.L.) by using computer-generated random numbers in permuted blocks of 4 to 8 participants. Outcome assessment was performed by trained outcome assessors (not involved in the study), who were masked toward treatment allocation. The statistician (N.H.B.) conducting the analysis was masked toward group allocation.

Interventions

The neuromuscular exercises and PNE group received a 12-week neuromuscular exercise programand PNE. The neuromuscular exercise program has previously been found feasible for patients following TKA surgery. One-hour group-based sessions consisting of 2 to 4 participants were held twice a week (24 sessions in total). Sessions were supervised by trained physiotherapists and included individualization of the exercise difficulty considering each participant's physical ability and pain intensity. Full details of the neuromuscular exercise program can be found in the study protocol (Supplement 1).

The PNE consisted of two 1-hour group-based educational sessions. The first session was held before the first exercise session for the neuromuscular exercise and PNE group, and the second session took place 6 weeks later. A physiotherapist trained in PNE (J.B.L.) delivered the sessions to both groups. Both intervention groups received the same content in the PNE sessions. The overall aim of PNE was to change maladaptive pain cognitions, enabling the participants to reconceptualize their painand thereby engage in self-management of their symptoms. Following both PNE sessions, a short information leaflet, summarizing the PNE topics, was given to the participants. Content for the PNE sessions can be found in eMethods 1 and 2 in Supplement 2. Assessments of outcomes were conducted at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

### The role of evolving concepts and new technologies and approaches in advancing pain research, management, and education since the establishment of the international association for the study of pain [^111mz2nw]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The decades since the inauguration of the International Association for the Study of Pain have witnessed major advances in scientific concepts (such as the biopsychosocial model and chronic primary pain as a disease in its own right) and in new technologies and approaches (from molecular biology to brain imaging) that have inspired innovations in pain research. These have guided progress in pain management and education about pain for healthcare professionals, the general public, and administrative agencies.

### Pain science education, stress management, and cognition-targeted exercise therapy in chronic whiplash disorders: a randomized clinical trial [^11442scG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Intervention

Both groups received 18 therapy sessions during 16 weeks. All sessions were one-on-one (except for 1 group session), using principles of person-centered care and applying guidance toward self-management, and were delivered by expert-trained physical therapists. Therapists involved in one treatment arm were not involved in the other treatment arm and vice versa. Details on the training of these therapists can be found in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. The modern pain neuroscience approach (MPNA) consisted of 3 pain neuroscience education sessions (totaling 2 hours of education) combined with 15 sessions of cognition-targeted, time-contingent exercise therapy and stress management (totaling 7.5 hours). Usual care physiotherapy (UC) included 3 biomedically focused neck school education sessions combined with 15 sessions of symptom-contingent exercise therapy (totaling 2 and 7.5 hours, respectively). The key treatment difference is that MPNA incorporates a reconceptualization of pain focusing on the brain's central role, along with stress management and exercise therapy not guided by pain. These elements were not included in UC. Full details are given in the trial protocol (Supplement 1) and elsewhere.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^113bzdKY]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Injectable biologics have not only been described and developed to treat dermal wounds, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, but have also been reported to treat chronic pain conditions. Despite emerging evidence supporting regenerative medicine therapy for pain, many aspects remain controversial.

Methods

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) identified the educational need for an evidence-based guideline on regenerative medicine therapy for chronic pain. The executive board nominated experts spanning multiple specialties including anesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and sports medicine based on expertise, publications, research, and clinical practice. A steering committee selected preliminary questions, which were reviewed and refined. Evidence was appraised using the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for evidence level and degree of recommendation. Using a modified Delphi approach, consensus points were distributed to all collaborators and each collaborator voted on each point. If collaborators provided a decision of "disagree" or "abstain", they were invited to provide a rationale in a non-blinded fashion to the committee chair, who incorporated the respective comments and distributed revised versions to the committee until consensus was achieved.

Results

Sixteen questions were selected for guideline development. Questions that were addressed included type of injectable biologics and mechanism, evidence in treating chronic pain indications (eg, tendinopathy, muscular pathology, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc disease, neuropathic pain), role in surgical augmentation, dosing, comparative efficacy between injectable biologics, peri-procedural practices to optimize therapeutic response and quality of injectate, federal regulations, and complications with mitigating strategies.

Conclusion

In well-selected individuals with certain chronic pain indications, use of injectable biologics may provide superior analgesia, functionality, and/or quality of life compared to conventional medical management or placebo. Future high-quality randomized clinical trials are warranted with implementation of minimum reporting standards, standardization of preparation protocols, investigation of dose–response associations, and comparative analysis between different injectable biologics.

Key Points

Question

What is the effect of neuromuscular exercise and pain neuroscience education compared with pain neuroscience education alone on pain and function in patients with chronic pain for more than 1 year after total knee arthroplasty?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 69 patients, neuromuscular exercise and pain neuroscience education did not provide superior pain and function outcomes compared with pain neuroscience education alone, although approximately one-third of all patients experienced clinically important improvements.

Meaning

Findings from this study suggest that neuromuscular exercise and pain neuroscience education do not provide superior pain and function outcomes compared with pain neuroscience education alone, but clinically important improvements in pain and function can be elicited in patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty.

This article reviews how emotions, behavior, and psychiatric comorbidity influence the course and outcome of chronic pain disorders and addresses methods of identifying and managing these problems in clinical practice. Successful medical rehabilitation for patients with chronic pain requires (1) appreciating the effects of biopsychosocial factors in the onset, course, and outcomes of pain disorders; (2) understanding neurobiologic mechanisms linking mind, brain, and body in the functions of pain perception and modulation; and (3) being able to review critically and use selectively the plethora of new medications and interventional technologies that are proposed in the literature. Deficits in these skills now are recognized as hazardous to the public health so that medical school education and post residency training in pain medicine is now mandatory in some states.

### Trigger point dry needling for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome: current perspectives within a pain neuroscience paradigm [^115KebzE]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

How to deal with pain in clinical practice

Applying contemporary pain neuroscience when providing TrP-DN can be conducted as follows. First, pain neuroscience education can be applied before application of dry needling, although this could be modified depending on the type of patient. This allows patients to gain a broader understanding of their pain problem, including the role of neurophysiological (eg, central nervous system sensitization), psychological, social and environmental factors on top of possible biomedical factors such as TrPs areas in the muscle tissue. Pain neuroscience education typically decreases the threat value of pain, diminishes catastrophic thinking about pain, and facilitates a more active coping strategy. However, clinicians may encounter several practical problems when trying to combine pain neuroscience education and dry needling in the context of a patient with chronic pain. That includes occurrence of contradictory messages between the two interventions since TrP-DN is usually perceived as a "painful" intervention by the patient. There is literature suggesting that a brief painful needle insertion (stimulus) is insufficient to induce or maintain central sensitization since the response within the pain neuromatrix is strongly influenced by the context in which the painful stimulus appears and within the context of a therapeutic encounter. In such a scenario, needling therapies may trigger a conditioned pain modulation response by activating an endogenous pain inhibitory mechanism that inhibits nociceptive pain processing.

### Exercise and pain neuroscience education for patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115RMRMx]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that neuromuscular exercises and PNE were not superior to PNE alone for the primary outcome on pain, symptoms, function, and knee-related quality of life or any of the secondary outcomes in participants with chronic pain after TKA. The study demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in approximately one-third of the participants, regardless of intervention group. This finding challenges the perception that nothing can be done to relieve pain in patients with chronic pain after TKA. Therefore, the results could have important implications for the future management of patients with chronic pain after TKA. Despite the contributions of this study, an evidence gap for the treatment and management of patients with chronic pain after TKA remains and should be further addressed in future research.

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^115AsenZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Building a Better Future for Pain Medicine

Advancing Pain Medicine requires a fundamental shift in how fellowship education is designed, with a stronger emphasis on longer-term chronic pain management. A paradigm shift in the design and funding of training programs is essential to address the growing complexity of chronic pain treatment. Central to this transformation is the proposal to extend the duration of Pain Medicine fellowships. This adjustment would enable trainees to follow patients over extended periods, fostering a deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics of chronic pain and its management. Developing dedicated 4-year residencies in Pain Medicine as a distinct discipline would help our trainees achieve this longitudinal expertise even better than requiring fellowships of increased duration.

An interdisciplinary approach to training is equally critical. By integrating rotations in specialties such as behavioral health, physical medicine, rehabilitation, neurology, radiology, spine surgery and rheumatology, fellowship programs can broaden trainees' perspectives and enhance their ability to deliver comprehensive care. This interdisciplinary exposure is crucial for equipping future pain specialists with the diverse tools needed to address the multifaceted nature of chronic pain. Fellowship programs and fellows alike recognize the importance of interventional pain management. The education of the procedures used in this space is essential for fortifying of our field. However, fellowship education should emphasize on non-pharmacologic therapies, as they are the gateway for insurance approval of many interventional procedures and salvage therapy for interventions that may not have met the expectations of the clinician or patient. Given that the evidence-based durability of most of our procedures has an end date of 1–2 years, managing patient symptoms beyond that point may rely on our field's ability to sensibly integrate physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions to make chronic pain care genuinely comprehensive. We posit that fellows should be trained to follow as many patients as possible from the first visit until pain has stabilized. For many patients, this requires several months to years. Following a patient during that timeframe will build an awareness of the different strategies fellows can incorporate into their treatment plans, recognizing their role as an aspect of a multimodal pain management strategy.

### Multimodal intervention based on physical exercise, mindfulness, behaviour change and education to improve pain and health in patients with chronic primary low back pain: a study protocol of the HEALTHYBACK randomised controlled trial [^114MdLww]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The CPLBP population does not usually meet the WHO's physical activity (PA) recommendations (> 150 min/week of moderate PA intensity or at least 75 min/week of vigorous PA intensity). PA presents potential health benefits in individuals with chronic conditions and disability. Individuals with CPLBP have a sedentary lifestyle, remaining longer in sedentary behaviour compared with healthy controls. Implementing inactivity alarms to promote behaviour change and reduce sedentary behaviour may help individuals with CPLBP achieve the WHO's PA recommendations.

The mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) method is based on increasing awareness and acceptance of moment-to-moment experiences, alleviating distress, supporting interpersonal and extrapersonal communication and promoting neuroplastic changes. Previous studies have shown that the MBSR method improves mental outcomes, subjective pain and mobility in individuals with chronic physical impairments. Mindfulness could help individuals with chronic pain accept their pain perception and decrease the need to evade it, allowing positive emotions and qualities.

Recent advances in neuroscience have led to a better understanding of pain mechanisms and highlighted the importance of maladaptive neuroplastic changes and central sensitisation (excessive response of central nervous system nociceptive neurons to normal and subumbral stimuli) in chronic pain. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) aims to educate individuals about their chronic pain experience and help them reconceptualise their pain and coping strategies. It addresses issues such as kinesiophobia (fear of movement), catastrophising (negative thinking), fear-avoidance behaviours and disability. PNE is effective in reducing these maladaptive behaviours and erroneous pain beliefs. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend using PNE combined with physical exercise for individuals with CPLBP, but not as a stand-alone therapy.

Despite all this previous evidence, individuals with CPLBP typically receive single-dimensional and passive therapies, such as pharmacological treatment or manual therapy, as first-line interventions in primary healthcare settings. These therapies often yield short-term improvements and render patients passive observers of their condition, resulting in poorer long-term outcomes. Recent evidence and clinical practice guidelines highlight the significant challenge of implementing multidimensional and active treatment approaches in CPLBP. These approaches encompass physical, biopsychosocial and behavioural components. Integrating supervised physical exercise (physical factors) with MBSR (mental-emotional factors), behaviour change strategies and PNE comprehensively addresses the biopsychosocial aspects of human health. Evaluating the effectiveness of this integrated approach is crucial in determining its impact on pain reduction and overall health improvement in individuals with CPLBP.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^112M9xMh]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Procedure

Patient recruitment was conducted from April 2018 until August 2019 in a center for IMPT in Hamburg, Germany. On the day of IS (t0) patients filled in an electronically administered questionnaire consisting of the primary and secondary outcomes and a study information leaflet was handed out. If patients were willing to participate, they gave informed consent. Patients were then scheduled for the IMPT program which could result in waiting times due to organizational matters or patient preferences. All participants went through the four-week IMPT. On the last day of the program the questionnaires were filled in again (t1). In December 2018, the therapeutic team was updated on latest pain neuroscience and a weekly one-hour PNE lecture for patients was implemented into the IMPT program. This resulted in two groups: One without (Control group) additional PNE, treated between April and November 2018, and one with the PNE lecture (Intervention group) treated between January and August 2019 (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow of patients through the study.

Intervention

IMPT Program

All participants received a four-week IMPT fulfilling recommendations for content and team approach. The program does accomplish the requirements of the OPS catalogue (OPS-2018 8–91c.11). As summarized in Kaiser et al the complex intervention is best described as

simultaneous, contextual, temporal and coordinated, comprehensive strategy to treat patients with chronic pain by integrating various somatic, physical, as well as psychological treatment approaches according to a predetermined therapeutic plan with consensual therapeutic aims among the therapists

with the primary aim of functional restoration and patients' control over pain. The interdisciplinary team is challenged to fundamentally change the patients´ attitude, coping style and beliefs about pain. Patients spend a minimum of four hours daily for four weeks in groups of eight working through a profound therapeutic timetable, provided by pain specialists, psychologists, physiotherapists and sport scientists, which has been published before. Table 1 displays the pain relevant information delivered during the IMPT program utilized in this study which adds up to 960 minutes (4 hours per week) of pain-related content. Importantly, all IMPT content remained unchanged for both groups in our study.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^115mGEcJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Strength and Limitations

A strength of our study is to have used a structured PNE intervention thus allowing for reproducibility and the exploration of a dosage response, which was recommended by Watson et al. As suggested by current literature, we added the PNE to interventions embracing a bio-psycho-social model of patient care, allowing PNE to unfold its best efficacy. Our study is the first to look at the effects of different dosages of PNE applied to patients suffering from chronic back pain.

One main limitation of our study was the allocation of participants to the intervention and control group, which was not at random, but depended on the date of the first consultation. This may have led to structural inequality between the groups. However, baseline characteristic in both groups seem comparable regarding the main potential confounders. Nevertheless, we calculated linear regression models to also quantify the confounder-adjusted effect of intervention on primary and secondary outcomes. No relevant change in estimates was found after adjusting for age, sex and BMI and after additional mutual adjustment for further potential confounders (baseline pain duration, DASS score, FABQ, SF12, FFbH-R, NPQ-D) (results not shown).

A control group receiving no intervention would have allowed to determine if the IMPT treatment phase was better than no treatment at all or natural history. From the authors' perspective, this was not considered as it is ethically not justifiable.

Another limitation is that the authors measured the outcomes directly after the IMPT, whereas a follow-up after three to six months would have added more to the scientific knowledge base of PNE.

Regarding the choice of outcomes, the authors missed assessing psychosocial factors relevant to PNE such as kinesiophobia, catastrophizing or self-efficacy. In addition, patient and provider satisfaction with the IMPT service were not considered and program adherence was merely recorded for the intervention group as stated in the TIDieR checklist.

The pain-related content delivered during the IMPT was not changed for our study and presented as usual. Some elements of the added PNE lectures surely were part of the IMPT program already (Table 1) which might have been perceived as duplicated information by the patients. The authors suggest, that hearing PNE topics more than once is helpful to reinforce the patients' understanding of the delivered information. This idea does also find support in our results, which show higher pain knowledge in the intervention group.

### Trigger point dry needling for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome: current perspectives within a pain neuroscience paradigm [^113BAnSA]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This narrative review presents current perspectives on the clinical application of trigger point dry needling for the management of chronic pain. Current evidence, mostly experimental studies, supports a possible role of myofascial trigger points in relation to the excitability of the central nervous system. The application of trigger point dry needling is able to reduce this excitability by reducing peripheral nociception from the trigger point, by reducing dorsal horn neuron activity, and by modulating brainstem areas. However, effects are only seen at short-term and effect sizes are small, pointing to a particular role that TrPs play within the complex chronic pain experience. There is no consensus on the clinical application of trigger point dry needling since some authors propose the need of eliciting local twitch responses during the needling intervention to be effective, whereas others do not. Finally, the application of trigger point dry needling should be integrated into a pain neuroscience paradigm by combining its application with pain neuroscience education, manual therapy and graded exercises. Future studies should investigate the effects of patient's expectation and patient–clinician interaction in the clinical outcomes of trigger point dry needling.

### Understanding the psychological, physiological, and genetic factors affecting precision pain medicine: a narrative review [^117PG1Ph]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the Field

Precision pain medicine offers the promise of a novel set of solutions to the problem of chronic pain, through mechanism-focused prevention and individualized risk-focused treatment strategies. Unfortunately, the current state of the science is still focused on identification of the critical factors that make up the patient's profile of risk. Precision medicine is dependent on data, but that data also constitute one of the primary areas of concern in the field of precision healthcare. Large volumes of highly specific patient data must be managed appropriately to protect patient privacy. In addition to protecting patient data, access to precision pain management strategies must not be restricted on the basis of financial means or socioeconomic status. In fact, given that the impact of psychological, physiological, and genetic factors could have differential impact on chronic pain risk based on race, ethnicity, sex, and other socioeconomic factors, the application of new findings to diverse groups must be based on evidence-based medicine and not on the assumption that all groups will benefit equally from precision pain management strategies that work for others. Currently, the integration of pharmacogenetics/genomics, nuanced phenotyping, and neuroimaging require the availability of significant infrastructure (eg, clinical expertise, equipment, facilities), but as the cost for these resources decreases and education for their application is more effectively integrated into medical training, they should become more widely used to benefit patients and reduce suffering.

Another limitation includes who is managing pain. While the number of pain centers using multimodal assessment and treatment strategies grew in the 20th century, survey data suggest that only 15% of people living with pain have accessed specialty pain management services and more than 50% of pain management is happening in primary care settings. While there has been significant progress made in the assessment and treatment of pain within these centers of expertise, the successful application of precision pain medicine for the masses depends on integration of these approaches into primary care as well as pain medicine.

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^111yRDuJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, Pain Medicine fellows frequently do not develop long-term relationships with patients, which limits their ability to appreciate the subtle nuances of each individual's pain experience. Given the structure of many fellowships, fellows infrequently see the same patient twice in clinic, reducing their ability to track symptom progression, treatment responses, and the longitudinal impact of psychosocial factors. Some programs address this issue by implementing fellow-centric clinics, where patients are booked under fellows for ongoing follow-up. However, this model comes with trade-offs, as it necessitates a provider transition each academic year, disrupting continuity of care. This frequent turnover can lead to frustration for patients who must repeatedly establish new therapeutic relationships while also limiting fellows' ability to observe the extended trajectory of chronic pain conditions. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary nature of chronic pain management — requiring collaboration with specialties including neurology, behavioral health, physical therapy, and rehabilitation medicine — is insufficiently emphasized within the current fellowship structure. However, the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) selected each of these specialties to ensure that we teach trainees how to manage the complexity of chronic pain states. Effective chronic pain care demands a comprehensive understanding of how these specialties interact to address the physical, emotional, and psychosocial dimensions of pain. However, fellows often have only limited opportunities to engage with these interdisciplinary relationships, which hinders their ability to provide comprehensive care. Evidence suggests that the lack of comprehensive multidisciplinary involvement is caused by trainees' inability to grasp, or that they are not taught the importance of, these care points because of the supremacy of interventional pain management focus in fellowship training.

### Reviewing the potential role of artificial intelligence in delivering personalized and interactive pain medicine education for chronic pain patients [^114mw15G]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To fully harness the potential of AI in patient education, collaboration between healthcare professionals, AI experts, and educators is crucial. By combining their respective expertise, these stakeholders can work together to develop innovative AI-driven educational tools that cater to the specific needs of patients with chronic pain. Healthcare professionals can provide valuable insights into the clinical aspects of pain management, while AI experts can contribute their technical knowledge to develop robust algorithms and systems. Educators can bring their pedagogical expertise to ensure that the educational content is engaging, effective, and aligned with established learning principles.

The future of AI in patient education is promising, with ongoing advancements and discoveries that hold the potential to transform the way we approach pain management. As this field continues to evolve, it is crucial to prioritize collaboration, ethical considerations, patient empowerment, and accessibility to maximize the benefits of AI in improving patient education and healthcare outcomes. By bringing together these diverse perspectives, interdisciplinary teams can create comprehensive and holistic AI-driven educational solutions for pain management. The field of AI in medicine, specifically pain medicine, is in its early stages as limited data are available to draw conclusions. Further original research with multidisciplinary teams is needed to properly guide the field to avoid releasing new applications that may harm the patient while bringing needed assistance to the field of medicine as a whole. Overall, AI holds incredible promise in the field of chronic pain management, potentially bringing improved patient education, adherence, and ultimately better pain relief.

### Trigger point dry needling for the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome: current perspectives within a pain neuroscience paradigm [^113uQMAm]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Integrating contemporary pain science and trigger point needling therapy

When providing dry needling to patients having chronic pain, therapists are advised to integrate contemporary pain neurosciences when providing the treatment. This implies applying evidence-based recommendations; therefore, TrP-DN can be part of, but should never be, the only treatment plan for individuals with chronic pain. Per evidence-based recommendations, a comprehensive management program for chronic pain patients should include neuroscience pain education, exercise programs, self-management (including graded activity), stress management (psychological), sleep management, and other individuallytailored aspects of self-management. Passive treatments, such as needling therapies or manual therapies, can improve pain and function inthe short-term (small-moderate effect sizes), but they should be integrated in a comprehensive pain management approach to contribute to prolonged/long-term effects with medium to large effect sizes. The pitfall when doing this, relates to the message that such passive intervention gives (is perceived) to the patient. The message may strengthen the common patient's biomedical view that (more) pain relates to (more) tissue damage, which is a typical maladaptive belief reducing long-term recovery and patient's independence. Indeed, the traditional model of pain assumes that there is a direct association between the amount of local tissue damage and the level of pain experienced by the patient. It advocates a "find it and fix it" therapeutic model imparting patients' dependence on passive interventions, eg, dry needling or hands-on manual therapy.

### Perspectives of participants with rotator cuff-related pain to a neuroscience-informed pain education session: an exploratory mixed method study [^111cecrh]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To explore perceptions and initial outcomes of patients with rotator cuff-related pain to a pain education session. Materials and Methods: Ten individuals with persistent rotator cuff-related pain (≥ 3months duration) attended an individual pain education session. They completed patient-reported outcomes measures on a weekly basis, three weeks prior and three weeks following the session. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted three weeks following the pain education. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the General Inductive Approach. Results: There were two over-arching key themes: firstly, 'Participants' Perspectives' of the session generated four themes: Improved understanding of 'the whole'; Mindful self-awareness; Taking charge; "The pain is still there". Their understanding of pain was reconceptualised, evident by their ability to describe the role of neurophysiological mechanisms, stress and general well-being towards their pain. The second over-arching key theme, 'Participants' Recommendations', had two themes: Integrating neuroscience with pathoanatomical knowledge and Educating other health professionals. Pain levels decreased post-pain education compared to pre-pain education. Conclusions: Following the pain education session, participants had greater understanding of factors influencing their shoulder pain. Pain education, in addition to pathoanatomical information may be useful as part of treatment for persistent rotator cuff-related pain.

### Additional effects of pain neuroscience education combined with physiotherapy on the headache frequency of adult patients with migraine: a randomized controlled trial [^113DVnmw]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim To assess the efficacy of pain neuroscience education combined with physiotherapy for the management of migraine. Background Physiotherapy can significantly reduce the frequency of migraine, but the evidence is based only on a few studies. Pain neuroscience education might pose a promising treatment, as it addresses migraine as a chronic pain disease. Methods In this non-blinded randomized controlled trial, migraine patients received physiotherapy+pain neuroscience education or physiotherapy alone, preceded by a three-month waiting period. Primary outcomes were frequency of headache (with and without migraine features), frequency of migraine and associated disability. Results Eighty-two participants were randomized and analyzed. Both groups showed a decrease of headache frequency (p = 0.02, d = 0.46) at post-treatment (physiotherapy: 0.77 days, 95%CI: -0.75 to 2.29 and physiotherapy+pain neuroscience education: 1.25 days, 95%CI: -0.05 to 2.55) and at follow-up (physiotherapy: 1.93, 95%CI: 0.07 to 3.78 and physiotherapy+pain neuroscience education: 3.48 days, 95%CI: 1.89 to 5.06), with no difference between groups (p = 0.26, d = 0.26). Migraine frequency was reduced significantly in the physiotherapy+pain neuroscience education group, and not in the physiotherapy group, at post-treatment (1.28 days, 95%CI: 0.34 to 2.22, p = 0.004) and follow-up (3.05 days, 95%CI: 1.98 to 5.06, p < 0.0001), with a difference between groups at follow-up (2.06 days, p = 0.003). Migraine-related disability decreased significantly in both groups (physiotherapy: 19.8, physiotherapy+pain neuroscience education: 24.0 points, p < 0.001, d = 1.15) at follow-up, with no difference between groups (p = 0.583). Secondary outcomes demonstrated a significant effect of time with no interaction between time and group. No harm or adverse events were observed during the study. Conclusion In comparison to physiotherapy alone, pain neuroscience education combined with physiotherapy can further reduce the frequency of migraine, but had no additional effect on general headache frequency or migraine-related disability. Trial Registration The study was pre-registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00020804).

### Neuroscience education as therapy for migraine and overlapping pain conditions: a scoping review [^113EutEh]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroscience education therapy (NET) has been successfully used for numerous overlapping pain conditions, but few studies have investigated NET for migraine.

Objective

We sought to 1) review the literature on NET used for the treatment of various pain conditions to assess how NET has been studied thus far and 2) recommend considerations for future research of NET for the treatment of migraine.

Design/Methods

Following the PRISMA guideline for scoping reviews, co-author (TR), a medical librarian, searched the MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Embase, and Cochrane Central Clinical Trials Registry databases for peer-reviewed articles describing NET to treat migraine and other chronic pain conditions. Each citation was reviewed by two trained independent reviewers. Conflicts were resolved through consensus.

Results

Overall, a NET curriculum consists of the following topics: pain does not equate to injury, pain is generated in the brain, perception, genetics, reward systems, fear, brain plasticity, and placebo/nocebo effects. Delivered through individual, group, or a combination of individual and group sessions, NET treatments often incorporate exercise programs and/or components of other evidence-based behavioral treatments. NET has significantly reduced catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, pain intensity, and disability in overlapping pain conditions. In migraine-specific studies, when implemented together with traditional pharmacological treatments, NET has emerged as a promising therapy by reducing migraine days, pain intensity and duration, and acute medication intake.

Conclusion

NET is an established treatment for pain conditions, and future research should focus on refining NET for migraine, examining delivery modality, dosage, components of other behavioral therapies to integrate, and migraine-specific NET curricula.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^113WUjTa]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

We demonstrated that the PNE lecture changed the patients' pain knowledge significantly better than the control group. As the content of the lecture was aiming at knowledge reconceptualization this was expected. Even though pain knowledge gain was superior for the intervention group, both groups improved their pain knowledge during therapy (intervention 9.49 ± 1.30 vs control 8.71 ± 1.73). Recently published results show that a two-day PNE seminar for physiotherapists lead to a NPQ-D score of 9.98 ± 1.73. Considering those scores as a reference, then the mean pain knowledge in all our study participants can be regarded as sufficient. Our conclusion concerning the knowledge gain in the control group is that the IMPT content alone already delivers an adequate pain message to patients, which results from the implementation of published recommendations. If this is applicable to other institutions offering IMPT is unknown. Comparing the mean pre-post difference of the two groups (intervention 3.95; 95% CI 3.50 to 4.40 vs control 2.77; CI 95% 2.33 to 3.20) it might be statistically significant, as established by the adjusted linear regression model used, but as all other outcomes are comparable between groups, the difference in pain knowledge does not imply any clinical relevance in the short term.

PNE does influence psychosocial factors like kinesiophobia and catastrophizing which are known to lead to pain persistence and chronicity. Hypothetically the intervention group patients will show better long-term results than the controls, as similar effects have been shown in a study done by Moseley et al. In their study, the superior pain reduction of the PNE-group appeared after three and twelve months. They claim that the PNE-group patients' conceptual changes were durable (compared to controls) which might have led to better self-efficacy and long-lasting better pain management skills. Watson et al postulate that PNE content, like pacing and graded exposure, will take time before their skilled application during daily activities. From their perspective, this might cause a delayed effect of PNE on disability. Lee et al could show that an improvement in pain knowledge is associated with less pain and disability one year later. If these positive long-term effects apply to our study will remain unknown due to the lack of a follow-up.

### The lyceum for pain education: providing accessible education on chronic pain and headaches to a global audience [^116jEHhE]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Educational efforts in pain medicine have been a mainstay of international academic organizations for more than 50 years. For example, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) was one of the first of these organizations, and continues today with a mission that includes "exchange of ideas and education to stimulate and support the study of pain and to translate that knowledge into improved pain relief worldwide". However, as commercial industry sponsors found an audience for the marketing of their products and services, a number of pain educational groups went awry. By the late 1990s, external forces seemingly brought increased accountability to the field, and efforts were made to improve educational programs with transparency regarding conflicts of interest and to deliver more evidence-based content and decrease bias. Nonetheless, the problem remains especially challenging within the field of chronic pain, an area of practice in which a number of treatments continue to be supported despite inconsistent evidence for safety and efficacy.

Multiple challenges continue to face pain educators today, such as upholding standards of academic integrity, minimizing conflicts of interest and bias, and maintaining interdisciplinary communication, while remaining accessible for healthcare providers, researchers, patients, and other stakeholders. The Lyceum for Pain Education and its weekly Interdisciplinary Pain and Headache Rounds offer one such template to meet these challenges and mitigate common problems with pain education. Upon switching to a virtual format after 20 years due to the COVID-19 crisis, these seminars provide evidence-based continuing education (CE) to clinicians, researchers, and public policy makers who have an interest in a wide variety of pain topics. The programs are provided at no cost to attendees, with sponsorship derived from philanthropic efforts as opposed to industry funding. In this article, we discuss the challenges that face CE and our experience in navigating them.

### Revisiting the provision of pain neuroscience education: an adjunct intervention for patients but a primary focus of clinician education [^113CRrLv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Society is mired in a serious health care crisis regarding pain and opioid abuse. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) has gained support in the last 20 years as an intervention to help people manage chronic pain. In this Viewpoint, we argue that exercise and movement must be the primary intervention for chronic pain conditions, and that PNE or other adjunctive therapies should only be used if they can foster increased exercise and movement participation. Pain education should be the primary focus of a chronic pain management strategy for students and clinicians. It would help to advance knowledge and skills, and ultimately enhance care and outcomes for patients with chronic pain. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2021;51(2):57–59. doi:10.2519/jospt.2021.9804.

### Integrating mechanistic-based and classification-based concepts into perioperative pain management: an educational guide for acute pain physicians [^114fKP9x]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain begins with acute pain. Physicians tend to classify pain by duration (acute vs chronic) and mechanism (nociceptive, neuropathic and nociplastic). Although this taxonomy may facilitate diagnosis and documentation, such categories are to some degree arbitrary constructs, with significant overlap in terms of mechanisms and treatments. In clinical practice, there are myriad different definitions for chronic pain and a substantial portion of chronic pain involves mixed phenotypes. Classification of pain based on acuity and mechanisms informs management at all levels and constitutes a critical part of guidelines and treatment for chronic pain care. Yet specialty care is often siloed, with advances in understanding lagging years behind in some areas in which these developments should be at the forefront of clinical practice. For example, in perioperative pain management, enhanced recovery protocols are not standardized and tend to drive treatment without consideration of mechanisms, which in many cases may be incongruent with personalized medicine and mechanism-based treatment. In this educational document, we discuss mechanisms and classification of pain as it pertains to commonly performed surgical procedures. Our goal is to provide a clinical reference for the acute pain physician to facilitate pain management decision-making (both diagnosis and therapy) in the perioperative period.

### What is important in transdisciplinary pain neuroscience education? A qualitative study [^116h21t6]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The main focus of Pain Neuroscience Education is around changing patients' pain perceptions and minimizing further medical care. Even though Pain Neuroscience Education has been studied extensively, the experiences of patients regarding the Pain Neuroscience Education process remain to be explored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences in patients with non-specific chronic pain.

Materials and Methods

Fifteen patients with non-specific chronic pain from a transdisciplinary treatment centre were in-depth interviewed. Data collection and analysis were performed according to Grounded Theory.

Results

Five interacting topics emerged: (1) "the pre-Pain Neuroscience Education phase", involving the primary needs to provide Pain Neuroscience Education, with subthemes containing (a) "a broad intake" and (b) "the healthcare professionals"; (2) "a comprehensible Pain Neuroscience Education" containing (a) "understandable explanation" and (b) "interaction between the physiotherapist and psychologist"; (3) "outcomes of Pain Neuroscience Education" including (a) "awareness", b) "finding peace of mind", and (c) "fewer symptoms"; 4) "scepticism" containing (a) "doubt towards the diagnosis and Pain Neuroscience Education", (b) "disagreement with the diagnosis and Pain Neuroscience Education", and (c) "Pain Neuroscience Education can be confronting".

Conclusion

This is the first study providing insight into the constructs contributing to the Pain Neuroscience Education experience of patients with non-specific chronic pain. The results reveal the importance of the therapeutic alliance between the patient and caregiver, taking time, listening, providing a clear explanation, and the possible outcomes when doing so. The findings from this study can be used to facilitate healthcare professionals in providing Pain Neuroscience Education to patients with non-specific chronic pain. Implications for Rehabilitation An extensive biopsychosocial patient centred intake is crucial prior to providing Pain Neuroscience Education. Repetitions of Pain Neuroscience Education, in different forms (verbal and written information, examples, drawings, etc.) help patients to understand the theory of neurophysiology. Pain Neuroscience Education induces insight into the patient's complaints, improved coping with complaints, improved self-control, and induces in some cases peace of mind. Healthcare professionals providing Pain Neuroscience Education should be aware of the possible confronting nature of the contributing factors.

### Chronic pain: what does It mean? A review on the use of the term chronic pain in clinical practice [^117H9dWf]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The term "chronic pain" adopted to define complex long-standing pain without actual known causes had surely a great political significance in the process of legitimation of pain medicine. However, as pain research progresses, it is likely to be misleading, especially for patients.

We call clinicians (physicians, psychologists, nurses, etc.) upon the necessity of avoiding ambiguous and imprecise terminologies as much as possible. The use of a vague terminology may lead to difficulties in grasping the multifaceted complexity of long-standing pain states, and even producing frictions between the physician and the patient, assuming his/her clinical condition to be misinterpreted. Therefore, if a clear name for the patient's clinical condition exists, then that name should be adopted. Otherwise, if a generic term such as "chronic pain" is adopted, then exploring the meanings that the patient attributes to her/his condition is crucial. Labelling patient's pain generically as "chronic pain" may fail to incorporate the range of factors that can contribute to the condition, limiting its understanding and affecting the management strategies that the patient may decide to adopt. As suggested in the literature, we encourage clinicians to create time for providing patient comprehensible information about chronic pain and on the biopsychosocial approach to its management, in order to foster a positive therapeutic alliance and positive health outcomes. It is noteworthy that patients are able to appreciate reconceptualizations of chronic pain from a more integrated perspective, although health professionals may underestimate their ability to understand.

In parallel, we believe social awareness initiatives are needed to enhance public understanding of long-standing pain states, their causes and management strategies, within a biopsychosocial approach. As recommended by the Institute of Medicine, education of health care providers is another crucial part of the necessary cultural transformation of the approach to chronic pain. Particularly, we claim the need for implementing pain curriculum for health care providers and to increase the number of health professionals with advanced expertise in chronic pain care, within a biopsychosocial approach to its assessment, prevention and treatment. Finally, more research is needed on etiological basis of chronic pain conditions as well as on diagnostic methods for neurobiological mechanisms underlying them, from wet biomarkersto other techniques. This is the only way to find the more meaningful label – or labels – and, equally important, to avoid applying the "chronic pain" diagnosis as the outcome of mere process of exclusion. While waiting for progresses of research, as suggested by Gallagher

### Exercise and pain neuroscience education for patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^114LpV6u]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

End-stage knee osteoarthritis is commonly treated with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In 2018, more than 715 000 TKAs were performed in the US, and the number is expected to rise to 1.9 million annually by 2030. Most patients undergoing TKA surgery will experience a positive outcome in terms of pain relief and improved functional performance, but 15% to 20% of patients will develop chronic pain after TKA. Chronic pain after TKA is defined as pain present for at least 3 to 6 months following surgery.

Patients have described the chronic pain after TKA as extreme, constant, and requiring maximal effort to endure. Furthermore, activities of daily living (eg, walking and stair climbing) are impaired in patients with chronic pain after TKA when compared with patients with knee osteoarthritis prior to surgery.

Chronic pain after TKA is considered multifactorial and can be influenced by physiological factors, such as central pain mechanisms, and psychosocial factors. There is a scarcity of high-quality evidence and guidelines on effective treatments of chronic pain after TKA. The lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines leads to inadequate access to optimal treatment and the risk of patients feeling abandoned by the health care system.

Studies have evaluated the inclusion of early postoperative exercises to avoid patients developing chronic pain after TKA but have not found this approach effective. However, a combination of exercise and education treatment modalities could induce beneficial treatment effects in patients with chronic pain after TKA, but to our knowledge, this has never been investigated.

Therefore, we conducted a superiority randomized clinical trial with the purpose of investigating whether a 12-week treatment consisting of neuromuscular exercise and pain neuroscience education (PNE) would prove superior in terms of improving pain and function compared with receiving PNE alone. It was hypothesized that the participants randomized to neuromuscular exercise and PNE would improve significantly more from baseline to 12 months compared with participants randomized to PNE alone.

### Pain education and knowledge (PEAK) consensus guidelines for neuromodulation: a proposal for standardization in fellowship and training programs [^113otAVq]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pain medicine is rapidly evolving, with neuromodulation techniques emerging as effective therapies for various pain syndromes. In this journal article, we summarize the key consensus points identified by the PEAK Consensus Committee regarding the essential knowledge and skills that pain fellows should acquire during their training in neuromodulation.

First and foremost, pain fellows should possess a strong foundation in pain medicine, encompassing an understanding of the pharmacology of opioid and non-opioid analgesics, multimodal pain management principles, and experience in evaluating and managing chronic pain patients. This comprehensive knowledge base forms the bedrock for effective patient care and optimizing pain management outcomes.

Additionally, pain fellows should develop a thorough understanding of the anatomical and physiological aspects relevant to neuromodulation. This includes a detailed grasp of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and peripheral nerves, as well as their intricate connections to the central and peripheral nervous systems. A robust comprehension of these structures and their pathophysiology enables pain fellows to accurately diagnose and target specific pain pathways for intervention.

Furthermore, pain fellows should receive comprehensive training in fluoroscopic and ultrasound-guided imaging techniques to accurately access this anatomy in a minimally invasive manner. Proficiency in radiation safety, identification of musculoskeletal and nervous structures, and precise needle localization are essential skills for successful neuromodulation procedures. This emphasis on imaging ensures the accurate and safe placement of leads and generators during SCS, DRG-S, and PNS implant procedures.

In conclusion, this article presents a concise summary of the PEAK Consensus Committee's recommendations on the core competencies required for pain fellows in the field of neuromodulation. It highlights the importance of a strong foundation in pain medicine, a thorough understanding of relevant anatomy and physiology, proficiency in imaging techniques, selection and management of patients for neuromodulation therapies, technical expertise in device placement and troubleshooting, knowledge of adjunctive treatments, familiarity with different devices and potential complications, and a commitment to ongoing education and research. By adhering to these recommendations, pain fellows can become well-equipped practitioners capable of providing optimal care and improving patient outcomes in neuromodulation.

### Mediterranean pain forum 2024-building a bridge for better pain management education [^113C4C5u]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The program boasts sessions on the intersection of artificial intelligence and pain medicine, exploring the role of technology in diagnostics and treatment. International perspectives on pain medicine education will be discussed, advocating for comprehensive training and certification standards. The education of pain physicians is a topic conspicuously absent from pain management conferences, generally. Given the ongoing controversy regarding training physicians in pain medicine internationally, we will include a number of sessions on this topic, including an international round table that includes some of the world's foremost authorities on pain education.

Notable additions to this year's agenda include a duet session featuring Peter Staats and Sebastiano Mercadante, exploring the dichotomy in ultra-specialized roles for oncologic and benign pain management. Guidance on neuropathic pain assessment and a deep dive into imaging anatomy for pain physicians underscore the commitment to elucidating the cutting edges of practical wisdom and technology.

The sessions on chronic pain intervention have been meticulously curated, covering topics including facetogenic pain, epidurals steroid injections, regenerative medicine, and advanced techniques such as peripheral nerve stimulation. The inclusion of a session on complications avoidance and a roundtable on the algorithm for treating chronic abdominal pain speaks volumes regarding the Forum's dedication to practical insights and innovation.

MPF 2024 will also witness a robust review of responsible opioid therapy, with Sebastiano Mercadante leading discussions on the state of the art in non-cancer pain management. We see this as an important component of our educational endeavor, as while opioids are not necessarily always the optimal treatment for chronic pain, we maintain that these medications need to remain in pain physicians' armamentaria. The program also delves into adjuvants, including exploration of the endocannabinoid system's potential therapeutic applications, as well as other medication categories.

### Dealing with chronic pain: tips to teach undergraduate health sciences students [^112oY8UF]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Educate the Patients and Involve Them in Pain Management

"Explain the pain" is important for changing the understanding of the biological processes that underpin pain. For this purpose, Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) uses the current understanding of neuroscience to help reconceptualise the experience of pain. Translating this for the targeted culture is also important. In fact, PNE has become key to the successful management of chronic pain. When it is combined with other pain interventions, this approach has been associated with health-related cost reduction. Furthermore, PNE has demonstrated a positive effect on kinesiophobia, pain intensity, disability, or catastrophising, which are predictors of negative clinical evolution in chronic pain patients.

Therefore, it is essential to Training health science students in teach this patient-centred therapeutic approach is essential for improving care of future patients. The focus of such educational interventions is the understanding of the biological processes that are thought to underpin pain as a mechanism for reducing pain itself. A combination of different teaching resources to complement in-person pain education can be used, such as prepared pictures, presentation slides, drawings, infographics, metaphors, and books. Research demonstrates that education, as part of multidisciplinary programmes, is likely to improve self-management and self-efficacy in people with chronic pain.

When educating patients is a goal, research indicates that the most effective health promotional programmes for adults are social and educational group activities rather than individual health-focused interventions. Educational group actions can help improve aspects such as differences in coping strategies illness perceptions, self-efficacy, fear-avoidant beliefs, locus of control, and pain attitudes in different populations. However, when these actions are carried out, ethnic and cultural patient characteristics should be considered because these affect the pain beliefs, cognitions, and behaviours in those with chronic pain.

### Pain neuroscience education as the foundation of interdisciplinary pain treatment [^1111Ak89]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain neuroscience education (PNE) can be applied as the foundational core of an interdisciplinary biopsychosocial approach to persistent pain. This article outlines a noninvasive, nonpharmaceutical, and collaborative approach to providing comprehensive pain care, applying evidence-based biopsychosocial treatment strategies within the framework of PNE. Through consistent messaging across all interdisciplinary team members, persistent pain patients can sustain a deeper level of understanding and empowerment, with goals of sustainable improvement and self-management. The application of adult learning theory by patient educators also is discussed.

### Pain neuroscience education and exercise in high school… [^113dSTi7]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain Neuroscience Education and Exercise in High School Students With Chronic Idiopathic Neck PainClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Musculoskeletal pain can affect up to 40% of children and adolescents. Neck pain is one of the most prevalent painful conditions and evidence suggests that its prevalence has increased in recent decades in adolescents aged 16 to 18 years, from 22. 9% in 1991 to
29. 5% in 2011. Interventions based on pain neuroscience education have emerged as promising strategies in chronic pain conditions. In adults this intervention has been explored in many pain conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, but there is only one pilot study in adolescents with chronic NP and one case study in adolescents with fibromyalgia.

Thus, the main objective of the present study is: To compare the effectiveness of an education program based on pain neuroscience education and exercise versus exercise alone, in decreasing pain intensity in secondary school students with chronic and idiopathic NP immediately after the intervention and at 6 months. The secondary objectives are to: i) Compare the effectiveness of these programs immediately after the intervention and at 6 months in i) disability, ii) sleep, iii) pain catastrophizing, iv) fear of movement, v) self-efficacy, vi) central sensitization vii) the strength of the deep neck flexors and extensors muscles and stabilizers of the scapula; and viii) the pressure pain threshold between the two intervention groups;. ii) Explore possible predictors of response to treatment. It is anticipated that the sample will consist of 127 participants from four secondary schools that will be divided into two groups. Both groups will receive the same exercise-based intervention.

The experimental group will receive, in addition to exercise, an intervention based on pain neuroscience education. The intervention will consist of 1 session per week during 8 weeks and will be applied in small groups. The intervention will be performed in a blended-learning format. Five sessions will be face-to-face with up to 45 minutes duration, performed at school and incorporated into physical education classes and 3 will be performed at home, supported by vídeos sent by WhatsApp. The first two sessions will always be face-to-face. Face-to-face sessions will be interspersed with WhatsApp sessions. Study Plan This section provides details of the study plan, including how the study is designed and what the study is measuring. Primary Purpose: Allocation: Interventional Model: Masking: Arms and Interventions.

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^112zAA5L]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain presents unique challenges due to its multifaceted etiology, encompassing psychological, social, anatomical, and physiological factors. Exacerbating these challenges is a high rate of pain morphological fluctuance. Some investigators report that 40–80% of patients with chronic pain are misdiagnosed, often resulting in inadequate or inappropriate treatments. Although many fellowship programs in Pain Medicine focus predominantly on procedural skills and acute pain management, there is insufficient time and attention devoted to appreciating the psychological, autonomic and central changes that manifest in patients with chronic pain throughout their chronic pain experience. One-year fellowships that observe and treat patients with multi-year symptoms inherently marginalize the importance of long-term care and continuity required to address chronic pain effectively.

We submit that the current educational paradigm for Pain Medicine education focuses on procedural aptitude but needs to be optimized for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and maintenance of chronic pain which will lead to better patient selection and to understand the durability of the treatments offered. The current fellowship model is designed for fellows to treat patients at different phases of their chronic pain experience in a fractionated fashion. This paradigm makes it difficult for fellows to learn about the importance of rhythmic pain cycles in patients, which can predict an exacerbation, or resolution, of a pain crisis. Some reports that suggest that Pain Medicine fellows underappreciate the importance of psychometrics in chronic pain patients. This may be due to the fragmented patient care model of a one-year pain fellowships that limits the visibility of psychosocial well-being. This analysis examines the inadequacies of current Pain Medicine fellowship education in preparing physicians to manage chronic pain comprehensively. Extending fellowship training and restructuring educational frameworks to prioritize longitudinal patient care, a deeper understanding of the differences noted in acute and chronic pain, evidence-based decision-making, and interdisciplinary approaches can significantly enhance patient and practitioner outcomes.

### The optimal dose of pain neuroscience education added to an exercise programme for patients with chronic spinal pain: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113twkFt]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain neuroscience education (PNE) has shown promising results in the management of patients with chronic spinal pain (CSP). However, no previous review has determined the optimal dose of PNE added to an exercise programme to achieve clinically relevant improvements. The aim was to determine the dose-response association between PNE added to an exercise programme and improvements in pain intensity and disability in patients with CSP. A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to April 19, 2023. The exposure variable (dosage) was the total minutes of PNE. Outcome measures included pain intensity, disability, quality of life, pressure pain thresholds, and central sensitization inventory. Data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, and certainty of evidence were performed by 2 independent reviewers. The dose-response relationship was assessed using a restricted cubic spline model. Twenty-six randomised controlled trials with 1852 patients were included. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant effect in favour of PNE on pain intensity and disability. In addition, a dose of 200 and 150 minutes of PNE added to an exercise programme was estimated to exceed the minimum clinically important difference described in the literature for pain intensity (-2.61 points, 95% CI = -3.12 to -2.10) and disability (-6.84 points, 95% CI = -7.98 to -5.70), respectively. The pooled effect of the isolated exercise was small. These findings may be useful in optimising the most appropriate PNE dose to achieve clinically relevant improvements in patients with CSP.

### Chronic pain self-management for older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^114w6Ads]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The problem of chronic pain in the elderly

Chronic pain is a common problem in the elderly, and is often associated with significant physical disability and psychosocial problems. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain problems among community-dwelling older adults range from 58–70%. The most common painful conditions among older adults are musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, low back pain, and previous fracture sites. Chronic pain often results in depression, sleep disturbance, decreased mobility, increased health care utilization, and physical and social role dysfunction. Despite its high prevalence, pain in the elderly often is inadequately assessed and treated.

As the United States population grows older, the public health problem of chronic pain and its sequelae will worsen. Projections show dramatic increases in this age group; approximately 25% of the population will be age 65 years or older in 2050. Moreover, by 2030 there will be an estimated 8 million people who are 85 years or older. Thus, there is an urgent and growing need for interventions that are effective in decreasing pain, suffering, and pain-related disability in this group.

The role of self-management in the treatment of chronic painful conditions

There is substantial empirical evidence that attention to cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physiological factors, is necessary for the successful treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain. Empirically supported multimodal therapies that incorporate cognitive and behavioral strategies now exist for many chronic pain conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and low back pain. These therapies aim to enhance the ability of patients to successfully self-manage their pain, using a variety of techniques. Related approaches and strategies are described under the rubrics "cognitive-behavioral therapy" (CBT), "psycho-educational" or "educational", and "self-management" or "self-help". Although there are variations among these approaches, they share some or all of the following components: education about pain, instruction in the identification and modification of negative thoughts, exercise, communication skills, relaxation training, and physical therapies. The goal of the therapies is to enhance function, improve mood, and decrease pain intensity by changing the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to pain.

### Reducing opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain in primary care using an evidence-based, theory-informed, multistrategic, multistakeholder approach: a single-arm time series with segmented regression [^117TMBsz]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2023). High credibility.

Opioid use is influenced by personal, social, organisational and legislative factors, and multistrategic solutions are also required to reduce the experience of pain. Pain is now understood to arise from a combination of sensory, cognitive and affective factors, and interventions to address pain must address each of these influences. Catastrophising is one cognitive factor which is known to affect both pain itself and risk of opioid misuseand, though associated with anxiety, has an effect on risk of opioid misuse independent of anxiety. Pain neuroscience educationand cognitive–behavioural therapyhave also been found to be effective in improving pain management. Pain neuroscience provides specific education which includes explaining the biological processes that underpin pain, with the aim of shifting a person's understanding of their pain from that of a marker of tissue damage or disease, to that of a marker of the perceived need to protect body tissue. This approach helps patients to better understand that pain can be decreased when the credible evidence of danger to the body is less than the credible evidence of safety to the body. Results from studies that have used educational approaches to help patients manage pain have shown that this approach can increase physical function, reduce catastrophising and normalise perception of pain. However, it is unknown as to whether this approach assists with reducing opioid use.

Based on the collective epidemiological evidence of factors influencing pain as well as successful strategies for improving medicine use and improving pain management, we designed a model (figure 1) to guide the development of a multistrategic, precision public health intervention targeting long-term opioid users and their health providers.

Figure 1
Pain model.

The intervention strategies included patient-specific audit and feedback, deprescribing guidance, information on how to assess catastrophising, pain neuroscience education and a cognitive tool for use by patients with their primary healthcare providers.

Primary healthcare in Australia is federally funded, with patients free to use a general practitioner (GP) of their choice. Patients do not have to register with a single practice, and are free to attend multiple practices. There is no separate health network for former military service members ('veterans'). Veterans receive care from primary care GPs who also treat non-veteran patients. We considered the GP who provided the most care to a veteran in a year to be the veteran's primary GP.

This study aimed to determine the impact of the effect of a chronic pain intervention and follow-on interventions on opioid use and alternative service utilisation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.

### Improving long-term outcomes for chronic low back pain: time for a new paradigm? [^114dWjTL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

These are exciting times for physical therapists who treat people with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Many of the mysteries of this condition are starting to be revealed, and it appears that major breakthroughs are on the way. Advances in neuroimaging, coupled with increased understanding of the molecular and submolecular events associated with the symptoms of back pain, are helping us reconceptualize the etiologies and mechanisms of this condition. The result of these advances is that physical therapists now have a wide range of potential "treatment packages" that can include patient education, manual therapy, and a wide variety of exercise options for people with CLBP. The question is, "How can long-term, self-management programs become more effective?"

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^111CVeQ7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Pain neuroscience education (PNE) for chronic low back pain — alone versus adjunct to other therapies — shows small short-term benefits overall, with larger effects when combined with exercise or manual therapy. An RCT (n = 104) in adults with chronic pain reported small or moderate short-term benefits of pain psychology and neuroscience education versus a health behavior education program for pain severity and pain interference at 1-month follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis found PNE produced small additional benefits over no PNE for short-term pain (weighted mean difference, 0.73), with slightly higher benefits when used alongside physical therapy interventions (weighted mean difference, 1.32); short-term disability also favored PNE (weighted mean difference, 0.42), and adding PNE to physiotherapy interventions showed larger benefits (weighted mean difference, 3.94), though heterogeneity precluded definitive 12-month conclusions. No included studies of PNE alone improved pain, whereas 5 of 6 combining PNE with another treatment improved outcomes; RCTs combining PNE with multimodal therapeutic exercise (n = 56) or with manual therapy (n = 36) showed moderate or large short-term benefits for pain and function. The evidence update concluded that effects were mostly small and greater when PNE was combined, and the 2021 recommendation states: Physical therapists should deliver PNE alongside other physical therapy interventions, such as exercise or manual therapy, to patients with chronic LBP.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^113THUqr]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this non-randomized, controlled intervention study, we found evidence that in patients with chronic back pain additional 4 one-hour PNE lectures during an IMPT program had no extra benefit on current pain levels directly after the four-week program compared to the same IMPT without these lectures. Despite pain knowledge none of the secondary outcomes proofed to be superior in the intervention group.

We could show that all patients, not depending on group allocation, did improve over the intervention period. MCID thresholds could be attained for current pain, function, fear-avoidance and HrQoL thus implying clinically meaningful improvements for all study participants.

Research points out that the effects of PNE on pain intensity are uncertain, but a higher dosage and intensity does show a tendency towards larger effects and needs to be further investigated to be able to provide guidance on optimizing interventions and outcomes. In our study, we show a clinically relevant pain reduction over the intervention time in both groups which implies that a further pain reduction constitutes a therapeutic challenge. Our results prove that a higher dosage of pain education (additional four hours) was not sufficient to achieve superior results. Supposedly this might be due to an attained ceiling effect for pain reduction through the IMPT program alone. If an even higher intensity of PNE or another style of delivery (one-on-one vs groups of eight) would have produced better results therefore is questionable.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^115yRkKX]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The addition of 4 one-hour PNE sessions into a four-week IMPT program for chronic back pain patients does not lead to superior results at discharge for current pain but does increase pain-related knowledge. We conclude that the application of a higher dosage of pain education content within the IMPT has not been successful in achieving better patient-relevant outcomes in the short term. Nevertheless, the higher pain knowledge scores could lead to better pain management in the long term.

### Effectiveness of pain neurophysiology education on musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GAKzh]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the effectiveness and safety of Pain Neurophysiology Education (PNE) on pain, disability, and psychological distress at post-intervention and long-term (closest to twelve months after initiating the intervention) in musculoskeletal pain (MSKP).

Methods

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) were identified in six engines, reference lists, ClinicalTrials.gov, and by contacting key researches. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Meta-analyses, using Restricted Maximum Likelihood Method, were conducted to estimate standardized mean differences (SMD) and overall quality of evidence was evaluated according to GRADE.

Results

In total, 18 RCTs (n = 1,585) were included. There was small to moderate effects of PNE on pain at post-intervention and long-term: SMD = -0.32 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -.58; -.05) and SMD = -0.40 (95% CI: -.78; -.03), respectively. On disability, PNE had a small effect at post-intervention: SMD = -0.17 (95% CI: -.34; -.01) but was insignificant at long-term: SMD = -0.27 (95% CI: -.59; .06). Likewise, there was a small to moderate effect on psychological distress at post-intervention: SMD = -0.36 (95% CI: -.67; -.06) but was insignificant at long-term: SMD = -0.37 (95% CI: -.75; .01). Quality of evidence was low across all outcomes. Additional analyses showed significant effects of PNE, corresponding to moderate effects, on pain and psychological distress at both time points in chronic MSKP.

Conclusions

Overall quality of evidence was low, supporting PNE being safe and having small to moderate effects on pain at both time points, and on disability as well as psychological distress at post-intervention.

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^112tndE4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic Pain Management: A Continuum of Care

Effective chronic pain management necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing understanding the patient's trajectory over extended periods, often months or years. In contrast to acute pain, which typically presents with a distinct onset and resolution, chronic pain is characterized by persistence. It is influenced by maladaptive behaviors, psychological stressors, and fluctuating social determinants of health. These factors can exacerbate symptoms and create a complex array of challenges for both patients and healthcare providers.

Notwithstanding this complexity, current Pain Medicine fellowships are structured to follow patients for a maximum of one year, providing limited opportunities for fellows to observe the long-term progression of chronic pain conditions involving psychological lability and its influence on the pain experience. This fragmented care model often limits fellows' abilities to understand the full spectrum of chronic pain management, including the durability or lack thereof of interventions and the evolution of pain conditions over time. For example, while fellows may become proficient in performing interventional procedures such as nerve blocks or spinal cord stimulation, they often lack the opportunity to observe patients' long-term outcomes or adjust care plans based on treatment efficacy and durability.

### Effect of pain neuroscience education combined with cognition-targeted motor control training on chronic spinal pain: a randomized clinical trial [^117MRw26]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Effective treatments for chronic spinal pain are essential to reduce the related high personal and socioeconomic costs.

Objective

To compare pain neuroscience education combined with cognition-targeted motor control training with current best-evidence physiotherapy for reducing pain and improving functionality, gray matter morphologic features, and pain cognitions in individuals with chronic spinal pain.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted from January 1, 2014, to January 30, 2017, among 120 patients with chronic nonspecific spinal pain in 2 outpatient hospitals with follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Interventions

Participants were randomized into an experimental group (combined pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted motor control training) and a control group (combining education on back and neck pain and general exercise therapy).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were pain (pressure pain thresholds, numeric rating scale, and central sensitization inventory) and function (pain disability index and mental health and physical health).

Results

There were 22 men and 38 women in the experimental group (mean [SD] age, 39.9 [12.0] years) and 25 men and 35 women in the control group (mean [SD] age, 40.5 [12.9] years). Participants in the experimental group experienced reduced pain (small to medium effect sizes): higher pressure pain thresholds at primary test site at 3 months (estimated marginal [EM] mean, 0.971; 95% CI, -0.028 to 1.970) and reduced central sensitization inventory scores at 6 months (EM mean, -5.684; 95% CI, -10.589 to -0.780) and 12 months (EM mean, -6.053; 95% CI, -10.781 to -1.324). They also experienced improved function (small to medium effect sizes): significant and clinically relevant reduction of disability at 3 months (EM mean, -5.113; 95% CI, -9.994 to -0.232), 6 months (EM mean, -6.351; 95% CI, -11.153 to -1.550), and 12 months (EM mean, -5.779; 95% CI, -10.340 to -1.217); better mental health at 6 months (EM mean, 36.496; 95% CI, 7.998–64.995); and better physical health at 3 months (EM mean, 39.263; 95% CI, 9.644–66.882), 6 months (EM mean, 53.007; 95% CI, 23.805–82.209), and 12 months (EM mean, 32.208; 95% CI, 2.402–62.014).

Conclusions and Relevance

Pain neuroscience education combined with cognition-targeted motor control training appears to be more effective than current best-evidence physiotherapy for improving pain, symptoms of central sensitization, disability, mental and physical functioning, and pain cognitions in individuals with chronic spinal pain. Significant clinical improvements without detectable changes in brain gray matter morphologic features calls into question the relevance of brain gray matter alterations in this population.

### Response to "the future of pain medicine: emerging technologies, treatments, and education" [letter] [^115Fo2X8]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

To conclude, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the future of pain management. However, the complexity of adopting emerging technologies should be considered. Future reviews should strengthen stratified patient studies, set standards, analyze efficacy differences through large-scale trials, build predictive models, and improve research generalizability and accuracy. Interdisciplinary collaboration platforms and professional training mechanisms should be developed to overcome professional barriers and effectively integrate technology into pain medicine. A technology evaluation and resource balance system should also be established to ensure that patients in different regions benefit. These measures are crucial for rapid advancement in pain management.

### Effectiveness of an intervention based on pain neuroscience education compared to conventional treatment in adults with cancer pain: clinical trial protocol | JCO global oncology… [^111SKtz4]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose Pain is the second most frequent symptom reported in patients with cancer, due to its multidimensional characteristics involving cognitive and central sensitization mechanisms that require other intervention strategies. Modern pain neuroscience has improved the understanding of pain, including the role of sensitization in pain intervention processes. In this regard, the use of educational modalities has been recommended. In this sense, neuroscience education is an intervention that provides elements of the neurophysiology of pain that are transferred to the patient through examples or metaphors. The objective is to examine the effectiveness of PNE on pain and biopsychosocial variables in comparison with conventional management.

Methods A single-blind controlled clinical trial will be carried out, which requires 82 adults with the presence of oncological pain due to prostate cancer in men and uterine and breast cancer in women in stages III and IV. A baseline evaluation will be generated considering pain and biopsychosocial variables. After that, randomization will be carried out where two groups will work: one corresponding to pain neuroscience education, where the participants will carry out one weekly session until completing 9 educational sessions each with a duration of 30 minutes; the second group will not receive the educational intervention; and the two groups will have the elements of conventional management estimated by the treating physician. The post-intervention evaluation will be carried out after 10 weeks for both groups.

Within the statistical processing, analysis will be considered per protocol and by intention to treat according to the variables evaluated. Results This study is in the process of recruiting patients according to the sample inclusion criteria. Conclusion It is expected that the intervention based on education in pain neuroscience will have greater effectiveness in pain modulation processes compared to patients who did not receive the intervention; it is expected that the educational content generated can be used in patients with these characteristics.

### Guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience for using artificial intelligence in interventional spine and nerve treatment [^114GwoMx]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

As artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly evolves, its integration into pain medicine is still emerging in machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics amongst many others that could revolutionize the way pain conditions are diagnosed, treated, and managed. Using AI-based interventions to improve pain recognition, prediction, and self-management is effective. Additionally, the utilization of AI patient education platforms can empower patients to actively participate in their pain treatment by understanding their pain and making informed decisions. AI should improve health care access and delivery resulting in an improved experience for clinicians and patients.

Clinician oversight is crucial in ensuring AI technology's safe and effective implementation in pain medicine due to the complexity of pain conditions and the variability of patient treatment responses. Pain is a multifactorial and subjective experience that can influence the psychological state, social environment, and individual differences in pain perception. Finally, clinicians are essential to maintaining patients' trust in the healthcare system. Clinicians help bridge the gap between AI technology and patient care, providing reassurance and confidence in the effective treatment of chronic pain patients.

In conclusion, while AI technologies have the potential to revolutionize the field and improve patient outcomes, the expertise and judgment of clinicians are irreplaceable in ensuring the safe, effective, and ethical use of AI. By working collaboratively with AI systems, clinicians can harness the power of technology to deliver personalized, evidence-based care that meets each patient's unique needs.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^112zVNVG]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Education and self-management strategies

Education and self-management are useful strategies to include in the management of patients with TMD. When comparing these interventions with occlusal splints, a slight benefit was obtained with education. However, when compared with other interventions, such as manual therapy or therapeutic exercise, no additional benefits were observed. Nevertheless, it is assumed that education and self-management strategies are good to combine with other techniques, as observed by Wright et aland Michelotti et al. Most studies performed with education and self-management have included only patients with myofascial TMD, leading to a lack of evidence regarding other types of TMD. There is a need to define better what should be included in patients' education and which self-management strategies are best according to the various types of TMD and regarding the psychosocial impairments that frequently affect patients with TMD. However, the authors consider that public and patient education could be much promising in patients with TMD, especially those based on neuroscience education, because this approach has been shown to reduce pain, disability, and psychological factors in chronic musculoskeletal disorders.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^1134s8xr]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT) is a recommended and complex intervention for people with persisting pain. Despite the lack of a clear international consensus on the definition for IMPT content, for the German health care system the structure and process parameters are defined and proposed by a task force of the German IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain) chapter. Their published IMPT contents are recommended as best practice in the national guideline for the treatment of non-specific low back pain. Even though IMPT is recommended and first-line treatment for chronic pain patients it is underutilized, and actual content lacks transparency.

While an interdisciplinary team delivers a variety of interventions, educating the patients is a strong common denominator through all professions and a consistent recommendation from clinical practice guidelines. Patients should receive education about their prognosis, diagnosis and treatment options. Education about pain and its underlying mechanisms also needs to be addressedand patients' pain knowledge should be challenged during IMPT in concordance with contemporary pain neuroscience. As there are no detailed descriptions of how to apply pain education content during IMPT it is left at the discretion of the treatment center or institution. Kaiser et alcall for standardization of therapeutic procedures within IMPT to allow for reproducibility and research, thus it seems meaningful to develop a structured pain education content and explore its therapeutic efficacy.

### Know pain, know gain? A perspective on pain neuroscience education in physical therapy [^115x8DSY]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is incredibly complex, and so are decisions as to its treatment. During physical therapy care, pain neuroscience education (PNE) aims to help patients understand more about their pain from a biological and physiological perspective. Accompanying the growing evidence for the ability of PNE to reduce pain and disability in patients with chronic pain is an increased interest in PNE from scientists, educators, clinicians, and conference organizers. However, the rise in popularity of PNE has highlighted a historical paradox of increased knowledge not necessarily corresponding with improved care. This Viewpoint discusses the growth and popularity of PNE as well as critical future considerations such as clinical application, clinical research, appropriate outcome measures, and the blending of pain education with exercise and manual therapy.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^113ap6QN]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

For sample description the mean, standard deviation and minimum and maximum values were calculated for continuous covariates, for categorial covariates, percentages are reported. Group differences at baseline were tested by conducting a t -test (continuous variables) or a chi-square test (categorial variables). For group related pre-post-sample statistics mean, standard error and 95% confidence interval (CI) for change of each outcome variable were calculated. The effect of PNE on outcomes was estimated via linear regression models. For each outcome, two models were calculated: a raw model with post intervention values as dependent variable and pre intervention values as well as group variable as independent variables, and an adjusted model, with additional sex, age and BMI as independent covariables. As result, we reported the beta-estimator for the PNE effect, its 95% CI and the p-value for each effect. The significance level was set a-prior at α ≤ 0.05. Missing values were excluded from analysis by listwise deletion. SAS 9.4 was used for data analysis (SAS Institute Inc. NC).

### Pain education and knowledge (PEAK) consensus guidelines for neuromodulation: a proposal for standardization in fellowship and training programs [^117WEQRi]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-term results have also demonstrated the durability of this therapy. A single-center prospective study of 62 patients with chronic neuropathic pain of multiple types treated with DRG-S reported significant pain reduction and improved functionality sustained through a 3-year follow-up period.

Given this growing body of evidence supporting DRG-S, all fellows in interventional pain medicine must receive foundational training in this technique. This training should include both lecture-based and practical components. Since 2019, guidelines and best practices for DRG-S have been published by multiple groups, including the NACC and ASPN. These foundational papers provide evidence-based recommendations on patient selection, procedural techniques, and post-operative care, ensuring pain fellows receive comprehensive and standardized training. By adhering to these guidelines, pain fellows can develop a solid foundation in DRG-S, enabling them to offer safe and effective treatment options for patients suffering from chronic pain.

Concepts of particular importance in the lecture curriculum include the anatomy and physiology of the DRG, its role in the chronic pain state, and the mechanisms by which stimulation of the DRG relieves pain. The lecture material should also review the techniques of safe DRG-S lead placement and implantation. Fellows should also receive education on the existing clinical data for DRG-S and a review of the appropriate levels to target based on the site of pathology. This material should be supplemented with case reviews to highlight real-world use examples of DRG-S.

Practical components include hands-on training in society cadaver labs and company-sponsored labs. Other considerations would be the establishment of partnerships with institutions performing a higher volume of DRG-S cases for fellows to visit as an away rotation.

Consensus Statement 8: Pain fellows should be trained in adjunctive therapies such as medication management, physical therapy, and psychological interventions in conjunction with SCS, DRG-S, and PNS therapies.

### Pain education and knowledge (PEAK) consensus guidelines for neuromodulation: a proposal for standardization in fellowship and training programs [^114whrZ3]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple non-pharmacologic options help reduce pain and restore function in treating pain patients. First-line therapies involve non-invasive interventions and can instill powerful psychological and physical tools when addressing underlying chronic pain issues. To that end, physical therapy and psychological interventions are effective for chronic pain patients. Introducing these modalities early in the therapy pathway is important for patients and can help supplement other modalities or prevent the need for pharmacological or invasive non-pharmacological options.

Not all people will respond to non-invasive or pharmacological modalities, and presenting interventional pain modalities may be an option in these patients. With appropriate diagnosis and patient selection, interventional pain management can be very effective regarding pain intensity, interference, and quality of life. As per recent comprehensive guidelines developed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, an individualized stepwise interventional approach carried out by fellowship-trained pain physicians is paramount in providing successful and safe patient care. Setting a solid foundation for diagnosing pain generators will lead to better patient selection and outcomes with various pain modalities and interventions. A stepwise, individualized approach is essential when treating pain patients. Using multiple modalities simultaneously (ie, cognitive behavioral therapy combined with epidural steroid injections) may aid a swifter recovery and return to function.

Consensus Statement 2: Pain fellows should thoroughly understand the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and peripheral nerves, including their connections to the central and peripheral nervous systems.

The PEAK consensus recommends that pain fellows thoroughly understand the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and peripheral nerves. This also includes the connection between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Given the increasing prevalence of chronic pain, this knowledge is essential for understanding pain mechanisms and developing effective multimodal pain management strategies. Multiple pain societies have content outlines for the recommended fundamentals, including the International Neuromodulation Society (INS) and the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).

While spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion stimulation can be an effective pain management tool, it does carry some risks. Thus, pain physicians need expert knowledge of the relevant anatomy to decrease the risk of neurologic injury.

PNE teachers need an excellent understanding of pain neurophysiology but also, they should have caring, insightful and pedagogical skills for best content delivery. There was no competency assessment evaluating the HCP skills to deliver the PNE content.

Clinical and research implications

As proposed by other researchers higher pain-related knowledge seems to be to the patients' benefit in the long term regarding pain and disability. Therefore, long-term effects need to be further investigated.

We suggest that our PNE lecture might show better effects in a clinical situation, where an interdisciplinary team is not already delivering a structured and up-to-date pain education or even in a monodisciplinary setting, eg outpatient physiotherapy.

Due to the design of our study, some pain-related information was delivered more than once. If this was helpful or not is unclear but diminishing all doubled information could be an option to save human and monetary resources.

### Perceived factors influencing the success of pain neuroscience education in chronic musculoskeletal pain: a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies [^115f25gZ]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to identify the factors influencing the success of Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) in chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain from the perspective of those experiencing PNE first-hand.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies. Articles were found on MEDLINE via Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINHAL, and PsycINFO up to April 2023. Eligible qualitative studies focussed on adults (> 16 years old) with a diagnosis of chronic primary or secondary MSK pain who performed PNE. Thematic synthesis by Thomas and Harden was followed. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool ensured the quality of the studies, while the Confidence in Evidence from the Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) approach facilitated data confidence assessment.

Results

Nine studies were included (188 participants). Three analytical themes were developed: (i) "Efficient Communication of Information", emphasising the importance of accurate content transmission; (ii) "Emotional Support and Well-being", recognising emotional aspects as integral to treatment; and (iii) "Empowerment Promotion", focusing on information retention and personal transformation. The studies showed good quality, with moderate confidence in the evidence.

Conclusions

The perceived factors influencing the success of PNE are intricately related to the domain of communication, the emotional dimension of personal experience, and the capacity to be empowered.

### In the spine or in the brain? Recent advances in pain neuroscience applied in the intervention for low back pain [^117Vi9Vm]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Conservative, surgical and pharmacological strategies for chronic low back pain (CLBP) management offer at best modest effect sizes in reducing pain and related disability, indicating a need for improvement. Such improvement may be derived from applying contemporary pain neuroscience to the management of CLBP. Current interventions for people with CLBP are often based entirely on a "biomedical" or "psychological" model without consideration of information concerning underlying pain mechanisms and contemporary pain neuroscience. Here we update readers with our current understanding of pain in people with CLBP, showing that CLBP is not limited to spinal impairments, but is also characterised by brain changes, including functional connectivity reorganisation in several brain regions and increased activation in brain regions of the so-called 'pain matrix' (or 'pain connectome'). Indeed, in a subgroup of the CLBP population brain changes associated with the presence of central sensitisation are seen. Understanding the role of these brain changes in CLBP improves our understanding not only of pain symptoms, but also of prevalent CLBP associated comorbidities such as sleep disturbances and fear avoidance behaviour. Applying contemporary pain neuroscience to improve care for people with CLBP includes identifying relevant pain mechanisms to steer intervention, addressing sleep problems and optimising exercise and activity interventions. This approach includes cognitively preparing patients for exercise therapy using (therapeutic) pain neuroscience education, followed by cognition-targeted functional exercise therapy.

### Interventional spine and pain procedure credentialing: guidelines from the American society of pain&neuroscience [^117EUbX3]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The executive leadership of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience developed a consensus working group consisting of both interventional pain physicians and spine surgeons to create guidelines. The sections were divided based on the expertise of each individual physician. The lead author created key questions regarding the history and evolution of interventional pain management, the role of regulatory bodies and societies, education, safety data monitoring and the future of interventional pain procedures.

What is Interventional Pain Management and Interventional Spine Care? How is It Different from Pain Medicine?

Pain medicine is a heterogenous field of medicine. Although its origins parallel the birth of anesthesiology, aspects of the field have been fortified by other disciplines including surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and radiology. To the non-pain physician or patient, the field is confusing. For this reason, it is important to understand the background, practice philosophy, and goals of physicians who are a part of this wondrous field.

Pain physicians may choose to be comprehensive, though not specialized, or may be focused on a certain aspect of pain medicine. The ideal model, the interdisciplinary clinic, where there are several disparate experts working cohesively, invented at the University of Washington by Dr. John Bonica in the 1960s, is unfortunately cost-prohibitive in today's healthcare system. Some larger systems, academic, Veteran's Affairs, or otherwise, may mimic or take parts of the interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary model for care.

HIVMA/IDSA chronic pain — general management principles and education: As with other chronic diseases, chronic pain management requires repeated evaluations over time. A holistic, multimodal approach that involves a comprehensive interdisciplinary team is recommended for all persons with chronic pain. This approach may include patient education on the neurophysiology of pain, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral therapy. The goal of treatment is to restore function.

### Effect of additional pain neuroscience education in interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy on current pain. A non-randomized, controlled intervention study [^116xf4zs]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary Outcome

Current Pain Level: Pain was measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from no pain at all (0) to worst imaginable pain (100). Minimal clinical important difference (MCID) is published with 20mm or 30% decrease. We a priori calculated a sample size of 17 in each group, which would have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 20 (the difference between the intervention Group mean of 30 and the control Group mean of 10) assuming that the common standard deviation is 20 using a two group t -test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. For organizational reasons, all patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, who were treated within the study period, were also included in the study (N = 179). This resulted in a power of > 99% to detect an effect of ≥ 20mm change.

### Exercise and pain neuroscience education for patients with chronic pain after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115ARaeg]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, the NEPNEP trial is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating exercise and education for patients with chronic pain after TKA. Our results revealed that neuromuscular exercise and PNE were not superior to PNE alone for the primary outcome KOOS 4 in patients with chronic pain after TKA or for any of the secondary outcomes. Consequently, the results did not support the hypothesis that neuromuscular exercises and PNE would lead to greater improvements in pain and function than would PNE alone. We observed clinically important improvements in approximately one-third (34.7%) of the participants with chronic pain after TKA, regardless of treatment allocation.

Studies evaluating the effect of treatments introduced in the early postoperative period, have not considered that patients who undergo TKA often experience spontaneous improvements in pain between 3 and 9 months after surgery. Hence, the observed treatment effects could have been influenced by the natural course of improvement after TKA and are therefore not generalizable to patients with chronic pain more than 1 year after TKA. Our findings contribute insight into the treatment of the patients who do not experience spontaneous improvements postoperatively and still experience chronic pain for at least 1 year after their TKA surgery.

Qualitative research has shown that patients with chronic pain after TKA feel abandoned by the health care system and the lack of treatment options. Therefore, patients experience their pain as something they are stuck with and that nothing more can be done. Our results challenge that perception. Given that both intervention groups experienced similar outcomes, the introduction of PNE as treatment could be of particular importance. By providing PNE, patients might realize the factors they can influence themselves, which could lead to improved self-management.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the neuromuscular exercise and PNE group exhibited an improvement in KOOS 4 immediately after the 3-month supervised exercise therapy program. While the neuromuscular exercise and PNE-alone group largely maintained their improvements until the 12-month follow-up, the PNE group gradually improved from baseline to 12 months. This could indicate that exercising is effective when performed with effects diminishing over time, similarly to findings within hip and knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, it would be valuable to investigate whether a longer period of exercise therapy or booster sessions could provide sustained improvements.

### Consensus guidelines for the use of peripheral nerve stimulation in the treatment of chronic pain and neurological diseases: a neuron project from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^116veFnG]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Progress within peripheral nerve stimulation has brought us to a pivotal time in the field. Efficacy research, including RCTs yielding impactful data on outcomes, important work on healthcare utilization and economics is building the case for PNS among payors; data on secondary outcomes such as reduced opioid utilization, functional outcomes, and sleep as well as minimizing sick and disability leave all add to the value proposition of PNS for patients. The endless frontier of possibilities for nerve targets and indications and significant research and understanding in non-pain applications continue to expand. These consensus guidelines (See Table 13) provide an essential framework for skilled interventional pain practitioners, offering evidence-based recommendations intended to guide current clinical practice and support decision-making in this evolving field. These practitioners leading our field can help refine the education tracks of our training to optimize ultrasound skills, image-guided lead placement, and understanding of patient selection and nerve targeting. The future of PNS holds great promise powered by research, technological advancement, and the determination of practitioners who have seen transformative outcomes in their patients.

Table 13
Summary of ASPN NEURON PNS Consensus Guidelines

Consensus Guideline 18: High level evidence, including RCTs, on efficacy, healthcare utilization and economic data, as well as work focused on functional outcomes, opioid use, and indirect benefits all strongly support the use of PNS in patients with chronic pain. PNS is a well-established and evidence-based therapy for patients with chronic pain who have failed conservative treatment.

### Short-term impact of combining pain neuroscience education with exercise for chronic musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113vSbKF]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Exercise and pain neuroscience education (PNE) have both been used as standalone treatments for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The evidence supporting PNE as an adjunct to exercise therapy is growing but remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of combining PNE and exercise for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, when compared with exercise alone. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 6, 2020. A quality effects model was used to meta-analyze outcomes where possible. Five high-quality randomized controlled studies (n = 460) were included in this review. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of individual studies, and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation analysis was conducted to determine the quality of evidence for each outcome. Meta-analyses were performed for pain intensity, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing using data reported between 0 and 12 weeks postintervention. Long-term outcomes (> 12 weeks) were only available for 2 studies and therefore were not suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in pain (weighted mean differences, -2.09/10; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.38 to -0.80; low certainty), disability (standardized mean difference, -0.68; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.20; low certainty), kinesiophobia (standardized mean difference, -1.20; CI, -1.84 to -0.57; moderate certainty), and pain catastrophizing (weighted mean differences, -7.72; 95% CI, -12.26 to -3.18; very low certainty) that favoured the combination of PNE and exercise. These findings suggest that combining PNE and exercise in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain results in greater short-term improvements in pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing relative to exercise alone.

### Effectiveness of training physical therapists in pain neuroscience education for patients with chronic spine pain: a cluster-randomized trial [^116oHysZ]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic spinal pain poses complex challenges for health care around the world and is in need of effective interventions. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is a promising intervention hypothesized to improve pain and disability by changing individuals' beliefs, perceptions, and expectations about pain. Pain neuroscience education has shown promise in small, controlled trials when implemented in tightly controlled situations. Exploration of promising interventions through more pragmatic methodologies is a crucial but understudied step towards improving outcomes in routine clinical care. The purpose was to examine the impact of pragmatic PNE training on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic spine pain. The cluster-randomized clinical trial took place in 45 outpatient physical therapist (PT) clinics. Participants included 108 physical therapists (45 clinics and 16 clusters) and 319 patients. Clusters of PT clinics were randomly assigned to either receive training in PNE or no intervention and continue with usual care (UC). We found no significant differences between groups for our primary outcome at 12 weeks, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function computer adaptive test {mean difference = 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.73 to 2.83), P = 0.25}. The PNE group demonstrated significant greater improvements in pain self-efficacy at 12 and 2 weeks compared with no intervention (mean difference = 3.65 [95% CI: 0.00–7.29], P = 0.049 and = 3.08 [95% CI: 0.07 to -6.09], P = 0.045, respectively). However, a similar percentage of participants in both control (41.1%) and treatment (44.4%) groups reported having received the treatment per fidelity question (yes or no to pain discussed as a perceived threat) at 2 weeks. Pragmatic PT PNE training and delivery failed to produce significant functional changes in patients with chronic spinal pain but did produce significant improvement in pain self-efficacy over UC PT.

### Reductions in kinesiophobia and distress after pain neuroscience education and exercise lead to favourable outcomes: a secondary mediation analysis of a randomized controlled trial in primary care [^116Heu4Z]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain neuroscience education combined with exercise (PNE + exercise) is an effective treatment for patients with chronic spinal pain. Yet, however, little is known about its underlying therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this study aimed to provide the first insights by performing a novel mediation analysis approach in a published randomized controlled trial in primary care where PNE + exercise was compared with standard physiotherapy. Four mediators (catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, central sensitization-related distress, and pain intensity) measured at postintervention and 3 outcomes (disability, health-related quality of life, and pain medication intake) measured at 6-month follow-up were included into the analysis. The postintervention measure of each outcome was also introduced as a competing candidate mediator in each respective model. In addition, we repeated the analysis by including all pairwise mediator-mediator interactions to allow the effect of each mediator to differ based on the other mediators' values. Postintervention improvements in disability, medication intake, and health-related quality of life strongly mediated PNE + exercise effects on each of these outcomes at 6-month follow-up, respectively. Reductions in disability and medication intake were also mediated by reductions in kinesiophobia and central sensitization-related distress. Reductions in kinesiophobia also mediated gains in the quality of life. Changes in catastrophizing and pain intensity did not mediate improvements in any outcome. The mediation analyses with mediator-mediator interactions suggested a potential effect modification rather than causal independence among the mediators. The current results, therefore, support the PNE framework to some extent as well as highlight the need for implementing the recent approaches for mediation analysis to accommodate dependencies among the mediators.

### Pain science education, stress management, and cognition-targeted exercise therapy in chronic whiplash disorders: a randomized clinical trial [^116K6fqj]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Despite this limitation, existing evidence cautiously suggests that pain neuroscience education, stress management, and exercise therapy, when applied separately, may benefit individuals with cWAD. Therefore, combining these interventions within a structured neuroscientific framework holds considerable potential for this population. To address this gap, we performed the first sufficiently powered multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT), to our knowledge, with long-term follow-up to evaluate whether pain neuroscience education combined with stress management and cognition-targeted exercise therapy is superior to UC (ie, biomedically focused education and symptom-contingent exercise therapy) in cWAD. We hypothesized that this combined approach would be more effective to improve pain-related disability, pain, health care costs, function, and pain cognitions.

Results

Participants

A total of 524 patients were screened for eligibility. For 266 patients the interdisciplinary team regarded IMPT as not indicated. Another 79 could not be included due to exclusion criteria age (< 20, > 60) or pain duration of < 6 months. Finally, 179 patients were included. No relevant difference between groups could be established. Both groups are homogenous with respect to the distribution of the covariates and directly comparable. See Table 2 for the sample characteristics.

Table 2
Sample Description

Primary Outcome

Current Pain

In our study, current pain level of chronic back pain patients, measured before and directly after the IMPT, decreased −30.03 (95% CI −35.31 to −24.76) in the intervention and −33.09 (95% CI −38.19 to −27.99) in the control group, resulting in a between-group difference of 3mm on a 100mm scale in favor for the control group (Table 3). No effect could be observed of additional PNE on change of current pain level in the raw (regression coefficient for PNE effect 0.11; 95% CI −6.42–6.65; p = 0.97) as well as in the adjusted model (0.34; 95% CI −6.23–6.97; p = 0.92) (Table 4).

Secondary Outcomes

In this study, all secondary outcomes improved in both groups during the intervention time (Table 3). However, additional effect of PNE was observed only for pain knowledge. We found improvement of NPQ-D in the raw (0.85; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.29; p < 0.01), as well as the adjusted (0.78; 0.35 to 1.20; p < 0.01) linear regression model in favor for the intervention group. However, no effect could be observed for additional PNE on any other secondary outcome (Table 4).

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^1113KeDp]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, enhancing the curriculum on invasive pain management techniques is essential. Fellowship programs should provide structured opportunities for simulation-based training, case-based learning, and extended exposure to complex cases. These efforts would help fellows better understand the indications, risks, and long-term outcomes associated with these interventions, enabling them to apply these techniques more effectively in their future practice.

By rethinking and expanding Pain Medicine fellowship education, we can better prepare the next generation of specialists to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving field, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with chronic pain.
