## Question

A 23-year-old college student was playing basketball when he fell directly onto his left elbow. He had sudden, intense pain and was unable to move his elbow. He was taken immediately to the emergency room by his teammates. He has no prior history of trauma or any chronic medical conditions. His blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg, the heart rate is 92/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. He is in moderate distress and is holding onto his left elbow. On physical examination, pinprick sensation is absent in the left 5th digit and the medial aspect of the left 4th digit. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition?
A. Axillary neuropathy
B. Radial neuropathy
C. Median neuropathy
D. Ulnar neuropathy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which nerve is most likely injured after a fall directly onto the left elbow resulting in loss of pinprick sensation in the left 5th digit and the medial aspect of the left 4th digit, with inability to move the elbow due to pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise sensory deficit and map it to a nerve distribution. Then, I should verify the elbow trauma mechanism and its anatomical vulnerability for nerve injury. Next, I will review each named option (axillary, radial, median, ulnar) and compare their expected sensory territories to the exam. After that, I need to check whether the mechanism and timing are compatible with an acute compressive or traction injury at the elbow. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and note any key differentials or confirmatory tests to consider.

> Let me first confirm the sensory deficit pattern: absent pinprick in the left 5th digit and the medial aspect of the left 4th digit; this is the classic ulnar nerve sensory distribution, the so-called ulnar fourth and entire fifth fingers, which aligns with the palmar and dorsal ulnar territories supplied by the ulnar nerve [^116mugis] [^111AC9BR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the anatomic plausibility of ulnar nerve involvement from a direct blow to the elbow. The ulnar nerve courses posterior to the medial epicondyle through the cubital tunnel, a fibro-osseous groove where it is superficial and vulnerable to contusion, traction, or entrapment during elbow trauma, especially with valgus or direct impact, and this location is a common site of compression neuropathy in both chronic and acute settings [^111AC9BR] [^117EvduQ] [^113ff5fH].

> Next, I should review the differential options against this sensory map. Axillary neuropathy would typically produce deltoid weakness and sensory loss over the lateral shoulder, not the ulnar hand, so this pattern does not fit axillary involvement, making option A unlikely. Radial neuropathy classically affects dorsal lateral hand sensation and wrist/finger extension; it would not explain isolated ulnar two-finger numbness, so option B is also unlikely in this scenario [^1132pu4C]. Median neuropathy would affect the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger; it would spare the little finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger, which contradicts the described deficits, so option C is not supported here [^116Zy2qQ].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and mechanism alignment with ulnar neuropathy. The immediate onset of sensory loss after a direct elbow impact is consistent with acute ulnar nerve contusion, traction, or dynamic compression at the cubital tunnel, and acute ulnar neuropathy at the elbow can present with sensory loss and medial elbow pain following trauma, with symptoms often exacerbated by elbow flexion due to increased tunnel pressure and nerve tension [^111AC9BR] [^1113rt25] [^117EvduQ].

> I should double-check whether any confounders could mimic this pattern. Carpal tunnel syndrome would involve the radial three-and-a-half fingers and would not explain isolated ulnar two-finger numbness, and cervical radiculopathy would typically follow a dermatomal pattern and often includes neck or proximal arm symptoms, which are not described here, reinforcing that the lesion is most consistent with a focal ulnar neuropathy at the elbow rather than a distal median entrapment or cervical root process [^116Zy2qQ] [^11558CNM].

> Let me consider confirmatory steps, even though the clinical picture is already quite specific. Neuromuscular ultrasound can measure ulnar nerve cross-sectional area or diameter at the elbow and has evidence-based diagnostic utility for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, with commonly used thresholds and swelling ratios supporting localization and confirmation of the clinical impression, and electrodiagnostic studies can further characterize severity and localization if needed, especially if symptoms persist or surgical planning is contemplated [^113npVgh] [^116mWFG9] [^115iPuVx].

> Putting this together, the sensory loss in the little finger and ulnar aspect of the ring finger, the direct elbow trauma mechanism, and the superficial course of the ulnar nerve through the cubital tunnel collectively point to ulnar neuropathy at the elbow as the most likely etiology, making option D the best answer [^111AC9BR] [^117EvduQ] [^113ff5fH].

---

The most likely etiology is **ulnar neuropathy** due to direct trauma to the ulnar nerve at the elbow from the fall, causing sensory loss in the 5th digit and medial half of the 4th digit. The ulnar nerve is **most vulnerable at the cubital tunnel** [^111AC9BR] and can be injured by blunt trauma, compression, or traction, producing this classic sensory pattern [^1113rt25]. Axillary neuropathy would cause deltoid weakness and lateral shoulder sensory loss; radial neuropathy would cause wrist and finger extension weakness and dorsal hand sensory loss; median neuropathy would cause thenar weakness and thumb, index, middle, and radial half of ring finger sensory loss.

---

## Anatomical and clinical correlation

The **ulnar nerve** originates from the medial cord of the brachial plexus (C8–T1) and courses posterior to the medial epicondyle through the **cubital tunnel**, a fibro-osseous canal on the medial aspect of the elbow [^117EvduQ]. It provides sensory innervation to the medial aspect of the forearm, the ulnar aspect of the hand, and the little finger and ulnar half of the ring finger [^1113rt25]. Motor innervation includes the flexor carpi ulnaris, **flexor digitorum profundus (ulnar half)**, and intrinsic hand muscles [^116mugis].

---

## Mechanism of injury

Direct trauma to the medial aspect of the elbow can compress, contuse, or lacerate the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel, leading to acute ulnar neuropathy [^113V5m8p]. The cubital tunnel is a common site of ulnar nerve entrapment due to its superficial location and limited mobility, making it particularly susceptible to injury from blunt trauma or repetitive elbow flexion-extension [^117EvduQ].

---

## Clinical presentation

The patient's sensory deficits — loss of pinprick sensation in the 5th digit and the medial aspect of the 4th digit — are characteristic of ulnar nerve involvement [^1113rt25]. This pattern corresponds to the ulnar nerve's sensory distribution and strongly suggests ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^111AC9BR].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Nerve involved** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to patient's presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| Axillary nerve | - Sensory loss over lateral shoulder <br/> - Deltoid weakness | Not consistent with patient's sensory deficits |
| Radial nerve | - Sensory loss over dorsolateral hand <br/> - Wrist and finger extension weakness | Not consistent with patient's sensory deficits |
| Median nerve | - Sensory loss over thumb, index, middle, and radial half of ring finger <br/> - Thenar weakness | Not consistent with patient's sensory deficits |
| Ulnar nerve | - Sensory loss over little finger and ulnar half of ring finger <br/> - Intrinsic hand muscle weakness | Consistent with patient's sensory deficits |

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

While clinical examination strongly suggests ulnar neuropathy, confirmatory diagnostic tests may include:

- **Electrodiagnostic studies**: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) can confirm ulnar nerve involvement and localize the lesion to the elbow [^111iEPyq].

- **Imaging**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound can visualize the ulnar nerve and identify structural abnormalities, such as swelling, compression, or entrapment at the cubital tunnel [^113npVgh] [^113ff5fH].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely etiology of the patient's condition is **ulnar neuropathy** resulting from direct trauma to the ulnar nerve at the elbow. The sensory deficits observed are characteristic of ulnar nerve involvement, and the mechanism of injury aligns with the anatomical vulnerability of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel [^111AC9BR].

### Diagnosis and treatment of work-related ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^111AC9BR]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome and occurs most commonly at the elbow due to mechanical forces that produce traction or ischemia to the nerve. The primary symptom associated with UNE is diminished sensation or dysesthesias in the fourth or fifth digits, often coupled with pain in the proximal medial aspect of the elbow. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. Surgery should include exploration of the ulnar nerve throughout its course around the elbow and release of all compressive structures.

Ulnar nerve instability

The term "ulnar nerve instability" refers to chronic conditions where the UN partially or completely dislocates during elbow flexion and relocates during elbow extension. UN dislocation can occur due to congenital partial or complete absence, laxity, or a tear of the retinaculum (Osborne ligament), a hypoplastic trochlea, posttraumatic cubitus valgus deformity, tight posterior medial collateral ligament bundle, or increased cubital tunnel pressure. UN movement is not always associated with neuropathy, as several studies documented the presence of this condition in 2% to 49% of asymptomatic healthy elbows. However, recurrent subluxation of the nerve at the elbow can cause tractional and frictional damage. Additionally, the nerve is more vulnerable to trauma in its partially dislocated position, where it lies superficially on the medial humeral epicondyle, potentially leading to ulnar neuropathy. When symptomatic, UN instability may present with pain in the medial elbow region, sometimes accompanied by tingling and paresthesia in the 4th and 5th fingers. Patients may report a "snapping" sensation and exhibit a positive Tinel sign. Clinical examination may reveal a palpable dislocation of the nerve over the medial epicondyle.

### Imaging in the diagnosis of ulnar nerve pathologies-a neoteric approach [^116mugis]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The ulnar nerve is a branch of the C8 and T1 nerve roots and arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus. It supplies the intrinsic muscles of the hand and assists the median nerve in functioning of the flexors. Also known as the musician's nerve, it is the second most common nerve involved in compressive neuropathy following the median nerve. Common sites of entrapment include cubital tunnel at the elbow, the ulnar groove in the humerus and the Guyon's canal at the wrist. Patients present with altered sensation in the ulnar fourth and the fifth digit and the medial side of arm with loss of function of intrinsic muscles of the hand, the flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar fibres of flexor digitorum superficialis in more severe cases. Diagnosis relies on clinical examination, electrodiagnostic studies and imaging findings. Plain radiographs are used to identify fracture sites, callus, or tumours as cause of compression. Technological advances in ultrasonography have allowed direct visualisation of the involved nerve with assessment of exact site, extent and type of injury. It yields unmatched information about anatomical details of the nerve. MR imaging adds to soft tissue details and helps in characterising the lesion. This pictorial review aims to illustrate a wide spectrum of causes of ulnar neuropathies as seen on ultrasound and MRI and emphasises upon the importance of imaging modalities in the diagnosis of neuropathies.

Conclusions

Imaging plays just a role in the correct interpretation of elbow neuropathies, which relies on the knowledge of the course, function, and pathology of peripheral nerves, the awareness of sensory and motor innervation, and the subsequent clinical picture associated with entrapment neuropathies. US is certainly superior to MRI for evaluating nerves' structure and dynamic motion, but it is less sensitive to muscle changes associated with denervation. The knowledge of anatomical landmarks (vessels, muscles, tendons, bones) and sites of compression is essential for being used as guidance for the assessment of peripheral nerves.

Cubital Tunnel Syndrome is the second most common peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity. It presents as elbow, forearm, or hand pain in the ulnar nerve sensory distribution and it is the result of overuse, trauma, or entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Proper physical diagnosis can localize the site of ulnar nerve entrapment to the elbow or wrist. Both conservative and operative modalities exist to treat the Cubital Tunnel Syndrome; optimal management is still unclear.

With the intricate anatomy of the hand and upper extremity, there are many possible etiologies of pain. In addition, one must be alert to conditions typically affecting other areas of the body presenting in the hand and upper extremity. To add to the complexity of diagnosis, one must also be aware of potential secondary gains. With this in mind, a thorough history, physical examination, and broad differential can help avoid mislabeling patients with uncommon ailments.

Secondary ulnar nerve palsy, an unusual condition in which the onset of ulnar nerve dysfunction occurs 1 to 3 months after elbow trauma, can be the cause of sudden deterioration of elbow function. Initially recognized in 1899, this condition has not been reported often. We describe 2 patients who had no subjective or objective evidence of ulnar nerve dysfunction after elbow trauma but had a sudden loss of motion, pain, and clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of ulnar nerve compression at the elbow 4 to 5 weeks after trauma. Marked improvement occurred after ulnar nerve subcutaneous transposition and contracture release.

Introduction

Entrapment neuropathies are common conditions in which peripheral nerves are compressed or stretched because of congenital or acquired disorders (or a combination of both). Diagnosis and management of these entities are based on patient history, physical and electrophysiological findings, and imaging evaluation. Imaging is useful to confirm the diagnosis, determine the site of compression, identify the underlying cause, and provide an anatomical roadmap of the nerve before surgery or interventional procedures. The elbow is the crossing point of the three main nerves of the upper limb, namely the ulnar nerve (UN), radial nerve (RN), and median nerve (MN). Because of their anatomic location and the dynamic forces at the elbow, it represents a common site of compressive neuropathy. In this setting, ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the imaging modalities of choice; plain radiography and computed tomography (CT) have a marginal role, being helpful for the evaluation of bony deformities and soft tissue calcifications/ossifications.

In this narrative review, we will discuss the imaging findings of entrapment neuropathies involving the UN, MN, and RN at the elbow.

### Ulnar nerve subluxation and dislocation: a review of the literature [^114JM9xP]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of ulnar nerve subluxation and dislocation is widely debated. Upon elbow flexion, the ulnar nerve slips out of the groove for the ulnar nerve, relocates medial or anterior to the medial epicondyle, and returns to its correct anatomical position upon extension. This chronic condition can cause neuritis or neuropathy; however, it has also been suggested that it protects against neuropathy by reducing tension along the nerve. This article reviews the extant literature with the aim of bringing knowledge of the topic into perspective and standardizing terminology.

### Imaging of elbow entrapment neuropathies [^1119ChCB]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

For US examination of the MN, the transducer is placed transversely on the anterior aspect of the elbow joint. At this level, the MN runs medial to the brachial artery and between the humeral and ulnar heads of the pronator teres muscle. Here, the brachial artery branches into the radial and ulnar arteries. The ulnar artery travels deep to the ulnar head of the pronator teres, and the MN can be observed in the proximal forearm along the medial aspect of the ulnar artery. Videos 05–06 show how to scan the MN from the upper arm to the elbow (Video 05) and from the elbow to the forearm (Video 06).

Kiloh-nevin or AIN syndrome

AIN syndrome is characterized by absent motor function in the muscles supplied by the AIN and is quite rare, comprising less than 1% of all nerve syndromes of the upper limb. The exact etiology and pathophysiology of AIN remain unclear, although common theories suggest either an idiopathic immune-mediated neuritis or intrinsic compression of the AIN around the elbow. Causes of AIN compression include the heads of the pronator teres muscle, the proximal edge of the flexor digitorum superficialis arch, enlarged bicipital tendon bursa, lacertus fibrosus, a thrombosed radial artery branch in the mid-forearm, a thrombosed ulnar artery, tendinous bands, and osseous spurs. Additionally, the AIN can be entrapped by anatomical variants such as Gantzer's muscle, which is an anomalous head of the flexor pollicis longus. Direct traumatic injury to the AIN from trauma (e.g. penetrating injuries, forearm fractures, venipuncture), extrinsic masses (e.g. tumors), or external compression of the forearm (e.g. from guitar playing, shoulder immobilization slings, crutches) is rare and not considered true AIN syndrome due to differing pathophysiology, with symptoms often resolving once the external compression is eliminated.

### Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity [^116SDCej]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral nerves in the upper extremities are at risk of injury and entrapment because of their superficial nature and length. Injury can result from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, systemic disease, and entrapment. The extent of the injury can range from mild neurapraxia, in which the nerve experiences mild ischemia caused by compression, to severe neurotmesis, in which the nerve has full-thickness damage and full recovery may not occur. Most nerve injuries seen by family physicians will involve neurapraxia, resulting from entrapment along the anatomic course of the nerve. In the upper extremity, the brachial plexus branches into five peripheral nerves, three of which are commonly entrapped at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Patients with nerve injury typically present with pain, weakness, and paresthesia. A detailed history and physical examination alone are often enough to identify the injury or entrapment; advanced diagnostic testing with magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, or electrodiagnostic studies can help confirm the clinical diagnosis and is indicated if conservative management is ineffective. Initial treatment is conservative, with surgical options available for refractory injuries or entrapment caused by anatomic abnormality.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^11558CNM]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

Cervical spine — History and physical examination emphasize pain patterns, paresthesia validity, dermatomal mapping, and key maneuvers. Cervical spine pain is a common clinical condition affecting activities of daily living and QoL in people around the world and can manifest as neck pain, shoulder or trapezius pain, scapular pain, and upper extremity pain. Radicular pain is most likely to travel below the elbow, and somatic referred pain is most often limited to above the elbow, although either can occasionally cross these boundaries. In contrast to the lumbar spine, paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and in the hand it is considered more valid than forearm paresthesia distribution. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to localize paresthesia and they present with diffuse, nondermatomal symptoms. Digit-specific patterns include thumb or index finger paresthesia attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index involvement) assigned to C7, and the little finger assigned to C8. Assessment is based on history and an extensive examination including neurological, motor, sensory, and reflex evaluation plus provocative maneuvers such as Spurling's neck compression test, shoulder abduction test, neck distraction test, Lhermitte sign, Hoffman sign, and Addison's test.

### Tardy ulnar nerve palsy [^114tgg1w]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Tardy ulnar nerve palsy is a chronic clinical condition characterized by a delayed onset ulnar neuropathy after an injury to the elbow. Typically, tardy ulnar nerve palsy occurs as a consequence of nonunion of pediatric lateral condyle fractures at the elbow, which eventually lead to a cubitus valgus deformity. While the child grows, the deformity worsens and the ulnar nerve is gradually stretched until classic symptoms of ulnar nerve neuropathy appear. Other childhood elbow trauma has also been associated with tardy ulnar nerve palsy, including supracondylar fractures resulting in cubitus varus, fractures of the medial condyle and of the olecranon, as well as radial head or Monteggia fractures/dislocation, with or without deformity. The clinical assessment includes obtaining a complete history, physical examination, nerve conduction tests, and elbow imaging studies. Treatment consists of ulnar nerve decompression, with or without corrective osteotomy, with overall successful results usually achieved.

### Phantom pain in a patient with brachial plexus avulsion injury [^116cn3L1]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Phantom limb pain is a painful sensation perceived in the absent limb following surgical or traumatic amputation. Phantom limb sensations, which are nonpainful, occur in nearly all amputees. Deafferentation can also produce similar symptoms. Here we report the presence of phantom pain in a deafferented limb.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Hospital-based outpatient clinic.

Patient

A 65-year-old man was referred to the pain clinic for management of upper extremity pain secondary to brachial plexus avulsion (BPA) following a motor vehicle accident. Initially he noticed a feeling of growing and shrinking of his arm. Following this, the pain started gradually from his elbow extending to his fingertips covering all dermatomes. He described the pain as continuous, severe, and sharp. He also described the arm as being separate from his existing insensate arm and felt as though the fist was closed with the thumb pointing out. On physical examination, he had no sensation to fine touch or pressure below the elbow. There were no consistent areas of allodynia. He had diffuse muscle wasting in all the muscle groups of his left upper extremity, besides winging of the scapula. Electrodiagnostic studies showed a left brachial plexopathy consistent with multilevel nerve root avulsion sparing the dorsal rami.

Conclusion

This is a report of phantom limb sensations and phantom pain following BPA in an intact but flaccid and insensate limb.

### Use of dynamic ultrasound imaging for assessment of the fibular collateral ligament of the knee [^112gviuz]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

A 25-year-old male college student reported an immediate sharp pain in the lateral aspect of his left knee while playing recreational basketball. He sought a direct-access consultation by a physical therapist. Due to the superficial nature of the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament (FCL), static and dynamic ultrasound imaging was used to visualize the FCL. Complementing the clinical examination findings, use of dynamic imaging strengthened the differential diagnosis of multidirectional laxity and supported the clinical decision of referral. Subsequent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging confirmed tears of the anterior cruciate ligament and FCL.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2019;49(3):210. doi:10.2519/jospt.2019.8460.

### Ulnar nerve entrapment neuropathy at the elbow: simple decompression [^113TU9jU]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Ulnar nerve entrapment neuropathy at the elbow, or the cubital tunnel syndrome, is frequently encountered in neurosurgical practice as the second most common peripheral nerve entrapment after carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients typically present with weakness or atrophy of the hand as well as paresthesias in the ulnar nerve distribution. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a careful clinical examination and electrophysiological studies. Patients who have failed conservative therapy are considered for surgery. Although a number of surgical options are available, simple decompression of the ulnar nerve can achieve satisfactory results with appropriate patient selection. We describe the relevant anatomy and surgical techniques for simple in situ decompression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.

Clinical presentation of ulnar neuropathy

Ulnar neuropathy can result in sensory symptoms only or can cause progressively worsening motor deficit. It usually starts as altered sensation in the ulnar nerve sensory distribution, including the ulnar fourth and entire fifth finger which may progress to involve the motor fibres leading to muscular weakening and muscular atrophy over time. Elbow flexion can result in exaggerated symptoms as the cubital tunnel height and area decrease on flexion with resultant nerve compression. Elbow flexion during sleep can result in night symptoms severe enough to cause awakening. The fibres of the intrinsic muscles of hand are located more peripherally in the nerve while the FCU and FDP fibres are more centrally placed. Chronic severe injury progressively leads to weakening of the FCU and FDP resulting in the typical 'Ulnar claw hand'. When the ulnar nerve is divided at the wrist, only the opponens pollicis, superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis and lateral 2 lumbricals are functioning, all of which are supplied by the median nerve.

### Prevention and treatment of elbow stiffness [^1112E6Y1]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The elbow is as prone to stiffness as it is essential for upper-extremity function. The elbow is a highly constrained synovial hinge joint that frequently becomes stiff after injury. Elbow contracture is challenging to treat, and therefore prevention is of paramount importance. When this approach fails, nonoperative followed by operative treatment modalities can be pursued. In the future, efforts to prevent and treat elbow stiffness may target the basic science mechanisms involved.

Case 2

A 68-year-old right-handed man presented with pain in the medial aspect of the left elbow joint and hand numbness in the distribution of the median and ulnar nerves. The symptoms worsened when the elbow was flexed and internally rotated. The patient had chronic obstructive lung disease. One year prior to admission, he had undergone open reduction and internal fixation using a plate for a fall-induced fracture of the ipsilateral distal radius in another hospital. However, surgical malunion led to secondary osteoarthritis in the wrist joint, causing chronic pain. He underwent arthrodesis at our hospital. Before surgery, the patient complained of worsening sensory abnormalities. Examination revealed tenderness and Tinel's sign in the medial and lateral epicondyles. X-ray imaging showed a supracondylar process located 5 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle (Figure 3). Surgery was performed under general anesthesia. The supracondylar process, which was 15 mm in length and 6 cm above the medial epicondyle, was exposed through a medial approach (Figure 4A). The ligament of Struthers connected the supracondylar process and medial epicondyle, and the median nerve passed under the ligament of Struthers. The ulnar nerve was not affected (Figure 4B). Although the median nerve was compressed by the supracondylar process and ligament of Struthers, there was no structural change. We released the nerve by removing the supracondylar process and ligament of Struthers and performed adhesiolysis to treat the ulnar nerve at the previous surgical site in the wrist joint. The symptoms improved, and the patient showed complete union 1 year after surgery, with the ability to resume normal daily activities. Pathology exam showed the excised tissue was lamellated bone.

A 16-year-old high school baseball pitcher with a 3-week history of acute-onset pain in his medial elbow during throwing presented to physical therapy. Following examination, physical therapy was initiated and the patient was referred for imaging, with suspicion of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury. Radiographs were noncontributory. Ultrasound imaging, however, was performed by a physiatrist and was suggestive of a partial-thickness tear of the UCL and ulnar nerve enlargement. The physiatrist ordered magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed a medial apophyseal stress reaction, a mild UCL sprain, and reactive ulnar nerve edema.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^116Zy2qQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Documentation of the steps taken to reduce the risk of PUN in high-risk patients is important. In one analysis of closed claims of peripheral nerve injury after general anaesthesia, documentation was judged to be missing or erroneous and to be a contributory factor to the claim in 24% of cases. Patient positioning during anaesthesia and surgery is often documented in both medical (i.e. anaesthetic) and nursing (i.e. perioperative care practitioner) records. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, retrospective review of records typically yields incomplete or conflicting information about how patients were positioned and protected during anaesthesia. The anaesthetist carries overall responsibility for the physical safety of patients during anaesthesia, and therefore should satisfy themselves of the overall standards of record keeping kept during anaesthetic care. Minimum suggested intraoperative documentation regarding the prevention of PUN that we consider reasonable is listed in Table 4. In surgical procedures of prolonged duration (> 2 h), local protocols should advise intermittent checks and repositioning of limbs. In the absence of such protocols, clinicians are advised to document the intermittent checks they perform during anaesthesia, acknowledging that surgical draping and the sterile field may reduce access to the patient to perform such inspection. In addition to these measures, prevention of systemic insults to nerve tissue (hypotension, hypoperfusion, etc.) is advisable.

Minimum suggested intraoperative documentation regarding the prevention of postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN).

Clinical presentation

Ulnar neuropathy at the cubital tunnel is characterised by paraesthesia or pain in the fourth and fifth digits or medial forearm. Weakness of flexor digitorum profundus, lumbricals, and intrinsic hand muscles may be present. The diagnostic value of Tinel's sign or flexion compression tests at the elbow is poor. Tinel's sign has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 62%, 53%, 77%, and 30%, respectively; it therefore offers little benefit over routine sensory and motor neurological examination. Atrophy of the ulnar intrinsic hand muscles has been described after surgery. In lesions arising from the cubital tunnel, the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle may be unaffected. The differential diagnosis for paraesthesia in the fourth or fifth digit or hand grip weakness in the postoperative period should always include carpal tunnel syndrome, as this is a known mimic of ulnar neuropathy, also presenting with digital numbness, paraesthesia, and weakness. Carpal tunnel syndrome can usually be differentiated clinically because the compression of the median nerve affects the first to third digits.

### Late reconstruction of ulnar nerve palsy [^117Ew55i]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Ulnar nerve palsy results in significant loss of sensation and profound weakness, leading to a dysfunctional hand. Typical clinical findings include loss of key pinch, clawing, loss of normal flexion sequence of the digits, loss of the metacarpal arch, and abduction of the small finger. Further deficits in hand/wrist function are seen in high-level ulnar nerve palsy, including loss of ring- and small-finger distal interphalangeal flexion, decreased wrist flexion, and loss of dorsal sensory innervation. This article reviews the clinical findings seen in low and high ulnar nerve palsies, and reviews surgical options for correcting certain motor and sensory deficits.

The injury is usually associated with typical soft-tissue disruptions (with common involvement of the lateral collateral ligament complex, elbow joint capsule, as well as the common extensor and flexor-pronator tendons) that are best understood in the context of injury mechanism as well as the role and relevance of the various elbow stabilizers. The goals of this article are to review the pertinent anatomy, mechanism of injury, classification and imaging of terrible triad injuries of the elbow with brief descriptions of treatment, and complications of this complex injury.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the anatomy of the median and ulnar nerves. 2. Perform clinical examination of the upper limb. 3. Analyze examination results to diagnose level of nerve compression.

Summary

Numbness and loss of strength are common complaints in the hand surgery clinic. Two nerves that are commonly entrapped (median and ulnar nerves) have several potential sites of entrapment, and in busy clinical practice, the less common sites may be overlooked, leading to wrong or missed diagnoses. This article reviews the anatomy of the median and ulnar nerves, provides tips to assist the busy clinician in diagnosis of site of entrapment(s), and discusses how to simplify surgery. The goal is to help the clinician be as efficient and accurate as possible when evaluating the patient with numbness or loss of strength in their hand.

Conclusion

Ulnar nerve is the second most common nerve involved in compressive neuropathies of the upper limb. Patients presenting with symptoms of ulnar nerve palsy have been conventionally diagnosed using clinical and electrodiagnostic findings. Use of high-resolution ultrasound and MRI will usher in a new era of multimodality approach in the diagnosis and treatment of nerve pathologies. It allows direct visualisation of the nerve with precise anatomical details and points towards the aetio-pathogenesis of the palsy, facilitating better clinical decision making and patient management. This pictorial essay describes the hallmark of imaging findings in a wide spectrum of ulnar nerve pathologies as diagnosed using imaging modalities.

### Ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist [^115C74AA]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Presentation of ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist varies based on differential anatomy and the site or sites of compression. Therefore, an understanding of the anatomy of the Guyon canal is essential for diagnosis in patients presenting with motor and/or sensory deficits in the hand. The etiologies of ulnar nerve compression include soft-tissue tumors; repetitive or acute trauma; the presence of anomalous muscles and fibrous bands; arthritic, synovial, endocrine, and metabolic conditions; and iatrogenic injury. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, which includes motor, sensory, and vascular assessments, imaging and electrodiagnostic studies facilitate the diagnosis of ulnar nerve lesions at the wrist. Nonsurgical management is appropriate for a distal compression lesion caused by repetitive activity, but surgical decompression is indicated if symptoms persist or worsen over 2 to 4 months.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^111P9ZA9]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The radial nerve is the biggest branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and one of its five terminal branches. Entrapment of the radial nerve at the elbow is the third most common compressive neuropathy of the upper limb after carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes. Because the incidence is relatively low and many agents can compress it along its whole course, entrapment of the radial nerve or its branches can pose a considerable clinical challenge. Several of these agents are related to normal or variant anatomy. The most common of the compressive neuropathies related to the radial nerve is the posterior interosseus nerve syndrome. Appropriate treatment requires familiarity with the anatomical traits influencing the presenting symptoms and the related prognoses. The aim of this study is to describe the compressive neuropathies of the radial nerve, emphasizing the anatomical perspective and highlighting the traps awaiting physicians evaluating these entrapments.

### Peripheral nerve entrapment and injury in the upper extremity [^114XmqUf]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Peripheral nerve injury of the upper extremity commonly occurs in patients who participate in recreational (e.g., sports) and occupational activities. Nerve injury should be considered when a patient experiences pain, weakness, or paresthesias in the absence of a known bone, soft tissue, or vascular injury. The onset of symptoms may be acute or insidious. Nerve injury may mimic other common musculoskeletal disorders. For example, aching lateral elbow pain may be a symptom of lateral epicondylitis or radial tunnel syndrome; patients who have shoulder pain and weakness with overhead elevation may have a rotator cuff tear or a suprascapular nerve injury; and pain in the forearm that worsens with repetitive pronation activities may be from carpal tunnel syndrome or pronator syndrome. Specific history features are important, such as the type of activity that aggravates symptoms and the temporal relation of symptoms to activity (e.g., is there pain in the shoulder and neck every time the patient is hammering a nail, or just when hammering nails overhead?). Plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging are usually not necessary for initial evaluation of a suspected nerve injury. When pain or weakness is refractory to conservative therapy, further evaluation (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electrodiagnostic testing) or surgical referral should be considered. Recovery of nerve function is more likely with a mild injury and a shorter duration of compression. Recovery is faster if the repetitive activities that exacerbate the injury can be decreased or ceased. Initial treatment for many nerve injuries is nonsurgical.

Frequently, patients present with postsurgical nerve dysfunction such as radial nerve palsy after open reduction and internal fixation of humeral fractures, peroneal and/or saphenous nerve palsy after knee ligament reconstruction and/or dislocation, – or ulnar nerve complications after medial or collateral ligament reconstruction of the elbow. – The literature addressing timing in these contexts is highly variable. Generally, symptom severity and duration are thought to be indicators of potential for spontaneous recovery or need for operative intervention. Although the literature lacks consensus recommendations, close monitoring of nerve symptoms is recommended in the early postoperative period (up to 12 weeks).

### Cubital tunnel syndrome [^1153my2c]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common compression neuropathy in the upper extremity. Patients complain of numbness in the ring and small fingers, as well as hand weakness. Advanced disease is complicated by irreversible muscle atrophy and hand contractures. Ulnar nerve decompression can help to alleviate symptoms and prevent more advanced stages of dysfunction. Many surgical treatments exist for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. In situ decompression, transposition of the ulnar nerve into the subcutaneous, intramuscular, or submuscular plane, or medial epicondylectomy have all been shown to be affective in the treatment of this disease process. Comparative studies have shown some short-term advantages to one or another technique, but overall results between the treatments have essentially been equivocal. The choice of surgical treatment is based on multiple factors, and a single surgical approach cannot be applied to all clinical situations. Through careful consideration of the potential sites of nerve compression and the etiologies for these local irritations, the appropriate surgical technique can be selected and a good outcome anticipated in most patients.

### Ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation of the radial nerve for a patient with lateral elbow pain: a case report with a 2-year follow-up [^111yZthZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with lateral elbow pain are often diagnosed with lateral epicondylalgia. Lateral elbow pain is often associated with dysfunction of the wrist extensor muscles; however, in some cases, it can also mimic signs and symptoms of radial nerve dysfunction.

Case Description

In this case report, a 43-year-old man, who was originally referred with a diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia as a result of playing table tennis and who previously responded favorably to manual therapy and exercise, presented to the clinic for treatment. An exacerbation while participating in a table tennis match resulted in a return of his lateral epicondylalgia symptoms, which did not respond favorably to the same interventions used in his prior course of therapy. Further examination revealed sensitization of the radial nerve, which was treated with 2 sessions of ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and 4 weeks of a low-load, concentric/eccentric exercise program for the wrist extensors.

Outcomes

Following this intervention, the patient experienced clinically meaningful improvement in pain intensity (numeric pain-rating scale), function (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation), and related disability (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire). The patient progressively exhibited complete resolution of pain and function, which was maintained at 2 years.

Discussion

This case report demonstrates the outcomes of a patient with lateral elbow pain who did not respond to manual therapy and exercise. Once radial nerve trunk sensitivity was identified and the intervention, consisting of ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation targeting the radial nerve combined with a low-load exercise program, was applied, a full resolution of pain and function occurred rapidly. Future clinical trials should examine the effect of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the management of nerve-related symptoms associated with musculoskeletal pain conditions.

### Evaluation and treatment of failed ulnar nerve release at the elbow [^116ChLAS]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Failure after ulnar nerve decompression at the elbow can be defined as either no change in the patient's symptoms or an initial improvement with recurrence, making the patient history essential in the work-up. Failure may be due to diagnostic, technical, or biologic factors. Technical errors and the development of perineural fibrosis necessitate revision surgery, while nerve damage due to chronic severe compression should be observed. We do not believe any one procedure is superior in the revision setting as long as a complete decompression is achieved with a compression free, stable transposition of the surgeon's choice.

### Bony cubital tunnel syndrome: a case report of heterotopic ossification causing circumferential ulnar nerve encasement at the elbow and review of current management [^1156GPgn]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a rare but known complication of brain and nerve trauma, orthopedic trauma, and burns. Nerve compression due to HO is extremely rare; "bony cubital tunnel syndrome", or compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow due to HO, is an unusual presentation that requires special considerations for treatment.

Case Presentation

We present a 50-year-old man who presented to our hospital after vehicular polytrauma with associated car fire and prolonged extrication. He experienced extensive trauma, with all classically described risks for HO. He developed bony cubital tunnel syndrome, with ulnar neuropathy confirmed on electrodiagnostic studies, and underwent surgical decompression. Surgical decompression revealed circumferential encasement of the ulnar nerve in heterotopic bone, all of which was removed. He demonstrates appropriate recovery of nerve function.

Literature Review

All perineural HO should be excised early to prevent nerve injury, because excision within 4 months of development is linked to improved functional outcomes. Measures to prevent nerve compression by HO are all associated with delayed wound or bone healing and should be considered on an individual basis.

US can effectively evaluate the MCNF from its origin to the distal branches, providing valuable information for patients with neuropathic pain on the medial aspect of the distal arm and forearm (Figures 2 and 3). The patient should be seated in front of the examiner with the arm extended on the bench. The MCNF can be easily identified in the middle third of the arm, where it lies in close proximity to the basilic vein, and can then be traced proximally along the medial aspect of the arm. In the axilla, the nerve initially lies superficially to the axillary artery and the main nerve trunks of the upper extremities before moving deeper, where it typically joins the ulnar nerve and the MCNA to form the medial cord in the retropectoralis minor space.

In the distal third of the arm, the distal branches of the MCNF can be indentified and traced along the dorsal and ventral aspects of the proximal forearm, particularly when using probes with a frequency of 20 MHz or higher. For patients experiencing a snapping sensation at the medial aspect of the elbow, the examination should not be limited to evaluating the structures within the cubital tunnel. Instead, it should also include a dynamic assessment of the posterior branches of the MCNF during active elbow flexion and extension to determine if they contribute to the snapping, alongside the ulnar nerve and the medial head of the triceps.

### Imaging of elbow entrapment neuropathies [^111ctFqD]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

For the US examination of the RN, the transducer is placed transversely on the anterolateral elbow, with the patient seated in front of the examiner with the arm in a neutral position. The examination follows the main trunk of the nerve as it courses adjacent to the bone between the brachioradialis and brachialis muscles until its bifurcation into the superficial sensory branch and the PIN. In normal subjects, the measured diameters of the nerve in this area are 4.0–4.2 mm (latero-lateral) and 2.3–3.5 mm (anteroposterior). Evaluating the PIN is facilitated by positioning the elbow in semiflexion over the examination table with the forearm oriented transversely and sweeping the probe over the supinator during hand extension and pronation; the nerve may appear to follow an angulated course at the arcade of Fröhse. Videos 07–09 show how to scan the RN from the upper arm to the elbow, the PIN (Video 08), and the superficial sensory branch of the RN (Video 09). RN neuropathies occur less frequently than those of the MN and UN because the RN is less commonly involved in entrapment syndromes. However, it is more often damaged by arm trauma, usually secondary to fractures. Predisposing factors for nerve compression include overuse, particularly repetitive supination and pronation motions, high-intensity handgrip force, and prolonged exposure of the arms to vibration, such as from excessive typing (occupational) and playing tennis (recreational).

Conclusion

This study identifies the 50 most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis or "tennis elbow" and includes foundational investigations that have provided knowledge and understanding of the underlying etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. This list may be used to aid in the education of orthopaedic residency and fellowship trainees because it serves as a source for establishing a reading curriculum on lateral epicondylitis. Many of the articles included were randomized controlled trials showing the modern-day emphasis on evidence-based medicine to evaluate outcomes for a condition for which the optimal management remains controversial.

### Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^113Ndzjk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and previously updated in 2012 and 2016.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: - surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; - conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; - it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to July 2022.

Selection Criteria

The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. The primary outcome was clinically relevant improvement in function compared to baseline. The secondary outcomes of interest were change in neurological impairment, change from baseline of the motor nerve conduction velocity across the elbow, change from baseline in the nerve diameter/cross-sectional area at the elbow, evaluated by ultrasound or MRI, change in quality of life and adverse events. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs (970 participants), of which six studies were new for this update. Sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in six studies; other studies had a low risk of selection bias. We evaluated the clinical outcomes (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological outcomes (2 trials, 101 participants) of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition. Moreover, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of endoscopic versus open decompression surgery (2 trials, 99 participants). We found there was probably little to no difference in clinical improvement in function for simple decompression versus subcutaneous transposition (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.14; 1 study, 147 participants) and simple decompression versus submuscular transposition (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17; 2 studies, 114 participants). Compared to simple decompression, we found little to no difference in wound infections for subcutaneous transposition (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.35; 1 study, 147 participants) and submuscular transposition (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.21; 2 studies, 114 participants). We found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in terms of postoperative clinical improvement measured by the Bishop score (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; 2 studies, 99 participants). Among surgical treatments, further single trials investigated postsurgical electrical stimulation after open decompression, nerve decompression and transposition with supercharged end-to-side anterior interosseous nerve-to-ulnar motor nerve transfer. Among conservative treatments for mild or moderate UNE, single trials explored the efficacy of participants' education, night splinting, nerve gliding exercises, corticosteroid and dextrose perineural injection.

Authors' Conclusions

Low- to moderate-certainty evidence indicates that there is little to no difference in terms of improvement in function or surgical complications between simple decompression and decompression with subcutaneous or submuscular transposition in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that there is little to no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function and in terms of procedural complications. Very low-certainty evidence indicates that it is unclear if steroid injections have an effect on clinical improvement, compared to placebo, and if written instructions have an effect on clinical improvement, compared to surgical decompression. Findings from a small RCT on conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort. One RCT showed that dextrose injection might reduce pain at either short-term (four months) or long-term follow-up (12 months), compared to placebo. Another RCT did not show differences in clinically relevant improvement between dextrose and corticosteroid injection. In clinically severe UNE, findings from a small RCT showed that postsurgical electrical stimulation improves intrinsic muscle reinnervation and strength at 12 months' follow-up.

### Common sports-related nerve injuries seen by the electrodiagnostic medical consultant [^111yUKcE]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Clinical presentation

Athletes presenting with UNE classically present with pain in the medial forearm and elbow radiating into the ulnar two fingers with associated numbness and tingling. However, UNE in athletes may present with symptoms of reduced throwing velocity, accuracy, or endurance. Clinical examination should start with a careful inspection of the arm with specific attention toward the patient's carrying angle and potential areas of atrophy. Initial areas of atrophy and weakness are most frequently noticed in the first dorsal interossei (FDI). In addition, a Tinel's sign may be elicited along the length of the nerve starting at the proximal arm and throughout the course through the medial elbow. Lastly, valgus stress test and moving valgus stress test may be able to aid in the diagnosis of UCL injuries increasing the risk of co‐morbid UNE.

4.3 Electrodiagnostic and imaging studies

EDx studies are the gold standard for the diagnosis of UNE. There are currently no detailed studies or protocols regarding sport‐specific UNE. The authors suggest utilizing the current AANEM clinical practice guidelines for assessing UNE in athletes. Due to the risk of falsely negative or non‐localizable EDx studies in UNE, there has been increased interest in alternative diagnostic techniques including MRI and ultrasound. MRI of the ulnar nerve has demonstrated characteristic signs of UNE including nerve thickening, T2 hyperintensity, and neurogenic edema. Most notably, MRI findings of fusiform ulnar nerve thickening with associated hyperintensity are characteristic of UNE.

Ultrasound has become a common adjunct diagnostic modality due to its increasing reliability compared to MRI imaging. There have been more than 30 articles published regarding the reliability and reproducibility of ultrasound evaluation of the ulnar nerve with a sensitivity of 64%–81% and a specificity of 60%–91%. Studies reference an increased diameter or cross‐section area (CSA), with cut‐offs ranging from > 2.5–2.9 mm or > 8–11 mm 2, respectively, with higher diameters and CSAs correlating to higher specificities. In addition, several studies have described swelling ratios of greater than > 2.1 between the ulnar nerve above or below the elbow compared to at its area of maximal swelling through the medial elbow. Dynamic ultrasound is also useful in demonstrating dislocation and/or subluxation of the ulnar nerve at the medial epicondyle, though clinical correlation with symptoms is warranted to determine if this is pathologic.

### Ulnar neuropathy and medial elbow pain in women's fastpitch softball pitchers: a report of 6 cases [^116XJ87S]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Elite-level women's fastpitch softball players place substantial biomechanical strains on the elbow that can result in medial elbow pain and ulnar neuropathic symptoms. There is scant literature reporting the expected outcomes of the treatment of these injuries. This study examined the results of treatment in a series of these patients.

Methods

We identified 6 female softball pitchers (4 high school and 2 collegiate) with medial elbow pain and ulnar neuropathic symptoms. Trials of conservative care failed in all 6, and they underwent surgical treatment with subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition. These patients were subsequently monitored postoperatively to determine outcome.

Results

All 6 female pitchers had early resolution of elbow pain and neuropathic symptoms after surgical treatment. Long-term follow-up demonstrated that 1 patient quit playing softball because of other injuries but no longer reported elbow pain or paresthesias. One player was able to return to pitching at the high school level but had recurrent forearm pain and neuritis 1 year later while playing a different sport and subsequently stopped playing competitive sports. Four patients continued to play at the collegiate level without further symptoms.

Conclusions

Medial elbow pain in women's softball pitchers caused by ulnar neuropathy can be treated effectively with subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition if nonsurgical options fail. Further study is necessary to examine the role of overuse, proper training techniques, and whether pitching limits may be necessary to avoid these injuries.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^113aaoDh]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — osteoarthritis and prior musculoskeletal disorders: One theory for how osteoarthritis (OA) may predispose people to CTS is that hypertrophy of carpal bones narrows the tunnel and thereby produces compression of the median nerve, while the reason for previous musculoskeletal disorders leading to CTS is less clear. Werner et al suggests (1) that individuals with pain in other parts of the upper extremity may develop compensatory strategies that place higher loads and awkward positioning of the hand and wrist or (2) because CTS can refer pain to the elbow or shoulder, patients with CTS may be misdiagnosed as having various tendinopathies.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^111UFtaF]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Elbow disorders epidemiology and burden note that musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) constitute 65% of all occupational illnesses in the United States, and in 2011 MSDs accounted for 33% of all workplace injuries requiring time away from work, with a total of 387,820 MSDs requiring a median of 11 days away from work, 3 more than the median of 8 days for all day-away-from-work cases. Upper extremity MSDs, including elbow disorders, now account for at least 4% of all US state workers' compensation claims, an increase from the 1% seen a decade ago, and in 1998 the state of Washington reported that elbow disorders accounted for the third highest incidence claims rate, with 29.7 injuries per 10,000 full-time employees. Lateral epicondylalgia affects approximately 1% to 3% of the population and is the most commonly diagnosed condition of the elbow, those between the ages of 35 and 50 years are at high risk, and one study found that in 16.2% of the general population the ulnar nerve slipped out of its olecranon groove when the elbow was flexed.

### Zolmitriptan (Zomig) [^11512LUb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Zolmitriptan binds with high affinity to human recombinant 5-HT1Dand 5‑HT1Breceptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT1Areceptors. The N-desmethyl metabolite also has high affinity for 5‑HT1B/1Dand moderate affinity for 5‑HT1Areceptors.

Migraines are likely due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides (vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of ZOMIG for the treatment of migraine headache is thought to be due to the agonist effects at the 5‑HT1B/1Dreceptors on intracranial blood vessels (including the arterio-venous anastomoses) and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion

Absorption

Zolmitriptan is well absorbed after oral administration for both ZOMIG tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan displays linear kinetics over the dose range of 2.5 to 50 mg.

The AUC and Cmaxof zolmitriptan are similar following administration of ZOMIG tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, but the Tmaxis somewhat later with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, with a median Tmaxof 3 hours for zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets compared with 1.5 hours for the ZOMIG tablet. The AUC, Cmax, and Tmaxfor the active N‑desmethyl metabolite are similar for the two formulations.

During a moderate to severe migraine attack, mean AUC0–4and Cmaxfor zolmitriptan, dosed as a ZOMIG tablet, were decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively, and mean Tmaxwas delayed by one‑half hour compared to the same patients during a migraine free period.

Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of zolmitriptan. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing.

Distribution

Mean absolute bioavailability is approximately 40%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is 7.0 L/kg. Plasma protein binding of zolmitriptan is 25% over the concentration range of 10–1000 ng/mL.

### CORR insights: what injury mechanism and patterns of ligament status are associated with isolated coronoid, isolated radial head, and combined fractures? [^114zLJ6t]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Where Do We Need To Go?

The biggest challenge for the treating surgeon, who may not be a specialist, is recognizing these complex injuries at an early stage so that appropriate imaging is carried out. A fall onto the outstretched arm resulting in an elbow injury with immediate pain and/or swelling calls for a careful elbow assessment and good initial imaging. Having identified the injuries and confirmed the mechanism of injury, we are still faced with determining which of these injuries would benefit from open surgical repair and which can be treated without surgery.

Some recommend early — almost immediate — ROM, after surgery. In order to achieve this, a strong and durable collateral ligament reconstruction is called for, with devices that can be well-fixed and can handle load at the end of the operation. Although both autograft and allograft tendons are currently used extensively for collateral ligament repair, providing a well-fixed tendon is rarely achievable because the fixation is not sufficiently stable to allow immediate unprotected movement.

The concept of using artificial devices as scaffolds, however, is starting to emerge. A recent study of explanted polyester devices by Kocsis and colleagues has shown both in-growth and on-growth of fibrous tissue leading to a device that is encased by natural tissue and becomes a biological structure during the months and years after its insertion. This concept may also be applicable to the collateral ligaments of the elbow.

### A case of extensive fracture bullae: a multidisciplinary approach for acute management [^114Baujx]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

An 87-year-old man with hypertension and atrial fibrillation managed with apixiban presented to the emergency room with left upper extremity pain and swelling after a mechanical fall. On physical examination, a midshaft deformity of the left humerus was noted along with moderate swelling and ecchymosis at the level of the injury. Neurovascular examination found decreased sensation in the radial nerve distribution along with inability to actively extend the wrist and digits of the injured extremity. Initial plain radiographs depicted a spiral fracture of the distal third of the humerus (Fig 1), consistent with a Holstein-Lewis fracture pattern. Acute management consisted of fracture immobilization with application of a coaptation splint and admission for observation.

Approximately 48 hours after injury, numerous tense hemorrhagic and serous bullae with superficial erosions developed. These varied bullae were present with ecchymoses directly overlying the fracture site, along with extension distally over the elbow and to the forearm (Fig 2). Wound cultures obtained from the bullae showed no growth of bacteria or fungus. The tense bullae were cleansed with isopropyl alcohol and drained with a 25-gauge needle to prevent traumatic rupture and erosion. These bullae were then covered with Xeroform petroleum gauze and dry gauze dressings. The extremity was again immobilized, and the upper extremity elevated to reduce swelling. Improvement of the affected dermis was noted within 72 hours without new bullae formation.

After discussion of treatment options, the patient opted for surgical management of his left humeral shaft fracture. Five days after sustaining the fracture, he underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the left humerus with exploration and neurolysis of the radial nerve. A modified posterior approach as described by Gerwin et alwas used. There were no perioperative complications, and the patient was discharged home uneventfully on postoperative day 2 with a dry gauze dressing over the incision. At most recent follow-up, 1 year postoperatively, there are no reported wound complications with return of radial nerve function and no gross scarring.

### Management of ulnar nerve injuries [^115489d6]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Injuries to the ulnar nerve result in both sensory and motor deficits within the hand. Functional outcomes following repair of this nerve have not performed as well as outcomes following repair of the median or radial nerves. Advances in imaging modalities may provide earlier means of identifying and diagnosing closed nerve injuries. Early neurorrhaphy of acute nerve injuries provides the best outcome, but consideration should also be given to performing distal motor nerve transfers to preserve hand intrinsic motor function when injuries occur at or above the proximal forearm. This article attempts to summarize the most recent trends within ulnar nerve repair.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^112tVAeg]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Because many of the aforementioned factors are elicited as part of preoperative anaesthetic assessment, anaesthetists are in an excellent position to undertake a patient-specific consent discussion, disclosing the likely risk of PUN and the steps taken perioperatively to mitigate risk (see section below 'Prevention').

Mechanism of injury

Mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of ulnar neuropathy can be derived from patients who do and do not undergo surgery. Compression neuropathy of the ulnar nerve at the elbow was first systematically described by Sir William Gowersin his 1886 book A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System. Causes of non-surgical entrapment at the elbow include anatomical abnormalities, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, medial epicondylitis, diabetes mellitus, trauma, and habitual leaning on the elbow arising from occupations. In a number of cases, no single cause is found to explain the neuropathy, and such cases are usually described as idiopathic. As a specific phenomenon, postoperative ulnar nerve injury has been ascribed to direct nerve trauma before or during upper-limb surgery (e.g. supracondylar humeral fracture, or implantable contraceptive device removal); trauma from peripheral nerve block; nerve infarction during transposition surgery; and, finally, arising from injudicious patient positioning under anaesthetic. Complete section of the ulnar nerve is unlikely to arise solely from anaesthetic care. In one analysis of iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries presenting to a single neurosurgical service over a 10 yr period, direct intraoperative damage incurred by inadvertent surgical trauma to the ulnar nerve during surgery for supracondylar humeral fracture was the most frequent mechanism of iatrogenic intraoperative ulnar injury. Unlike PUN, in 85% of such cases, total ulnar nerve discontinuity was demonstrated.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^117EvduQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Stretch of the ulnar nerve is brought about by prolonged flexion of the elbow beyond 90° — a commonly observed phenomenon in awake or drowsy individuals, where relief from paraesthesia is brought about by elbow extension. Inappropriate stretch may occur in both prone and supine patient positions, as dictated by the needs of surgery. Hypermobility of the ulnar nerve manifests as partial or complete dislocation of the nerve outside the cubital groove; it is present in approximately 20% of patients, and may increase risk of injury by worsening compressive forces when the nerve dislocates.

Compression of the ulnar nerve commonly occurs at the cubital tunnel. The cubital tunnel transmits the ulnar nerve into the forearm; it is a fibro-osseous space at the posteromedial aspect of the elbow. The tunnel is bordered medially by the medial epicondyle of the humerus and laterally by the olecranon of the ulna. The floor is formed by the elbow joint capsule and the medial collateral ligament of the elbow. The roof is formed by the cubital tunnel retinaculum (the arcuate ligament of Osborne) — a 4-mm-wide band of fascia running from medial epicondyle to olecranon between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris. The retinaculum functions to hold the ulnar nerve in position behind the medial epicondyle. This retinaculum is sometimes supplemented by the atavistic anconeus epitrochlearis muscle, an anatomical variant present in approximately a third of individuals. During elbow flexion, the tunnel changes from oval to elliptical shape in cross section. At full elbow extension, the retinaculum is lax, whereas in elbow flexion to 90° the retinaculum becomes taut and reduces the capacity of the tunnel. A study performed in 27 cadaveric specimens revealed four anatomical retinacula subtypes: Type 0, absent retinaculum (4%); Type 1a, present retinaculum taut in full flexion (63%); Type 1b, present retinaculum taut in less-than-full flexion (22%); and Type 2, absent retinaculum replaced by the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle (11%). The authors postulated that these anatomical variations may explain why certain individuals develop ulnar neuropathy, whereas others do not. Type 0 retinaculum (i.e. absent) allows medial ulnar nerve displacement to the tip of the medial epicondyle and exposing it to external compression; Type 1b may predispose to dynamic compression with only moderate degrees of elbow flexion, and Type 2 may lead to compression attributable to the bulk of the anconeus muscle. Although the authors were able to correlate retinaculum variants with cadaveric evidence of chronic ulnar compression, whether these variants are neatly associated with in vivo clinical presentations of ulnar neuropathy remains unknown. Within the cubital tunnel, the sensory fibres of the ulnar nerve are typically more superficial than motor components, and it is theorised that sensory components are therefore more vulnerable to external compression.

### Elbow pain… [^113sWYd8]. Wikipedia (2021). Medium credibility.

Elbow pain generally refers to discomfort in the joint between the upper arm and forearm. Elbow pain is a common complaint in both the emergency department and in primary care offices. The CDC estimated that 1. 15 million people visited an emergency room for elbow or forearm-related injuries in
2020. There are many possible causes of elbow discomfort but the most common are trauma, infection, and inflammation. Pain may be acute, chronic or associated with a number of other symptoms. Treatments range from conservative measures, such as ice and rest, to surgical interventions, depending on the underlying cause and severity. Causes Elbow pain can result from a number of conditions. On a cellular level the pain, aka nociception, is conveyed through nerves in the elbow.

Theses nerve cells, aka neurons, are activated and or compressed due to local tissue damage and swelling, which ultimately leads to pain and possibly numbness. Trauma is a common cause of this local tissue damage. Traumatic events such as car accidents, falls, or assaults to this area can result in fractures and dislocations of the bones surrounding the elbow. In children, there is a specific type of dislocation called a pulled elbow or subluxation seen when an extended elbow is pulled with force. Frequently, these traumas can cause obvious deformities visible to the naked eye, but other times more advanced imaging is required to evaluate the extent of the damage. When pain is not associated with a specific incident a more general type of inflammation may be involved. This broad category is best thought of in terms of how long pain symptoms have been present.

If pain is acute or subacute, there is a greater concern for over-use injuries or infection. Repetitive strain injury is defined as inflammation of tendons from forceful, repetitive motions. This is common with jobs that require manual labor, and with sports and other recreational activities. Based on the mechanics of the repetitive motion, pain will be located in different locations on the elbow. Pain on the inside of the elbow is known as golfer's elbow, while pain on the outside is known as tennis elbow. There are multiple types of infections that can result in elbow pain. A frequent presentation is known as arthralgias or body aches. This is a generalized joint pain that can be a non-specific symptom associate with almost any minor viral or bacterial illness. It is also possible to have a local skin and soft tissue infection, known as cellulitis, in the structures that overly the elbow resulting in pain.

When the infection affects deeper structures such as the joint or bursa, then a more serious diagnosis of bursitis or septic arthritis is made. Finally, reactive arthritis is a joint pain resulting from of an overactive immune response in the days to weeks following a bacterial infection. When pain is more chronic, there is a higher concern for arthritic and autoimmune conditions. Both are more common in middle-aged to older adults. Osteoarthritis is caused by normal wear-and-tear of the joints and worsened by extreme forces or injury, whereas autoimmune conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, are caused by the body's own defenses attacking joint tissues. Autoimmune conditions typically have other associated symptoms like rash, weight-loss, fatigue, swelling, and low-grade fever. Furthermore, autoimmune pain is typically described as morning stiffness whereas osteoarthritic pain is usually described as end-of-day soreness.

### Elbow [^114jCxhi]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Extension is limited by the olecranon reaching the olecranon fossa, tension in the anterior ligament, and resistance in flexor muscles. Forced extension results in a rupture in one of the limiting structures: olecranon fracture, torn capsule and ligaments, and, though the muscles are normally left unaffected, a bruised brachial artery. The blood is brought back by vessels from the radial, ulnar, and brachial veins. There are two sets of lymphatic nodes at the elbow, normally located above the medial epicondyle — the deep and superficial cubital nodes. The lymphatic drainage at the elbow is through the deep nodes at the bifurcation of the brachial artery, the superficial nodes drain the forearm and the ulnar side of the hand. The efferent lymph vessels from the elbow proceed to the lateral group of axillary lymph nodes.

Nerve supply The elbow is innervated anteriorly by branches from the musculocutaneous, median, and radial nerve, and posteriorly from the ulnar nerve and the branch of the radial nerve to anconeus. Pathology The types of disease most commonly seen at the elbow are due to injury. Tendonitis Two of the most common injuries at the elbow are overuse injuries: tennis elbow and golfer's elbow. Golfer's elbow involves the tendon of the common flexor origin which originates at the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Tennis elbow is the equivalent injury, but at the common extensor origin. Fractures There are three bones at the elbow joint, and any combination of these bones may be involved in a fracture of the elbow. Patients who are able to fully extend their arm at the elbow are unlikely to have a fracture and an X-ray is not required as long as an olecranon fracture is ruled out.

Acute fractures may not be easily visible on X-ray. Dislocation Elbow dislocations constitute 10% to 25% of all injuries to the elbow. The elbow is one of the most commonly dislocated joints in the body, with an average annual incidence of acute dislocation of 6 per 100, 000 persons. Among injuries to the upper extremity, dislocation of the elbow is second only to a dislocated shoulder. A full dislocation of the elbow will require expert medical attention to re-align, and recovery can take approximately 6 weeks. Infection Infection of the elbow joint is uncommon. It may occur spontaneously, but may also occur in relation to surgery or infection elsewhere in the body. Arthritis Elbow arthritis is usually seen in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis or after fractures that involve the joint itself. When the damage to the joint is severe, fascial arthroplasty or elbow joint replacement may be considered.

Bursitis Olecranon bursitis, tenderness, warmth, swelling, pain in both flexion and extension-in chronic case great flexion-is extremely painful. Elbow pain Elbow pain occurs when the tenderness of the tissues in the elbow become inflamed. Frequent exercise of the inflamed elbow will assist with healing. Clinical significance Elbow pain can occur for a multitude of reasons, including injury, disease, and other conditions. Common conditions include tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, distal radioulnar joint rheumatoid arthritis, and cubital tunnel syndrome. Tennis elbow Tennis elbow is a very common type of overuse injury. It can occur both from chronic repetitive motions of the hand and forearm, and from trauma to the same areas. These repetitions can injure the tendons that connect the extensor supinator muscles to the olecranon process. Pain occurs, often radiating from the lateral forearm.

### Heart rate… [^114NerhM]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Heart rate is the frequency of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute. The heart rate varies according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide. It is also modulated by numerous factors, including genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness, as well as the interaction between these factors. It is usually equal or close to the pulse rate measured at any peripheral point. The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60–100 bpm. An ultra-trained athlete would have a resting heart rate of 37–38 bpm. Tachycardia is a high heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a low heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. When a human sleeps, a heartbeat with rates around 40–50 bpm is common and considered normal.

When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an arrhythmia. Abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease. There are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down. Most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain, some of which are those that are 'forced'/'enticed' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs such as cocaine or atropine. This section discusses target heart rates for healthy persons, which would be inappropriately high for most persons with coronary artery disease. This is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one's foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.

There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR. The opposite is also true. The limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable.

Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one's eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR. Resting heart rate is often correlated with mortality. In the Copenhagen City Heart Study a heart rate of 65 bpm rather than 80 bpm was associated with 4. 6 years longer life expectancy in men and
3. 6 years in women. Other studies have shown all-cause mortality is increased by 1. 22 when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute. ECG of 46, 129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting heart rates ranging from 48 to 98 beats per minute. The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission heart rate was greater than 90 beats per minute. For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting heart rate between 33 and 50 bpm.
