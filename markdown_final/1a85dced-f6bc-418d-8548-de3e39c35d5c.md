## Question

Eplerenone for giant cell myocarditis cure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether eplerenone can cure giant cell myocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what eplerenone is actually indicated for and how it works. Then, I should verify the natural history and standard-of-care therapy for giant cell myocarditis. Next, I will check whether any guideline or clinical evidence supports eplerenone for GCM directly. After that, I will consider indirect and mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I should distinguish supportive heart failure therapy from disease-modifying treatment and conclude with a clear clinical recommendation consistent with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm eplerenone's role. Eplerenone is a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist approved for hypertension and for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, typically dosed 25–50 mg daily, with important cautions in renal dysfunction and with CYP3A inhibitors; there is no approved or guideline-listed indication for giant cell myocarditis, which I need to explicitly state to avoid conflating HF management with etiologic therapy [^115jMitk] [^116Aj8o3] [^115DFqUF] [^114QSeX9] [^116UJAN3] [^1153muWD].

> Next, I should review what giant cell myocarditis is and how it behaves clinically. GCM is a rare, frequently fulminant, T-lymphocyte–mediated autoimmune myocarditis with rapid progression to heart failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and heart block, and without aggressive therapy the 5‑year transplant‑free survival is extremely poor, often in the 10–30% range, underscoring the need for disease‑modifying immunosuppression rather than standard HF monotherapy [^113j5aQ2] [^111RnU66] [^1167oSSr] [^114hsciV].

> Hold on, I should verify the standard of care. Guidelines and contemporary series consistently recommend early combined immunosuppression targeting T‑cell–mediated injury, typically a calcineurin inhibitor plus high‑dose corticosteroids with or without adjuncts such as azathioprine, antithymocyte globulin, or other agents; mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation are often required in unstable patients despite medical therapy [^1169MSnX] [^111RnU66] [^114dLCqz] [^117MyEWG] [^115a5Ezo] [^11739xtB] [^1173z3jo].

> Now, I need to check whether eplerenone is recommended or studied for GCM itself. Wait, let me verify this carefully across guidelines and the cited literature; there are no ESC or AHA documents recommending eplerenone for treating the autoimmune process in GCM, and I do not see any clinical trials or case series demonstrating eplerenone as a disease‑modifying therapy for GCM, which strongly argues against any curative role [^1169MSnX] [^111RnU66].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall an eplerenone study in myocarditis — let me double‑check the etiology. That signal comes from a mouse encephalomyocarditis viral myocarditis model where eplerenone reduced fibrosis and improved survival; but that is an animal viral model, not human autoimmune GCM, so extrapolation would be inappropriate and mechanistically off‑target for T‑cell–driven necrotizing myocarditis [^1169MSnX].

> I should confirm the mechanistic fit. Eplerenone blocks aldosterone signaling, offering anti‑fibrotic and anti‑remodeling benefits in HFrEF, but it does not suppress T‑cell activation, cytokine cascades, or multinucleated giant cell formation that define GCM pathobiology; GCM requires immunosuppression directed at adaptive immunity, which mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism does not provide [^115PiFsf] [^113S79Q8].

> Let me distinguish supportive from disease‑modifying therapy. Using eplerenone in a GCM patient can be reasonable as part of guideline‑directed therapy for secondary HFrEF to reduce remodeling and HF events, but that is supportive care; it will not halt the underlying autoimmune myocardial destruction, which is why outcomes hinge on immunosuppression, hemodynamic support, and timely consideration of transplantation rather than MRAs alone [^1153muWD] [^1169MSnX] [^111RnU66] [^1167oSSr].

> But wait, what if someone meant "cure" loosely as durable control — could eplerenone contribute to remission maintenance. I should double‑check recurrence data; GCM can relapse even years later and can recur after transplantation, especially with withdrawal or attenuation of immunosuppression, which emphasizes that control depends on adequate immunosuppression rather than on adjunctive HF drugs like eplerenone [^115JsEc6] [^115BYG3i] [^115a5Ezo].

> I need to ensure safe use if eplerenone is chosen for HF management in GCM. I should confirm renal function and potassium, avoid potent CYP3A inhibitors, and follow HF dosing adjustments in CKD to mitigate hyperkalemia risk, because these safety constraints apply regardless of the myocarditis etiology [^115jMitk] [^114QSeX9] [^116UJAN3] [^1153muWD].

> Synthesis and clinical answer: I should be explicit. No, eplerenone does not cure giant cell myocarditis; it has no disease‑modifying role against the T‑cell–mediated process, is not guideline‑recommended for that purpose, and lacks clinical evidence in GCM, though it may be used as supportive therapy for concomitant HFrEF as tolerated while the patient receives prompt, guideline‑directed immunosuppression and consideration of mechanical support or transplantation when indicated [^1169MSnX] [^111RnU66] [^114dLCqz] [^1153muWD].

Eplerenone does not cure giant cell myocarditis (GCM). It is a selective aldosterone antagonist used for heart failure and hypertension [^115jMitk], not for GCM, and there is **no evidence** that it alters the autoimmune inflammation or prevents progression in GCM [^111NQuCa] [^113j5aQ2]. GCM requires **immunosuppression** (corticosteroids plus calcineurin inhibitors) [^111RnU66] and often transplantation [^1143C3HR] [^117MyEWG]; eplerenone may be used for standard heart failure management but is not curative [^1153muWD].

---

## Pathophysiology of giant cell myocarditis

GCM is a rare, rapidly progressive autoimmune myocarditis with multinucleated giant cells, myocyte necrosis, and severe inflammation [^111NQuCa]. It often presents with acute heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities [^113Wj2ur], and carries a **poor prognosis** without aggressive immunosuppression or transplantation [^113S79Q8] [^111RnU66].

---

## Current standard of care for GCM

The cornerstone of GCM management is **immunosuppressive therapy**, typically high-dose corticosteroids plus calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) [^1143C3HR] [^1169MSnX]. This approach improves survival and reduces the need for transplantation [^115a5Ezo] [^11739xtB]. In refractory or advanced cases, mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation are often required [^111RnU66] [^1173z3jo].

---

## Eplerenone: pharmacological profile and clinical indications

Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist **approved for hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** [^115jMitk]. It **reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in HFrEF**, particularly post-myocardial infarction [^1153muWD] [^115jMitk]. These benefits are attributed to **anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory** effects via aldosterone blockade.

---

## Evidence for eplerenone in myocarditis

Limited preclinical data suggest eplerenone may reduce inflammation and fibrosis in viral myocarditis models, improving survival and cardiac function [^113j5aQ2]. However, these findings are **not directly applicable to GCM**, which has a distinct autoimmune pathogenesis [^115PiFsf].

---

## Clinical evidence for eplerenone in GCM

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting eplerenone as a curative therapy for GCM [^111NQuCa]. No clinical trials or case reports show that eplerenone alone or in combination with immunosuppression induces remission or cure [^1143C3HR]. Current guidelines **do not recommend eplerenone** as primary therapy for GCM [^111RnU66] [^1169MSnX].

---

## Potential role of eplerenone in GCM management

While not curative, eplerenone may be considered as adjunctive therapy for standard heart failure management in GCM with reduced ejection fraction [^1153muWD]. Its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties could theoretically provide supportive benefits, but there is **no evidence** supporting its use as a primary or curative therapy [^111NQuCa].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Eplerenone is generally well-tolerated but can cause **hyperkalemia**, renal impairment, and hypotension [^115jMitk]. It is **contraindicated** in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^116UJAN3], hyperkalemia, or concomitant use of potent CYP3A inhibitors [^114QSeX9]. Regular monitoring of **serum potassium** and **renal function** is essential.

---

## Comparison with other immunosuppressive therapies

Immunosuppressive therapies, particularly corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, are the **mainstay of GCM treatment** [^111RnU66] and improve survival and reduce transplantation rates [^1143C3HR] [^115a5Ezo]. By contrast, eplerenone lacks evidence as a primary or curative therapy for GCM.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend eplerenone** as a primary or curative therapy for GCM [^1169MSnX]. The recommended treatment approach remains aggressive immunosuppression [^111RnU66] and, when necessary, mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation [^1143C3HR] [^117MyEWG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Eplerenone is **not a curative therapy** for GCM. It may be used as adjunctive therapy for standard heart failure management, but there is **no evidence** supporting its use as a primary or curative treatment. The mainstay of GCM treatment remains **aggressive immunosuppression** and, when necessary, mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation.

### Anti-inflammatory effects of eplerenone on viral myocarditis [^113j5aQ2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Inflammation contributes to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The aim of this study was to investigate whether eplerenone, a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, has anti-inflammatory effects on viral myocarditis.

- **Methods and results**: Four-week-old inbred male DBA/2 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Mice were fed with standard chow (control) or with chow containing 2.5 mg/kg of eplerenone, starting either on day 0 (inoculation) or day 7. Survival at 28 days was significantly higher in the mice which started eplerenone treatment on day 0 (35% vs. 15% in controls, each n = 40, P < 0.05). The area of myocardial fibrosis on day 28 was significantly smaller in the eplerenone-treated mice than in controls (19.8 ± 2.6%, n = 14, vs. 33.4 ± 5.4%, n = 6, mean ± SEM, P < 0.05). Gene expression of mouse mast cell proteases-4 and -5, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and type I procollagen on day 6 after EMC virus inoculation was significantly decreased in the hearts of eplerenone-treated mice.

These results suggest that eplerenone has anti-inflammatory effects and exerts its beneficial effects on viral myocarditis by suppression of genes related to mast cells and cardiac remodeling in the hearts of mice.

### Improved diagnosis of idiopathic giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis by myocardial gene expression profiling [^113Ut6fG]. European Heart Journal (2014).

- **Aims**: Improvement of clinical diagnostics of idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (IGCM) and cardiac sarcoidosis (CS), two frequently fatal human myocardial diseases. Currently, IGCM and CS are diagnosed based on differential patterns of inflammatory cell infiltration and non-caseating granulomas in histological sections of endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) after heart explantation or postmortem. We report on a method for improved differential diagnosis by myocardial gene expression profiling in EMBs.

- **Methods and results**: We examined gene expression profiles in EMBs from 10 patients with histopathologically proven IGCM, 10 with CS, 18 with active myocarditis (MCA), and 80 inflammation-free control subjects by quantitative RT-QPCR. We identified distinct differential profiles that allowed a clear discrimination of tissues harboring giant cells (IGCS, CS) from those with MCA or inflammation-free controls. The expression levels of genes coding for cytokines or chemokines (CCL20, IFNB1, IL6, IL17D; P < 0.05), cellular receptors (ADIPOR2, CCR5, CCR6, TLR4, TLR8; P < 0.05), and proteins involved in the mitochondrial energy metabolism (CPT1, CYB, DHODH; P < 0.05) were deregulated in 2- to 300-fold, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses and correlation of the gene expression data with immunohistochemical findings provided novel information regarding the differential cellular and molecular pathomechanisms in IGCM, CS, and MCA.

- **Conclusion**: Myocardial gene expression profiling is a reliable method to predict the presence of multinuclear giant cells in the myocardium.

### Giant-cell myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and orthotopic heart transplantation [^114t65UE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Described herein are two patients diagnosed clinically with "giant cell myocarditis". Both patients had short clinical courses, approximately two months, before undergoing lifesaving orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Examination of the hearts disclosed multiple widespread yellow lesions in the ventricular walls. The short clinical courses in these patients are quite different from cardiac sarcoidosis, which typically has courses lasting years. In contrast to cardiac sarcoidosis, the ventricular myocardial lesions were yellow in color, not white as in cardiac sarcoidosis. In conclusion, we consider giant-cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis to be different conditions and not simply different stages of the same condition.

### Pathophysiological gaps, diagnostic challenges, and uncertainties in cardiac sarcoidosis [^11249Na4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Is the cardiac non-caseating granulomatous inflammation a unique feature of cardiac sarcoidosis? The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) in histopathology is defined by "myocarditis with non‐necrotizing granulomas with macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, surrounded by fibrosis and a lymphocytic infiltrate". Although not completely understood, the initiation of the inflammatory process appears to be a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. The understanding of the pathophysiologic pathway of cardiac granuloma formation is depicted in Figure 3.

- **Proposed Concept of Granuloma Formation in Sarcoidosis**:
	1. Presentation of an unknown antigen by dendritic cells and macrophages to lymphocytes.
	2. Recruitment of naive T cells and conversion to T helper 1 cells followed by lymphocytic infiltration and accumulation of dendritic cells and macrophages caused by cytokines, such as interleukin (IL‐2) and interferon‐γ.
	3. M1 macrophages transform into epithelioid cells, which then fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. Granuloma formation involves activated M1 macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, CD4+ helper T cells, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.
	4. Transition from Th1 to Th2 predominance leads to the induction of M2 macrophages, which potentially produce cytokine signals that stimulate fibrosis.

The clinical presentation of CS can mimic various cardiomyopathies such as amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

### Manifestations and outcome of cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis by 25-year nationwide cohorts [^111zSzW5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The major strength of our work resides in the study population. We included cases of CS and GCM diagnosed clinically over 25 years in our country and completed the study groups with cases diagnosed at autopsy and identified from the cause-of-death registry. The study population was considerably large, given the rarity of the diseases, and was composed exclusively of White northern Europeans. Although this is a strength of our comparative analyses, it may limit the generalizability of our data, as the susceptibility and manifestations of CS and GCM may vary by the ethnicity of the population under study.

All diagnoses of GCM were based on myocardial histology, as were two-thirds of the CS diagnoses. In the remaining third of CS cases, histology of sarcoidosis was confirmed from extracardiac biopsies in conformity with the recommendations. Importantly, each GCM diagnosis was based on a reanalysis of all available myocardial specimens from lifetime biopsies, explanted native hearts, or autopsies. It should be recognized, however, that our comparative data are specific to the criteria used to distinguish GCM from CS on myocardial microscopy. Our diagnostic criteria differed from the ones used by Okura et al., as here the presence of myocardial granulomas categorically excluded the diagnosis of GCM. In the work of Okura et al, all diagnoses were based on myocardial histology, and the proportion of postmortem and post-transplant case inclusions was higher than in our study. This may have resulted in more severe average disease phenotypes.

### Manifestations and outcome of cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis by 25-year nationwide cohorts [^113S79Q8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The prevailing view among today's researchers and clinicians is that cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) constitute different disease entities. Yet they have remarkably much in common. Although the details of their cause and pathogenesis are unknown, T lymphocyte–mediated inflammatory injury appears crucial in both, and the association with thymomas described in GCM holds for sarcoidosis as well. The prevalence of concomitant autoimmune diseases, known to be high in GCM, was equal in both conditions in our study, which is the first comparing CS and GCM in this respect.

- **Gender association**: The preponderance of women was also similar, whereas the GCM case series was on average a few years older. Both the study of Okura et al. and our work show that the end‐to‐end spectrum of cardiac manifestations is similar in CS and GCM. However, heart failure with rapid clinical deterioration is more prevalent in GCM, while atrioventricular block and a slow disease course characterize CS.

Still, it is well known that CS, too, can cause an acute and fulminant myocarditis, and a protracted clinical course, in turn, is possible in GCM. It is also undeniable that patients with confirmed systemic sarcoidosis can harbor GCM in their hearts. In the seminal report by Davies et al. of idiopathic GCM, one of 11 patients had sarcoidosis in the lungs, liver, and spleen, and in the study by Davidoff et al, four of 10 patients with GCM had extracardiac sarcoidosis. More recently, Nakasuka et al. described a patient with GCM who had been diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis only.

### Current state of knowledge on aetiology, diagnosis, management, and therapy of myocarditis: A position statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases [^115MgFVw]. European Heart Journal (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for myocarditis, specifically concerning endomyocardial biopsy, the ESC 2013 guidelines recommend taking at least three myocardial samples (from the right or left ventricle), each 1–2 mm in size, and fixing them immediately in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for light microscopy. Additional samples should be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C or stored in RNAlater tubes at room temperature for viral PCR testing.

### Incidence, risk factors, and outcome of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in giant cell myocarditis [^113Wj2ur]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are characteristic of giant cell myocarditis, but their true incidence, predictors, and outcome are unknown.

- **Methods and results**: Our work involved 51 patients with giant cell myocarditis (35 women) aged 52 ± 12 years. We reviewed their medical records for history, results of laboratory and imaging studies, and occurrence of serious cardiac events, including life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death (fatal or aborted) was the primary endpoint of our analyses, whereas the composite of sudden cardiac death and ventricular tachycardia requiring treatment constituted the secondary endpoint. Giant cell myocarditis presented as nonfatal ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 10 patients and as a fatal cardiac arrest in 1 patient. Overall, 14 of 50 patients suffered a sudden cardiac death during follow-up, with a cumulative incidence of 22% at 1 year and 26% at 5 years from presentation. The composite incidence of sudden cardiac death or ventricular tachycardia was 41% at 1 year and 55% at 5 years. The incidence of arrhythmias was associated with high plasma concentrations of troponin-T and N-terminal brain natriuretic propeptide, as well as with moderate-to-severe fibrosis on myocardial biopsy and history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias at presentation (P < 0.05 for all). An intracardiac cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in 31 patients, of whom 17 had altogether 114 appropriate antiarrhythmic therapies by the device and none suffered an arrhythmic death.

### Manifestations and outcome of cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis by 25-year nationwide cohorts [^116cgSfm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Earlier studies comparing CS and GCM**: Before our work, three original studies had compared selected aspects of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) and giant cell myocarditis (GCM). In a retrospective autopsy study, Litovsky et al. analyzed myocardial histopathology in eight hearts with GCM and seven hearts with CS. Both conditions were characterized by histiocytic giant cells, the main discriminator being the absence of myocardial granulomas in GCM and necrosis in CS. Eosinophils were frequent in GCM but rare in CS.

In another study, Okura et al, on behalf of the Multicenter Giant Cell Myocarditis Study Group, compared cardiac histopathology and clinical features in 73 cases of GCM and 42 cases of CS collected from nearly 50 institutions worldwide. The groups differed in ethnic background and had a recruitment imbalance, as most centers did not have a single case of CS, though all contributed cases of GCM. Notably, myocardial necrosis and granulomas were observed in both conditions, though necrosis was more extensive in GCM and granulomas more common in CS. Eosinophils were more frequent in GCM, while fibrosis was more extensive in CS. Left‐sided heart failure predominated in GCM, whereas syncope and atrioventricular block (AVB) were seen more often in CS. The five-year transplant-free survival was 61% in CS versus only 10% in GCM. Despite their disagreement on the presence of granulomas in GCM and necrosis in CS, the above reports have been considered to establish CS and GCM as histopathologically different disease entities.

The third comparative study, focusing on transcriptomics, analyzed the myocardial expression profiles of a selected sample.

### Fatal giant cell myocarditis in a patient with multiple autoimmune disorders [^112GM2Ui]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

A case of circulatory collapse due to severe heart failure is reported in a 52-year-old male with autoimmune disorders, including type-1 diabetes, Graves' disease, and total alopecia. Upon admission, the patient presented with severe heart failure characterized by a cardiac index of 0.9 l/min/m², a mixed venous saturation of 29%, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 5%. The condition was refractory to treatment with inotropic agents and necessitated mechanical cardiopulmonary support. Endomyocardial biopsies revealed extensive giant cell myocarditis (GCM). Immunosuppressant treatment did not alter the condition, and urgent orthotopic heart transplantation was performed. Histopathological examination of the explanted heart confirmed the diagnosis and showed widespread vascular deposition of complement C4d, suggesting a pathogenic role for the innate immune system in GCM. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient was in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, experienced episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, but showed no evidence of GCM recurrence in endomyocardial biopsies.

### An unusual case of giant cell myocarditis missed in a Heartmate-2 left ventricle apical-wedge section: A case report and review of the literature [^113H7wS7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is usually dramatic; however, some cases may present an indolent course with symptoms present for months to years before proper diagnosis is made. Ventricular arrhythmias are initially found in 14% of patients but will develop in 50% of patients. Fascicular and high-degree atrioventricular blocks are also frequently encountered. The median survival without heart transplantation is poor, ranging from 3.0 to 5.5 months from the onset of symptoms, and relapse in the transplanted graft may occur in up to 25% of cases.

Histopathology is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells with diffuse myocardial necrosis in the absence of granulomatous myocarditis; fibrosis may be prominent. The precise pathophysiology is unknown but seems to involve a T-lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune process, which may explain the common association (up to 20%) with other autoimmune disorders, typically inflammatory bowel diseases and tumors, mostly thymoma. Association with lymphoma has been described twice in the literature.

### An unusual case of giant cell myocarditis missed in a Heartmate-2 left ventricle apical-wedge section: A case report and review of the literature [^114qX64V]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

This case report illustrates important learning points. First, the bimodal presentation of initial improvement followed by decompensation is unusual for GCM. Additionally, the presence of GCM may not always be appreciated at the initial biopsy, even though a large sample is provided, such as a Heartmate-II apical core. This highlights the importance of obtaining a precise histological diagnosis, since immunosuppressive therapy might improve survival.

One question remains unanswered: was the initial diagnosis really an acute lymphocytic myocarditis, or was it the indolent phase of a GCM? Could lymphocytic myocarditis have been a contributing factor to the development of GCM? Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment in this rare but life-threatening disease.

### Cardiac sarcoidosis and giant cell myocarditis: Actually, 2 ends of the same disease [^1155WUFq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Perhaps the greatest strength of the study is the quantity and quality of the histopathological assessment. All patients had histological confirmation, with the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) directly from cardiac tissue in 224 cases: 150 from endomyocardial biopsy, 10 post-transplant, 64 autopsies, and others from lymph nodes (n = 102) or extracardiac organs (n = 25). In addition, there was central overreading by two cardiac pathologists of histological features in all patients with giant cell myocarditis (GCM), but not in patients with CS.

These data have been published separately and showed that, after overreading all available histological material, 45 of the 73 cases of GCM (62%) were reclassified as CS. The reclassification was based on identifying typical sarcoid granulomas that had either been misread, overlooked, or found in subsequent specimens. The quality of the histopathological assessment is clearly key here, as the findings of GCM and CS intersect to some extent and there is no agreed consensus among cardiac pathologists on the respective diagnostic criteria.

As the authors importantly state, "our comparative data are specific to the criteria used to distinguish GCM from CS on myocardial microscopy". The only significant weakness is that 100% of the patients were White.

### Fatal recurrence of fulminant giant cell myocarditis and recovery after initialisation of an alternative immunosuppressive regime [^113hu3s1]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We report on a challenging case of a 34-year-old male patient with giant cell myocarditis (GCM) and fulminant relapse after discontinuing immunomodulatory therapy 2 years after the initial event. Specific combined immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and high-dose glucocorticoids, combined with guideline-based heart failure medication, led to the recovery of GCM, improvement of systolic left ventricular function, and clinical remission. This case report emphasizes the importance of immunosuppressive therapy for prognosis and outcome, along with the risk associated with its discontinuation. Most importantly, ATG seems to be a new potential treatment option for patients with acute GCM.

### Manifestations and outcome of cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis by 25-year nationwide cohorts [^1167oSSr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) and giant cell myocarditis (GCM) share many histopathologic and clinical features, leading to discussions on whether they are parts of a one-disease continuum.

- **Methods and results**: We compared medical record data of 351 CS and 28 GCM cases diagnosed in Finland since the late 1980s, followed until February 2018, focusing on a composite endpoint of cardiac death, aborted sudden death, and heart transplantation. Heart failure was the presenting manifestation in 50% of GCM cases versus 15% of CS cases (P < 0.001), while high-grade atrioventricular block was present in 21% of GCM versus 43% of CS cases (P = 0.044). At presentation, left ventricular ejection fraction was ≤ 50% in 81% of GCM cases compared to 48% in CS cases (P = 0.004). The median (interquartile range) of plasma NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) was 5273 (2782–11309) ng/L on admission in GCM versus 859 (290–1950) ng/L in CS (P < 0.001), and cardiac troponin T exceeded 50 ng/L in 17 of 19 cases of GCM versus 48 of 239 cases of CS (P < 0.001). The 5-year estimate of event-free survival was 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%) in CS compared to 27% (95% CI, 10%-45%) in GCM (P < 0.001). By Cox regression analysis, GCM predicted cardiac events with a hazard ratio of 5.16 (95% CI, 2.82–9.45), which decreased to 1.58 (95% CI, 0.71–3.52) after including markers of myocardial injury and dysfunction in the model.

- **Conclusions**: GCM differs from CS by presenting with more extensive myocardial injury and having a worse long-term outcome. Yet, the key determinant of prognosis appears to be the extent of myocardial injury.

### Cardiac transplantation for pediatric giant cell myocarditis [^115cFbzo]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that infrequently affects children and generally has a more aggressive, often fatal course than other forms of myocarditis. No data are available regarding the epidemiology of GCM in children. We describe a 13-year-old girl who presented with ventricular tachycardia and rapid hemodynamic deterioration, which required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to heart transplantation. Histopathologic examination of the explanted heart revealed GCM. We review the demographic features, clinical course, and post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy of all patients aged 19 years and younger reported to have had GCM.

### Management of patients with giant cell myocarditis: JACC review topic of the week [^111NQuCa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis is a rare, often rapidly progressive and potentially fatal disease due to T-cell lymphocyte-mediated inflammation of the myocardium that typically affects young and middle-aged adults. Frequently, the disease course is marked by acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, intractable ventricular arrhythmias, and/or heart block. Diagnosis is often difficult due to its varied clinical presentation and overlap with other cardiovascular conditions. Although cardiac biomarkers and multimodality imaging are often used as initial diagnostic tests, endomyocardial biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.

Combination immunosuppressive therapy, along with guideline-directed medical therapy, has led to a paradigm shift in the management of giant cell myocarditis, resulting in an improvement in overall and transplant-free survival. Early diagnosis and prompt management can decrease the risk of transplantation or death, which remain common in patients who present with cardiogenic shock.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of giant-cell myocarditis in the era of combined immunosuppression [^11739xtB]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Giant-cell myocarditis often escapes diagnosis until autopsy or transplantation and has defied proper treatment trials due to its rarity and deadly behavior. Therapy relies on multiple-drug immunosuppression, but its prognostic influence remains poorly understood. We sought to analyze our experience in diagnosing giant-cell myocarditis and the outcome of patients on combined immunosuppression.

- **Methods and results**: We reviewed the histories, diagnostic procedures, treatment details, and outcomes of 32 consecutive patients with histologically verified giant-cell myocarditis treated in our hospital since 1991. Twenty-six patients (81%) were diagnosed by endomyocardial or surgical biopsies, and 6 were diagnosed at autopsy or post-transplantation. Twenty-eight (88%) patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy. The sensitivity of transvenous endomyocardial biopsy increased from 68% (19/28 patients) to 93% (26/28) after up to 2 repeat procedures. The 26 biopsy-diagnosed patients were treated with combined immunosuppression (2–4 drugs), including cyclosporine in 20 patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of transplant-free survival from symptom onset were 69% at 1 year, 58% at 2 years, and 52% at 5 years. Of the transplant-free survivors, 10/17 (59%) experienced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up, and 3 received intracardiac defibrillator shocks for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

- **Conclusions**: Repeat endomyocardial biopsies are frequently needed to diagnose giant-cell myocarditis. On contemporary immunosuppression, two-thirds of patients reach a partial recovery.

### Atrial giant cell myocarditis: a distinctive clinicopathologic entity [^115ywrQK]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) typically causes fulminant heart failure, arrhythmias, or heart block, necessitating aggressive immunosuppression, ventricular assist device insertion, or cardiac transplantation. We describe a novel variant of GCM, primarily involving the atria, that displays distinctive clinical features and follows a more benign course than ventricular GCM.

- **Methods and results**: We identified 6 patients (median age 67.5 years, 4 male) with atrial GCM in our pathology consultation practices from 2010 to 2012. Clinical history, imaging, and pathology materials were reviewed. Clinically, 4 patients had atrial fibrillation, 1 had acute heart failure, and 1 had incidental disease at autopsy. Among the 5 living patients, echocardiography revealed severe atrial dilatation (5 cases), mitral/tricuspid regurgitation (5), atrial mural thrombus (3), atrial wall thickening (2), and atrial hypokinesis (2). Ventricular function was preserved in all 5. Histological review of surgically resected atria showed giant cell and lymphocytic infiltrates, lymphocytic myocarditis-like foci, cardiomyocyte necrosis, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in all cases. Other features included interstitial fibrosis (5), poorly-formed granulomas (4), eosinophils (4), neutrophils (1), and vasculitis (1). Treatment consisted of steroids and cyclosporine (1), pacemaker placement for sick sinus syndrome (1), and supportive care (3). All 5 living patients returned to baseline exercise tolerance after 6 to 16 weeks of follow-up.

Atrial GCM represents a distinct clinicopathologic entity compared to other forms of GCM, pursuing a less aggressive clinical course.

### Manifestations and outcome of cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis by 25-year nationwide cohorts [^111Uw52u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The long‐term outcome and its predictors were examined in this study. The 311 cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) patients with lifetime disease presentation had total follow‐up times ranging from 6 months to 29.7 years (median, 6.3 years) from symptom onset to the end of the study. Among them, 39 fatal and 32 sudden aborted cardiac deaths were recorded, with the former including 31 fatalities from ventricular arrhythmia, 7 from heart failure, and 1 from extensive coronary artery disease. Nine patients with CS died of noncardiac causes, including 5 from cancer, and 1 each from tuberculosis, dementia, terminal lung sarcoidosis, and brain infarction.

Among the 25 idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) patients, with total follow‐up times from 3 days to 19.1 years (median, 3.6 years), there were 7 fatal and 7 sudden aborted cardiac deaths. The fatalities included 5 deaths from arrhythmia and 2 from heart failure. Altogether, 25 patients with CS and 11 with GCM underwent cardiac transplantation; of these, 9 with CS and 3 with GCM died following transplantation.

The composite endpoint of fatal or aborted cardiac death or transplantation was recorded in a total of 91 patients with CS and 18 patients with GCM. The Kaplan–Meier graphs present event‐free survival in the two groups, showing a rapid divergence with most events in GCM occurring within 1.5 years from disease presentation. Still, by the end of the study, occasional GCM patients had follow‐up times beyond 8 to 12 years without events. The Kaplan–Meier estimate of 5‐year event‐free cardiac survival was 77% (95% CI, 72%–82%) in CS versus 27% (95% CI, 10%–45%) in GCM (P < 0.001).

### Giant cell myocarditis after first dose of BNT162b2 - a case report [^111VRrFM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rare subtype of myocarditis with a high risk for rapid progressive heart failure, leading frequently to heart transplantation or death. Patients most often present with ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Diagnosing GCM can be challenging, as it is a rapidly progressive disease, and in the early course, clinical presentation can be unspecific and subtle. While cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard in the diagnosis of myocarditis, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) profile can be variable in GCM. Often, the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the only method allowing the identification of the underlying etiology of cardiac inflammation. Like in our case, EMB histology was necessary to make the correct and complete diagnosis of GCM and treat the patient accordingly.

Gene expression profiling, a diagnostic tool which seems suitable to indicate giant cells even if not histologically detectable by analysis of genes coding for cytokines or chemokines, cellular receptor, and proteins involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, was in addition used to support the diagnosis of GCM and differentiate from cardiac sarcoidosis. Although our patient had only one asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and described no history of syncope or palpitation, and had only slightly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), we supplied the patient with a wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) as the 5-year incidence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias is described as 55% in GCM patients. About 20% of GCM patients have shown underlying autoimmune disease. In this case, no hint for any autoimmune disorder was identified, yet the patient's father suffered from…

### An unusual case of giant cell myocarditis missed in a Heartmate-2 left ventricle apical-wedge section: A case report and review of the literature [^113XUEcM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Kodama and colleagues developed an experimental model of GCM using Lewis rats inoculated with human cardiac myosin fragments and sacrificed at 14 and 84 days. They showed typical myocarditis with multinucleated giant cells and diffuse fibrosis in the early phase, with disappearance of the mononuclear infiltrates in the later phase suggestive of healed myocarditis. Anti-cardiac myosin antibodies were significantly higher in the groups sacrificed earlier, but all had higher titers than controls. These findings could be prevented by cyclosporine, FK-506 (Tacrolimus), and anti-alphabeta T-cell receptor antibodies, supporting the role of a T-cell mediated autoimmune process in GCM.

Clinically, immunosuppressive therapy might improve survival in GCM, in contrast with other types of myocarditis. In a retrospective study, GCM patients who received immunosuppression (corticosteroids and cyclosporine, with or without azathioprine) had an improved survival without cardiac transplantation (12.3 versus 3.0 months [p = 0.001]), while corticosteroids alone had no effect. An observational study of biopsy-proven GCM patients (excluding those with fulminant presentation) and symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmia reported that treatment with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for one year, with or without muromonad-CD3 pre-treatment for ten days, dramatically improved survival (64%) without cardiac transplantation.

### Atrial giant cell myocarditis with preserved left ventricular function: a case report and literature review [^114feisg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rare and fatal inflammatory disorder induced by T-lymphocytes, typically affecting young adults. Generally, this disease presents with a rapidly progressive course and a very poor prognosis. GCM is characterized by acute heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and varying grades of atrioventricular block. Uncommon findings, including pericardial tamponade and atrial masses, have been previously reported in GCM cases. Due to its clinical presentation overlapping with other cardiac diseases and nonspecific imaging features, the timely diagnosis of GCM is challenging; the definitive diagnosis relies on an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).

Although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of GCM remain elusive, statistics show that up to 20% of GCM cases are associated with other autoimmune diseases, indicating that altered immunity may be a causal factor. In recent years, atrial GCM (aGCM) has been recognized as a clinicopathological entity distinct from classical GCM. As described by retrievable case reports, although its histopathological manifestations are highly similar to those of classical GCM, this entity is characterized by preserved left ventricular function and atrial arrhythmias, without ventricular arrhythmias. aGCM tends to show benign disease progression with a better clinical prognosis compared to the rapid course and poor prognosis of vGCM. The atrial myocardium is not routinely sampled at autopsy or during routine pathology; thus, knowledge of the atrial myocardium originates only from rare findings.

### Cardiac sarcoidosis and giant cell myocarditis: Actually, 2 ends of the same disease [^117EVDVK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

It should be noted that there are some important similarities between the conditions, including both often presenting with high-grade atrioventricular block (21% versus 43% for GCM and CS, respectively); these rates of atrioventricular block are both much higher than in all other forms of myocarditis. Age at disease presentation and female preponderance were also similar. Also, T lymphocyte–mediated inflammatory injury appears important in both conditions. Finally, there have been several reports of patients possibly having both conditions, with biopsy evidence of extracardiac sarcoidosis and cardiac biopsies suggesting GCM. However, it is also possible that the cardiac histopathological features in these cases were misread as GCM.

We will clearly need more data to resolve this debate. Further histological studies may help answer this question, specifically by a systematic assessment of regional lymph nodes of autopsy specimens in patients with CS and GCM. Our (J.V. and V.N.) unpublished experience is that we invariably find reactive changes and congestion in regional lymph nodes in patients with GCM and granulomas in patients with CS. This brings up the related controversial issue of "isolated CS", and the authors also suggest that GCM may be a subtype of isolated CS. Sarcoidosis is, by definition and biological features, a systemic disease, so really the debate is whether there is "a sarcoidosis-like disease" that only involves the heart. The reported prevalence of isolated CS varies widely, from 3.2% to 54%.

### Long term biventricular support with Berlin Heart Excor in a septuagenarian with giant-cell myocarditis [^115KJNmv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Giant-cell myocarditis (GCM) is known as a rare, rapidly progressive, and frequently fatal myocardial disease in young and middle-aged adults. We report a 76-year-old male patient who underwent implantation with a biventricular Berlin Heart Excor system at the age of 74 due to acute biventricular heart failure caused by giant-cell myocarditis. The implantation proceeded without any surgical problems; however, a difficulty was encountered with the immunosuppressive therapy after implantation. Meanwhile, the patient is 76 years old and has lived with circulatory support for about 3 years without major adverse events. Additionally, in terms of mobility in old age, there are no major limitations. It seems that even in selected elderly patients, implantation of long-term support with the biventricular Berlin Heart Excor is a useful therapeutic option with an acceptable outcome.

### The role of right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy for idiopathic giant cell myocarditis [^117SZ9fd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is an uncommon cause of cardiac failure distinguished clinically from lymphocytic myocarditis by rapidly progressive heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart block. Unlike fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis, patients with fulminant cardiac failure caused by GCM may respond to certain immunosuppressive agents; however, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is infrequently used to establish the diagnosis partly because the sensitivity of EMB for GCM is unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity of right ventricular EMB for GCM in a referral population.

- **Methods and results**: Twenty subjects (of 63 total) in the Multicenter Giant Cell Myocarditis Registry underwent both right ventricular EMB and heart pathology (HRTP) evaluation from apical wedge, explantation, or autopsy. The false-negative rate of right ventricular EMB was defined as the ratio of negative EMB to positive HRTP results. Ten of the 20 subjects were women. The mean age was 38 years (range, 16–53 years). Twelve (60%) subjects had a positive EMB and positive HRTP confirming GCM. Three (15%) had a negative EMB and positive HRTP for GCM. Five had a positive EMB and negative HRTP evaluation for GCM. The resulting sensitivity of EMB for GCM was 80% (12/15) with a positive predictive value of 71%. Assuming the 5 subjects with a positive EMB and negative HRTP are true positives, the sensitivity improves to 85% (17/20). Predictors of negative HRTP after positive EMB were time from symptom onset to HRTP (P.006) and time from EMB to HRTP (P.03).

### Recurrence of giant cell myocarditis in cardiac allograft [^115BYG3i]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis causes essentially irreversible fulminant left ventricular dysfunction, with associated conduction abnormalities and congestive failure. Response to immunosuppressive therapy is poor, and cardiac transplantation is the only viable treatment option. The histologic hallmarks of giant cell myocarditis include a polymorphous inflammatory response with numerous multinucleated giant cells and extensive myocyte necrosis in a geographic pattern. In the Giant Cell Myocarditis Registry, 38 patients received cardiac transplants for giant cell myocarditis. Among these patients, there were 9 recurrences of the disease in the allograft. Concern has been expressed that recurrence of giant cell myocarditis in the allograft might be a contraindication for cardiac transplantation in the future.

- **Methods**: In our single-center analysis, we describe the clinical and histologic findings of 5 patients transplanted for giant cell myocarditis at the Cleveland Clinic.

- **Results**: All but 1 of the patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 4, with an average cardiac index (CI) of 1.52 liters/min x m². Of the 5 patients transplanted, 1 developed recurrent giant cell myocarditis. Routine right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy at 1 week exhibited severe multifocal myocardial fibrosis, in addition to mild acute vascular rejection and mild grade 1A cellular rejection. Follow-up biopsy in this patient indicated grade IIIA moderate acute rejection in addition to multinucleated giant cells. Two distinct inflammatory processes were noted, consisting of foci.

### Myocarditis [^115d2ivx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening disease that presents with a wide range of symptoms in both children and adults. Viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis in developed countries, but other etiologies include bacterial and protozoal infections, toxins, drug reactions, autoimmune diseases, giant cell myocarditis, and sarcoidosis. Acute injury results in myocyte damage, which activates the innate and humoral immune system, leading to severe inflammation. For most patients, the immune reaction is eventually down-regulated and the myocardium recovers. However, in select cases, persistent myocardial inflammation leads to ongoing myocyte damage and relentless symptomatic heart failure or even death.

The diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation and noninvasive imaging findings. Most patients respond well to standard heart failure therapy; however, in severe cases, mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation may be indicated. The prognosis in acute myocarditis is generally good, except in patients with giant cell myocarditis. Persistent chronic myocarditis usually has a progressive course but may respond to immunosuppression.

### Giant cell myocarditis: A brief review [^114hsciV]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rapidly progressive and frequently fatal disease that mainly affects young to middle-aged, previously healthy individuals. Early diagnosis is critical, as recent studies have shown that rapidly instituted cyclosporine-based immunosuppression can reduce inflammation and improve transplant-free survival. Before the 1980s, GCM was primarily diagnosed at autopsy. However, due to advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic options, it is now increasingly diagnosed based on endomyocardial biopsies, explanted hearts, or apical wedge sections removed during ventricular assist device placement.

Histologic examination remains the gold standard for diagnosis; however, there are many possible etiologies for cardiac giant cells. Having a working knowledge of the clinicopathologic features that distinguish GCM from other giant cell-containing lesions is essential, since such lesions can have widely divergent management and outcomes.

### Giant cell myocarditis: Clinical presentation, bridge to transplantation with mechanical circulatory support, and long-term outcome [^111RUqmW]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

The multicenter Giant Cell Myocarditis Registry recorded 64 cases from 36 centers before 1996. The median transplant-free survival of 30 patients without immunosuppression was 3 months. Of 34 patients who received heart transplantations, 9 experienced recurrence of giant cell myocarditis in their transplanted hearts and 1 patient died.

- **Methods**: We reviewed our experience in 340 heart transplantations since 1984. Unexpected giant cell myocarditis was found in the explanted hearts of 7 patients (6 men and 1 female, aged 18–65 years).

- **Results**: The duration from the onset of symptoms to assist-device implant or transplantation ranged from 11 days to 9 years, whereas the time interval from referral or deterioration ranged from 2 days to 4 months. Four patients required mechanical circulatory support before surgery (total artificial hearts in 2 and left ventricular assist devices in 2), and 3 patients required inotropic drugs. Six patients are alive with no sign of recurrent giant cell myocarditis at 12 to 113 months after surgery. One patient died suddenly 75 months after surgery, and autopsy showed severe graft vascular disease with no recurrence of giant cell myocarditis. Surveillance right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens showed asymptomatic giant cell myocarditis in 3 patients at 5 to 13 months after surgery and found recurrence in 1 patient 30 months after surgery. This patient received augmented immunosuppression.

- **Conclusions**: Giant cell myocarditis often is not diagnosed before transplantation. It can present as dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Stabilization of early Duchenne cardiomyopathy with aldosterone inhibition: Results of the multicenter AIDMD trial [^111dhhht]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Two deaths occurred, both in the eplerenone arm and both deemed unrelated to study medication by the data safety monitoring board. The first was a 20-year-old patient with severe baseline restrictive lung disease (FVC, 13% predicted) who experienced respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia with respiratory failure. The second patient, aged 18 years, experienced accidental drowning after ingesting lysergic acid diethylamide. No other deaths and no symptomatic heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias occurred during the study.

Gynecomastia was reported by one subject in the spironolactone arm, and one subject taking eplerenone developed a facial rash (Table 2). Worse pulmonary function by FVC as a percentage predicted value and worse cardiac function by Ecc interacted to predict worse reported health status (P = 0.023). However, pulmonary function remained stable over 12 months in both arms, with no significant change in FVC (eplerenone versus spironolactone change in FVC as a percentage predicted value, −4.0 [interquartile range {IQR}, −12.5 to 1.0] versus −6.0 [IQR, −14.0 to −1.0]; P = 0.667) or maximal inspiratory pressure (eplerenone versus spironolactone change in maximal inspiratory pressure, −4.0 [IQR, −13.0 to 2.0] versus 3.0 [IQR, −2.1 to 9.0] mm Hg; P = 0.134) over 12 months of therapy. Health status also remained stable over 12 months.

The estimated glomerular filtration rate was normal at baseline and remained normal in all subjects at follow-up in both the eplerenone (137 [IQR, 122–181] versus 133 [IQR, 110–175] mL/min per 1.73 m²; P = 0.563) and spironolactone groups.

### Long-term risk of recurrence, morbidity and mortality in giant cell myocarditis [^115JsEc6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rare disorder in which survival beyond 1 year without heart transplantation is uncommon. Long-term follow-up data on those with such survival are lacking. Twenty-six patients with biopsy-proved GCM who survived for more than 1 year without heart transplantation were identified from a multicenter GCM registry. The incidence of death, transplantation, ventricular assist device placement, and histologically proved disease recurrence was ascertained retrospectively. The rates of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, renal failure, and infectious complications were calculated. The mean age of the cohort was 54.6 ± 13.9 years (65% women). The mean follow-up duration was 5.5 years, starting 1 year after diagnosis.

- **Risk outcomes**: There were 3 deaths (12%), 5 heart transplantations (19%), and 1 ventricular assist device placement (4%). Three histologically confirmed recurrences of GCM (12%) occurred between 1.5 and 8 years after diagnosis. Thirteen of the 26 patients experienced a total of 30 heart failure episodes more than 1 year after initial diagnosis.

- **Complications**: There were 23 episodes of elevated creatinine in 12 patients, 41 infectious events in 13 patients, and 19 episodes of ventricular arrhythmias in 6 patients over a total of 144 years of follow-up. Starting 1 year after GCM diagnosis, the combined rate of death, transplantation, ventricular assist device placement, and GCM recurrence was 47% at 5 years.

In conclusion, the risk for GCM recurrence continues to more than 8 years after diagnosis.

### Heart transplantation in giant cell myocarditis: Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing Registry [^113mVXJk]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a lethal, rapidly progressive disease for which heart transplantation is the treatment of choice. We sought to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with GCM who undergo heart transplantation.

- **Methods and results**: We used the United Network for Organ Sharing thoracic organ transplantation registry to identify adults with GCM as the primary diagnosis. We compared their characteristics and outcomes with patients who underwent transplantation for other types of myocarditis and for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCMP). A total of 32 patients with GCM were compared with 219 patients with myocarditis and 14,221 patients with IDCMP. Median age at listing for GCM was 52 years (interquartile range 40–55 years). The majority were white (94%), male (63%), and listed as 1A (44%). Biventricular assist devices were used more frequently in GCM compared with IDCMP (31% vs. 2%; p < 0.001). After transplantation, there were no statistically significant differences among GCM, myocarditis, and IDCMP patients regarding pacemaker implantation, dialysis initiation, or stroke rate. GCM patients had an increased risk of acute rejection compared with IDCMP patients (16% vs. 5.0%; p = 0.021), but there was no difference in rehospitalization for rejection among the three etiologies (P = 0.88). The cumulative survival rates for GCM patients at 1, 5, and 10 years were 94%, 82%, and 68%, respectively, which were similar to the other etiologies (P = 0.11).

- **Conclusions**: Compared with patients with IDCMP, those with GCM present more acutely and have significantly higher utilization of assist devices.

### Resolution of giant cell myocarditis after extended ventricular assistance [^1155DD5z]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Lower recurrence rates and improved long-term outcomes are the goals of treatment for giant cell myocarditis (GCM). We describe a case of GCM in an Asian woman who presented with new onset palpitations and syncope. Initially, she had normal systolic function by echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Due to rapidly deteriorating hemodynamic status, she underwent implantation of a biventricular assist device (BiVAD). Giant cell myocarditis was diagnosed at that time by surgical biopsy. She was not treated with immunosuppressive therapy due to the low likelihood of recovery and concerns for potential infection with the BiVAD in place. She received a heart transplant 12 months later and had extensive fibrosis but no evidence of active GCM in the heart explant. The role of extended BiVAD support in patients with GCM should be further investigated.

### Usefulness of immunosuppression for giant cell myocarditis [^115a5Ezo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is a rare and highly lethal disorder. The only multicenter case series with treatment data lacked cardiac function assessments and had a retrospective design. We conducted a prospective, multicenter study of immunosuppression, including cyclosporine and steroids, for acute, microscopically-confirmed GCM. From June 1999 to June 2005, in a standard protocol, 11 subjects received high-dose steroids and cyclosporine, and 9 subjects received muromonab-CD3. Of these subjects, 7 of 11 were women, the mean age was 60 ± 15 years, and the mean time from symptom onset to presentation was 27 ± 33 days.

During 1 year of treatment, 1 subject died of respiratory complications on day 178, and 2 subjects received heart transplants on days 2 and 27, respectively. Serial endomyocardial biopsies revealed that after 4 weeks of treatment, the degree of necrosis, cellular inflammation, and giant cells decreased (p = 0.001). One patient who completed the trial subsequently died of a fatal GCM recurrence after the withdrawal of immunosuppression. Her case demonstrates for the first time that there is a risk of recurrent, sometimes fatal, GCM after cessation of immunosuppression.

In conclusion, this prospective study of immunosuppression for GCM confirms retrospective case reports that such therapy improves long-term survival. Additionally, the withdrawal of immunosuppression can be associated with fatal GCM recurrence.

### Cardiac sarcoidosis and giant cell myocarditis: Actually, 2 ends of the same disease [^116zYdiR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In our opinion, much of the data presented in the article suggest different clinical entities. For example, they found that GCM had a much more acute onset, with a mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis of 0.3 months compared with 7 months for CS. Heart failure was the presenting manifestation for GCM in 50% of cases versus 15% for CS. At presentation, cardiac troponin was almost always elevated in cases of GCM but in less than a quarter of cases of CS.

Finally, they found that the prognosis was much worse for GCM than for CS, with a 5-year event-free survival of 27% compared with 77%. Of the 18 surviving patients with GCM, 11 (61%) underwent a transplant compared with 25 of 272 (9.1%) of patients with CS. After adjustment for presentation and baseline left ventricular function, patients with GCM had a 5-fold higher risk of the primary end point.

These outcomes are clearly different between the two groups and are consistent with a previous article from the Multicenter Idiopathic GCM Registry, which included 42 patients with CS and 73 patients with GCM. Patients with CS had a 5-year transplant-free survival of 69.8% versus 21.9% for GCM. That study also found a much more acute onset of GCM, with a mean of 1.2 months from symptom onset to presentation compared with 5.5 months for CS.

### Giant cell myocarditis: a life-threatening disorder heralded by orbital myositis [^111pLNEy]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old man with a history of orbital myositis (OM) presented to the emergency department with ventricular tachycardia requiring electrical cardioversion. Post-cardioversion ECG showed right bundle branch block, while an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% and a dilated right ventricle. Cardiac MRI produced suboptimal images because the patient was experiencing frequent arrhythmias. The rest of the work-up, including coronary angiography, was unremarkable. Given the dilated right ventricle, we suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and discharged the patient with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

One week later, he was readmitted with cardiogenic shock; endomyocardial biopsy revealed giant cell myocarditis (GCM). To the best of our knowledge, this is the seventh case report of GCM described in a patient with OM. We recommend that clinicians maintain a high degree of suspicion for GCM in patients with OM presenting with cardiac problems.

### Ventricular assist device support as a bridge to heart transplantation in patients with giant cell myocarditis [^1173z3jo]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Giant cell myocarditis (GCM) carries a poor prognosis and many patients require end-stage therapies. This study aimed to determine the outcome of patients bridged with ventricular assist devices (VAD) to orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT).

A retrospective data collection of all patients with GCM was performed. Diagnosis was determined by endomyocardial or explanted heart biopsy. Eight patients were identified, but two went directly to OHT and were excluded. The remaining six patients received VADs and these patients, aged 44 ± 18 years, were included. Five of the six patients were bridged with biventricular support, while one patient was supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) alone. Two patients died on device support. Four patients were successfully bridged to OHT, 77 ± 42 days after device implantation. All four patients bridged with a VAD are alive, with a mean follow-up of 5.7 ± 4.1 years. Two patients experienced reGCM in the transplanted heart and were treated successfully with immunosuppression. Three patients had high-grade (2R) rejection, occurring 66 ± 52 days post-OHT. Cardiac function was preserved in all patients, with only one patient developing cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

Patients with end-stage GCM can be successfully bridged with VADs to OHT, with very good post-transplant survival. The appropriate immunosuppressive regimen for this group needs further investigation, given the frequency of rejection and GCM recurrence.

Regarding the medical management of myocarditis, specifically concerning immunosuppressive therapy, the ESC 2013 guidelines recommend initiating corticosteroid therapy in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. This is advised in the presence of ventricular dysfunction and/or arrhythmia. Additionally, corticosteroid therapy is recommended in some forms of infection-negative eosinophilic or toxic myocarditis presenting with heart failure and/or arrhythmia.

### Stabilization of early Duchenne cardiomyopathy with aldosterone inhibition: Results of the multicenter AIDMD trial [^113J5GVE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Between February 2015 and May 2017, 61 eligible boys were identified for screening, and 52 were enrolled across 7 sites. Of the participants, 26 were randomly assigned to receive eplerenone, and 26 were assigned to receive spironolactone. In each group, 23 participants completed baseline and 12-month visits. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the enrolled cohort by assignment group.

Three subjects in the spironolactone group withdrew from the study — two due to difficulty arranging follow-up blood draws and one following a sibling's death. One subject in the spironolactone group completed the 12-month follow-up but chose not to undergo follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Most subjects' background therapies included corticosteroids, and approximately two-thirds were on background ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). The concomitant use of other medications was common and included vitamins, calcium supplements, proton pump inhibitors, and antidepressants. No subjects were receiving any other experimental agent, and all subjects were nonsmokers.

### Manifestations and outcome of cardiac sarcoidosis and idiopathic giant cell myocarditis by 25-year nationwide cohorts [^117HQEus]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The data cannot be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results due to restrictions related to patient consent. Individual-level data cannot be shared openly.

- **Study population**: We included a total of 310 patients with a lifetime clinical diagnosis of either cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) or giant cell myocarditis (GCM) and 69 similar cases diagnosed only at autopsy and identified retrospectively from the cause-of-death registry. The clinical case series was based on our nationwide registry of Myocardial Inflammatory Diseases in Finland (MIDFIN) and comprised patients admitted to and diagnosed in Finnish university and main provincial hospitals from the late 1980s until the end of 2015. The essentials of the MIDFIN registry and the methods by which the patients were identified and included were detailed in our earlier publications. Postmortem cases were identified by screening a total of 820,605 death certificates available in digital form in the national cause-of-death registry from 1998 until the end of 2015. The method of screening, the yield of candidate cases, their further assessment, and ultimate inclusions and exclusions have been reported thoroughly in earlier works.

- **Diagnostic criteria and reassessment of the original GCM diagnoses**: For the diagnosis of CS, histology of sarcoidosis was mandatory, confirmed preferably in a sample of the myocardium or, if absent, in extracardiac organs or lymph nodes. Besides histology, the diagnosis required the presence of clinical signs of myocardial involvement.

The efficacy and safety of RINVOQ 15 mg once daily were assessed in Trial GCA (NCT03725202), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in patients 50 years of age and older. Of the participants, 81.8% were 65 years of age and older, 73.1% were female, and 93.7% were white, with new-onset or relapsing giant cell arteritis. Trial GCA spanned 52 weeks, in which 428 patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio and dosed once daily with RINVOQ 15 mg, upadacitinib 7.5 mg, or placebo. All patients received background corticosteroid therapy.

- **Corticosteroid taper regimen**: The RINVOQ and upadacitinib-treated groups followed a pre-specified corticosteroid taper regimen aimed at reaching 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the placebo-treated group followed a regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks.
- **Primary endpoint**: The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission at Week 52, defined by the absence of giant cell arteritis signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52 and adherence to the protocol-defined corticosteroid taper regimen.
- **Key secondary endpoint**: A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained complete remission at Week 52, defined by the absence of giant cell arteritis signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hsCRP from Week 12 through Week 52, and adherence to the protocol-defined corticosteroid taper regimen.

The study included a 52-week extension for a total study duration of up to 2 years.

### Long-term outcome and its predictors in giant cell myocarditis [^113a7mwm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

There are no studies focusing on prognostic factors in giant cell myocarditis (GCM). We aimed to identify predictors of transplant-free survival in GCM.

We analyzed the details of 46 patients with GCM (31 women, mean age 51 ± 12 years) seen at our hospital since 1991 and followed for the occurrence of cardiac death or transplantation until May 2015. The association of transplant-free survival with patient characteristics, laboratory data on admission, and myocardial histology in the 38 patients diagnosed prior to death or transplantation was examined. Altogether, 26 patients died (n = 8) or underwent transplantation (n = 18) a median of 11 months following symptom onset. The 5-year estimate of transplant-free survival was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI) 35–48%]. By Cox regression analysis, the hazard ratio for death or transplantation was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75–0.99) per +5% difference in LVEF, 1.06 (95% CI 1.03–1.10) per +1000 ng/L difference in NT-proBNP, and 4.57 (95% CI 1.63–11.28) for cardiac troponin-T above the median of 85 ng/L at presentation. The severity of necrosis and fibrosis in myocardial biopsy, graded by the consensus of two cardiac pathologists as none, mild, moderate, or severe, predicted the outcome with a hazard ratio of 7.17 (95% CI 2.29–22.40) for the presence of either necrosis or fibrosis of at least moderate extent.

In GCM, the probability of transplant-free survival is 42% at 5 years from symptom onset. Markers of myocyte injury and cardiac dysfunction help predict the outcome.
