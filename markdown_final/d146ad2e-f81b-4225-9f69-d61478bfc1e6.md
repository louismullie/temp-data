## Question

When you hear the heart skip a beat, what is that called?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the medical term is for the sensation that the heart "skips a beat". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct term for the symptom the patient perceives. Then, I should verify the typical electrophysiologic causes that produce this sensation and whether one is more common than others. Next, I will consider the mechanism that makes a "skip" perceptible. Finally, I need to check diagnostic implications and when to confirm the symptom–rhythm correlation with monitoring to avoid premature conclusions [^1118sHiU].

> Let me first confirm the symptom terminology. The lay description of an irregular, missed, or "skipped" heartbeat corresponds to palpitations; patients also describe racing, fluttering, pounding in the chest or neck, or irregular beats — so "heart skipped a beat" maps onto palpitations, not a specific arrhythmia itself, and I should be careful not to over-interpret it as a diagnosis [^117FV3aX] [^1115kjhj].

> Wait, let me verify the common arrhythmic substrate behind a "skip". The sensation is often produced by a premature beat followed by a compensatory pause; most commonly these are premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), which are frequent in the general population and classically present with palpitations, dyspnea, or presyncope, though they may be asymptomatic as well; this aligns with the patient's description of a "missed" beat due to the pause after the premature beat [^115X2Kgw] [^113zYsFi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: palpitations are the symptom and PVCs are one cause, but premature atrial contractions (PACs) and other rhythms can also generate palpitations; any arrhythmia — including sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, PACs, and PVCs — may produce this perception, so I need to ensure I differentiate the symptom from its potential causes before labeling it as PVC-related [^1115kjhj].

> I should double-check the strength of the symptom–rhythm correlation. In practice, a direct link between reported palpitations and concurrent PVCs can be established only in a subset of patients; this uncertainty argues for ambulatory ECG monitoring to document the rhythm during symptoms — 2‑week event monitoring often yields the best diagnostic value-to-cost ratio — and it cautions me against attributing all "skips" to PVCs without evidence [^113EP5iU] [^1118sHiU] [^1149AAg9].

> Putting this together, I will state the answer clearly while keeping the distinction intact. The medical term for the felt "skipped beat" is palpitations, and the most common underlying rhythm disturbance producing that sensation is a premature beat — typically a premature ventricular contraction — causing a compensatory pause that the patient perceives as a "skip", although other premature beats like PACs can do the same and confirmation with rhythm monitoring is prudent when clinically indicated [^117FV3aX] [^115X2Kgw] [^1118sHiU] [^1115kjhj] [^113zYsFi].

The sensation of the heart "skipping a beat" is called **palpitations** [^117FV3aX], most often due to **premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)** [^113zYsFi] or premature atrial contractions (PACs) [^1115kjhj]. These are usually benign in healthy people, but frequent PVCs (> 10% of beats) [^113hZL1R] can cause **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy** [^111pt3zp] and warrant evaluation. Initial workup includes a **12-lead ECG** [^1118sHiU] and ambulatory monitoring [^115kUCad]; echocardiography [^112JSatt] is indicated if structural heart disease is suspected [^117NybjZ]. Management is based on symptoms and underlying disease, ranging from reassurance [^115X2Kgw] to beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics [^113d2K4T], or catheter ablation [^11491S1z].

## Medical terminology

- **Palpitations**: The general term for awareness of irregular, skipped, or extra heartbeats [^117FV3aX] [^1115kjhj].
- **Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)**: Early ventricular beats causing a pause and a "skipped beat" sensation [^113zYsFi].
- **Premature atrial contractions (PACs)**: Early atrial beats that can also feel like skipped beats [^1115kjhj].

---

## Clinical significance

PVCs and PACs are common and usually benign in healthy individuals; however, **frequent PVCs** (> 10% of beats) [^113hZL1R] can cause **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy** [^113gXhT5] and warrant evaluation.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **12-lead ECG**: Initial test to detect arrhythmias and structural or ischemic heart disease [^1118sHiU].
- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Holter or event monitors [^1118sHiU] to correlate symptoms with arrhythmias [^115kUCad].
- **Echocardiography**: Indicated if structural heart disease is suspected [^117NybjZ] [^112JSatt].

---

## Management strategies

- **Reassurance and lifestyle modification**: For benign cases without structural heart disease [^115X2Kgw].
- **Medications**: Beta-blockers [^1128t4Fk] or antiarrhythmics for symptomatic or frequent PVCs [^113d2K4T].
- **Catheter ablation**: For symptomatic or frequent PVCs, especially with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.

---

The sensation of the heart "skipping a beat" is called **palpitations**, most often from PVCs or PACs; they are usually benign but frequent PVCs can cause cardiomyopathy and should be evaluated and managed according to symptoms and underlying disease [^111pt3zp].

### Diagnostic approach to palpitations [^1115kjhj]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpitations — sensations of a rapid or irregular heartbeat — are most often caused by cardiac arrhythmias or anxiety. Most patients with arrhythmias do not complain of palpitations. However, any arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations should be considered potentially more serious if they are associated with dizziness, near-syncope, or syncope. Nonarrhythmic cardiac problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, and congestive heart failure, as well as noncardiac problems like hyperthyroidism, vasovagal syncope, and hypoglycemia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations can also result from stimulant drugs, and over-the-counter and prescription medications. No cause for the palpitations can be found in up to 16 percent of patients.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is usually indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.

### Palpitations: Evaluation, management, and wearable smart devices [^1118sHiU]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

For the diagnostic investigations of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in the evaluation of palpitations, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a 12-lead ECG as part of the initial assessment. This helps screen for structural and ischemic heart disease, conduction disorders, and arrhythmias. It is important to recognize that ambulatory ECG monitoring for two weeks provides the highest diagnostic yield-to-cost ratio when evaluating palpitations of unknown etiology.

### Evaluation and management of premature ventricular complexes [^113zYsFi]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are extremely common, found in the majority of individuals undergoing long-term ambulatory monitoring. Increasing age, a taller height, higher blood pressure, history of heart disease, less physical activity, and smoking each predict a greater PVC frequency. Although the fundamental causes of PVCs remain largely unknown, potential mechanisms for any given PVC include triggered activity, automaticity, and reentry. PVCs are commonly asymptomatic but can also result in palpitations, dyspnea, presyncope, and fatigue.

- **Diagnosis and evaluation**: The history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG are each critical to the diagnosis and evaluation of a PVC. An echocardiogram is indicated in the presence of symptoms or particularly frequent PVCs, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is helpful when the evaluation suggests the presence of associated structural heart disease. Ambulatory monitoring is required to assess PVC frequency.

- **Prognosis and treatment**: The prognosis of those with PVCs is variable, with ongoing uncertainty regarding the most informative predictors of adverse outcomes. An increased PVC frequency may be a risk factor for heart failure and death, and the resolution of systolic dysfunction after successful catheter ablation of PVCs demonstrates that a causal relationship can be present. Patients with no or mild symptoms, a low PVC burden, and normal ventricular function may be best served with simple reassurance. Either medical treatment or catheter ablation is considered first-line therapy in most patients with PVCs associated with symptoms or reduced life quality.

Regarding medical management for ventricular arrhythmias, specifically the management of premature ventricular complexes, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of β-blockers, nondihydropyridine CCBs, or flecainide. This recommendation applies when catheter ablation is not available, desired, or is particularly risky in symptomatic patients with idiopathic VT/premature ventricular complexes originating from the right ventricular outflow tract or the left fascicles.

### Premature ventricular contraction diurnal profiles predict distinct clinical characteristics and beta-blocker responses [^1147Ln91]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Low credibility.

Frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can lead to symptoms such as cardiomyopathy and increased mortality. Beta-blockers are recommended as first-line therapy to reduce PVC burden; however, the response is unpredictable. The objective of this study is to determine whether PVC diurnal-variability patterns are associated with different clinical profiles and predict drug response.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with frequent PVCs (burden ≥ 1%) referred for Holter monitoring between 2014 and 2016 were included. Follow-up Holters, when available, were assessed after beta-blocker initiation to assess response (≥ 50% reduction). Patients were divided into three groups based on the relationship between hourly PVC count and mean heart rate (HR) during each of the 24 Holter hours: (1) fast-HR-dependent-PVC (F-HR-PVC) for positive correlation (Pearson, P < 0.05), (2) slow-HR-dependent-PVC (S-HR-PVC) for a negative correlation, and (3) independent-HR-PVC (I-HR-PVC) when no correlation was found.

- **Results**: Of the 416 patients included, 50.2% had F-HR-PVC, 35.6% I-HR-PVC, and 14.2% S-HR-PVC with distinct clinical profiles. Beta-blocker therapy was successful in 34.0% of patients overall. Patients with F-HR-PVC had a decrease in PVC burden (18.8 ± 10.4% to 9.3 ± 6.6%, P < 0.0001; 62% success), I-HR-PVC had no change (18.4 ± 17.9% to 20.6 ± 17.9%, P = 0.175; 0% success), whereas S-HR-PVC had an increase in burden (14.6 ± 15.3% to 20.8 ± 13.8%, P = 0.016; 0% success). The correlation coefficient was the only predictor of beta-blocker success (AUC = 0.84, sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 6%).

The study suggests that the correlation coefficient can predict the response to beta-blocker therapy in patients with different PVC diurnal-variability patterns.

### Mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of outflow tract tachycardia [^111mcSo9]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia is a generic term for a spectrum of arrhythmias that occur in the absence of structural heart disease or ion channelopathy. These arrhythmias include monomorphic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and sustained VT. Most idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias originate from the right and left ventricular outflow tracts and include sites accessed from the aortic sinuses of Valsalva. Outflow tract arrhythmia is identified by an electrocardiographic pattern consistent with a left bundle branch block inferior axis morphology. Characteristically, outflow tract VT is caused by cAMP-mediated triggered activity and is terminated by administration of adenosine. Outflow tract arrhythmias are focal and, therefore, are readily amenable to definitive treatment with catheter-based radiofrequency ablation. Although arrhythmia might be associated with reversible PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy, and infrequently with PVC-induced polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation, prognosis is generally favorable.

### Detection of concealed structural heart disease by imaging in patients with apparently idiopathic premature ventricular complexes: A review of current literature [^111ZNQeq]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Longstanding frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) may cause left ventricular (LV) impairment in up to 7% of cases of otherwise unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy. The development of LV adverse remodeling and dysfunction requires several years before becoming clinically manifest; thus, patients with persistent frequent PVCs should be monitored annually for LV function by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), even if completely asymptomatic. A daily PVC burden between 16% and 24% of all heartbeats has been associated with progressive LV dysfunction. However, subtle myocardial mechanical dysfunction detected by speckle tracking echocardiography has been reported even in patients with a PVC burden as low as 4%.

- **PVC morphology and burden**: Left bundle-branch block (LBBB) PVC-QRS morphology and longer PVC-QRS duration (> 150 ms), as well as an epicardial origin of PVCs, require a lower arrhythmic burden to develop LV dysfunction. This corroborates the hypothesis of mechanical dyssynchrony as the main mechanism of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, narrower PVCs originating from endocardial sites close to the Purkinje network, such as the basal septum or left bundle branch fascicles, are rarely responsible for LV dysfunction due to the less dyssynchronous effect upon ventricular contraction.

In patients presenting with frequent PVCs and LV dysfunction, differentiating between reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy manifesting with frequent PVCs is challenging. Typically, a definitive diagnosis is possible only on a retrospective basis by demonstration of reversible LV dysfunction after effective suppression of PVCs.

### Depressive symptoms and risk factors in Chinese patients with premature ventricular contractions without structural heart disease [^114v5sJY]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Our objective was to study depressive symptoms and potential risk factors in Chinese persons with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) without structural heart disease.

The Zung self-rating depression scale (ZSDS) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Correlations between depressive symptoms and sociodemographic and medical factors were analyzed by logistic regression.

Prevalence of depressive symptoms in coronary heart disease (CHD) is higher than in the general population and those with the majority of other chronic symptoms in patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

Of 1,144 patients with PVCs (488 males, 656 females), aged 51 ± 23 years, with disease duration ranging from 1 month to 23 years, a total of 309 (27%) patients were categorized as having depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms increased with age, income, education level, nationality, PVC count/24h, social support, and settlement type (p < 0.05). Univariate logistic regression showed that being female, level of education, age, settlement type, and PVC count/24h significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that five variables — female sex, education level, settlement type, age, and PVC count/24h — were significantly and independently related to depressive symptoms (p < 0.05).

In the Chinese population, depressive symptoms in subjects with PVCs were frequent. The village settlement type, female sex, age, PVC count/24h, and education level were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Further research is warranted in this area.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^113EP5iU]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 214 patients were enrolled in this study, with 92 (43.0%) males. The mean age was 56.6 ± 17.2 years. The demographic and clinical characteristics are available in Table 1.

- **ECG characteristics related to PVCs**: In these patients, the mean total number of PVCs was 12,828 beats/24 h (IQR, 5,986–22,219), and the mean PVC burden was 13.0% (IQR, 5.9%–21.3%). The ECG characteristics of PVCs can be found in Table 2.

- **Findings of palpitations assessment and comparative analysis between groups**: According to the face-to-face consultations, 124 out of 214 patients (57.9%) experienced palpitation symptoms within the last month, while the remaining 90 patients (42.1%) did not report any palpitations. The symptomatic group had a higher proportion of females (63.7% vs. 47.8%; p = .020), a lower proportion of subjects aged 20 years or younger, and a higher proportion of subjects aged 21–65 years (≤ 20 years: 2.4% vs. 10.0%; 21–65 years: 64.5% vs. 50.0%; > 65 years: 33.1% vs. 40.0%; p = .019). There was also a higher proportion of subjects taking β-blockers (37.9% vs. 17.8%; p = .001), a higher proportion of subjects with anxiety (44.4% vs. 14.4%; p = .000), and longer disease courses (28 [16–74] vs. 17 [12–38] months; p = .002). The comparisons between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups are summarized in Table 3.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^114nausy]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

A direct relationship between palpitations and PVCs could be established only in a minority of patients with frequent PVCs. Therefore, when making treatment decisions, it is important to carefully investigate the correlation between symptoms and arrhythmias. PVCs with a relatively short PVC CI and a long post‐PVC CI were more likely to cause palpitations, whereas palpitations lasting only a few seconds were more likely to be directly relevant to PVCs.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving Holter monitoring [^114DQvk6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Recent data suggest that premature ventricular contraction (PVC) suppression can not only improve left ventricular systolic function but, more importantly, it can improve survival in patients with PVC-cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM). However, the prevalence of frequent and high-burden PVCs and cardiomyopathy (CM) and its demographics in these populations remain unclear. Our study reports the prevalence of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under 50%, recognizing sex differences with different PVC burdens and the lack of LVEF assessment in patients at risk of developing PVC-CM with more than 10% burden.

In contrast to the general study cohort, the length of ambulatory ECG Holter monitors in the general study cohort with LVEF less than 50% showed a higher percentage of patients with PVC burden greater than 10% in 14-day ECG monitors compared to shorter 24- and 48-hour monitors. This is consistent with prior publications reporting a minimum of a 7-day Holter monitor to adequately identify high-burden PVCs. Moreover, the older age in the 14-day Holter monitor in the general study cohort is likely driven primarily by a higher number of veterans, likely based on institutional preference for longer ambulatory ECG Holter monitors.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113HNpzE]. Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dilated cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the AHA 2016 guidelines recommend considering offering radiofrequency ablation in patients with premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy.

### Hemodynamic consequences of premature ventricular contractions: Association of mechanical bradycardia and postextrasystolic potentiation with premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^112seRsY]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

The relationships between hemodynamic consequences of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and the development of premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM) have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to correlate concealed mechanical bradycardia and/or postextrasystolic potentiation (PEP) to PVC-CM.

Invasive arterial pressure measurements from 17 patients with PVC-CM and 16 controls with frequent PVCs were retrospectively analyzed. PVCs were considered efficient (ejecting PVCs) when generating a measurable systolic arterial pressure. PEP was defined by a systolic arterial pressure of the post-PVC beat being ≥ 5 mm Hg higher than the preceding sinus beat. Every PVC was analyzed for 10 minutes before ablation, and the electromechanical index (EMi = number of ejecting PVCs/total PVC) and postextrasystolic potentiation index (PEPi = number of PVCs with PEP/total PVC) were calculated.

- **Results**: EMi was 29% ± 31% in PVC-CM and 78% ± 20% in controls (P < 0.0001). PEPi was 41% ± 28% in PVC-CM and 14% ± 10% in controls (P = 0.001). There was no control in groups of low EMi or high PEPi. EMi and PEPi were not significantly correlated to left ventricular dimensions or function in PVC-CM patients. PVC coupling interval was related to both ejecting PVCs and PEP.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with PVC-CM more often display nonejecting PVCs and PEP compared to controls.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving Holter monitoring [^114xzxHY]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

A high burden of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may be associated with the development of cardiomyopathy (CM) and heart failure, referred to as PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy (PVC‐CM). However, the presence of PVCs in an abnormal heart can represent a mere consequence of the underlying (unrelated) CM ("bystander PVCs"), or as mentioned, it may represent the main etiology of the newly diagnosed CM (i.e. PVC‐CM), or a secondary mechanism that worsens the original ventricular dysfunction ("superimposed PVC‐CM"). Although several studies have tried to elucidate some of its pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors, this clinical entity still faces several unmet clinical needs.

Currently, a PVC burden (percentage of PVCs) greater than 15% is considered a strong predictor for the development of PVC‐CM. However, there is no clear consensus on the PVC burden required to produce invariably "deleterious effects" to the heart. Undoubtedly, this distinction has treatment implications. Furthermore, it is unclear what the prevalence of frequent PVCs (> 5% burden), high PVC burden (> 10%), and PVC‐CM is in the general population.

The first step would be to estimate the prevalence of frequent PVCs with and without left-ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in a cohort of patients undergoing ambulatory Holter monitors. The purpose of this study was to understand the prevalence of LV systolic dysfunction and frequent PVCs and describe their demographic profiles in consecutive patients receiving ambulatory ECG monitors.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^117BLvzM]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

In patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), palpitations may not always be directly caused by PVCs. Therefore, it is essential to establish symptom-rhythm correlations to determine the appropriate treatment. This study aims to analyze the palpitations and related factors in patients with frequent PVCs.

The study enrolled patients with frequent PVCs who were not combined with other arrhythmias or structural heart disease. Through face-to-face consultation, patients were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. For symptomatic patients, the correlation between palpitations and PVC was further evaluated based on the temporal consistency of symptom onset and PVC occurrence. The demographic, clinical, and electrocardiogram features of the patients in each group were compared.

Of the 214 patients enrolled, 124 (57.9%) experienced palpitations. Compared to the asymptomatic group, the symptomatic group had a higher proportion of females (63.7% vs. 47.8%; p = .020) and a higher proportion of subjects with anxiety (44.4% vs. 14.4%; p = .000). Within the symptomatic patients, 72 (33.60%) who had palpitations that were clearly correlated with PVCs were classified as the PVC-relevant group. In this group, the PVC CI ratios were significantly lower (55% [52% −60%] vs. 62% [55% −67%]; p = .001) and the Post-PVC CI were longer (1170 [1027–1270] vs. 1083 [960–1180] ms; p = .018) than in the PVC-irrelevant group.

A direct relationship between palpitations and PVCs could be established only in a minority of cases.

### The teenager with palpitations [^115fsqra]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Palpitations can result from cardiac awareness (increased conscious perception of the heart beating) or from a fast or irregular cardiac rhythm. Most causes for palpitations in teenagers can be diagnosed with minimal testing. Patients with an abnormal ECG, non-sinus tachycardia, abnormal cardiac examination, concerning family history, or palpitations associated with activity or syncope should be referred to a pediatric cardiologist. This article discusses the evaluation, testing, and management of teenagers with palpitations and provides a general guideline for referral for subspecialty evaluation.

### Evaluation and management of arrhythmia in the athletic patient [^117NF1B7]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Athletes may present with palpitations, syncope, or arrest resulting in the diagnosis of arrhythmia or screening may result in diagnosis of conditions with predisposition to arrhythmia. This chapter focuses on three common arrhythmic conditions in athletes: atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and the athlete with an implanted device.

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Most studies show that atrial fibrillation is more common in competitive athletes, particularly those participating in long-term endurance sports. Postulated mechanisms include morphologic changes such as atrial dilatation, autonomic changes such as increased vagal tone, or inflammatory changes due to sports participation. Treatment options include long-term antiarrhythmic agents, "pill in the pocket" medications, or radiofrequency ablation, a highly successful procedure in athletes.

- **Premature ventricular contractions**: Data conflict on whether the incidence of PVCs is increased in highly trained individuals. Very frequent PVCs in athletes, however, can be a manifestation of underlying heart disease, and athletes presenting with PVCs should undergo evaluation. In the absence of underlying heart disease, PVCs do not carry a poor prognosis, and US guidelines do not recommend restriction from sports.

- **Implanted devices**: The safety of sports for the athlete with an implanted device is unknown and guidelines recommend against participation in vigorous competitive sports based on postulated risks including failure to defibrillate and risk of injury. Many athletes with defibrillators and…

### Idiopathic malignant premature ventricular contractions [^117L638C]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in patients with structurally normal hearts was once considered a benign phenomenon. However, in susceptible patients, these "benign" or idiopathic PVCs may develop malignant potential, trigger ventricular fibrillation, and result in sudden cardiac death. Alternatively, idiopathic PVCs can also induce cardiomyopathy. Clinical recognition of these entities can lead to effective targeted therapy. In the first instance, treatment consists of ablating the PVC source and implanting a defibrillator, whereas in the second scenario, ablating the PVC origin can normalize left ventricular function.

### "Quick flutter skip": Midlife women's descriptions of palpitations [^112ktZ8o]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe peri- and postmenopausal women's experiences of palpitations, including quality, frequency, severity, distress, duration, temporal pattern, aura, associated symptoms, and aggravating/alleviating factors, as well as their related healthcare experiences.

Qualitative descriptive methods were used. Semistructured interviews were conducted with women who reported palpitations and were enrolled in a larger case-control pilot study comparing electrocardiographic results between women with and without palpitations. Authors analyzed women's narratives using standard content analytic procedures.

Fourteen participants (mean age, 54.5 years [SD = 4.8 years]; range, 46–62 years; 79% postmenopausal) completed interviews. The interviews revealed that women:

- **Describing palpitations**: Often had difficulty describing their palpitations until prompted by the interviewer.
- **Variations in quality and dimensions**: Experienced noteworthy variations in the quality and other dimensions of their palpitations.
- **Healthcare experiences**: Had a wide variety of healthcare experiences related to their palpitations, including not reporting their symptoms to providers, having providers dismiss their symptoms, and having providers be aware of their symptoms and provide diagnostic tests.
- **Worst case scenarios**: At times, created worst case scenarios (downward shifts) under which they would seek treatment for their palpitations, thus enabling them to minimize their symptoms and avoid healthcare.

This study advances understanding of how women describe their palpitations and related healthcare experiences. Findings could have implications for building re

### Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in young athletes [^116438sN]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

There is a growing body of literature focusing on the morphology, management, and outcomes of PVCs in athletes. This review summarizes this literature and establishes recommendations on management, treatment, and indications for specialist referral in this patient population. The sports medicine physician's responses and recommendations should be made in conjunction with the athlete's wishes. Medications or ablations are not always necessary for all athletes if they are followed with regular evaluations.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^114vZTBx]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is one of the most common arrhythmias. It has been detected in 40%–75% of apparently healthy individuals through 24–48 hour Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. In a study conducted in China, among patients who underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring due to palpitations, 67.7% had PVCs, and 7.7% had frequent PVCs. Because the vast majority of PVC patients without noticeable cardiac structural abnormalities have a good prognosis, according to existing guidelines, the treatment of PVC is mainly based on the presence or absence of symptoms. The usual symptom of PVCs is palpitations, characterized by awareness of the heartbeat and described as unpleasant pulsations or sensations of movement in the chest and/or adjacent areas.

There is a broad range of causes and underlying diseases associated with palpitations, including cardiac arrhythmia, structural heart diseases, psychosomatic disorders, and systemic diseases. Although arrhythmia is often the cause of palpitations, studies have shown only a weak relationship between palpitations and cardiac irregularities through ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Some patients with PVC may experience palpitations, while others may be completely asymptomatic. On the other hand, for symptomatic patients, palpitations may not necessarily be directly relevant to PVCs themselves. It is essential to assess palpitations and establish symptom‐rhythm correlations to determine the appropriate treatment for PVCs. Further in‐depth research is needed in this area. This observational study aims…

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: The reunion of distant relatives [^115JMp2V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Perhaps more technical and hypothetical follow-up questions to the study by Lee et al. are regarding specific PVC characteristics. Previous research has focused on PVC characteristics to help us differentiate high-risk features that pose a more malignant risk for cardiomyopathy, including origin (epicardial), QRS width, and coupling interval. Is there an association between a PVC anatomical location and new-onset AF? Did participants with new AF and moderate to high burden of PVCs have monomorphic, or polymorphic PVCs? May there be a similar relationship with AF incidence? Although PVC anatomical location can be a point of debate among electrophysiologists, establishing a relationship between the risk of AF and PVC anatomical location would further risk stratify patients and may support screening decisions.

The authors looked at a cohort in the highest PVC burden group (defined as > 10,000 a day) that received successful catheter ablation, compared them with the index study cohort with the highest PVC burden, and found a trend in lower development of AF (not statistically significant). This raises the following important key question: Could PVCs be a modifiable risk factor for AF? The authors speculate that PVC ablation may be a possible adjuvant strategy for AF ablation, which could eliminate all potential AF triggers. Without a doubt, this statement begs further data and analysis; yet, it may influence our use of continuous monitoring post-AF ablation to screen for PVCs and may represent one missing piece of the AF ablation recurrence puzzle.

### Palpitations: Evaluation, management, and wearable smart devices [^114p7iAK]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for atrial flutter, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of palpitations, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a 12-lead ECG as part of the initial evaluation of patients with palpitations to screen for structural and ischemic heart disease, conduction disorders, and arrhythmias. Recognize that ambulatory ECG monitoring for 2 weeks has the highest diagnostic yield-to-cost ratio in the evaluation of palpitations of unknown etiology.

### Clinical presentation of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia without cardiac arrest [^113pDVhJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Of note, heart rate upon presentation did not differ significantly between the two groups (165 ± 26 beats/min during VT versus 171 ± 32 beats/min during SVT; P = 0.16). Symptomatology, however, significantly differed: While 90.7% of patients presenting with SVT reported having palpitations, only 8.8% of the patients with VT reported this symptom (P < 0.001). Chest pain was the chief complaint among patients with VT (reported by 64%, of which 71% was angina‐type chest pain). In contrast, only 11% of the SVT group had chest pain. Other common symptoms in the VT group included presyncope (27%) and shortness of breath (21%).

Three disagreements between the electrophysiologists examining the ECG tracings required an electrophysiological study in three patients: all three were diagnosed with a VT (none had palpitations). There was no correlation between the type of symptoms and the heart rate. Similarly, there was no correlation between the symptomatology and the underlying heart disease (e.g. nonischemic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic VT). Atrioventricular dissociation was found in the ECG tracings of four patients with VT; palpitations were reported in three of them.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^1168tfwj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Out of the symptomatic patients, 72 (33.60%) with palpitations that had been demonstrated to be clearly correlated with PVCs were classified as the PVC-relevant group, and the other 52 (24.30%) with palpitations that were not definitely related to PVCs as the PVC-irrelevant group (Figure 1). The only difference in the clinical characteristics between the two groups was the duration of the palpitation.

- **Clinical characteristics**: In the PVC-relevant group, more patients experienced palpitations that lasted only a few seconds (29.2% vs. 11.5%; p = .027). In addition, a higher proportion of patients took antiarrhythmic drugs (33.3% vs. 13.5%; p = .012).

- **ECG features**: A comparison of ECG features between the two groups revealed significantly lower PVC CI ratios (55% [52% −60%] vs. 62% [55% −67%]; p = .001) and longer post-PVC CI (1170 [1027–1270] vs. 1083 [960–1180] ms; p = .018) in the PVC-relevant group.

The comparisons between the PVC-relevant and PVC-irrelevant groups are presented in Table 4.

### Catheter ablation of premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^112mZNhT]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old female presented with a long history of chest pain, palpitations, and increasing dyspnea. Electrocardiography and 24-hour Holter monitoring revealed multiple premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), and echocardiography demonstrated significant left ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment. After further investigation, it was concluded that this cardiomyopathy was secondary to the observed multiple PVCs and that these represented a potential target for treatment.

- **Investigations**: Electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, 24-hour Holter monitoring, coronary angiography, tilt testing, and invasive electrophysiological testing using a multielectrode array catheter.

- **Diagnosis**: PVC-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.

- **Management**: Electrophysiological mapping and cryoablation of the focus of the ventricular ectopy.

### Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs): A narrative review [^115X2Kgw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs) are relatively common, occurring in 3%-20% of the general population, and are often found during the work-up of palpitations or incidentally on routine electrocardiographic testing. They are usually considered benign but can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease and cause significantly impairing symptoms. While often thought of as a problem for the cardiologist, it is not uncommon for PVCs to be identified initially in a primary care or inpatient general medicine setting. This paper reviews the etiologies, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of PVCs for the internist.

### Predictive value of history taking and physical examination in diagnosing arrhythmias in general practice [^1137G5xx]. Family Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Palpitations and light-headedness are common symptoms that may be indicative of cardiac arrhythmias. Effective triage by the GP might prevent delayed treatment or inappropriate referrals. The aim of this study was to determine the capability of GPs to assess the presence of cardiac arrhythmias and to identify which signs and symptoms are used in predicting the presence of arrhythmias and which are actually related to the presence of arrhythmias.

- **Methods**: A consecutive cohort of 127 patients presenting with palpitations and/or light-headedness to 41 GPs in the Netherlands underwent physical examination, patient history, and standard electrocardiogram. The GPs' estimation of the probability of patients having an arrhythmia was compared with the diagnostic result of 30 days of continuous event recording (CER). We assessed discriminating factors that can assist a GP in diagnosing an arrhythmia.

- **Results**: No correlation was found between the GPs' assessment of risk and actual diagnoses. GPs were more likely to predict an arrhythmia in patients who suffer from hypertension (P = 0.049) or those with a history of cardiovascular disease (P = 0.006). Vasovagal symptoms [odds ratio (OR) = 2.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–7.6] and bradycardia (OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.3–14.0) were significantly more common in patients with a CER diagnosis of arrhythmia.

- **Conclusion**: Prediction of arrhythmias by GPs based on history taking and physical examination alone is not accurate. These parameters are insufficient to decide which patients need further diagnostic evaluation.

### An 18-dof hand integrating force-position multimodal perception using a monocular camera [^114bDFwL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To assess the dexterous hand's ability to synergistically perceive angle and position, we conducted experiments with grasping a tennis ball. During the experiment, a camera on the forearm tracked the displacement of all markers in real-time (Fig. 4d), enabling simultaneous monitoring of the joint angles (Fig. 4e) and the five fingertips' positions (Fig. 4f). The dexterity of the VMS hand was evaluated in the standardized Feix GRASP taxonomy test (see Supplementary Movie 5). The VMS hand successfully implemented 33 grasping modes (Fig. 4g), including precise grasping operations requiring fingertip coordination, such as pen holding, egg pinching, and chopstick manipulation. All grasping tasks were stably executed via feedforward-feedback closed-loop control based on predefined joint angle configurations, demonstrating the system's adaptability in multi-scenario grasping applications.

- **External force perception experiment**: Relying only on the information provided by the internal vision of the forearm, the VMS hand can detect contact and also provide real-time feedback on the external torques at the joints and external forces at the fingertips. To evaluate the external perception capabilities of the hand, we conducted three parts of experiments: contact detection, contact force evaluation, and object rotation experiments.

	- The plate was positioned above a six-dimensional force sensor, enabling the sensor to reflect changes in force during fingertip contact with the plate. Simultaneously, the actuation-perception forearm transmits and processes data in real-time to the tendon-based system, facilitating effective dynamic response and adaptation in force-driven tasks.

### Impact of QRS duration of frequent premature ventricular complexes on the development of cardiomyopathy [^1118PeaQ]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are at risk of developing reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (rPVC-CMP). Not all determinants of rPVC-CMP are known.

- **Objective**: To assess the impact of the QRS duration of PVCs on the development of rPVC-CMP.

- **Methods**: In a consecutive series of 294 patients with frequent idiopathic PVCs referred for PVC ablation, the width of the PVC-QRS complex was assessed. The QRS width was correlated with the presence of rPVC-CMP.

- **Results**: The PVC-QRS width was significantly greater in patients with rPVC-CMP than in patients without rPVC-CMP (164 ± 20 ms vs 149 ± 17 ms; P < .001). A PVC-QRS width of ≥ 150 ms best differentiated patients with and without rPVC-CMP (area under the curve 0.66; sensitivity 80%; specificity 52%). The PVC burden for developing rPVC-CMP is significantly lower in patients with a PVC-QRS width of ≥ 150 ms than in patients with a narrower PVC-QRS complex (22% ± 13% vs 28% ± 12%; P < .0001).

- **Conclusion**: Broader PVCs and an epicardial PVC origin are associated with the development of rPVC-CMP independent of the PVC burden.

### Diagnostic yield of automatic and patient-triggered ambulatory cardiac event recording in the evaluation of patients with palpitations, dizziness, or syncope [^115kUCad]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that patient-triggered cardiac event recorders (CER) have an increased diagnostic yield and are more cost-effective than conventional 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs) for the evaluation of sporadic, potentially arrhythmia-related symptoms.

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic yield of a patient-triggered CER combined with continuous automatic arrhythmia detection in the evaluation of sporadic dizziness/syncope or palpitations and its clinical relevance in assessing further management.

We investigated 101 consecutive outpatients (54 ± 20 years, 40 women) referred for evaluation of sporadic dizziness and syncope (36%) or palpitations (64%) of suspected rhythmogenic origin. All were monitored by patient-triggered CER with continuous automatic arrhythmia detection.

After a mean monitoring period of 103 ± 38 hours, 83 patients registered symptoms, and 57 patients had diagnostic or therapeutically relevant arrhythmias (relA). A total of 196 episodes of relA were recorded; 31 (16%) episodes were patient-triggered and 165 (84%) automatically recorded. Diagnostic relevant episodes (relA and/or typical symptoms) occurred in 94 patients, in 54% after the first 24 hours of monitoring. According to the results of the CER, 80 patients needed no further diagnostic evaluation, while 20 underwent additional diagnostic tests.

Cardiac event recorders with a continuous automatic arrhythmia detection function are a well-tolerated device for sporadic, potentially arrhythmia-related symptoms.

### A randomized controlled trial of a brief educational and psychological intervention for patients presenting to a cardiac clinic with palpitation [^114yBhvC]. Psychological Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether a brief psycho-educational intervention reduced disability in patients with benign palpitation.

- **Method**: In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial within a cardiology clinic at a district general hospital, 80 consecutive patients diagnosed as having benign palpitation — either palpitation due to awareness of extrasystoles or sinus rhythm — with associated distress or disability were randomized to an intervention group (usual care plus nurse-delivered intervention based on cognitive-behavioral principles) or to a control group (usual care). The principal outcome was the difference in the proportion of participants with good or excellent researcher-rated activity levels at 3 months. Subsidiary outcomes were self-rated symptoms, distress and disability, and researcher-rated unmet treatment needs.

- **Results**: The principal outcome showed a statistically and clinically significant benefit for the intervention group, with a number needed to treat of 3 (95% CIs 2 to 7). All but one subsidiary outcomes also showed a difference in favor of the intervention group, and several differences reached statistical significance. Significantly more of the control group had unmet treatment needs at 3 months.

- **Conclusions**: A brief, nurse-delivered, psycho-educational intervention was an effective treatment for benign palpitation. Further evaluation, including assessment of cost-effectiveness, is needed. The findings have applications to the care of patients presenting with other types of 'unexplained' medical symptoms.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^116XFDrW]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

In the comparison of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, although there was no difference in average age, the proportion of symptomatic patients was significantly lower in those under 20 years of age, with only 3 out of 12 (25%) having palpitations. This is generally consistent with the results of previous studies. On the other hand, in the 21–65 age group, the proportion of symptomatic patients was obviously higher. In this age group, no significant difference in proportion was found when comparing patients in the PVC-relevant group with those in the PVC-irrelevant group, indicating that palpitations were more likely to be caused by reasons other than PVC.

Liang et al. discovered that 27% of patients with PVCs had depression, which is similar to the 32% in our group. In this study, anxiety was significantly more prevalent in those with palpitations than in those without. There may be a reciprocal causal relationship between palpitations and depression. Barsky et al. found that 45% of those with palpitations had anxiety or depressive disorder. They also observed that the correlation between palpitations and arrhythmia was weaker in patients with more severe psychiatric symptoms, suggesting that patients with depression and anxiety are more likely to have palpitations unrelated to arrhythmia.

Palpitations experienced by patients with PVCs are not necessarily directly related to PVCs and may be caused by other arrhythmias or non-arrhythmic factors. In the present study, we excluded patients with coexisting other arrhythmias, but the role of sinus tachycardia, a common cause, was not explored.

### Clinical and translational insights on premature ventricular contractions and PVC-induced cardiomyopathy [^116yQ2Kk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The medical community's understanding of the consequences of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and PVC-induced cardiomyopathy has mostly been derived from observational and large population-based studies. Due to the difficulty of predicting the development of PVC-cardiomyopathy, the acute and chronic cardiac effects of PVCs and the mechanism of PVC-cardiomyopathy have been explored through pre-clinical studies with large animal models. Recently, these studies have described myocardial substrates that could potentially increase morbidity and mortality in patients with frequent PVCs and PVC-cardiomyopathy. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date comprehensive review of these pre-clinical and clinical studies.

### Outpatient approach to palpitations [^114D8G6o]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem seen in family medicine; most are of cardiac origin, although an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety, is also common. Even if a psychiatric comorbidity does exist, it should not be assumed that palpitations are of a noncardiac etiology. Discerning cardiac from noncardiac causes is important given the potential risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. History and physical examination followed by targeted diagnostic testing are necessary to distinguish a cardiac cause from other causes of palpitations. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an essential initial diagnostic test. Cardiac imaging is recommended if history, physical examination, or electrocardiography suggests structural heart disease. An intermittent event (loop) monitor is preferred for documenting cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when they occur infrequently. Ventricular and atrial premature contractions are common cardiac causes of palpitations; prognostic significance is dictated by the extent of underlying structural heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia resulting in hospitalization; such patients are at increased risk of stroke. Patients with supraventricular tachycardia, long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, or palpitations associated with syncope should be referred to a cardiologist.

### Electrical management of heart failure: from pathophysiology to treatment [^116mK92N]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions are the most frequent ventricular arrhythmia and are commonly associated with heart failure (HF), ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are recognized as a reversible cause of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction referred to as 'PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy' (PVC-CM), where PVC suppression will improve and even normalize LV function. The prevalence of PVC-CM is estimated between 10% and 29% in patients with frequent PVCs (> 5–10%). While PVC burden is the most consistent predictor of PVC-CM, various factors, including genetics, comorbidities, cardiac phenotype, PVC features, and length of exposure, play a role in the susceptibility or resilience to developing PVC-CM. Additionally, PVCs with a longer QRS duration and epicardial location are more frequently associated with PVC-CM, supporting the role of LV dyssynchrony in PVC-CM.

- **Clinical features and presentation**: Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy can present with or without fatigue, HF symptoms, syncope, and SCD. Frequently, patients are referred for bradycardia due to bigeminy, where heart rate is underestimated (i.e. pseudo-bradycardia) due to the lack of pulse pressure generated by PVCs. The time to develop PVC-CM is unknown, but probably months or years of exposure to frequent PVCs are needed.

Diagnosis of premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy should be suspected if PVC burden is > 5–10%.

### Palpitations: Evaluation, management, and wearable smart devices [^117FV3aX]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common symptom described by patients as a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart, a pounding chest, irregular or skipped heartbeats, or a pounding sensation in the neck. They are associated with a low mortality rate; however, they have been shown to impair quality of life and increase health care use. Common triggers include cardiac disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, medication or illicit drug use, or psychosomatic disorders.

A detailed history, physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and 12-lead electrocardiography are often sufficient to identify the etiology of palpitations. Additional testing may include echocardiography, cardiac stress testing, electrocardiogram monitoring, or electrophysiologic studies to determine whether symptoms correlate with cardiac arrhythmia or structural or ischemic heart disease.

Management of palpitations is based on the suspected etiology. In most cases of cardiac-induced palpitations, treatment may involve reassurance, education, trigger avoidance, or the use of atrioventricular nodal blockers. Tachyarrhythmias may require cardiac ablation. Patients who have palpitations with no arrhythmia causality and no cardiac disease should be reassured; however, screening for psychosomatic disorders should be considered.

Wearable smart devices with ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring technologies are currently available to consumers. These tools have demonstrated diagnostic accuracy for the detection of arrhythmias, allowing patients to have greater participation in their health care.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^113zEgEu]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

In each patient, the standard 12-lead resting ECG was recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec and a voltage gain of 10 mm/mV. The 12-lead Holter ECG was recorded for 24 hours. The ECG recordings were automatically analyzed by computers and manually checked by experienced cardiologists.

The following parameters were collected from the resting ECG:

- **Baseline sinus cycle length (SCL)**: The R-R interval of the sinus beats just before the PVC.
- **PVC coupling interval (CI)**: From the onset of the R wave of the sinus beat immediately before the PVC to the onset of the R wave of the PVC.
- **PVC CI ratio (%)**: PVC CI/SCL × 100%.
- **Post-PVC CI**: From the onset of the R wave of the PVC to the onset of the R wave of the next sinus beat.
- **Post-PVC CI ratio (%)**: Post-PVC CI/SCL × 100%.
- **PVC QRS width**: From the onset of the PVC QRS complex to the end of the S wave.
- **PVC origin**: Based on the morphology of QRS complex, PVCs were distinguished into outflow tract origin (with positive QRS in inferior leads) and non-outflow tract origin (with negative QRS in inferior leads).

For multiple PVCs, we chose to measure ECG parameters with PVCs that predominated in the Holter recordings and were traced in the resting ECG.

### A 52-year-old woman with ventricular tachycardia [^1158nTa1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old woman with shortness of breath and palpitations was referred to a cardiologist. A 24-hour Holter monitor demonstrated a high density (37%) of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and long runs of non-sustained, eventually sustained, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with the same morphology as several VPBs detected in a 12-lead ECG. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, and the patient's evaluation was completed with a functional and gadolinium-enhanced cardiovascular MR (CMR) study to assess structural heart disease. In a follow-up visit, an electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed to identify the origin of VPBs and VT.

### Variation of QRS morphology of premature ventricular contractions originate from the left-ventricular outflow tract during ablation [^116nsHPj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Low credibility.

A 45‐year‐old woman visited our hospital for palpitations due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The QRS morphology of the PVCs was characterized by an r pattern with a notch in lead I, an rS pattern in leads V1 and V2, a QS pattern in leads aVR and aVL, and a precordial transition in lead V3 (Figure 1). On 24‐hour Holter monitor recordings, the PVC burden was 27,834. We decided to perform catheter ablation, as antiarrhythmic medications were not useful for managing this patient's symptomatic PVCs.

### Predictors and possible mechanisms of premature ventricular contraction induced cardiomyopathy [^116bhuVD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). High credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are encountered frequently in clinical practice. While PVCs may have various causes, a small number of individuals with PVCs develop cardiomyopathy in the absence of other potential etiologies. When correctly identified, patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy can experience a dramatic improvement in their condition with appropriate treatment of their PVCs. This focused review discusses potential predictors of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, including PVC frequency, PVC characteristics, and modifiable patient risk factors. Additionally, it reviews proposed mechanisms of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and concludes with future directions for research and clinical practice.

### Missing the beat: Arrhythmia as a presenting feature of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^111gLvWd]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common presenting symptom in patients attending the emergency department; however, eosinophilic infiltration of the myocardium is rarely the cause. This case describes a 77-year-old woman who presents with sudden onset palpitations and is later diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Cardiac involvement occurs in 50% of cases, but heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis, and myocardial infarction are more commonly recognized complications. Arrhythmia is less well described. In this report, we propose eosinophilic inflammation as the precipitant for an aberrant conduction pathway.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving Holter monitoring [^111pCkdk]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), atrial fibrillation, and PVC-related conditions, have emerged as frequent causes of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM) is primarily characterized by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, LV dilatation, eccentric hypertrophy, electrophysiological remodeling, and interstitial fibrosis. Frequently, high-burden PVCs are either underdiagnosed or disregarded as the underlying cause of cardiomyopathy. Understanding the prevalence and coexistence of frequent/high-burden PVCs and LV systolic dysfunction in patients receiving ambulatory Holter monitors would help clinicians grasp their potential relevance. It would also promote their detection and further work-up. Moreover, it provides the needed background to launch further clinical trials of PVCs with and without associated LV dysfunction.

Our study found that frequent (> 5%) and high-burden (> 10%) PVCs are often present in patients (9% and 5%, respectively) undergoing ambulatory ECG monitoring and those with LV systolic dysfunction (26% and 16%, respectively). Males have a higher prevalence of frequent PVCs (> 5% burden) than females, even among those with LV systolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, 15% of males and 21% of females in our study did not have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment to rule out PVC-CM despite documented high-burden PVCs (> 10%). While the mechanisms of PVC-CM are being elucidated, the diagnosis of PVC-CM can be confirmed only upon successful PVC suppression and subsequent LV function restoration.

Due to the significance of the morphology of the ectopic QRS in guiding the diagnostic work-up and risk assessment, comprehensive efforts should be undertaken to accurately characterize the ectopic QRS morphology using a 12-lead resting ECG, an exercise test, or a 12-lead 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring.

- **Coupling interval**: Regardless of QRS morphology, short-coupled PVBs, or PVBs that are superimposed on the preceding T-wave (peak or earlier), should be regarded as a warning sign for myocardial electrical instability due to early/inhomogeneous ventricular repolarization, potentially leading to ventricular fibrillation in the absence of structural heart disease, such as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Athletes with short-coupled PVBs, especially when accompanied by the ECG pattern of inferolateral early repolarization with pronounced terminal QRS slurring, should be referred for evaluation by a specialist through an electrophysiological study.

- **Figure 2**: Coupling interval of premature ventricular beats. This includes the normal coupling interval in a common (infundibular) pattern of premature ventricular beats (A). It also shows short-coupled premature ventricular beats and terminal QRS slurring in the inferolateral leads followed by a flat ST segment in an athlete with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (B).

### Abnormal left ventricular mechanics of ventricular ectopic beats: Insights into origin and coupling interval in premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^116Y3Q7s]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony caused by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) has been proposed as a mechanism of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. We sought to understand the impact of different PVC locations and coupling intervals (prematurity) on LV regional mechanics and global function of the PVC beat itself.

- **Methods and results**: Using our premature pacing algorithm, pentageminal PVCs at coupling intervals of 200 to 375 ms were delivered from the epicardial right ventricular apex, RV outflow tract, and LV free wall, as well as premature atrial contractions from the left atrial appendage at a coupling interval of 200 ms in 7 healthy canines. LV short-axis echocardiographic images, LV stroke volume, and dP/dtmax were obtained during all ectopic beats and ventricular pacing. LV dyssynchrony was assessed by dispersion of QRS-to-peak strain (earliest-last QRS-to-peak strain) between 6 different LV segments during each of the aforementioned beats (GE, EchoPac). LV dyssynchrony was greater during long-coupled rather than short-coupled PVCs and PVCs at 375 ms compared with rapid ventricular pacing at 400 ms (P < 0.0001), whereas no difference was found between PVC locations. Longer PVC coupling intervals were associated with greater stroke volume and dP/dtmax despite more pronounced dyssynchrony (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: PVCs with longer coupling intervals demonstrate more pronounced LV dyssynchrony, whereas PVC location has minimal impact. LV dyssynchrony cannot be attributed to prematurity or abnormal ventricular activation alone, but rather to a combination of factors.

### Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111pt3zp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Arrhythmias coexist in patients with heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions are known to trigger a reversible dilated cardiomyopathy referred to as arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AiCM). It remains unclear why some patients are more prone to develop AiCM despite similar arrhythmia burdens. The challenge is to determine whether arrhythmias are fully, partially, or at all responsible for observed LV dysfunction.

AiCM should be suspected in patients with a mean heart rate > 100 beats/min, atrial fibrillation, and/or a premature ventricular contractions burden of ≥ 10%. Reversal of cardiomyopathy by elimination of the arrhythmia confirms AiCM. Therapeutic choice depends on the culprit arrhythmia, patient comorbidities, and preferences. Following recovery of LV function, patients require continued follow-up if an abnormal myocardial substrate is present. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of AiCM is likely to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes and to reduce hospital admissions and health care spending.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^112GYeyC]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in the management of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend considering catheter ablation or the initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in non-responders to CRT. This is especially relevant for cases with frequent, predominantly monomorphic premature ventricular complexes that limit optimal biventricular pacing despite pharmacological therapy.

### Palpitations in a 64-year-old man [^111GGMro]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old man presented with several weeks of intermittent irregular palpitations. He had no prior history of cardiac disease, hypertension, or syncope. A 12-lead ECG revealed sinus rhythm with premature atrial and ventricular contractions, and high QRS voltages consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac MRI revealed asymmetrical septal hypertrophy and marked mid-myocardial hyperenhancement of the interventricular septum.

### Single catheter approach for treatment of premature ventricular contractions [^114gf9a7]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Catheter ablation has become one of the main treatment strategies in patients with premature ventricular complexes (PVC). Successful mapping and ablation can be performed with an ablation catheter without additional diagnostic catheters.

- **Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that using a single catheter for PVC ablation may decrease complications, procedure time, and fluoroscopy exposure while maintaining comparable success rates.

- **Methods**: Sixty-nine consecutive patients with PVC were treated with a single catheter approach compared to a historical cohort, in which a conventional setup was used. Propensity score matching was conducted with a 1:1 ratio. Outcome parameters included acute procedural success with elimination of all premature ventricular contractions after catheter ablation, procedural data, and complication rates.

- **Results**: Patients treated with a single catheter approach had shorter total procedure times (60 minutes [IQR: 47.5–69.0 minutes] vs. 90 minutes [IQR: 60–120 minutes]; p = 0.001) and fluoroscopy times (218 seconds [IQR: 110.5–446 seconds] vs. 310 seconds [IQR: 190–640 seconds]; p = 0.012), which led to reduced radiation exposure signified by a lower dose area product (155 cGycm² [IQR: 74.4–334.5 cGycm²] vs. 368.4 cGycm² [IQR: 126–905.4 cGycm²]; p = 0.009). Acute procedural success rates were comparable in both groups (54 [84.3%] in the single catheter approach group and 58 [90.6%] in the conventional group; p = 0.287).

- **Conclusion**: A single catheter approach for the treatment of PVC is associated with a reduction of procedure and fluoroscopy times.

### Does this patient with palpitations have a cardiac arrhythmia [^115K1Cdr]. JAMA (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients experience palpitations and seek advice from general practitioners. Differentiating benign causes from those resulting from clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia can be challenging, and the clinical examination may aid in this process.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and cardiac testing for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with palpitations.

- **Data source, study selection, and data extraction**: Searches of MEDLINE (1950 to August 25, 2009) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2009) of English-language articles compared clinical features and diagnostic tests in patients with palpitations with a reference standard for cardiac arrhythmia. Of the 277 studies identified by the search strategy, 7 studies were used for accuracy analysis and 16 studies for diagnostic yield analysis. Two authors independently reviewed articles for study data and quality, and a third author resolved disagreements.

- **Data synthesis**: Most data were obtained from single studies with small sample sizes. A known history of cardiac disease (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–3.11), palpitations affected by sleeping (LR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33–3.94), or occurring while the patient is at work (LR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19–3.96) slightly increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. Conversely, a known history of panic disorder (LR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.01) or palpitations lasting less than 5 minutes (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.63) makes the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia slightly less likely.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^115gGxLq]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ventricular arrhythmias, specifically in the management of premature ventricular complexes, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend against the use of verapamil in pediatric patients under 1 year of age with premature ventricular complexes or ventricular tachycardia. This is particularly emphasized if they exhibit signs of heart failure or concurrently use other antiarrhythmic drugs.

### Palpitations in midlife women: The menopause racing heart pilot study [^1152ZrZo]. Menopause (2025). Low credibility.

Although palpitations are common in midlife women and may have long-term effects on cardiovascular health and longevity, little is known about underlying electrocardiogram findings, real-time palpitations reporting, or correlates. This hypothesis-generating pilot study compared midlife perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with and without palpitations on electrocardiogram findings, real-time palpitations reporting, and potential correlates.

In this prospective, longitudinal, descriptive, comparative pilot study, 15 midlife women with and 15 without palpitations provided data. They wore an ambulatory electrocardiogram patch for 14–28 days, prospectively recorded palpitations via event button presses and daily diaries, recorded vasomotor symptoms in daily diaries, provided blood samples, and completed questionnaires.

There were no group differences in age [Md (IQR) = 56 (50, 59) vs. 55 (53, 57), with an age range of 46 to 62 in both groups] or menopausal status. The palpitations group had significantly lower heart rate variability and longer runs of atrial tachycardia. Button press data indicated that 50% of the palpitations group experienced palpitations (1) one-third or more of all nights in the study, (2) nearly half of all days in the study, or (3) once or more per 24 hours in the study. Symptoms occurred during altered rhythms and normal sinus rhythm, though the latter seemed more common at night. Palpitations reporting was not related to demographics, clinical variables, biomarkers, anxiety, or somatosensory awareness but was related to…

### Clinical recognition of pure premature ventricular complex-induced cardiomyopathy at presentation [^113gXhT5]. Heart Rhythm (2017). High credibility.

Frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can induce or worsen left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical pattern of patients having a "pure PVC-induced" cardiomyopathy at presentation.

- **Methods**: This prospective multicenter study included 155 consecutive patients (age 55 ± 12 years, 96 men [62%], 23% ± 12% mean PVC burden) with LV dysfunction and frequent PVCs submitted for ablation and followed up for at least 12 months. Patients with a previously diagnosed structural heart disease (50 [32%]) and those without complete PVC abolition during follow-up who did not normalize LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (24 [15%]) were excluded from the analysis.

- **Results**: Of the remaining 81 patients, 41 (51%) had a successful sustained ablation, did not have normalized LVEF, and were classified as having PVC-worsened nonischemic cardiomyopathy; 40 (49%) who had normalized LVEF were considered as having pure PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. The latter group had higher baseline PVC burden (27% ± 12% vs. 12% ± 8%; P < 0.01), longer QRS duration (baseline QRS duration: 130 ms), and larger LV dimensions (baseline LV end-diastolic dimension: 63 mm).

- **Conclusion**: Almost half of patients with frequent PVCs and low LVEF of unknown origin normalize LVEF after sustained PVC ablation.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving Holter monitoring [^114Fqq2h]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are frequently observed with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, although the prevalence of these associated conditions in the general population remains unknown. We sought to understand the prevalence of frequent PVCs (defined as PVCs > 5%) and high burden PVCs (defined as PVCs > 10%) along with LV systolic dysfunction in patients receiving ambulatory Holter monitors (HM).

A prospective multicenter (eight US medical centers) cross-sectional study collected demographic and PVC burden data from consecutive patients undergoing 24-hour, 48-hour, and 14-day HM from July 2018 to June 2020. Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) data was collected if obtained within six months of HM. Four PVC burden groups were analyzed based on a 10% burden and stratified by normal LVEF (≥ 50%) or presence of LVEF < 50%.

- **Results**:
	- The prevalence of PVC > 5% and PVC > 10% was 16.4% and 4.2%, respectively, in the population undergoing HM (n = 6529).
	- Significant differences in age were noted between PVC groups. The prevalence of PVC > 5% and PVC > 10% in patients with LVEF < 50% was found to be higher.
	- PVC > 5% was more prevalent in older, male, and Caucasian individuals (p < 0.05). However, women showed a higher prevalence of PVC > 10% compared to males (11% vs. 6%; p < 0.05).

Overall, frequent PVCs and a high burden of PVCs combined with LVEF < 50% are prevalent among patients receiving Holter monitoring.

### Assessment of palpitations in patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions [^113Z111g]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

In patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), palpitations may not always be directly caused by PVCs. Therefore, it is essential to establish symptom-rhythm correlations to determine the appropriate treatment. This study aims to analyze the palpitations and related factors in patients with frequent PVCs.

- **Methods**: The study enrolled patients with frequent PVCs who did not have other arrhythmias or structural heart disease. Through face-to-face consultation, patients were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. For symptomatic patients, the correlation between palpitations and PVCs was further evaluated based on the temporal consistency of symptom onset and PVC occurrence. The demographic, clinical, and electrocardiogram features of the patients in each group were compared.

- **Results**: Of the 214 patients enrolled, 124 (57.9%) experienced palpitations. Compared to the asymptomatic group, the symptomatic group had a higher proportion of females (63.7% vs. 47.8%; p = .020) and a higher proportion of subjects with anxiety (44.4% vs. 14.4%; p = .000). Within the symptomatic patients, 72 (33.60%) who had palpitations that were clearly correlated with PVCs were classified as the PVC-relevant group. In this group, the PVC CI ratios were significantly lower (55% [52% -60%] vs. 62% [55% -67%]; p = .001) and the Post-PVC CI were longer (1170 [1027–1270] vs. 1083 [960–1180] ms; p = .018) than in the PVC-irrelevant group.

- **Conclusion**: A direct relationship between palpitations and PVCs could be established only in a minority of patients.

### Palpitations, arrhythmias, and awareness of cardiac activity [^1149AAg9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Somatic and visceral symptoms have a surprisingly weak relationship to objective measures of tissue pathology. This is exemplified by the poor correlation found between palpitations and cardiac arrhythmias. Many factors other than the extent of the disease influence symptomatic distress. Since symptoms are such a crucial feature of illness and medical practice, much more investigation of these nonbiomedical influences is needed.

Although experimental laboratory paradigms facilitate such investigation, there are problems involved in generalizing from laboratory findings to the reporting of symptoms of disease in daily life. In studying the awareness of cardiac arrhythmias and of resting heartbeat, we have found that the palpitations of patients who somatize more and have more health-related anxiety and psychiatric distress are significantly less likely to be related to demonstrable cardiac arrhythmias than are the palpitations of other patients. The accurate awareness of arrhythmias, however, is not associated with the accurate awareness of resting heartbeat.

Even more surprising, a relatively large proportion of heart transplant recipients are accurately aware of their resting heartbeat. This work poses more questions than it answers, underscoring some of the technical difficulties of conducting research in this area and revealing how little is known about symptom perception, processing, and reporting.
