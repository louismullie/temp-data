## Question

is orvexatide helpful for weight loss

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "orvexatide" helps with weight loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "orvexatide" exists in the provided references and, if not, what the most plausible intended agent is. Then, I should verify the regulatory indication and dose for the likely agent. Next, I will review pivotal efficacy data and head-to-head trials. After that, I need to assess safety and tolerability, including contraindications and dose-escalation strategies. Finally, I should synthesize guidance on long-term use and maintenance, and briefly compare with alternatives such as tirzepatide while noting any uncertainties about the original drug name and emerging combinations or classes.

> Wait, let me verify the drug identity first: "orvexatide" is not mentioned in any of the provided references, which makes me suspect a misspelling or misremembered name; my first thought was exenatide because of the "-tide" ending, but hold on, exenatide is older, twice-daily or weekly, and not the centerpiece of the evidence set here, whereas semaglutide and tirzepatide dominate the high-credibility obesity data in these materials, so I should confirm that semaglutide is the most likely intended agent and keep tirzepatide in view as a comparator.

> Let me first confirm indication and dosing for the probable target, semaglutide: for chronic weight management, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly is used alongside lifestyle intervention with a stepwise titration to mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects; this aligns with the STEP clinical program's framework and guideline recommendations to consider semaglutide in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with weight-related comorbidities [^114hsRUd].

> Next, I should review efficacy from the pivotal program; I need to check the magnitude and durability of weight loss in nondiabetic adults: across 68-week trials in STEP 1, 3, 4, and 8, mean weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was roughly 15% to 17% and substantially higher than placebo, with a meta-analysis showing about 12% relative body-weight reduction and one-third achieving ≥ 20% loss, which is clinically meaningful and consistent across studies [^113hyvNV] [^111hWRbR].

> Hold on, I should verify the head-to-head data versus liraglutide to ensure comparative claims are accurate: STEP 8 showed semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly achieved a 15.8% mean reduction versus 6.4% with liraglutide 3.0 mg daily at 68 weeks, with far more patients reaching ≥ 10% and ≥ 15% loss on semaglutide, confirming superior efficacy within the GLP-1 class under active-comparator conditions [^1136eMcY].

> I will now examine how semaglutide compares with tirzepatide, since dual GLP-1/GIP agonism might matter clinically; direct comparative real-world and meta-analytic data suggest larger weight loss with tirzepatide than semaglutide at one year, with estimates around −15.3% for tirzepatide versus −8.3% for semaglutide in a large cohort and consistent advantages across direct comparisons, indicating tirzepatide may be more potent for weight loss than GLP-1 monotherapy in many patients [^111ZKFqL] [^116fTk3q].

> Now, I need to check safety and tolerability because dose escalation and contraindications drive real-world success; common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, constipation), typically mild-to-moderate and dose-dependent, with low hypoglycemia risk in the absence of insulin/secretagogues, and class labeling includes a contraindication in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2, supporting the need for gradual titration and patient counseling on expected GI effects [^1177KRaM].

> But wait, what about long-term maintenance and what happens if therapy is stopped; I should double-check the withdrawal data: continuation of semaglutide after a run-in yields additional loss and maintenance, whereas switching to placebo results in weight regain, and the STEP 1 extension quantified that about two-thirds of lost weight returns after withdrawal, underscoring that obesity is chronic and pharmacotherapy must generally be continued to sustain benefits, a theme echoed in benefit–harm modeling work [^112VfZbG] [^116DNrym] [^114qLrEB].

> Let me consider mechanism and broader metabolic context to ensure I'm not missing relevant therapeutic effects; GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce appetite centrally and slow gastric emptying, while enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon, leading to weight loss and glycemic improvements, with cardiometabolic risk factor benefits observed across trials and cardiovascular risk reduction signals in related GLP-1 programs, which supports their selection in appropriate patients [^111to37y] [^111dSDih].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could "orvexatide" refer to an emerging combination like cagrilintide–semaglutide or another pipeline agent; the references include an ongoing phase 3a combination study (CagriSema) suggesting additive potential, but without definitive clinical guidance yet for routine care, so for now the best-evidence answer relies on approved semaglutide 2.4 mg or consideration of tirzepatide where available and appropriate [^1134QoPH].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final clinical takeaways: if "orvexatide" was intended to mean semaglutide, then semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly with lifestyle modification is a highly effective, guideline-supported option achieving approximately 12–17% mean weight loss at 68 weeks and outperforming liraglutide 3.0 mg, with the caveat that GI adverse effects require gradual titration and that long-term continuation is usually needed to prevent weight regain; if the intent was tirzepatide, current comparative data suggest even greater weight loss, but the class principles on safety, titration, and maintenance still apply [^111hWRbR] [^1136eMcY] [^111ZKFqL].

I **can't find evidence** for a weight-loss drug called "orvexatide". Please confirm the exact name or share a reference. If you meant one of the following, I can **summarize the evidence** [^114oeAwh]:

- **Semaglutide (Wegovy)**: 14.9–17.4% [^113hyvNV] mean weight loss at 68 weeks [^111hWRbR] in STEP trials
- **Liraglutide (Saxenda)**: ~6.4% [^1136eMcY] at 68 weeks in STEP 8
- **Tirzepatide**: greater weight loss [^116fTk3q] than semaglutide in comparative studies [^111ZKFqL]
- **Cagrilintide–semaglutide combination**: under investigation [^1134QoPH]

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: The STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^1136eMcY]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

The STEP 8 study, published in 2022 in JAMA, evaluated the effectiveness of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide versus daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes. This multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial involved 338 patients (265 female, 73 male).

- **Population**: Non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30 or a BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity were included. Key exclusion criteria included HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol, a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a self-reported change in body weight of ≥ 5 kg within 90 days of screening.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Semaglutide group (n = 126)**: Initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks, titrated every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks.
	- **Liraglutide group (n = 127)**: Initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks.

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in body weight reduction was observed (15.8% in the semaglutide group vs. 6.4% in the liraglutide group; absolute difference 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12).
	- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase was noted in the proportion of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; odds ratio 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) and ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; odds ratio 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4).

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^116fTk3q]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In the direct comparative studies analyzed in this meta‐analysis, tirzepatide demonstrated superior weight loss compared to semaglutide, supporting the notion of enhanced clinical efficacy of dual GLP‐1 and GIP agonism. The efficacy of semaglutide has been established throughout the SUSTAIN trials, where semaglutide showed significantly greater weight loss compared to placebo and active comparators (p < 0.0001 for all). Semaglutide also achieved greater proportions of weight loss over 5% or 10% (p < 0.0001 for all). Additionally, the STEP trials noted that semaglutide 2.4 mg had an average weight loss reduction of up to 16%. Tirzepatide has also been established to be efficacious in reducing body weight, with up to 20.9% weight loss seen across the SURMOUNT trials. However, it is important to note that these trials evaluated each of these GLP‐1 RAs independently rather than direct head‐to‐head trials. Thus, the data in this meta‐analysis provide more clinically relevant comparisons between these agents.

Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle intervention and usage of GLP‐1 RAs is still unclear. However, Wadden et al. suggest that an initial lifestyle intervention period followed by medication addition can maximize weight reduction. This stems from the observation that STEP‐1 (semaglutide only) and STEP‐3 (lifestyle and semaglutide) did not produce an additive benefit towards weight loss. These findings in the literature combined with this study's results suggest that adding semaglutide or tirzepatide produces clinically significant weight loss that can be further potentiated through strategic lifestyle interventions.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: A review [^113hyvNV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Efficacy outcomes**: Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68-week-long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4, and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9% to 17.4% from baseline to week 68. Furthermore, more than 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

	- **STEP 1**: Mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% compared to 2.4% with placebo.
	- **STEP 3**: Mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioral therapy was 16.0% compared to 5.7% with placebo.
	- **STEP 4**: Mean decrease in body weight during the 20-week run-in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase.
	- **STEP 8**: Mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4, and 8 trials (the 68-week-long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy) was achieved by 86% to 89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29% to 48% receiving placebo. In these trials, 69% to 79% of participants achieved…

### Coadministered cagrilintide and semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^1134QoPH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg has established weight-loss and cardiovascular benefits, and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg has shown promising results in early-phase trials; the efficacy of the combination (known as CagriSema) on weight loss in persons with either overweight and coexisting conditions or obesity is unknown.

- **Methods**: In a phase 3a, 68-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. Participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 21:3:3:7 to receive the combination of semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg, semaglutide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, cagrilintide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, or placebo, plus lifestyle interventions for all groups. The coprimary endpoints were the relative change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight from baseline to week 68 with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with placebo. Body-weight reductions of 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more were assessed as confirmatory secondary endpoints. Effect estimates were assessed with the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle).

- **Results**: A total of 3417 participants underwent randomization, with 2108 assigned to receive cagrilintide-semaglutide, 302 to receive semaglutide, 302 to receive cagrilintide, and so on. Safety was assessed.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: An updated review of head-to-head clinical studies [^113UGkgD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Regarding weight, there is significant ambiguity in differentiating between agents. Long-acting agents tend to produce more substantial weight loss compared to short-acting agents, with semaglutide leading in terms of weight reduction. The agents, ordered by weight loss efficacy from most to least, are as follows: semaglutide > liraglutide > dulaglutide > exenatide XR = exenatide (twice daily) = lixisenatide.

- **GI adverse effects**: These appear highest with short-acting agents and subcutaneous semaglutide, while they are lowest with exenatide XR.
- **Injection site reactions**: More common with longer-acting agents, particularly exenatide once-weekly, which may cause transient small nodules at the injection site.
- **Patient satisfaction**: Data indicate higher satisfaction with once-weekly injections compared to twice-daily injections. Among once-weekly agents, satisfaction is highest for dulaglutide due to its single-use, disposable pen device requiring few steps.
- **Discontinuation rates due to adverse events**: These vary between agents and studies but are generally low, with less than 10% of patients discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy due to adverse events. Discontinuation rates might be higher in clinical practice, possibly due to less patient education, support, and follow-up.

The risk of hypoglycemia with GLP-1 RAs is low.

### The emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of NAFLD [^116bhpcm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Because greater weight loss was observed in early head-to-head trials of semaglutide compared with liraglutide, the STEP program involved several RCTs (n = 4988) developed to assess the efficacy and safety for weight management of higher dose semaglutide (2.4 mg/weekly). Results of the 68-week-duration STEP 1 to STEP 4 trials have been recently reported:

- **Step 1: Weight management**;
- **Step 2: Weight management in T2D**;
- **Step 3: Intensive behavioral therapy**;
- **Step 4: Sustained weight management**.

STEP-5 is an ongoing 102-week treatment trial. As anticipated, weight loss was greater than in the SCALE trials. The most impressive results are from STEP 4, where patients with overweight/obesity without T2D, all initially treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly for 20 weeks, were randomized to receive either continued semaglutide or placebo for another 48 weeks. The mean weight loss of volunteers that continued on semaglutide was 7.9% in contrast to a weight regain of 6.9% on placebo. Pooling the STEP 1 to 4 studies together, semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly led to a mean weight loss ranging from -7.9% to -16% (-7.1 to -16.8 kg), whereas with placebo it ranged from +6.9% to -5.7% (+6.1 to -6.2 kg). These results led to the approval on June 4, 2021, of semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly (as Wegovy) for the treatment of obesity. Such results clearly make semaglutide a strong candidate for use in patients with NAFLD.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: The STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^112VfZbG]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The effect of continuing versus withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with a switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity following a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study was conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020. Participants included adults with a body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

- **Interventions**: A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during the run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation and 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), with lifestyle intervention in both groups.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was the percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Among the 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss…).

### Anti-obesity drug discovery: Advances and challenges [^114ezuAT]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2022). Low credibility.

Undoubtedly, patients with extreme obesity, those with multiple comorbidities, and younger individuals confronting a lifelong struggle with excess body weight require special attention. In these instances, the importance of safety is paramount, yet the need for efficacy is equally enhanced. Certain anti-obesity medications (AOMs) unsuitable for the broader population with obesity might still hold promise in special circumstances when carefully administered and monitored by a specialist.

Therapy with leptin in patients with congenital deficiency, or with setmelanotide in patients deficient in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), is highly effective, yet currently of little (leptin) or uncertain (setmelanotide) value in other more common forms of obesity. In any case of weight loss pharmacotherapy, the initial priority should be to safely achieve maximal weight reduction, followed by sustained therapy with AOMs and lifestyle changes that might require less supervision to maintain reduced body weight. Such an approach aims to reduce the risks of intensified therapy by scheduled migration to less forceful forms of therapy.

Aggressive use of glucocorticoid therapy in severe inflammatory diseases followed by dose reduction seems a suitable example, where careful patient management and specific drugs can suitably provide efficacy and safety. Each patient managed by an informed caregiver might progress through a schedule of different drugs in combination with lifestyle modification to eventually achieve an optimal outcome.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide for weight loss in patients without diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hWRbR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated clinically important weight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remain unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

A total of four randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the three trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m². Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved ≥ 20% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher with semaglutide.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: An update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^11695jAi]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

While early total body weight loss of at least 5% labels patients as responders to anti-obesity medications (AOM), a higher response should be targeted; 5–10% total body weight loss is associated with a reduction in the risk of various metabolic, skeletal, and anatomical complications of obesity, and a total body weight loss of more than 15% may be needed to result in improvement of cardiovascular outcomes, as observed in studies assessing effects of weight loss in response to lifestyle modifications.

The effectiveness of the currently available weight loss monotherapies is still modest, with the exception of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RA), and in particular semaglutide, which in combination with behavioral modification therapy, may achieve more than 15% weight loss. The combination of more than one molecule may be needed to achieve a larger total body weight loss; for instance, tirzepatide, a GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist, led to approximately 23% weight loss with the highest dose. New drugs seem to have a much higher potency and are expected to change the medical weight management landscape in the not-so-distant future.

Trials on AOM showed improvement in various metabolic parameters, some of which were of a small magnitude with limited clinical implication. Furthermore, whether this effect has been driven solely by total body weight loss, rather than a direct effect of the drug per se, and whether it differs between metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy individuals with obesity, has been poorly investigated. While some available data showed improvement in liver steatosis with GLP-1 RA, there is no evidence of reduction in liver fibrosis.

### Why does GLP-1 agonist combined with GIP and/or GCG agonist have greater weight loss effect than GLP-1 agonist alone in obese adults without type 2 diabetes [^112AAPVj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is a chronic condition demanding effective treatment strategies, among which pharmacotherapy plays a critical role. As a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term weight management in adults with obesity, liraglutide and semaglutide have shown great weight loss effects by reducing food intake and delaying gastric emptying. The emergence of unimolecular polypharmacology, which utilizes single molecules to simultaneously target multiple receptors or pathways, marked a revolutionary improvement in GLP-1-based obesity pharmacotherapy. The dual agonist tirzepatide activates both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors and has shown enhanced potency for weight loss compared to conventional GLP-1 mono agonists.

Furthermore, emerging data suggest that unimolecular GLP-1/glucagon (GCG) dual agonists, as well as GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonists, may offer superior weight loss efficacy over GLP-1 agonists. This review summarizes the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the pronounced advantages of GLP-1/GIP dual agonists, GLP-1/GCG dual agonists, and GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonists over GLP-1 mono agonists in weight reduction in obese adults without type 2 diabetes. A deeper understanding of these unimolecular multitargeting GLP-1-based agonists will provide insights for their clinical application and guide the development of new drugs for obesity treatment.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^112GVAVv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

As our review shows, our knowledge on adverse events for the GLP-1RAs is largely based on the study of these drugs in the management of diabetes. There are several reasons why data on adverse events might not translate between these populations. For one, the users of GLP-1RAs for weight management are roughly 20–25 years younger on average than those using the same drugs for the management of diabetes. Even under the strong assumption that the relative risk increases translate between these populations, the much lower baseline risk of most diseases among younger individuals will make the absolute magnitude of such risks markedly different.

Second, some adverse effects might be directly or indirectly linked to the indication of diabetes and hyperglycemia. This is obvious for diabetic retinopathy and also hypothesized for the use of GLP-1RA and risk of NAION, making it uncertain whether the same effect can be expected with the use of the drugs for weight management. As such, there is a need to study the occurrence of adverse effects specifically among users of GLP-1RA for weight management and, in particular, the absolute risk of these effects.

- **Methodological quality**: With the growing body of literature on the real-world use and effects of GLP-1RA, there is an increasing need to not only summarize this literature but also to evaluate and strengthen its methodological quality.

Areas of particular focus are warranted to ensure comprehensive understanding and application.

### Reduced efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists therapy in people with type 1 diabetes and genetic forms of obesity [^112kXCPa]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Low credibility.

Once-weekly Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RA) have been shown to improve glycemic outcomes and cause significant weight loss. However, 9% to 27% of individuals have little or no response to these drugs. In this article, we investigated the efficacy of GLP-1 RA therapy among adults with type 1 diabetes and obesity likely related to genetic mutations compared with obesity likely unrelated to genetic mutations.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, we compared body weight and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change with the use of GLP-1 RA therapy (including a dual agonist, Tirzepatide) over six months among adults with type 1 diabetes and obesity likely (n = 11, median age 39.5 years with a median BMI of 43.0 kg/m²) versus unlikely related to genetic mutation(s) (n = 15, median age 45.8 years with a median BMI of 38.7 kg/m²).

- **Results**: Six months of GLP-1 RA treatment resulted in a numerically lower reduction of weight (-5.75 ± 9.46 kg vs. -8.65 ± 9.36 kg, P = 0.44) and HbA1c (-0.28 ± 0.96% vs. -0.43 ± 0.57%, P = 0.64) among individuals with obesity likely versus unlikely related to a genetic mutation(s), respectively. Fewer individuals with genetic obesity met goal weight loss ≥ 5% or HbA1c decrease ≥ 0.4% than did individuals with obesity unlikely related to a genetic cause (36.4% vs. 80.0%, P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: The weight loss and glycemic lowering effects of GLP-1 RA therapy may be decreased in people with type 1 diabetes and obesity likely related to genetic causes. Further research is needed to understand GLP-1 RA mechanisms via energy regulation.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: The STEP 1 trial extension [^116DNrym]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

During the main treatment phase (from baseline [week 0] to week 68), semaglutide reduced body weight more than placebo (Figure 1A and Tables 2 and S1); observed mean weight loss was 17.3% (standard deviation [SD]: 9.3%) with semaglutide versus 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo (Table S1). After treatment withdrawal, body weight regain was observed in both the semaglutide and placebo arms (Figure 1A and Tables 2 and S1). Participants regained a mean of 11.6 percentage points (SD: 7.7) of body weight in the semaglutide arm versus 1.9 percentage points (SD: 4.8) in the placebo arm (Table S1). The net mean body weight loss over the full duration of the main treatment phase and off-treatment extension phase (from week 0 to week 120) was 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) in the semaglutide arm versus 0.1% (SD: 5.8%) in the placebo arm (Figure 1A). At week 120, a 5% or higher weight loss from baseline was observed in 48.2% of participants (95 of 197) in the semaglutide arm and in 22.6% (21 of 93) in the placebo arm.

### Effect of bremelanotide on body weight of obese women: data from two phase 1 randomized controlled trials [^115eWwWH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Transient changes in blood pressure observed 1 hour following each injection were minimal and relatively consistent across the placebo and bremelanotide groups. Over the course of the study, subjects in both groups showed a slight decrease from baseline (96% of subjects in both groups), and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the study. Skin hyperpigmentation and nausea were more commonly reported among subjects receiving bremelanotide compared to placebo. Three subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse events (AEs): one subject from the placebo group following an event of vomiting, and two subjects from the bremelanotide group following events of hypertension and nausea (one each). Changes in libido were not monitored or reported in Study A.

### Healthy weight loss maintenance with exercise, GLP-1 receptor agonist, or both combined followed by one year without treatment: A post-treatment analysis of a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^113NKf7B]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we investigated whether exercise during obesity pharmacotherapy improved healthy weight maintenance after one year of active treatment followed by one year in a real-world setting after treatment was terminated. One year after treatment termination, participants who had previously received combined supervised exercise and GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment had maintained weight loss and body-fat reduction compared with GLP-1 receptor agonist alone. More participants who had previously received combination treatment maintained a weight loss of at least 10% of initial body weight one year after treatment termination compared with participants who had received liraglutide alone or placebo. Weight regain during the one-year post-treatment phase was 6 kg larger for participants who had previously received liraglutide alone compared with participants who had previously received supervised exercise alone, despite similar initial weight loss. Collectively, these results indicate that the addition of supervised exercise during obesity pharmacotherapy improves maintenance of healthy body weight and body composition after treatment termination.

In the intervention phase of the S-LiTE study, weight loss was successfully maintained for one year with exercise and liraglutide as separate treatments, and the combination of both was the most effective strategy in terms of healthy body weight and fat reduction. In the present study, approximately two-thirds of the initial weight loss had been regained one year after liraglutide treatment alone was stopped.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues reduce alcohol intake [^111hMyni]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Use of GLP‐1 RAs in patients with obesity was associated with a significant reduction in alcohol intake and a weak positive correlation with weight loss. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for GLP‐1 RAs in managing co‐occurring obesity and alcohol use. Future randomized controlled trials with larger and more diverse populations are necessary to validate these results, explore underlying mechanisms, and assess long‐term outcomes for integrated treatment strategies.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight reduction in people living with obesity but without diabetes: A living benefit-harm modelling study [^114qLrEB]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

The trade-off between the benefits and harms of GLP-1 RA treatment is challenging due to the multitude of parameters and outcomes to consider concurrently, and it becomes even more challenging when considering GLP-1 RAs for weight maintenance. Evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for rapid weight loss in conjunction with lifestyle interventions during the first years of treatment. However, all RCTs showed that weight reduction stabilizes over time after the initial 1 or 2 years of treatment. This triggers an important question: whether discontinuing (but having a high risk of weight rebounding) or continuing GLP-1 RA therapy for weight maintenance (with no further weight loss but higher harm risks) is beneficial for the overall health of individuals, which needs a separate analysis.

For instance, the STEP 1 and STEP 4 trials demonstrated that patients who stopped taking semaglutide experienced significant weight regain and a reversal of cardiometabolic benefits, whereas those who continued the treatment maintained their weight loss. Similarly, the S-LITE and SURMOUNT-4 trials also reported weight regain following the discontinuation of liraglutide and tirzepatide, respectively. This was supported by an observational study, albeit in people living with diabetes, that reported an increased risk of CVD events in those who withdrew GLP-1 RAs.

The long-term harms and benefits are also not clear. Although RCTs available so far are too short to observe long-term benefits or harm outcomes, they have signaled some important harms.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically [^111to37y]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Shortly after starting a meal, a hormone, GLP-1, is released from the small intestine. This hormone stimulates insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, and delays gastric emptying, all of which aid in reducing the post-prandial rise of glucose concentrations. GLP-1 only has a 2-minute half-life in the circulation. An effective class of anti-hyperglycemia drugs has been developed by altering the amino acids at the site where the enzyme that destroys GLP-1 acts. This allows GLP-1 to remain in the circulation for hours to days, up to a week, depending on other additions to the drug preparations.

These drugs bind to the GLP-1 receptor, reproducing the actions of endogenous GLP-1. These GLP-1 receptor agonists also suppress hunger and appetite by stimulating the satiety center in the brain, resulting in decreased food intake with resulting weight loss. Randomized controlled trials involving two GLP-1 receptor agonists, but at higher US Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved doses than those approved for the treatment of diabetes, have been evaluated for weight loss in obese individuals. Daily injections of liraglutide achieved a 6–8% weight loss, and weekly injections of semaglutide achieved a 15% weight loss. In a semaglutide weight loss trial, 42% of the subjects at enrollment had prediabetes, which fell to 7% at the end of the study [Results presented at the ADA National Meeting, New Orleans, LA, USA, June 2022].

### Time to reach glycaemic and body weight loss thresholds with tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes: A pre-planned exploratory analysis of SURPASS-2 and SURPASS-3 [^116bZh15]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, provides clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control and body weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. The early efficacy profile of tirzepatide after treatment initiation is of interest. In this exploratory pre-planned analysis, we evaluated the time to achieve glycaemic control and body weight loss thresholds with tirzepatide.

- **Methods**: In two randomized studies, we compared time to achieve HbA1c (< 7.0% and ≤ 6.5%) and weight loss (≥ 5%, SURPASS-2 only) thresholds among people treated with tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg), semaglutide 1 mg in SURPASS-2, and titrated insulin degludec in SURPASS-3. Longitudinal logistic regression models were used to explore the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c and body weight loss thresholds at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. The time to achieve these thresholds was analyzed and compared between groups using the Cox proportional-hazards model.

- **Results**: Overall, greater proportions of participants achieved the HbA1c and body weight loss thresholds at 4, 12, and 24 weeks with tirzepatide compared with semaglutide 1 mg and insulin degludec. The median time to achieve HbA1c < 7.0% (8.1 weeks with each tirzepatide dose, 12.0 weeks with semaglutide 1 mg, and 12.1 weeks with insulin degludec) and ≤ 6.5% (12.1, 15.7, and 24.1 weeks, respectively) was faster with tirzepatide than semaglutide 1 mg and insulin degludec. In SURPASS-2, the median time to first achieve a body weight loss of ≥ 5% was faster with tirzepatide.

### Estimating direct tissue effects versus weight loss effects of incretin-based drugs for obesity on various chronic conditions [^1122LFAm]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

The extent to which newer incretin-based drugs for obesity improve disease outcomes via weight loss versus the direct effects of these drugs is the subject of intense interest. Although reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events appear to be predominantly driven by the direct tissue effects of such drugs, the associated weight loss effects must be relevant to the benefits observed in other major outcomes, albeit to differing extents. In this personal view, we draw on evidence to support that weight loss is at least partly responsible (albeit to differing extents) for the reported benefits of incretin-based drugs for obesity in people living with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes. Concurrently, we propose that drug-induced weight loss is largely responsible for the reported improvements in osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis outcomes. However, more evidence is needed to solidify these observations, including, when possible, trials comparing the effects of incretin-based drugs for obesity with calorie-reduced diets on both outcomes and mechanistic pathways. Such evidence has implications for public health and the design of future trials of novel drugs for obesity.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: A narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^112snv3o]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

The long-term effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use for weight loss remain an important area for future research. While studies have demonstrated substantial short-term weight loss and metabolic improvements, the sustainability of these outcomes over extended periods requires further exploration. Longitudinal studies should investigate how these agents impact long-term health outcomes, such as the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Additionally, long-term safety needs to be established. Comprehensive long-term studies will help clarify the risk-benefit ratio of prolonged GLP-1 RA therapy.

The development of oral GLP-1 RAs offers an alternative to injectable formulations, potentially improving access and adherence for some patients. Oral semaglutide has demonstrated efficacy in both diabetes and obesity management. Cardiovascular safety was first established in the PIONEER 6 trial, with the more recent SOUL trial demonstrating a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to placebo among individuals with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular or renal risk. These findings support the potential of oral semaglutide for broader clinical use. Orforglipron, a novel non-peptide oral GLP-1 RA, has also shown promising glycemic and weight-lowering effects in phase 2 trials. While oral formulations have demonstrated acceptable tolerability overall, gastrointestinal side effects remain common and may occur at similar or slightly higher rates than with injectable agents. Daily dosing and pill burden may also pose challenges.

There are many mechanisms by which GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) promote metabolic improvement and weight loss. While these mechanisms are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere, recent studies provide support for their use among endocrinologists for the management of adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

### Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) on weight loss following bariatric treatment [^111UJJC7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

There has been growing recognition of the need to consider weight-loss strategies following metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) to limit the magnitude of potential weight regain. The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in this setting remains uncertain.

- **Objective**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of GLP-1RAs on weight changes in patients who previously underwent MBS.

- **Methods**: We examined the effect of GLP-1RAs on weight changes by calculating pooled estimates (random-effects model) of the absolute differences in body weight (kg) compared to baseline for observational studies and compared to a control group for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A total of 17 studies (1164 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Pooling the data from the 14 observational studies evaluating the effect of GLP-1RAs post-bariatric treatment demonstrated a reduction of 7.83 kg compared to pre-treatment (before the use of GLP-1RA) (weight-7.83 kg [95% CI, -9.27 to -6.38]). With respect to tolerability, 23% (95% CI, 10%-36%) of participants reported any adverse event, but only 7% discontinued treatment. Data from RCTs showed that the use of GLP-1RAs induced weight reduction of 4.36 kg (95% CI, -0.42 to -8.30) compared to placebo with a similar safety profile.

- **Conclusion**: Our findings suggest that the use of liraglutide and semaglutide in patients who previously underwent MBS can promote significant weight reduction with an acceptable safety profile.

### Impact of dose-escalation schemes and drug discontinuation on weight loss outcomes with liraglutide 3.0 mg: A model-based approach [^113LdcBt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The global obesity epidemic continues to grow, with an estimated 38% of the world's adult population predicted to be overweight and 20% obese by 2030. Even though first-line interventions, such as diet and increased physical activity, can lead to weight loss, studies show that people tend to regain the lost weight in the long term, potentially owing to well-regulated body weight homeostatic mechanisms and decreased effort regarding weight maintenance over time. Thus, effective and well-tolerated interventions are needed to aid with weight reduction and help sustain the lost weight in the long term. Novel incretin hormone-based pharmacotherapeutic approaches have been proposed as a viable strategy for weight management in overweight or obese patients. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a member of the incretin hormone family that stimulates insulin secretion and dose-dependently inhibits glucagon secretion. It has been shown to lead to weight loss via a reduction in energy intake by increasing satiety and reducing hunger.

### Glp-1 receptor agonists induce loss of lean mass: so does caloric restriction [^116FjKiP]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). Low credibility.

The widespread prevalence of obesity and its adverse health effects have made sustained weight loss strategies a public health priority. While the causes of obesity are still debated, it is well established that a chronic positive or negative energy balance results in weight gain or loss, respectively. Caloric restriction (CR) with optimal nutrition has the potential to reverse several obesity-related metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hepatic steatosis, and hypertension. Challenges in implementing long-term CR regimens, such as low adherence, psychological impact, and metabolic adaptation, have made the search for pharmacological alternatives an attractive area of research, though progress in this field has, until recently, been limited.

- **A new tool in the arsenal**: The recent introduction of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RA), a class of widely used drugs for the treatment of T2DM, as anti-obesity medication, is poised to revolutionize the management of obesity. Indeed, GLP-1 RA can achieve weight losses of about 15%–25% while being relatively well tolerated by the patients. For comparison, CR results in weight loss of about 10%–20% in 6 months, and metabolic surgery achieves ~25%–35%. The primary mechanism of action of GLP-1 RA is through appetite suppression via its action at the level of the central nervous system and delayed gastric emptying, thus facilitating adherence to a CR state. However, the significant weight loss associated with GLP-1 RA has raised concerns regarding its impact on lean body mass.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: Key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114UrjaB]. Obesity (2020). High credibility.

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain weight loss or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain weight loss following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity. The goal is to gain a greater understanding of weight loss, weight loss maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: The STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, available for weight management. This study's objective was to compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, versus once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg, both in conjunction with diet and physical activity in individuals with overweight or obesity.

This randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial was conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 to May 2021. Participants included adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, or 27 or greater with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes (N = 338).

Participants were randomized in a 3:1:3:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or a matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or a matching placebo, along with diet and physical activity interventions. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg. Those unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued the treatment but were allowed to restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

The primary endpoint was the percentage change in body weight. Confirmatory secondary endpoints included achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide versus liraglutide at week 68. Comparisons between semaglutide and liraglutide were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against placebo.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^111ptEkp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The study aimed to discover alternative dosing regimens of incretin mimetics that simultaneously reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy. As a secondary objective, the researchers explored how allocating a limited incretin mimetics budget could affect public health on a national scale.

- **Materials and methods**: The researchers used mathematical modelling and simulation of semaglutide and tirzepatide to investigate dosing regimens which have not yet been studied clinically. For semaglutide, they utilized a recent pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) model. For tirzepatide, they employed a recent PK model and modelled PD by reparameterizing the semaglutide PD model to fit tirzepatide clinical data.

- **Results**: Reducing dose frequency does not commensurately reduce weight loss. For example, switching from one dose per week (q1wk) to one dose every two weeks (q2wk) maintains roughly 75% of the weight loss. Furthermore, if the decrease in dose frequency involves an appropriate increase in dose size, then approximately 100% of the weight loss is maintained. The study compared offering incretin mimetics to: (1) a fraction of obese US adults with q1wk dosing versus (2) twice as many obese US adults with q2wk dosing. Although scenarios (1) and (2) require the same budget, the analysis suggests that (2) reduces national obesity and mortality to a much greater degree.

- **Conclusion**: The study highlights the potential utility of alternative dosing regimens of incretin mimetics. Compared with standard once-weekly dosing, costs can be halved and weight loss maintained. These cost-saving results have significant implications for public health.

### Medications for obesity: A review [^114oeAwh]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Obesity affects approximately 19% of women and 14% of men worldwide and is associated with increased morbidity. Antiobesity medications (AOMs) modify biological processes that affect appetite and significantly improve outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

- **Observations**: AOMs should be administered in combination with lifestyle interventions and can be classified according to their mechanisms of action. Orlistat modifies digestive tract absorption and causes gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as oily fecal spotting and urgency, in more than 25% of patients. Centrally acting drugs, such as phentermine-topiramate and naltrexone-bupropion, regulate appetite in the brain and are associated with constipation in approximately 20% of patients, although the incidence of other adverse effects (e.g. paresthesia, nausea) varies by medication.

- **Nutrient-stimulated hormone-based medications**: Liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide mimic the actions of enteropancreatic hormones that modify central appetite regulation and provide multiple cardiometabolic weight-loss benefits. Adverse effects of these drugs include nausea (28%-44%), diarrhea (21%-30%), and constipation (11%-24%).

- **Relative potency**: The relative potency of adult obesity medications has been studied in meta-analyses. Compared with placebo, orlistat was associated with 3.1% greater weight loss (52 randomized clinical trials [RCTs]; 16,964 participants), phentermine-topiramate was associated with 8.0% greater weight loss (5 RCTs; 3,407 participants), and naltrexone-bupropion was associated with 4.1% greater weight loss.

### Utilization patterns of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prior to bariatric and metabolic surgery: a multicenter study [^113LxAfY]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (G1RA) have gained popularity as a treatment for weight loss in patients who are overweight or obese, but their utilization patterns and impact on candidates for metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) remain understudied.

- **Objective**: We aimed to investigate the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of patients with a history of G1RA utilization among MBS candidates.

- **Setting**: Five high-volume MBS centers in Israel.

- **Methods**: Data were collected retrospectively from February 1st, 2023, to September 30th, 2023. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were analyzed to assess a history of G1RA use, associated factors, adverse events, and treatment outcomes.

- **Results**: Four hundred thirty-four MBS candidates were included in the study. A history of G1RA utilization was obtained in 275 (63%) MBS candidates, with Liraglutide and Semaglutide being the most commonly used agents. Younger age, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and no previous MBS history were associated with a higher rate of G1RA utilization. With these medications, median maximal weight loss was 5.38 kg, and mean duration of use was 19 weeks. Patients using G1RA for ≥ 6 weeks experienced significantly greater weight loss compared to those using it for shorter periods (6.3 ± 6.43 vs 1.65 ± 1.69; P < .001). GI-related adverse events were reported in 57.8% of patients. Over 95% of patients discontinued G1RA due to insufficient weight loss and/or adverse effects. Patients reaching the maximal recommended dose exhibited significantly greater weight loss versus other patients.

### Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in achieving weight loss and improving cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight and obesity [^111dSDih]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In addition to the primary outcome, significant reductions from baseline for several cardiovascular risk factors were noted in the trials. These included body weight, glycated hemoglobin, and systolic blood pressure in the GLP-1 RA treatment groups compared with placebo. The PIONEER-6 trial demonstrated a difference of −3.4 kg in weight loss between oral semaglutide 14 mg and placebo. Greater weight loss was achieved with higher doses of semaglutide (1.0 mg subcutaneous formulation and 14 mg oral formulation) compared with the lower dose (0.5 mg subcutaneous). Similarly, in the SUSTAIN-6 trial, there were mean changes of −4.9 kg in the group receiving 1.0 mg subcutaneous semaglutide and −3.6 kg in those receiving 0.5 mg, versus placebo.

There are several factors that may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of GLP-1 RAs. Although the exact mechanism of cardiovascular risk reduction from GLP-1 RAs is unknown, similar cardiovascular benefits have not been demonstrated when using other effective glucose-lowering therapies, such as insulin, for the treatment of T2D. The cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 RAs seem to be independent of their glycated hemoglobin-lowering effects. This indicates that the improved cardiovascular outcomes following GLP-1 RA treatment may occur through a unique glucose-independent mechanism and thus could be beneficial to populations beyond patients with T2D.

### Weight maintenance on cost-effective antiobesity medications after 1 year of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy: a real-world study [^1149nxXb]. Obesity (2024). Low credibility.

The high cost of novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) class agents often limits access and creates barriers to care. This real-world study evaluated the efficacy of older-generation generic antiobesity medications (AOMs) for weight maintenance after 1 year of GLP-1 RA therapy in patients who had achieved successful weight loss.

We prospectively followed patients (N = 105) who had completed 12 months of therapy and were part of a "medical weight loss bundle", which included 12 months of GLP-1 RA therapy followed by 6 months of transition care. The baseline mean BMI was 36.4 kg/m². Body weight outcomes were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

- **Results**: After the medical weight loss bundle, 40 patients transitioned to generic AOMs. At 12 months, this cohort lost an average of 18.3% [95% CI: 13.0%, 23.6%] body weight from baseline, with a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m². At 18 months, they maintained the weight loss, with a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m². Subsequent follow-up visits (average 1.5 months later) without GLP-1 RAs showed further reduction, resulting in a total average weight loss of 25.5% [95% CI: 23.1%, 27.9%] compared to the initial visit.

Patients successfully treated with GLP-1 RAs can maintain their weight loss using generic older-generation AOMs, suggesting potential cost savings for insurers and implications for policy regarding AOM coverage.

### Neurobeachin (NBEA) is a novel gene associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist associated weight loss [^114AuUUD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Weight loss was not consistent across GLP‐1RAs. Liraglutide resulted in a mean weight loss of 2.47% (SD = 7.06) after 12–18 months in All of Us and 3.44% (SD = 6.09) in the UK Biobank. Semaglutide resulted in 94% greater weight loss, with a mean of 4.87% (SD = 7.53) in the All of Us cohort. The 20th percentiles of weight loss (i.e. high response) were 7.57%, 6.38%, 7.77%, and 10.9% weight on dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide, respectively. UK Biobank participants in the top 20th percentile lost 8.25% on liraglutide.

A meaningful proportion of the cohort did not lose weight on GLP‐1RAs. In the NIH All of Us cohort, 36.30% and 24.30% of patients did not lose any weight after 12–18 months on liraglutide and semaglutide, respectively. Comparatively, fewer individuals did not lose weight on liraglutide in the UK Biobank (28.63%). Other clinical variables were also associated with weight loss. In All of Us, individuals were more likely to experience no weight loss if they were younger, had a lower baseline BMI, and had shorter prescription regimens (OR < 1, Ps < 0.05). Individuals were more likely to experience the top 20th percentile of weight loss if they had their prescriptions for longer. Longer prescription durations were also negatively associated with no response in the UK Biobank (OR = 0.45 (0.23–0.9), p < 0.05). As expected, no significant differences in clinical variables were observed for the semaglutide discovery and validation sets.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: Moving towards efficacy improvement [^1122YLvY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

In the follow-up of the STEP 1 trial, which included 327 participants with a mean weight loss of 17.3% in the semaglutide group and 2.0% in the placebo group, participants regained two-thirds (11.6 vs. 1.9 percentage points) of their previously lost weight after the discontinuation of the treatment and lifestyle interventions, resulting in net losses of 5.6% vs. 0.1% by week 120. These data confirm that obesity is a chronic disease, and medications will only be useful when used continuously; this concept is not different from that of hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia.

The double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled STEP 2 study evaluated patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and T2DM (n = 1210). This was the only study included in the STEP program that involved patients with diabetes, showing clinically relevant weight loss related to a once-a-week subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity and T2DM. Patients treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg for 68 weeks showed a –9.6% reduction in their initial body weight versus a –7.0% reduction with 1.0 mg of semaglutide and a –3.4% reduction with a placebo (p < 0.0001). A greater percentage of patients (13.3%) also achieved a ≥ 20% body-weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg, versus 4.7% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group and 1.6% in the placebo group.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^111ZKFqL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

In general, there were few large, methodologically strong head-to-head comparative effectiveness studies of weight loss in obese users of different GLP-1RA for weight loss. Liraglutide has been compared with dulaglutide, showing no clear difference in weight loss. In patients receiving GLP-1RA treatment for T2D or obesity, semaglutide use was more likely to lead to weight reduction of ≥ 10% compared with liraglutide use. In individuals without T2D, weight loss was 6.9% for semaglutide, 6.6% for liraglutide, and 3.1% for dulaglutide. A newer large real-world comparative cohort study from the US of more than 18,000 adults with overweight or obesity compared weight loss during treatment with semaglutide or tirzepatide. The treatment was labeled for T2D, yet only 52% of individuals in the study were classified as having T2D. The achieved treatment doses were not reported. The study found a larger weight loss at 12 months for tirzepatide (−15.3%) versus semaglutide (−8.3%) in individuals who had not been excluded due to discontinuation or GLP-1RA switching. Two recent studies based on the TriNetX database have compared users of tirzepatide with either users of semaglutide or other GLP-1RAs (combined). Anson et al. followed individuals after six months of completed treatment with tirzepatide and semaglutide and found that tirzepatide was associated with greater weight loss and decreased risk of developing T2D in individuals without pre-existing diabetes compared with semaglutide at one-year follow-up.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: Key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114hsRUd]. Obesity (2020). High credibility.

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

- **Methods**: Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, weight management; NCT03552757, weight management in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, weight management with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained weight management; and NCT03693430, long-term weight management), approximately 5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary endpoint is the change from baseline to the end of treatment in body weight.

- **Results**: Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%-81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m² and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

- **Conclusions**: The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on weight management in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long-term follow-up.

### Pharmacologic options for the treatment of overweight and obesity [^113Yv7ET]. Menopause (2025). High credibility.

The field of antiobesity pharmacotherapy is rapidly evolving. FDA-approved medications, such as orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, bupropion/naltrexone, and liraglutide, have significantly improved weight-loss outcomes. Agents such as semaglutide and tirzepatide are setting new standards, achieving weight-loss outcomes comparable to bariatric surgery. These medications not only aid in weight reduction but also offer additional health benefits, including improved cardiometabolic health and reduced cardiovascular risk. Antiobesity medications require long-term use because discontinuation often causes weight regain. Similar to other chronic diseases, overweight and obesity require ongoing management. Patient education and support are key to maintaining results and preventing weight recidivism.

### Incretin-based weight loss pharmacotherapy: Can resistance exercise optimize changes in body composition [^113iWLk6]. Diabetes Care (2024). Low credibility.

This narrative review highlights the degree to which new antiobesity medications based on gut-derived nutrient-stimulated hormones (incretins) cause loss of lean mass and the importance of resistance exercise to preserve muscle. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) induce substantial weight loss in randomized trials, effects that may be enhanced in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists. Liraglutide and semaglutide (GLP-1RA), tirzepatide (GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist), and retatrutide (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor triple agonist) are peptides with incretin agonist activity that induce approximately 15–24% weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity, alongside beneficial impacts on blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin. However, these agents also cause rapid and significant loss of lean mass (approximately 10% or 6 kg), comparable to a decade or more of aging.

Maintaining muscle mass and function as humans age is crucial to avoiding sarcopenia and frailty, which are strongly linked to morbidity and mortality. Studies indicate that supervised resistance exercise training interventions with a duration greater than 10 weeks can elicit large increases in lean mass (approximately 3 kg) and strength (approximately 25%) in men and women. After a low-calorie diet, combining aerobic exercise with liraglutide improved weight loss maintenance compared with either alone. Retaining lean mass during incretin therapy could blunt body weight (and fat) regain on cessation of weight loss pharmacotherapy. We propose that tailored resistance exercise training could optimize these outcomes.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment increases bone formation and prevents bone loss in weight-reduced obese women [^113NRz2b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Recent studies indicate that glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 regulates bone turnover, but the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on bone in obese weight-reduced individuals are unknown.

- **Objective**: To investigate the role of GLP-1 RAs on bone formation and weight loss-induced bone mass reduction.
- **Design**: Randomized control study.
- **Setting**: Outpatient research hospital clinic.
- **Participants**: Thirty-seven healthy obese women with a body mass index of 34 ± 0.5 kg/m² and age 46 ± 2 years.
- **Intervention**: After a low-calorie-diet-induced 12% weight loss, participants were randomized to treatment with or without administration of the GLP-1 RA liraglutide (1.2 mg/d) for 52 weeks. In case of weight gain, up to two meals per day could be replaced with a low-calorie-diet product to maintain the weight loss.
- **Main outcome measures**: Total, pelvic, and arm-leg bone mineral content (BMC) and bone markers [C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-1) and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP)] were investigated before and after weight loss and after 52-week weight maintenance. Primary endpoints were changes in BMC and bone markers after 52-week weight maintenance with or without GLP-1 RA treatment.

Results indicated that total, pelvic, and arm-leg BMC decreased during weight maintenance in the control group (P < .0001), but not significantly in the liraglutide group. Thus, total and arm-leg BMC loss was four times greater in the control group compared to the liraglutide group (estimated difference, 27 g; 95% confidence interval, 5–48; p = 0.01), although the 12% weight loss was the same in both groups.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^113MCKJX]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for obesity, more specifically with respect to the choice of agent, the AGA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the following agents in addition to lifestyle modifications in adult patients with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications:

- **Semaglutide 2.4 mg**: Effective in weight loss management.
- **Liraglutide 3.0 mg**: Clinically approved for obesity treatment.
- **Phentermine-topiramate extended-release**: A combination that aids in weight reduction.
- **Naltrexone-bupropion extended-release**: Utilized for its impact on appetite reduction.
- **Phentermine**: Commonly prescribed for short-term weight loss.
- **Diethylpropion**: An option for obesity management.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^1172fhpF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

An important note for GLP-1 GI AEs is that standard approaches may not correctly characterize the incidence of GI AEs, given the mechanism of action of GLP-1 RAs, which decrease gastric emptying and suppress appetite to reduce overall food intake. Rather than vomiting, nausea was reported more frequently as the reason for treatment discontinuation in the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials. However, a gradual dose escalation may increase tolerability and reduce the frequency of GI AEs. There has been some speculation on the contribution of GI AEs to the weight reduction seen in GLP-1 RAs, but mediation analysis suggests a minimal contribution. Overall, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well tolerated, and AEs are deemed mild to moderate in severity.

### Gip receptor antagonists in the pharmacotherapy of obesity: Physiologic, genetic, and clinical rationale [^116Tqz1g]. Diabetes (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is a prevalent disease that contributes significantly to the incidence and severity of many other chronic diseases and health conditions. Treatment approaches include lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological options. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, approved specifically for weight loss, have changed the treatment landscape significantly in the last five years. Targeting the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor may enhance the metabolic benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonism. These beneficial effects are seen with both GIP receptor antagonism and GIP receptor agonism, although the mechanisms underlying this paradox remain unknown.

Here, we summarize the physiologic, genetic, and clinical evidence for pursuing GIP receptor antagonism to achieve metabolic and weight benefits. Global and central nervous system knockout of GIP receptors protects mice fed a high-fat diet from obesity and insulin resistance. Genome-wide association studies in humans support this notion by correlating lower BMI with GIP receptor genetic variants with reduced function. Pharmacologic approaches in mice and monkeys confirm that GIP receptor antagonism enhances GLP-1-induced weight reduction and other metabolic benefits. A phase 1 study provides proof of principle that these beneficial effects extend to humans. GIP receptor antagonism may represent an important new mechanism to expand treatment options for individuals living with obesity.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of suboptimal initial clinical response and weight gain recurrence after bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112smhhS]. Obesity Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Suboptimal initial clinical response (SICR) and weight gain recurrence (WGR) are challenging issues following bariatric surgery. Recently, the promising weight loss effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been applied to bariatric patients. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in the treatment of SICR and WGR after bariatric surgery.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed across online databases. The primary outcomes were percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) and absolute weight loss. Secondary outcomes included changes in biochemical markers and adverse effects (AEs).

- **Results**: Nineteen studies including 1,290 patients were included. After at least 3 months of treatment, the pooled %TWL was 9.24% for liraglutide, 11.38% for semaglutide, and 15.50% for tirzepatide, with corresponding weight reductions of 8.56 kg, 11.62 kg, and 12.60 kg, respectively. Additionally, %TWL and weight loss with liraglutide use were 7.65% and 7.47 kg for ≤ 6 months, 10.22% and 9.30 kg for 6–12 months, and 10.80% and 9.72 kg for ≥ 12 months. For semaglutide, the %TWL and weight reduction were 10.18% and 9.43 kg at 6 months, and 13.15% and 14.68 kg at 12 months. Biochemical markers including triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase levels showed significant reductions after GLP-1 RA treatment. Common AEs were nausea (23%), vomiting (6%), diarrhea (6%), constipation (10%), headache (6%), fatigue (8%), and abdominal pain.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^115XU7iC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is closely related to the lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men, increasing from 7% to 70% as the BMI rises from less than 18.5 kg/m² to greater than 35 kg/m². Similarly, the lifetime risk increases in females from 12% to 74% with the same BMI values. An estimated majority (approximately 86%) of T2DM patients are also overweight or obese. Notably, weight loss of 5%–10% has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control and decrease the incidence of diabetes by over 50%.

At a 7-year follow-up, bariatric surgery resulted in an 18.2% diabetes remission rate compared to the 6.2% in the medical/lifestyle group (p = 0.02). However, bariatric surgery is considered a last resort if lifestyle modifications or medical therapies fail. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) such as liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide have been approved for the treatment of obesity and achieve effects via increased insulin release, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased gastric emptying, and acting on central receptors in the central nervous system to reduce appetite. The effects of GLP-1 RAs extend beyond T2DM and obesity, reducing the risk of systemic conditions as well.

- **Study on GLP-1 RAs and systemic risk reduction**: Nassar et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study with data spanning a more than 5-year follow-up period involving patients with T2DM or obesity. GLP-1 RA treatment was found to significantly lower incidences of dementia (risk difference (RD): −0.010), Alzheimer's disease (RD: −0.003), Parkinson's disease (RD: −0.002), pancreatic cancer (RD: −0.003), systemic lupus erythematosus (RD: −0.001), and systemic sclerosis (RD: −0.000), with p < 0.001.

### Effect of a stepped-care intervention approach on weight loss in adults: A randomized clinical trial [^114pnZga]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Given the obesity epidemic, effective but resource-efficient weight loss treatments are needed. Stepped-treatment approaches customize interventions based on milestone completion and can be more effective while costing less to administer than conventional treatment approaches.

To determine whether a stepped-care weight loss intervention (STEP), compared with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (SBWI), would result in greater weight loss, a randomized clinical trial was conducted.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized clinical trial with 363 overweight and obese adults (body mass index: 25- < 40; age: 18–55 years, 33% nonwhite, and 83% female) who were randomized to SBWI (n = 165) or STEP (n = 198) at two universities affiliated with academic medical centers in the United States (Step-Up Study). Participants were enrolled between May 2008 and February 2010, and data collection was completed by September 2011.

- **Interventions**: All participants were placed on a low-calorie diet, prescribed increases in physical activity, and attended group counseling sessions ranging from weekly to monthly during an 18-month period. The SBWI group was assigned to a fixed program. Counseling frequency, type, and weight loss strategies could be modified every 3 months for the STEP group in response to observed weight loss as it related to weight loss goals.

- **Main outcome measure**: Mean change in weight over 18 months. Additional outcomes included resting heart rate and blood pressure, waist circumference, body composition, fitness, physical activity, dietary intake, and cost of the program.

### Injectable semaglutide and reductions in HbA1c and weight in the real world in people switched from alternative glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^1124rJtL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

It should be noted that the liraglutide group had longer follow-up periods and higher HbA1c at baseline. Although this does not explain why HbA1c reductions would be attenuated in this group (if anything, the opposite might be expected) and it is unlikely to account fully for weight loss in this group being somewhat similar to GLP‐1RA–naïve individuals. We hypothesize that adherence to daily liraglutide injections might be less than to weekly injections of either dulaglutide or semaglutide, but we cannot test this within the available data.

Our findings are broadly comparable with those from existing real-world evidence and RCTs. However, the mean weight and HbA1c in our study were greater than those of RCT cohorts, reflecting UK practice in the management of type 2 diabetes that prioritizes GLP-1RA use for people who are likely to benefit from significant weight loss. We were not able to assess the relative effectiveness of semaglutide doses above 1.0 mg once weekly, nor of oral semaglutide, nor doses of dulaglutide above 1.5 mg once weekly, because these were not licensed at the time of data collection.

A further limitation of our study is the use of paired t tests to compare change within each group separately, rather than a more complex statistical analysis with cross-group comparisons. The latter approach would be appropriate for a randomized clinical trial or meta-analysis but, in this retrospective observational study, would make excessive assumptions about the underlying data.

More work will be needed to compare the efficacy of the expanding dose range of se…

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: An update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^1123CQMr]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Head-to-head comparison between FDA approved anti-obesity medications effect on weight**: A network meta-analysis of RCTs on FDA approved AOM, up to 2016, showed that compared to placebo, at one year, phentermine/topiramate was associated with the highest total body weight loss of 8.8 (7.4–10.2) kg, while liraglutide and NB had a similar total body weight loss of 5.3 (4.5–6.1) kg for liraglutide and 5.0 (4.0–5.9) kg for NB. The lowest total body weight loss was reported with orlistat at 2.6 (2.2–3.0) kg. On the other hand, liraglutide and NB were associated with the highest risk of discontinuation due to adverse events.

- **Two RCTs compared liraglutide to orlistat and semaglutide, respectively**: A 20-week RCT, followed by a one-year extension, compared increasing doses of daily liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4, or 3.0 mg) to placebo or open-label orlistat (120 mg TID). After one year, all liraglutide and placebo groups were switched to liraglutide 2.4 or 3 mg. At one year, total body weight loss was higher with liraglutide compared to placebo and orlistat, with a difference in achieved weight of 5.8 (3.7–8.0) kg and 3.8 (1.6–6.0) kg, respectively, favoring liraglutide; at two years, total body weight loss remained significantly higher in liraglutide groups (5.3 kg) compared to the orlistat group (2.3 kg) (p < 0.001).

- **The STEP 8 trial**: Compared semaglutide (2.4 mg weekly) to liraglutide (3 mg daily) with matching daily and weekly placebo in patients with obesity, mean BMI 37.5 (6.8) kg/m². Total body weight loss was higher in semaglutide compared to liraglutide, with a mean difference.

### Marked weight loss on liraglutide 3.0 mg: Real-life experience of a Swiss cohort with obesity [^1171kUYP]. Obesity (2023). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effectiveness of liraglutide 3.0 mg daily in combination with a standardized multidisciplinary intervention on body weight and body composition changes in a real-life setting.

- **Methods**: A prospective, observational cohort study design was used. Adult patients with a BMI > 35 kg/m², or a BMI > 28 kg/m² with at least one metabolic comorbidity, were included (n = 54, 65% women). Liraglutide treatment was covered by Swiss health insurance. Clinical and biological data were collected at baseline, 4 months, and 10 months. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 10 months.

- **Results**: At 10 months, the mean (SD) percentage weight loss (WL%) was −12.4% (5.5%) or −14.1 (6.6) kg. WL% was ≥ 5% in 87% of patients at 4 months and in 96% at 10 months. WL% was higher in women (−9.5% [3.1%] vs. men −7.2% [2.5%], p = 0.02) at 4 months and persisted at 10 months (−13.7% [5.2%] vs. −9.6% [5.1%], p = 0.006). WL% was associated with baseline percentage fat mass but not with age or BMI. Body composition showed a decrease in fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and absolute lean mass.

- **Conclusions**: In a real-world setting, liraglutide 3.0 mg led to beneficial changes in weight loss and body composition, with a greater impact in women.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come [^113GgZn2]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs in reducing HbA1c by up to 1.9 percentage points compared with baseline and in promoting weight loss of up to 6.9 kg. There were also significant reductions in cardiovascular events and some renal outcomes in the absence of hypoglycemia due to their glucose‐dependent mechanism of action. While all approved GLP‐1 RAs have high glucose‐lowering and weight loss efficacy, there is variation within the drug class. Structural differences among GLP‐1 RAs influence duration of action, and their formulation and dosing may affect efficacy in reducing blood glucose and body weight, as well as the side effect profile and cardiovascular effects. However, an increased dosage of multiple approved GLP‐1 RAs has been studied in recent trials.

The AWARD‐11 trial compared dulaglutide at doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus the approved dose of 1.5 mg in people with T2D inadequately controlled with metformin. Indeed, escalation to a higher dose of dulaglutide provided clinically relevant, dose‐related reductions in HbA1c (1.72 percentage points vs. 1.61 percentage points vs. 1.55 percentage points with dulaglutide 4.5, 3.0, and 1.5 mg, respectively) and in body weight (4.9 kg vs. 4.0 kg vs. 3.4 kg with dulaglutide 4.5, 3.0, and 1.5 mg, respectively) at 52 weeks, with a similar safety profile.

Another example is the weekly injectable semaglutide, currently approved at doses of up to 1.0 mg for people with T2D and up to 2.4 mg for obesity management. In the STEP trials, semaglutide plus a lifestyle intervention was tested at the higher dose of 2.4 mg/week, specifically for.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: Moving towards efficacy improvement [^112fvYeA]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

STEP 4 was a phase-3a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial with 902 adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) with at least one weight-related comorbidity and without diabetes or an HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. The study aimed to evaluate how continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg, compared to withdrawing the treatment, affects weight maintenance in people with overweight or obesity after significant weight loss. After 20 weeks and a mean bodyweight loss of 10.6% with semaglutide, individuals who continued with semaglutide achieved an additional loss of 7.9% of body weight by week 68, versus a 6.9% weight gain with placebo (p < 0.001). Greater weight loss with continued treatment was associated with an early response at week 20; however, non-early responders could also achieve a ≥ 5% weight loss by week 68 if semaglutide treatment was continued. These results are consistent with the chronic and relapsing nature of obesity and indicate that continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg is required for sustained weight loss.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^114vYeLM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is the most prevalent chronic disease worldwide and drives significant morbidity and mortality. It increases the risk of a variety of other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. In the United States (US), approximately 71% of adults are overweight (defined as having a body mass index (BMI) in kg/m² greater than or equal to 25), including 41% who are obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 8% who are severely obese (BMI ≥ 40). The financial costs of excess adiposity are massive, with obesity resulting in over $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US every year.

We are currently in the midst of a revolution in weight loss interventions. While both lifestyle and older pharmaceutical approaches have demonstrated limited efficacy, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) receptor agonists have recently been shown to yield unprecedented levels of weight loss. For example, the incretin mimetics semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown via meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials to induce placebo-adjusted average body weight losses of 15.0% and 19.2%, respectively, and have demonstrated significant weight loss in a recent head-to-head comparison.
