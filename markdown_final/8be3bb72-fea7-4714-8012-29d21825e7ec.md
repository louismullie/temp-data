## Question

What is the appropriate treatment for an avulsion fracture off of the dorsal aspect of the base of the distal phalanx of the third finger with intra-articular extension, visualized only on the lateral view, with no other fracture of the right hand identified?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate treatment for an avulsion fracture off the dorsal base of the distal phalanx of the third finger with intra-articular extension, which sounds like a bony mallet finger injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and mechanism. Then, I should assess key radiographic parameters on a true lateral view, especially fragment size as a percentage of the articular surface and any volar subluxation of the distal phalanx. Next, I will map those findings to a treatment pathway, weighing nonoperative versus operative options. After that, I need to specify a nonoperative splinting protocol and monitoring plan, and finally, I should consider surgical indications, techniques, expected outcomes, and special scenarios such as pediatric or open injuries that could change management [^115CSzgE] [^114dn63M].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. The description of a dorsal avulsion at the base of the distal phalanx with intra-articular extension is classic for a bony mallet finger, caused by terminal extensor tendon avulsion with a bony fragment and resulting risk of DIP extensor lag if not managed properly, potentially progressing to a swan neck deformity if untreated or undertreated [^115CSzgE] [^114dn63M].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging requirements before jumping to treatment. I need to ensure a true lateral radiograph because mallet fractures and subtle volar subluxation are best appreciated on the lateral; I should also quantify the percentage of articular surface involved by the fragment and check for any volar subluxation of the distal phalanx, as these two factors guide management decisions most reliably in mallet fractures [^115CSzgE] [^116GxTEs].

> I will now examine the nonoperative pathway for a small fragment without subluxation. If the fragment involves less than roughly one-third of the articular surface and there is no volar subluxation, continuous DIP extension splinting is the standard of care and typically yields excellent results, so I should not over-medicalize this scenario unless compliance or skin complications threaten success [^115CSzgE] [^1128yWwh].

> Let me consider the scenario of a larger fragment without subluxation. Even when the fragment involves more than one-third of the articular surface, nonoperative management is reasonable and supported by clinical series and comparative studies showing union and similar functional outcomes relative to surgery in carefully selected cases without instability, so I can justify a trial of splinting if the joint remains concentrically reduced on serial lateral views [^112vSMiN] [^113aN9G9] [^115nwEPM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially started to generalize that even with volar subluxation I could still default to splinting based on reports of good nonoperative outcomes in some displaced cases; but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the mainstream indication: volar subluxation of the distal phalanx and/or fragment size greater than one-third of the articular surface are generally cited as indications to consider surgery, even though the literature has not definitively proven a major advantage of surgery in all such cases, which means I must individualize the decision by stability on closed reduction, patient factors, and the ability to maintain concentric reduction in a splint [^112vSMiN] [^115CSzgE] [^115nwEPM].

> Next, I should review the nonoperative protocol details when I choose splinting. I need to ensure strict immobilization of the DIP joint alone in full extension at all times, typically for 6 to 8 weeks continuously, followed by 1 to 2 additional weeks at night; I should double-check that skin care is done without allowing DIP flexion, and I need to select an orthosis that minimizes skin complications and pain, with randomized data suggesting Quickcast reduces skin issues and discomfort compared with a custom thermoplastic orthosis while achieving similar final extensor lag and need for surgery [^114dn63M] [^113FHkMa].

> I need to ensure monitoring preserves alignment. Weekly skin checks help avoid maceration and pressure ulcers, and I should obtain a follow-up lateral radiograph around the 6-week mark to verify maintained reduction and union; given that the DIP joint is more tolerant of some displacement than the PIP joint, a small residual extensor lag can be compatible with good function and does not necessarily mandate surgery if the patient is satisfied and pain is controlled [^116GxTEs] [^111eVYia] [^115nwEPM].

> If instability persists or volar subluxation cannot be corrected or maintained, I should review operative options. Let me reconsider favored techniques: percutaneous extension block pinning is commonly employed and can provide excellent reduction with low extensor lag when performed well, while alternative devices like hook plates are described for small avulsion fragments around the interphalangeal joints, though data are mostly from case series and technique articles, so I should align the method with fragment size, surgeon expertise, and soft-tissue envelope [^115hTnWM] [^113aN9G9] [^115jPb8t].

> But wait, what if this is a pediatric patient or there is an associated nail-fold injury suggesting an open fracture pattern. I should double-check for the Seymour-equivalent scenario by examining the nail plate position and nail bed; if present, I need urgent irrigation and debridement, reduction, stabilization as indicated, and antibiotics to reduce the risk of osteomyelitis, recognizing that pediatric phalangeal fractures can malunite rapidly and warrant timely, meticulous assessment and follow-up [^112WFEbr] [^112oX8mB] [^1168ASxM].

> Finally, I should review expected outcomes and counsel on risks. I need to emphasize that both high-quality splinting and surgery generally achieve union with low pain and similar final extensor lag across strategies in many cases, that splinting carries skin-complication risk mitigated by orthosis choice and vigilance, and that unrecognized or undertreated mallet injuries can evolve into swan neck deformity requiring surgical reconstruction or DIP fusion in a subset of chronic cases, which we should aim to prevent through early, stable, and compliant management [^115nwEPM] [^113FHkMa] [^114dn63M] [^116M9kyv].

For a dorsal avulsion fracture at the base of the distal phalanx with intra-articular extension, **nonoperative management is first-line** if the fragment is small (< 30% of the articular surface), minimally displaced (< 2 mm), and there is no volar subluxation [^114dn63M] [^115CSzgE]. Use a **stack or custom thermoplastic splint** to immobilize the DIP joint in slight hyperextension for 6–8 weeks [^113FHkMa] [^1128yWwh], then wean over 2–4 weeks with early motion. Surgery is indicated for larger fragments, displacement > 2 mm, or volar subluxation, with extension block pinning or hook plate fixation as options [^115hTnWM] [^114irBzr]. Early motion and hand therapy are essential to minimize stiffness and extensor lag [^1113bcSc].

---

## Indications for nonoperative management

Nonoperative management is appropriate when the following criteria are present:

- **Fragment size**: < 30% of the articular surface [^114dn63M] [^115CSzgE].
- **Displacement**: < 2 mm.
- **Subluxation**: No volar subluxation of the distal phalanx [^114dn63M].
- **Patient factors**: Reliable, compliant, and able to adhere to splinting [^1128yWwh].

---

## Nonoperative management protocol

### Initial management

Perform gentle closed reduction if needed [^114dn63M], then **immobilize the DIP joint** in slight hyperextension with a stack or custom thermoplastic splint, keeping the PIP free [^113FHkMa]. Maintain **continuous immobilization for 6–8 weeks** [^1128yWwh].

---

### Follow-up and rehabilitation

Obtain **radiographs at 1 and 2 weeks** to confirm alignment. Wean the splint gradually over 2–4 weeks with night splinting, and **begin early active ROM** with hand therapy to prevent stiffness and extensor lag.

---

## Indications for surgical management

Surgical intervention is indicated when any of the following are present:

- **Fragment size**: > 30% of the articular surface [^114dn63M] [^115CSzgE].
- **Displacement**: > 2 mm.
- **Subluxation**: Volar subluxation of the distal phalanx [^114dn63M] [^115CSzgE].
- **Failure**: Nonoperative management fails or patient is noncompliant [^115nwEPM].

---

## Surgical techniques

| **Attribute** | **Extension block pinning** | **Hook plate fixation** |
|-|-|-|
| Technique | Percutaneous K-wire to maintain reduction | Small hook plate for stable fixation |
| Indications | Displacement > 2 mm or volar subluxation | Larger fragments or failed nonoperative care [^114irBzr] |
| Outcomes | Good union and function with early motion [^115hTnWM] | Stable fixation allowing early motion and good function [^114irBzr] [^115jPb8t] |

---

## Potential complications

### Nonoperative management

Nonoperative management may result in persistent **extensor lag** or mallet deformity and can cause **DIP joint stiffness** [^114dn63M]. **Nonunion is rare**, but skin irritation or breakdown from splinting can occur [^112vSMiN] [^113FHkMa].

---

### Surgical management

- **Infection**: Pin tract or wound infection [^115hTnWM].
- **Hardware issues**: Irritation or prominence [^114irBzr].
- **Stiffness**: DIP joint stiffness [^115nwEPM].
- **Nonunion**: Rare [^115hTnWM].

---

## Prognosis and functional outcomes

Nonoperative management generally yields good results with minimal lag and high satisfaction when criteria are met [^112vSMiN]. In contrast, **surgical** management also achieves good outcomes with stable fixation and early motion but carries a higher complication risk than nonoperative care [^115nwEPM] [^113aN9G9].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Fragment size** | **Displacement** | **Subluxation** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| < 30% | < 2 mm | None | Nonoperative (splinting) [^114dn63M] [^1128yWwh] |
| > 30% | > 2 mm | Present | Surgical (extension block pinning or hook plate) [^115hTnWM] [^114irBzr] |

---

Nonoperative management is preferred for small, minimally displaced dorsal avulsion fractures with intra-articular extension; surgery is reserved for larger fragments, significant displacement, or volar subluxation. Early motion and hand therapy are **critical** to optimize function and limit stiffness [^1113bcSc].

Mallet finger is a common injury of the extensor tendon insertion, causing an extension lag of the distal interphalangeal joint.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the most literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of mallet finger injuries, focusing on the indications and outcomes of surgical intervention.

- **Results**: Nonoperative management has been advocated for almost all mallet finger injuries; however, complex injuries are usually treated surgically. There is still controversy regarding the absolute indications for surgical intervention.

- **Conclusions**: Although surgery is generally indicated in the case of mallet fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface, as well as in all patients who develop volar subluxation of the distal phalanx, a significant advantage of surgical management even in those complicated cases has yet to be clearly proven.

### Nonsurgical treatment of closed mallet finger fractures [^112vSMiN]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Surgical repair of closed mallet finger fractures has been traditionally favored for displaced injuries that involve more than one third of the articular surface and for injuries with palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx. This study analyzed the outcomes of nonsurgical treatment for closed and displaced mallet finger fractures with greater than one-third articular surface damage. It compared cases with and without concomitant terminal joint subluxation.

Twenty-two closed mallet finger fractures in 21 patients, treated nonsurgically and involving more than one third of the articular surface, were reviewed retrospectively. The patients underwent continuous extension splinting of the distal interphalangeal joint for a mean of 5.5 weeks. The average patient age at the time of injury was 35.2 years, with a mean delay to treatment of 21 days. Nine cases showed a reduced distal interphalangeal joint at presentation (type IB), while 13 cases exhibited palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx (type IIB). Complications from splinting were limited to two cases of transient skin irritation. All patients returned for new finger radiographs and completed a survey to assess pain, function, and satisfaction, on average 24.5 months after injury.

Patients reported negligible pain, minimal difficulties with daily activities and work, and relatively high satisfaction with finger function and treatment outcome. However, they only expressed marginal satisfaction regarding finger appearance. The differences in outcomes between type IB and type IIB cases were not significant.

### Effectiveness of quickcast versus custom-fabricated thermoplastic orthosis immobilization for the treatment of mallet fingers: A randomized clinical trial [^113FHkMa]. Hand (2022). High credibility.

Mallet finger is a common injury involving a detachment of the terminal extensor tendon from the distal phalanx. This injury is usually treated with immobilization in a cast or splint. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of mallet fingers treated with either a cast (Quickcast) or a traditional thermoplastic custom-fabricated orthosis.

- **Methods**: Our study was a prospective, assessor-blinded, single-center randomized clinical trial of 58 consecutive patients diagnosed with bony or soft tissue mallet finger treated with immobilization. Patients were randomized to receive either an Orfilight thermoplastic custom-fabricated orthosis or a Quickcast orthosis. Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, and 10 weeks for bony mallets and 4, 8, and 12 weeks for soft tissue mallets. Skin complications, pain with orthosis, compliance, the need for surgical intervention, and extensor lag were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: Both bony and soft tissue mallet finger patients experienced significantly fewer skin complications (33% vs. 64%) and less pain (11.2 vs. 21.6) when using Quickcast compared with an Orfilight thermoplastic custom-fabricated orthosis. The soft tissue mallet group revealed a greater difference in pain, favoring Quickcast (6.2 vs. 22). No significant differences in final extensor droop or the need for secondary surgery were found between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: Quickcast immobilization for the treatment of mallet finger demonstrated fewer skin complications and less pain compared with Orfilight custom-fabricated splints.

### Modification of the extension block Kirschner wire technique for mallet fractures [^115hTnWM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

A modification of the extension block Kirschner wire technique that is used for closed reduction of mallet fractures is described. Eighteen mallet avulsion fractures of the distal phalanx treated with this modification were included in this prospective study. The fingers affected were nine small fingers, eight ring fingers, and one long finger. Surgical indications included fractures involving more than 33% of the articular surface and fractures associated with subluxation of the distal phalanx that could not be corrected by closed reduction. The average joint surface involvement was 39.8%.

At follow-up, only one patient had pain, and that was graded as minimal. Objectively, congruous and satisfactory joint surfaces were present in 17 patients. No patient had pseudarthrosis. The average active flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint was 81.1 degrees, and the average extensor lag was 1.6 degrees. Neither pin tract infections nor migration of the pins occurred. The average follow-up was 27.3 months.

This modification increased the range of motion at the distal interphalangeal joint and showed a trend toward reduced permanent extensor lag compared with the original method. This technique should be considered when planning treatment of a mallet fracture using the extension block Kirschner wire technique.

### The hook plate technique for fixation of phalangeal avulsion fractures [^114irBzr]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Avulsion fractures of the phalanges involve small osseous fragments that are usually attached to structures necessary for stability or movement of the joint. Satisfactory healing of the fracture to preserve joint function may require open reduction and internal fixation, which can be difficult because of the small size of the fragments.

- **Methods**: We used a hook plate fashioned from a 1.3-mm Synthes titanium plate in thirteen patients with a phalangeal avulsion fracture. Four patients had an avulsion fracture of the volar plate with dorsal proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation, four had a dorsal avulsion fracture of the extensor central slip from the middle phalanx, three had a flexor digitorum profundus avulsion fracture from the distal phalanx, and two had an avulsion fracture of the phalangeal insertion of the collateral ligament.

- **Results**: Union without complications was achieved in all cases. After an average duration of follow-up of seventeen months, all patients had a good to excellent result, and the average total interphalangeal motion was 149°.

- **Conclusions**: This indirect fixation technique produces stable fixation allowing early active finger motion.

### The impact of microsurgery on the treatment of ring avulsion injuries [^117H8bQz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Treating ring avulsion injuries continues to challenge the reconstructive hand surgeon. The complex operation draws from plastic surgery and orthopedic surgery principles to provide soft-tissue coverage, skeletal fixation, tendon repair, and neurovascular reconstruction. Furthermore, the application of microsurgical techniques has enabled the revascularization and replantation of completely avulsed fingers.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 22 consecutive ring avulsion injuries (seven amputations, five replantations, and 10 revascularizations) from 1987 to 2015 performed by a single senior surgeon (D.T.W.C.) was conducted.

- **Results**: Of these 22 ring avulsions, 10 revascularizations, five replantations, and seven amputations (five because of clinical factors, and two because of patient request) were performed. None of the 15 replantations and revascularizations resulted in loss of the ring finger or necrosis of the revascularized tip.

- **Conclusions**: With proper patient selection, the appropriate level of injury identification, and meticulous surgical execution, the restoration of form and function to the hand is feasible in ring avulsion injuries.

- **Clinical question/Level of evidence**: Therapeutic, IV.

### Pediatric phalanx fractures: Unique challenges and pitfalls [^1168ASxM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

The hand is the most frequently injured part of the body in children. Most pediatric hand fractures can be treated by nonoperative means with good results. However, a subset of fractures requires prompt recognition and surgical intervention. Several pediatric phalangeal fracture types must be recognized and treated appropriately to minimize complications and disability. These injuries defy the general conception that pediatric fractures universally do well with minimal intervention.

This paper highlights two important concepts:

- **Phalangeal fractures in children can differ considerably from other pediatric fractures**: Tolerance of displacement may be small in juxtaarticular or intraarticular fractures.

- **Phalangeal fractures in children can be very different from those in adults**: Healing is rapid in phalangeal fractures, allowing displaced fractures to develop into malunions in a short period of time, with resultant deformity and dysfunction.

Careful clinical examination of any suspected phalanx fracture in children is essential to appropriate treatment of these potentially problematic injuries. This includes adequate radiographic evaluation with multiple views of the suspected fracture site and thorough examination of possible open injuries.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^111CPY3N]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The most notable finding of this study was that union rates for tuberosity avulsion fractures were found to be independent of both initial treatment choice and degree of fracture displacement. Non-displaced zone 1 fractures demonstrated particularly uncomplicated union rates following non-operative management. Outcome analysis of displaced zone 1 fractures, however, also demonstrated similar union rates for surgical and conservative treatment, albeit with a more limited dataset. In contradistinction, both higher union rates and faster times to union were found following the surgical management of zone 2 fractures when compared to conservative treatment methods. Acute proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures appear to be a rare occurrence in the literature, and therefore an optimized treatment algorithm cannot be determined at this time.

### Avulsion injuries of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon [^1153EcMx]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Avulsions of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon may involve tendon retraction into the palm and fractures of the distal phalanx. Although various repair techniques have been described, none has emerged as superior to others. A review of the literature provides evidence-based premises for treatment: multi-strand repairs perform better, gapping may be seen with pullout suture-dorsal button repairs, and failure due to bone pullout remains a concern with suture anchor methods. Clinical prognostic factors include the extent of proximal tendon retraction, the chronicity of the avulsion, and the presence and size of associated osseous fragments. Patients must be counseled appropriately regarding anticipated outcomes, the importance of postoperative rehabilitation, and potential complications. Treatment alternatives for chronic avulsion injury remain patient-specific and include nonsurgical management, distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis, and staged reconstruction.

### Operative fractures of the phalangeal head and neck in children-does open reduction affect outcomes [^1118BxFC]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). High credibility.

Hand fractures are common in the pediatric population, comprising an estimated 15% of fractures seen in the emergency department, and most of these occur in the phalanges, with 10% to 15% being phalangeal head or neck sub-types.

Pediatric phalangeal neck fractures are described as inherently unstable with poor remodeling potential because they occur at the distal end of the phalanges, away from the physis. Al-Qattan originally described and developed a classification and treatment algorithm for phalangeal neck fractures, with Type I being nondisplaced, Type II displaced with bony contact, and Type III displaced without any bony contact. He recommended pin fixation for unstable, displaced Type II and all Type III fractures, with a strong preference for open reduction. Most displaced phalangeal head and neck fractures in children are treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP). However, if healing and early callus formation make closed reduction impossible, these fractures require anatomic reduction through either open or percutaneous osteoclasis and percutaneous pinning. Additional indications for open reduction include failure of conservative treatment, unsuccessful closed reduction, and delayed presentation with impending malunion.

### Suture stabilization of open physeal fractures of the great toe distal phalanx (Seymour fracture) [^112yxz41]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Low credibility.

Open physeal fractures of the distal phalanx of the hallux are analogous to Seymour fractures of the hand. When missed, these injuries can result in long-term sequelae, including infection, pain, nail deformity, and physeal arrest. Nevertheless, there is a paucity in the literature regarding the optimal surgical treatment for these challenging injuries. We present a novel technique and case series for suture-only stabilization of Seymour fractures of the great toe.

- **Methods**: Billing records were used to identify all children aged 18 years or younger who underwent operative treatment for open distal phalanx fracture of the hallux with an associated nail bed injury. Electronic medical records and plain imaging were reviewed to identify the mechanism of injury, surgical technique, results, complications, and follow-up.

- **Results**: Five boys with a mean age of 10.3 years (range, 5 to 13 years) met the inclusion criteria. Forty percent (2/5) of the injuries were missed by the initial treating providers. Only two patients presented primarily to our institution, while 60% (3/5) were transferred from other facilities. The mechanism of injury was variable but generally involved "stubbing" the toe. The mean time from injury to surgical treatment was 2.6 days (range, 0 to 6 days). The median follow-up was 2 months (range, 1 to 96 months). No patient complications (including infection) or reoperations were reported. On follow-up imaging, no physeal bars were evident in patients treated with the suture-only technique.

- **Conclusions**: Seymour fractures of the hallux are uncommon, and there is frequently a delay in both diagnosis and treatment.

### Pinckney fracture: Do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^113nkXjE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Toe injuries are common in the emergency department, and most are treated conservatively. In some circumstances, these injuries can present as a physeal fracture with concomitant soft-tissue injury affecting the nail bed, resulting in a hidden open fracture. To adequately treat these patients, a high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose and treat open fractures and prevent complications such as infection, osteomyelitis, malunion, and premature physeal arrest.

We report a case of a patient admitted to the hospital with a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the distal phalanx of the hallux. After confirming the diagnosis, antibiotic treatment was started, and the fracture was reduced and fixed.

The literature on this entity is sparse, and most management protocols are based on its hand equivalent — the Seymour fracture — emphasizing the low threshold for treating these lesions as an open fracture.

### Mallet finger in a toddler: A rare but easily missed injury [^115pc5oC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

A mallet finger is a flexion deformity of a finger at the distal interphalangeal joint due to an injury of the extensor mechanism at the base of the distal phalanx. Most common in middle-aged men, injuries in the pediatric population are less common and rare in toddlers. We describe a case of missed mallet finger and its subsequent treatment in a female toddler.

### Operative fractures of the phalangeal head and neck in children-does open reduction affect outcomes [^112gKXAN]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). High credibility.

Based on Al-Qattan's classification, the CCR group had significantly more excellent results than both COR and OI groups (P < 0.00050), with OI having significantly more poor results compared with COR and CCR (P < 0.05). Among 13 patients with poor results in the OI group, 12 had AVN, 8 had significant stiffness, and 3 had residual deformity great enough to compromise function. Several patients had multiple issues that caused poor function. One patient with a proximal phalanx neck fracture and associated digital nerve, artery, and extensor mechanism injuries went on to undergo a partial finger amputation at the P1 level of the fracture after the failure of arterial repair 11 days postoperatively. No AVN of the bone was noted at the time of amputation. Another patient developed a nonunion that was asymptomatic. For the 2 poor results in the COR group, 1 was stiff at the PIP joint, and 1 had AVN. Of the CCR group's poor results (3 patients), 2 had AVN, and the other had cascade-altering rotational deformity but ultimately declined corrective surgery. Three infections were reported: 2 in the OI group and 1 in CCR, which all resolved with a 14-day course of Clindamycin.

There were a total of 142 extra-articular fractures, 23 intra-articular fractures, and 1 unknown without available injury radiographs. Intra-articular fractures showed a significantly higher rate of AVN (30.4% vs. 5.6%, P < 0.0005). Stiffness was present in 19.7% of extra-articular versus 39.1% of intra-articular fractures (P < 0.05). ROM data was available for 128 extra-articular and 19 intra-articular fractures.

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: Preliminary results [^111WCGWv]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the wide variety of techniques and devices available, complex unstable fractures of the base of the second phalanx (P2) remain a challenge for hand surgeons. The goals of surgical treatment are to restore joint congruity, allowing the return of native kinematics, and to provide stability to withstand the forces of early mobilization. Fracture comminution is often associated with these injuries and may preclude stable internal fixation. Additionally, there is a reduced risk of infection and other complications commonly associated with external fixation pin tracts. The internal joint stabilizer provides stability and allows immediate range of motion (ROM), which is crucial for a successful outcome. This treatment option is applicable across a wide spectrum of injury patterns involving the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Contraindications for this method include a tenuous soft tissue envelope and infection.

The results of this study are comparable to those reported for external fixation in PIP fracture-dislocations. Badia et al. reported a series of six patients treated with a dynamic external fixator; the PIP ROM was 5° to 89° at a mean follow-up of 24 months. There were two early pin tract infections. Sastravaha et al. presented an alternative external fixator using a syringe to maintain distraction force. Across 13 patients, the mean PIP ROM was 89° (range: 70°-104°) at a mean follow-up of six months. One patient developed a pin tract infection and underwent debridement with removal of the fixator. Inanami et al. treated four patients with a small dynamic external finger fixator following acute injuries.

### Hook plate as a treatment for flexor digitorum profundus avulsion types II and III [^1118RA61]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

Avulsion fracture types II and III of flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), also called Jersey Finger, in flexor zone 1 are an uncommon pathology requiring surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether hook miniplates were an accessible and reliable option to repair FDP avulsion types II and III. Between July and August 2018, we treated two consecutive patients with zone 1 Leddy-Packer type II and III FDP injuries using hook plates and 1.2 × 7 mm screws included in the Medartis Aptus Hand fixation system set. The patients were aged 37 and 39 years, a man and a woman, respectively. At the end of the follow-up, we evaluated the Visual Analog Scale, range of motion, grip strength, and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores. Both patients completed 12 months of follow-up with excellent functional and radiological results; neither presented complications or residual disability.

This injury has been treated with a wide range of surgical techniques, including anchor suture, pullout button sutures, screws, and plates. However, due to the difficulty in surgical fixation of fragments around finger joints, limited access to ligaments and tendons, and the lack of cases, none of the techniques have emerged as a clear option above others. Hook plates placed in the distal phalanx emerge as a surgical treatment for FDP avulsion types II and III in flexor zone 1, with excellent clinical outcomes.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: Working group on craniosynostosis [^117BUvf2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Radiography reveals specific characteristics of the thumb, which always has two phalanges: a better-developed distal phalanx and a proximal deltapalanx. This characteristic does not apply to type 3 hands. Over time, fusion of the proximal and distal phalanges of the thumb can occur. The MCP joints are consistently visible. Depending on the hand type, fusion can exist between the end phalanges of digits 2 and 3; 2, 3, and 4; or between all fingers. Occasionally, there is fusion between the basis metacarpal (MC) 4 and MC 5, occurring in 77% of non-type 1 hands. Carpal fusion between the capitate bone and the hamate bone is also possible.

Additional anatomic deformities in the hands include a deviating vein pattern and nerve pattern, especially distal at the MC level. Deformities of the flexor retinaculum, flexor tendons, extensor tendons, and intrinsic hand muscles are observed. These anatomic variations have significant implications for surgical treatment.

- **Elbows**: In the majority of the 10 Apert patients evaluated, elbow functions were normal, with less than half exhibiting radiologic deformities. Limited elbow functionality showed a strong positive correlation with the severity of hand and foot deformities. Progression toward synostosis will occur in patients with no elbow movement at birth; however, a proximal underarm synostosis between the radius and ulna was not reported.

- **Shoulders**: A study on 19 Apert patients reported prominent acromion, a broad major tuberositas, a small glenoid fossa of scapula, an indistinctly defined anatomic neck of the humerus, and an oval-shaped humeral head. The most consistent finding was glenoid dysplasia.

### Stability of fixation of proximal phalanx unicondylar fractures of the hand: A biomechanical cadaver study [^112RFEd4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the relative stability of various fixation methods for proximal phalanx intra-articular unicondylar fractures during simulated early active motion, we created proximal phalangeal intra-articular unicondylar fractures in 13 fresh-frozen human cadaveric hands. Using a saw through a dorsal approach, we made an osteotomy beginning in the intercondylar notch and extending proximally at a 45° angle to the radial border of the proximal phalanx. We fixed each of the four fingers on each hand with a 1.5-mm headless compression screw, a 1.5-mm lag screw, two 1.1-mm smooth K-wires, or one 1.1-mm smooth K-wire. The order of constructs was rotated randomly for each hand. We simulated active range of motion on a custom-loading device at 0.25 Hz from full finger extension to full flexion for 2,000 cycles and measured displacement by a differential variable reluctance transducer.

We found no significant differences in displacement of the fracture site among the four methods of fixation. Movement in the control specimen with no osteotomy fixation was significantly higher than with each of the other fixation methods.

Biomechanical stability did not differ among the fixation methods for proximal phalanx unicondylar fractures in a flexion-extension active range of motion model. Clinically, fixation of these fractures with any of the methods tested may provide sufficient stability to withstand postoperative therapy when there is no substantial resistance to active motion.

### Fractures of the base of the proximal phalanx in children: Remodeling of malunion in the radioulnar plane with a diaphyseal axis-metacarpal head angle of 156° to 163° [^1112bTKm]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The diaphyseal axis-metacarpal head angle (DHA) measures the angle between the axis of the proximal phalanx and the center of the metacarpal head. In unfractured fingers, the normal DHA ranges from 177.1° to 180.0°. The angle may be used to quantify the degree of lateral displacement of pediatric fractures of the base of the proximal phalanx. Previous authors have shown that if the postreduction X-rays show an angle greater than 169°, remodeling with normalization of the DHA is expected to occur in children. The degree of remodeling of more severe angulations is unknown.

- **Patients and methods**: This is a retrospective study over the last 5 years that identified 8 late referrals (4–6 weeks after injury) of inadequately reduced pediatric fractures of the base of the proximal phalanx with a postreduction DHA of 156° to 163°. At the time of presentation, there was lateral deviation of the finger, and the fracture site was not tender, indicating malunion. All patients were offered surgery, but this was refused by the parents. Follow-up appointments to the clinic were made, and the DHAs were serially measured to investigate the degree of remodeling.

- **Results**: Seven patients had normalization of the DHA (i.e. an angle > 177°) between 9 and 18 months. In the remaining patient, the DHA was 175.7° at 2 years.

- **Conclusions**: The study shows adequate remodeling of severe residual angular deformities (DHA of 156°-163°). The clinical implication of this finding concerns late referrals with no tenderness at the fracture site. In these cases, refracturing.

### Fracture-dislocation about the finger joints [^111eVYia]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Fracture-dislocations in the small joints of the fingers are challenging injuries. The surgeon must choose an appropriate treatment based on fracture pattern, joint stability, and injury chronicity. Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint are notoriously unforgiving, with the potential for long-term sequelae of residual pain and stiffness. Similar injuries in the distal interphalangeal joint are more tolerant of fracture displacement and even joint subluxation. Dorsal dislocations of the metacarpophalangeal joint may be associated with shearing fractures of the metacarpal head but are most notable for the volar plate interposition that may block closed reduction.

### Surgical management of swan neck deformity following mallet finger injury: A review of 25 patients over 20 years [^116M9kyv]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Swan neck deformity develops as a sequela of chronic mallet finger. Surgical management can include soft tissue reconstruction or distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) fusion. Studies examining the incidence and management of posttraumatic swan neck deformity following mallet fracture are limited.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-institution review of patients undergoing surgical management of swan neck deformity following a traumatic mallet finger from 2000 to 2021 was performed. Patients with preexisting rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. Injury, preoperative clinical, and surgical characteristics were recorded along with postoperative outcomes and complications.

- **Results**: Twenty-five patients were identified who had surgical intervention for swan neck deformity. Sixty-four percent of mallet fingers were chronic. The median time to development of mallet finger was 2 months. Twelve (48%) mallet fingers were Doyle class I, 6 (24%) were class III, and 7 (28%) were class IVB. Forty percent of injuries failed nonoperative splinting trials. Sixteen (64%) underwent primary DIPJ arthrodesis, 8 (32%) underwent DIPJ pinning, and 1 underwent open reduction and internal fixation of mallet fracture. The complication rate was 50% overall, and 33% of surgeries experienced major complications. The overall reoperation rate was 33%. Proximal interphalangeal joint hyperextension improved by 11° on average. The median follow-up was 61.2 months.

- **Conclusions**: The development of symptomatic swan neck deformity following traumatic mallet finger injury is rare. All patients warrant attention for potential complications and reoperation.

### Consequences of avulsion fracture of the proximal phalanx caused by a technical failure of hallux valgus surgery [^112BbU32]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Several cases of avulsion fracture of the proximal phalanx of the big toe during the lateral capsular release procedure were observed, yet these fractures have not been reported as a complication of hallux valgus surgery. The purpose of the present study was to report the proximal phalanx base fracture as an unrecognized complication and to evaluate the clinical and radiographic consequences of this complication. We retrospectively reviewed 225 feet that underwent hallux valgus surgery involving proximal chevron osteotomy and distal soft tissue release from May 2009 to December 2012. Of these 225 feet (198 patients), 12 (5.3%) developed proximal phalanx base fracture postoperatively, and these patients were assigned to the fracture group. The remaining patients were assigned to the nonfracture group.

Patients were followed to observe whether the fractures united and whether degenerative changes developed at the first metatarsophalangeal joint due to this fracture. The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range 12 to 72 months). All subjects in the fracture and nonfracture groups underwent weightbearing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the foot at the initial presentation and final follow-up point. The two groups were compared with respect to the hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, range of motion, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, satisfaction, and degenerative changes. No significant differences were found in age, follow-up period, hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, or American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score.

### Interventions for treating mallet finger injuries [^1128yWwh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Mallet finger, also called drop or baseball finger, is a condition where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened due to injury of the extensor tendon mechanism. Treatment commonly involves splinting the finger for six or more weeks. Less frequently, surgical fixation is used to correct the deformity.

- **Objectives**: To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of treating mallet finger injuries.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group trials register (November 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 2, 2004), EMBASE (1988 to 2004 week 8), and other databases, as well as reference lists of articles and various conference proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials evaluating different interventions, including no intervention, for treating mallet finger injuries.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently performed study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Four trials were included. These involved a total of 278 mainly adult participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. All four trials were methodologically flawed, including inadequate outcome assessment. Three trials compared different types of finger splints versus a standard Stack splint. One trial found a lower incidence of treatment failure in participants treated with a perforated custom-made splint. One trial found there were fewer…

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: Short- to medium-term outcomes [^11713QN6]. Hand (2025).

Hand fractures are common and account for up to a third of all fractures presenting to emergency departments, with phalangeal fractures occurring more commonly than those involving the metacarpals. Injury to the proximal phalanx comprises 39% of all phalangeal fractures and poses a significant financial and health burden to both the individual and the community. Thus, optimal management is key.

The treatment objective once the proximal phalanx is fractured is to ensure sufficient stability in a satisfactorily reduced position to allow early mobilization, thereby preventing the formation of adhesions that may limit range of motion and function. Many of these fractures are stable and can be treated nonoperatively. However, fracture pattern and mechanism, as well as patient characteristics and functional requirements, may necessitate surgical intervention. Rigid fixation constructs are generally preferred to nonrigid fixation, as they facilitate precise alignment and earlier mobilization. However, stable fixation is only one determinant of outcome, with invasiveness, degree of soft tissue dissection, and cost also important considerations.

Intramedullary screw fixation of phalangeal and metacarpal fractures has gained popularity as a method of providing rigid internal fixation with minimum tendon disturbance, allowing early mobilization and rehabilitation, with novel methods of instrumentation broadening the indications. Screws may be inserted via retrograde intra-articular, antegrade intra-articular, and antegrade transarticular routes, with choice determined by the specifics of the fracture and patient requirements.

### The versatile hook plate in avulsion fractures of the hand [^115jPb8t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Avulsion fractures can pose technical difficulties for surgical fixation as the fragments are often small and located around finger joints, making access difficult due to the attachment of ligaments or tendons. Traditionally, these have been treated using K wires, lag screws, or pullout sutures. Hook plates were originally described for the operative management of mallet fractures. Our unit has been using hook plates for over 10 years, and over time, we have extended their use to other avulsion fractures in the hand, such as proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations, central slip avulsions, flexor digitorum profundus avulsions, and collateral ligament avulsions. The aim of this article is to describe the technique of fabricating a hook plate and using it for avulsion fractures in the hand. A few illustrative cases are discussed, along with a review of the literature.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective review of our use of hook plates in hand fractures from 2008 to 2014, a total of 63 cases were identified from the hospital database. There were 35 cases of mallet fractures, 16 cases of proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations, 5 cases of flexor digitorum profundus avulsion fractures, 5 cases of central slip avulsions, and 2 collateral ligament avulsions.

- **Results**: All fractures healed well with this technique, with no biomechanical failures and good functional outcomes. Plates needed removal in a total of 25 cases, of which 14 were in mallet fractures. Thirteen (21%) cases suffered complications, the majority of which were related to mallet fractures.

### What middle phalanx base fracture characteristics are most reliable and useful for surgical decision-making [^112KLGSX]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint are challenging due to subluxation and articular damage, which can lead to arthrosis. Treatments for these fractures are often imperfect. Ideally, a surgeon could predict the necessity for surgical intervention based on radiographic evidence, yet it remains uncertain if middle phalanx base fracture characteristics are reliable enough to guide surgical decision-making.

- **Questions/purposes**: We evaluated (1) the degree of interobserver agreement as a function of fracture characteristics, (2) the differences in interobserver agreement between experienced and less-experienced hand surgeons, and (3) which fracture characteristics and surgeon attributes were associated with the decision for operative treatment.

- **Methods**: Ninety-nine (33%) of 296 hand surgeons evaluated 21 intra-articular middle phalanx base fractures on lateral radiographs. Among these, 81 surgeons (82%) were in academic practice, and 57 (58%) had less than 10 years of experience. Participants assessed six fracture characteristics and recommended treatment — either nonoperative or operative (including extension block pinning, external fixation, open reduction and internal fixation, volar plate arthroplasty, or hemihamate autograft arthroplasty) — for all cases.

- **Results**: When all surgeons were pooled together, the interobserver agreement for fracture characteristics was substantial for assessing a 2-mm articular step or gap (kappa, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; p < 0.001) and for subluxation or dislocation (kappa, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.86; p < 0.001).

### Fracture dislocation of the finger joints [^115cghKd]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fracture dislocations of the hand are difficult and often unforgiving injuries. Keys to treatment include early recognition, stable concentric reduction, and protected early active range of motion while maintaining joint stability. The balance between stability and mobility is difficult to manage; therefore, surgeons need a wide array of treatments to tailor management to the specific fracture pattern. With appropriate treatment, residual stiffness and pain can be minimized. This concepts review aims to provide up-to-date management for proximal interphalangeal, distal interphalangeal, and metacarpophalangeal joint fracture dislocations.

### Open physeal fracture of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^112oX8mB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Open physeal fractures of the distal phalanx of the hallux are the lesser described counterpart to the same fracture of the finger, known by its eponym as a "Seymour fracture". Displaced Salter-Harris phalangeal fractures present with a concomitant nailbed or soft tissue injury. Often, these fractures occur in the summer months when open-toe footwear can be worn; however, they may occur indoors as well. Frequently, the injury results from a direct axial load of the toe, or "stubbing", which in turn causes the fracture and associated soft tissue injury.

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent negative sequelae such as osteomyelitis, malunion, nonunion, or premature growth arrest. In this article, we present a 12-year-old male who sustained an open physeal fracture of the distal phalanx when he "stubbed" his great toe on a bed post. His injury was initially misdiagnosed at an urgent care facility, thereby delaying appropriate intervention and necessitating an operative surgical procedure. Additionally, we review the existing literature discussing these infrequently reported injuries and present key points as they pertain to the diagnosis and management of this injury in the emergency department.

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: Preliminary results [^111uM8Ue]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Unstable fractures of the base of the middle phalanx are notorious for causing chronic loss of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint function, and they remain a challenge for the hand surgeon. We report on a temporary intraoperatively constructed internal joint stabilizer for unstable PIP joint injuries.

- **Methods**: Across two institutions, a retrospective chart review was performed for cases with an acute presentation of pilon fracture or fracture-dislocation of the base of the middle phalanx, which were surgically treated with an internal joint stabilizer. Information collected included time from injury to surgical intervention, time from implantation to device removal, complications, and preoperative and postoperative range of motion.

- **Results**: Seven patients met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 51 (range: 24–72) years and a mean follow-up of 29 (range: 11–72) months. After removal of the fixator, the mean arc of PIP joint motion was 8° to 88° (range: 0°-100°). There were no infections, no hardware loosening or failures, and no revision procedures.

The findings are comparable to the results for dynamic external fixators. An internal joint stabilizer for unstable injuries to the base of the middle phalanx provides satisfactory functional outcomes, allows early postoperative motion, and mitigates the routine complications which may arise with external fixation.

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: Short- to medium-term outcomes [^115C5hNG]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Recently, intramedullary screw fixation has been advocated to address concerns of tendon disturbance minimization while providing sufficient stability to facilitate early mobilization. Intramedullary screws can be inserted via retrograde (through a flexed proximal interphalangeal joint into the head of the proximal phalanx); intra-articular antegrade (where the proximal phalanx base is subluxated at the metacarpophalangeal joint to facilitate direct entry); and transarticular (where the screw is inserted through the metacarpal head into the base of the proximal phalanx) routes.

Various biomechanical and cadaveric studies have alleviated concerns surrounding this technique. Ibanez found that intramedullary screw fixation provides greater construct stability and load to failure than lateral plating. Vegas found that the insertion of 2.8-mm screws via retrograde insertion damaged 6.2% of the articular surface of the head of cadaveric proximal phalanges, while a 4.1-mm screw affected 13.4%. Retrograde insertion also preserved the central slip, with the tendon lesion an average of 2.7 mm wide and 4.9 mm proximal to its insertion into the middle phalanx.

Del Piñal assessed articular surface involvement following retrograde insertion, finding that the smallest joints had less than 18% and 25% damage with 2.5- and 3.0-mm screws, respectively. Proximal articular surface lesions of the proximal phalanx (via antegrade techniques) are markedly smaller, with Borbas reporting 4.5% and 8.5% disruption when using a 2.2- or 3.0-mm screw, respectively. Notably, the screws used in these studies are…

### What is the relative effectiveness of the various surgical treatment options for distal radius fractures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157hu5o]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Low credibility.

Many acceptable treatment options exist for distal radius fractures (DRFs); however, a simultaneous comparison of all methods is difficult using conventional study designs.

- **Questions/Purposes**: We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DRF treatment to answer the following questions: Compared with nonoperative treatment, (1) which intervention is associated with the best 1-year functional outcome? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of overall complications? (3) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications requiring operation?

- **Methods**: Ten databases were searched from inception to July 25, 2019. Search and analysis reporting adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Included studies were English-language RCTs that assessed at least one surgical treatment arm for adult patients with displaced DRFs, with less than 20% loss to follow-up. We excluded RCTs reporting on patients with open fractures, extensive bone loss, or ipsilateral upper extremity polytrauma. Seventy RCTs (n = 4789 patients) were included. Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. Mean (range) patient age was 59 years.

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: Preliminary results [^114fAKeJ]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

The concept of an internal joint stabilizer has been previously described for elbow instability. When it is constructed for the treatment of an unstable P2 PIP injury, a rotating pin is placed along the axis of PIP motion to maintain joint reduction and guide proper joint kinematics [as shown in Figure 1]. It is affixed to the lateral aspect of P2 by a longitudinal section capable of accepting screws. The surgeon creates the device intraoperatively by shaping an appropriately sized K-wire. The wire is bent close to a right angle at its proximal aspect to allow the axis pin to be inserted along the anatomical PIP rotational axis. The distal longitudinal section requires the creation of two loops to accept screw fixation to P2.

### Epidemiology and management of 10,486 pediatric fractures in Shenzhen: Experience and lessons to be learnt [^111ngSCP]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Fractures of the phalanges of fingers are a common type of pediatric fractures resulting from trauma in emergency departments and outpatient clinics, with a high annual incidence. A survey found a very low annual incidence of hand fractures among toddlers in the United Kingdom (34/100,000 children); nevertheless, this figure increases by approximately 20-fold after the age of 10 years, reaching 663/100,000 in children aged 11–18 years. Many previous studies revealed that hand fractures were more common in boys than in girls, with 65–75% of fractures occurring in boys and a peak occurring around 9–14 years. However, among the 1112 cases of fractured phalanges of fingers in this study, which included 696 boys and 416 girls, the peak and trough ages of fracture occurrence were 3–6 years (469 cases) and 12–19 years (120 cases), respectively. This finding differed from that previously reported in the literature in other countries.

Epiphyseal fractures are a unique type of pediatric fractures, accounting for 15–30% of all pediatric fractures. The incidence of epiphyseal fractures is higher in boys than in girls and is more common in the upper limbs. Komura et al. found that, of all epiphyseal fractures, those of the distal radius are relatively common. Steinberg et al. showed that about 50% of epiphyseal fractures occurred in the proximal radius. Peterson et al. found that the most common site of epiphyseal fracture was the phalanges of the fingers. In the present study, epiphyseal fractures occurred in 1209 cases, accounting for 8.65% of the total number of fractures.

### Use of osteobiologics for fracture management: The when, what, and how [^117MAYDS]. Injury (2021). Low credibility.

Osteobiologics are defined as a group of natural and synthetic materials used to augment bone healing. The selection of the most appropriate osteobiologic from the growing list of available options can be a challenging task. In selecting a material, surgeons should weigh a variety of considerations, including the indication for their use (the when), the most suitable substance (the what), and the correct mode of application (the how). This summary reviews these considerations and seeks to provide the surgeon with a basis for informed, clinical, evidence-based decision-making in their choice of a successful option.

### The high risk of infection with delayed treatment of open Seymour fractures: Salter-Harris I/II or juxta-epiphyseal fractures of the distal phalanx with associated nailbed laceration [^112WFEbr]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

This study describes treatment methods and complication rates for all open Seymour fractures (Salter-Harris I/II or juxta-epiphyseal fractures of the distal phalanx of the hand with associated nailbed laceration) treated at or referred to a pediatric level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period. We hypothesized that delayed treatment of Seymour fractures results in higher rates of infectious complications.

- **Methods**: We identified all patients treated for open Seymour fractures at the orthopedic hand clinic at our level 1 pediatric trauma center between August 2002 and December 2012. All charts were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into groups based on the timing and completeness of treatment. "Appropriate" treatment was defined as irrigation and debridement, fracture reduction, and antibiotic administration. "Partial" treatment was defined as any type of incomplete treatment. "Acute" treatment was defined as management within 24 hours of the injury, whereas "Delayed" was considered treatment received after 24 hours from the time of injury. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Fisher exact test.

- **Results**: A total of 34 patients treated for 35 Seymour fractures met the inclusion criteria. In total, 31% (11/35) received acute, appropriate treatment; 37% (13/35) received acute, partial treatment; and 31% (11/35) received delayed treatment. There were 7 infectious complications: 2 superficial and 5 osteomyelitis. No infections occurred in the acutely, appropriately treated group (infection rate 0%, 0/11). Two infections were noted in the acutely, partially treated group (15%).

### The central slip fracture: Results of operative treatment of volar fracture subluxations/dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^115y2Dkn]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Fractures of the base of the middle phalanx present a considerable challenge. While dorsal fracture-subluxations/dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are common, the volar fracture-subluxation/dislocation, known as the "central slip fracture", is rare. This study reports on our experience with patients who underwent surgical treatment for central slip fracture subluxation/dislocation, with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year. We hypothesized that most patients with this type of fracture-subluxation/dislocation would have poor outcomes.

- **Methods**: Thirteen patients with central slip fracture-subluxations/dislocation were identified from departmental billing records between 2003 and 2013. Of these, nine patients completed the study follow-up examination, and eight were included in the final analysis. Clinical data assessed included age at injury, sex, mechanism of injury, injured digit, type of treatment, additional interventions, complications, length of follow-up, and range of motion at follow-up. Fluoroscopic images and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand surveys were obtained at study follow-up.

- **Results**: All patients underwent at least one surgery, with seven out of eight undergoing open reduction. The average age at the time of injury was 41 years (range, 25–60 years). All injuries were closed. The average follow-up period was 43 months (range, 17–67 months). The average passive and active range of motion of the PIP joint at follow-up were 62° and 54°, respectively. Six of eight patients developed radiographic evidence of arthritic change, and four experienced an outcome that…

### Pinckney fracture: Do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^115y7BBa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In most cases, the fracture is not severely displaced, and the reduction is easy or even unnecessary, requiring only comfort measures such as syndactyly or partial weight bearing. In some cases, such as late presentation and severe displacement, the fracture can be unstable and require provisional Kirschner wire fixation to maintain the reduction. In other cases, soft-tissue interposition (e.g. germinal matrix) dictates surgical exploration.

Treatment with antibiotics is required, and the need for initial intravenous therapy depends mainly on the clinical presentation. Patients with delayed treatment and signs of infection require intraoperative cultures and benefit from initial intravenous antibiotic treatment. On the other hand, for patients with early diagnosis, a period of 5–7 days of oral antibiotics and close follow-up is accepted, typically using a first-generation cephalosporin or clindamycin. Immobilization in a postoperative or hard-soled shoe for four weeks is recommended.

- **Learning points**: Our case highlights the importance of rigorous radiographic evaluation. True lateral and anteroposterior views are imperative for a correct diagnosis, especially in the presence of an occasional subtle presentation. When in doubt, compare with the contralateral foot. Early recognition is key for a favorable outcome. Identifying these cases as open fractures with a regimen of antibiotics lowers the risk of cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Despite a negative radiographic evaluation, facing a nail outside the eponychium or a nail laceration, we should suspect a physeal injury.

### International survey: Factors associated with operative treatment of distal radius fractures and implications for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons' Appropriate Use Criteria [^114gNdeB]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Low credibility.

Through an international survey, we assessed whether deciding to operatively treat an intra-articular distal radius fracture (DRF) is guided by identifiable patient and surgeon factors. Additionally, we compared surgeons' treatment decisions with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons' Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) treatment recommendations.

This cross-sectional survey asked 224 surgeons to operatively or nonoperatively treat 28 hypothetical patients with radiographs of an intra-articular DRF. We randomized patient age (50/70 years), gender, mechanism of injury, activity level, and OTA/AO fracture type. Six fractures were classified as "nonclinically significant displacement" and 22 as "potentially clinically significant displacement". Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Statistical significance was P < 0.05.

- **Results**:
	- **Patient factors**: Independently associated with surgery included younger age (OR 6.7, P = 0.003), clinically significant fracture displacement (type B: OR 122, CI, 20–739, P < 0.001; type C: OR 59, CI, 12–300, P < 0.001), normal activity level (OR 5.0, P < 0.001), and high-energy mechanisms (OR 1.3, P = 0.002).

### Do computerized tomography scans change management in carpometacarpal dislocations and fracture-dislocations [^114h8sH8]? Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Computed tomography scans significantly increased the overall number of diagnoses, χ² (1, N = 211) = 206.88, P < 0.001, with 40 additional diagnoses made by CT that were not seen on plain films. Nineteen patients (70.4%) who received a CT scan obtained a new diagnosis. The number of additional diagnoses found on CT did not change significantly by velocity of injury mechanism (P = 0.35). The most clinically significant of these additional diagnoses included 10 additional carpometacarpal dislocations/fracture-dislocations (CMCD/FD), 3 additional scaphoid fractures, and 1 additional hook of hamate fracture.

A CMCD/FD of the ring and small fingers significantly changed the odds of having a carpal fracture. The odds of having any carpal fracture were 5.33 times greater with a ring finger CMCD/FD (B = 1.67, SE = 0.51, P = 0.001) and 0.23 times less with a small finger CMCD/FD (B = −1.46, SE = 0.71, P = 0.04). In addition, CMCD/FD of the long finger trended toward significance, such that the odds of having any carpal fracture was 3.15 times greater when patients had this injury (B = 1.15, SE = 0.65, P = 0.08).

Patients who sustained high-velocity trauma were significantly more likely to have trapezial, trapezoid, and hook of hamate fractures than the low-velocity injury cohort (P = 0.006, .004, and .043, respectively).

### Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^1113bcSc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint encompass a spectrum of injury severity, ranging from injuries that require little intervention to those necessitating advanced reconstructive surgery for optimal outcomes. Three fracture-dislocation patterns are recognized: dorsal, volar, and pilon. Acceptable outcomes depend on achieving and maintaining a well-aligned and well-reduced joint, re-establishing normal joint kinematics, and restoring motion. Anatomic articular surface reduction is desirable but not absolutely necessary for a good outcome. Treatment depends on both the type of injury and patient-dependent factors. Optimal outcomes for specific injuries are predicated on expedient diagnosis and recognition of injury severity, which enables the initiation of appropriate management.

### Proximal phalanx fracture management [^117KtizW]. Hand (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of proximal phalangeal fracture management is to allow for fracture healing to occur in acceptable alignment while maintaining gliding motion of the extensor and flexor tendons.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature on various treatment methods of proximal phalanx fractures, focusing on the indications and outcomes of nonoperative as well as operative interventions.

- **Results**: Stable fractures can be successfully treated nonoperatively, whereas unstable injuries benefit from surgery. Regardless of the surgical intervention employed, the overriding goal is to restore anatomy and impart enough stability to allow for early motion. The surgical dissection contributes to soft tissue scarring and should be minimized.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical success is achieved when acceptable fracture alignment and stability occur in the setting of unobstructed tendon gliding and early active range of motion.

### Chronic recurrent dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger: case report [^115QBprt]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

We present a case of chronic, recurrent dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint of the little finger after traumatic dislocation. Intraoperative findings showed complete avulsion of the volar plate from the base of the distal phalanx and laxity of the ulnar collateral ligament. The volar plate was reattached by the suture anchor technique and reinforced by the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon.

### Extension block pinning for the treatment of a dorsal fracture dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint: Case report [^117KtKq2]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

A relatively rare case of dorsal dislocation of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint associated with a compression fracture of the volar base of the distal phalanx is presented. An extension block pin was used to maintain the reduction of the DIP joint during active flexion and extension exercises after surgery. At a 49-month follow-up, both the clinical results and radiographic findings were satisfactory.

### Seymour fractures: Retrospective analysis and therapeutic considerations [^112LmtLE]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

To analyze the management of Seymour fractures, which are juxta-epiphyseal fractures of the terminal phalanx of the finger accompanied by flexion deformity at the fracture site, laceration of the nail bed, and frequently ungual subluxation, this study aimed to determine clinical and radiographic results following operative or conservative treatment.

Clinical and radiological results of 24 skeletally immature patients (7 girls and 17 boys; mean age, 8.5 years) with Seymour fractures were evaluated. Assessment following a mean follow-up of 10 years (range, 1–18 years) included the range of motion, the modified Kapandji index, growth disturbance of the affected digit and nail, pain according to the visual analog scale, and patients' satisfaction.

Nine patients received nonoperative treatment, while operative management included debridement, open reduction, and fixation in 9 patients. Due to instability, an additional K-wire passing across the distal interphalangeal joint was used in 5 patients. In 1 patient, the nail was removed. All surgically treated patients received a splint and perioperative cephalosporin. Twenty-three patients out of 24 gained full motion (mean, 80°; range, 65°-90°). The average modified Kapandji index was 5.0 for extension and 4.8 for flexion. Long-term minor growth disturbance of the distal phalanx, seen on radiographs at high amplification only, and nail was noted in 5 patients, and solitary nail dystrophies were observed in 6 patients. Nine of the 11 nail growth irregularities were not a relevant cosmetic problem for the patients. Patient satisfaction assessment revealed high satisfaction.

### Quantitative 3-dimensional CT analyses of fractures of the middle phalanx base [^117XdU8W]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Quantitative 3-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) analyses can provide a more detailed understanding of fracture morphology. For fracture-dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint, the extent of fragmentation of the volar lip of the middle phalanx — a factor that might influence treatment — is not always apparent from radiographs. We hypothesized that there is no correlation between the number of fracture fragments and the percentage of articular surface area involved in intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx using quantitative 3DCT analyses.

- **Methods**: We used 13 computed tomography scans with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm or less to create 3-dimensional models of 15 intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx in 13 patients. We resized 3-dimensional models of a non-fractured middle phalanx of the same hand to fit the fractured middle phalanx in order to approximate the size and shape of the fractured middle phalanx in its pre-injury state. We created a heatmap to demonstrate the location of the fractured articular surface.

- **Results**: With the number of scans available, we did not find a significant correlation between the percentage of articular surface area involved and the number of fracture fragments. The median percentage of articular surface area involved was 46% (range, 21–90%). The heatmap demonstrated that the radio-volar side of the articular surface seems to be more involved than the ulnar-volar side in intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx.

- **Conclusion**: Quantitative 3DCT analysis of fractures provides a detailed insight into fracture morphology.

### Irreducible fracture dislocation of a finger metacarpophalangeal joint: A case report [^1151t4bX]. Hand (2008). High credibility.

A case of unusual displacement in a finger, with an avulsion fragment from the dorsal metacarpal head of the finger displaced in the palmar direction under the volar plate, is described. An 18-year-old woman presented with a complaint of difficulty flexing the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint of the right little finger following a fall onto the outstretched hand. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) was useful for diagnosing this condition. The use of both palmar and dorsal approaches was needed to reduce the displacement and to fix the bones with a single screw. Bone union was achieved, and the patient has been asymptomatic for more than 10 months.

### Outcomes after surgically managed oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures: A comparison of closed-reduction percutaneous pinning and open-reduction internal fixation with lag screws [^116gnxZQ]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures are common orthopedic injuries. When unstable and without substantial comminution, treatment options include closed-reduction percutaneous pinning (CRPP) and open-reduction internal fixation using lag screws (ORIF-screws). The aims of this study are primarily to compare the functional outcomes and complication rates between these techniques and secondarily to assess potential factors affecting outcomes after surgery.

- **Methods**: All patients with long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures treated surgically within a single orthopedic institution from 2010 to 2017 were identified. Outcome measures and complications were assessed at the final follow-up.

- **Results**: Sixty patients were included in the study with a mean time to the final follow-up of 41 weeks (range: 12–164 weeks). Thirty-four patients (57%) were treated with CRPP and 26 patients (43%) with ORIF-screws. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score across both fixation types was 8 (range: 0–43) and did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mean proximal interphalangeal extension at the final follow-up was 9° short of full extension after CRPP and 13° short of full extension after ORIF-screws. The rates of flexion contracture and extensor lag were 15% and 41% in the CRPP group compared with 12% and 68% in the ORIF-screws group. Reoperation rates and complication rates did not differ significantly between fixation strategies.

- **Conclusions**: Acceptable outcomes can be achieved after surgical fixation of long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures using either CRPP or ORIF-screws, with no significant difference in complication rates or functional outcomes.

### Surgical outcomes of percutaneous pinning and open locking plating in patients with intra-articular fractures of the base of the fifth metacarpal [^113DF32x]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The study aimed to demonstrate the results of surgical treatment, including percutaneous K-wire fixation after closed reduction (CRKF) or locking plate fixation after open reduction (ORPF), in patients with intra-articular fractures of the base of the fifth metacarpal. Researchers retrospectively reviewed data from 29 patients who received surgical treatment for closed, intra-articular fractures of the base of the fifth metacarpal and were followed up for at least one year post-surgery. Sixteen of the 29 patients underwent CRKF, whereas 13 underwent ORPF. Closed reduction was attempted to address intra-articular step-off in all patients; however, if inadequate, ORPF was performed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores, visual analog scale pain scores, total active motion (TAM) of the little finger, and grip strength. Osseous union and posttraumatic arthritis of the fifth carpometacarpal joint were also evaluated.

K-wire fixation after closed reduction was performed for 13 simple fractures and 3 comminuted fractures; ORPF was performed for 6 simple fractures and 7 comminuted fractures. All patients had satisfactory subjective outcomes, with over 90% grip strength compared with the contralateral side and nearly full TAM. All patients in both groups achieved osseous union. There were five cases of grade 1 posttraumatic arthritis after CRKF and seven cases of grade 1 posttraumatic arthritis after ORPF.

Surgical treatment provided satisfactory outcomes in terms of union and functional recovery, despite the occurrence of grade 1 posttraumatic arthritis.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of mallet finger: A systematic review [^115nwEPM]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The literature describes multiple surgical and nonsurgical techniques for the management of mallet finger injuries, and there is no consensus on the indications for surgical treatment. The objective of this study was to determine, through a literature review, if any conclusions can be drawn concerning the indications for surgery in mallet finger injuries, the treatment outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical management, the most effective methods of surgical and nonsurgical treatment, and the most common treatment complications of mallet finger injuries.

A systematic review of multiple databases was performed. English language clinical studies evaluating therapeutic interventions for mallet fingers that reported objective, standardized outcome measures were included. Basic science studies, cadaveric studies, conference abstracts, level V evidence studies, studies lacking statistical data, and tendinous injuries other than mallet fingers were excluded. Salvage procedures and studies evaluating exclusively chronic lesions were also excluded.

Forty-four studies that reported clinical outcomes for the treatment of mallet finger injuries were included: 22 evaluating surgical treatments and 17 investigating nonsurgical treatments. The average distal interphalangeal joint extensor lag was 5.7° after surgical treatment and 7.6° after nonsurgical treatment. Complication rates of surgical and nonsurgical interventions were comparable at 14.5% and 12.8%, respectively. Five studies directly compared the outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical management.

### The outcomes of extension block pinning and nonsurgical management for mallet fracture [^113aN9G9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic results of patients with a mallet fracture involving more than one-third of the articular surface, but without a high degree of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint subluxation, treated with extension block pinning or nonsurgical management.

Forty-nine patients with a mallet fracture involving more than one-third of the articular surface were reviewed. Twenty-six cases were treated using extension block pinning (surgery group) and 23 were treated nonsurgically (nonsurgical group). At the final follow-up, extension lag and flexion of the DIP joint of the affected digit were measured. Distal interphalangeal joint pain was rated using a visual analog scale, and the overall clinical outcomes were graded using Crawford's criteria. Complications, including nail deformity and dorsal prominence, were also assessed. The rate of DIP joint subluxation and fracture fragment size were radiographically evaluated.

Mean extension lag and flexion of the DIP joint and mean visual analog pain scores were not significantly different in the two groups. Outcomes, as assessed using Crawford's criteria, were excellent in 5, good in 12, fair in 6, and poor in 3 in the surgery group, and excellent in 2, good in 11, fair in 8, and poor in 2 in the nonsurgical group. Moreover, the frequency of nail deformity or dorsal prominence was similar in the two groups. The rate of DIP subluxation and mean fracture fragment size were similar between the two groups. All the fractures had united by 3 months after injury in both groups.

### Trans-web approach for fixation of avulsion fractures of the proximal phalangeal base: Report of two cases [^115vrzgK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Displaced fractures of the lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx can be surgically treated, but previously described approaches are not necessarily easy to perform. We describe a trans-web approach to the metacarpophalangeal joint and report on two clinical cases. This technique allows the fracture fragments to be reduced and fixed with minimal risk of damage to the adjacent structures.

### Pinckney fracture: Do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^113wdLoT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The original description of this injury was initially highlighted by Pinckney et al, and they describe it as a compound injury of a Salter Harris type I fracture that, when mistreated, evolved into an infection process of the toe.

These injuries result from a forced hyperflexion of the distal phalanx, suggesting that the vector of tension disrupts the dorsal toe structures. The layer of skin between the nail and bone is thinnest directly above the physis, where the germinal matrix of the nail (specialized inner layers of the epidermis) and a shallow layer of dermis at the base of the nail are easily disrupted, allowing the occurrence of an open physeal fracture.

These lesions may be hidden from view because the skin and toenails of the pediatric population are often very soiled areas. For this reason, the risk of contamination and infection is enhanced. Additionally, late recognition and treatment make it prone to complications such as cellulitis and osteomyelitis.

Several signs should raise concern for this diagnosis:

- **Longer nail length or longer length of the lunula compared with the contralateral side**: This indicates that the nail is positioned over the nail fold.

- **Bleeding around the nail at the time of injury**:

- **Laceration proximal to the nail fold**:

A physeal fracture on the distal phalanx should warn of an open fracture unless proven otherwise. Clinicians should also be aware that lacerations of the nail and nail bed with an apparently normal radiograph, in the scenario of a hyperflexion mechanism, are manifestations of a possible Salter Harris type I fracture.

### Current concepts: Mallet finger [^114dn63M]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Loss of the extensor mechanism at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint leads to mallet finger, also known as baseball finger or drop finger. This condition can result from either tendon substance disruption or a bony avulsion. Soft tissue mallet finger is due to the rupture of the extensor tendon in Zone 1, while bony mallet finger is caused by an avulsion of the extensor tendon from the distal phalanx, leaving a small fragment of bone attached to the avulsed tendon. Mallet finger results in an imbalance of the extensor force distribution between the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and DIP joints. If untreated, mallet finger can lead to a swan neck deformity characterized by hyperextension of the PIP joint and flexion of the DIP joint. Most mallet finger injuries can be managed non-surgically, but surgery may occasionally be recommended, particularly for acute or chronic cases or for salvaging failed prior treatments.

### Blocking plate for volar proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocation [^115HgtqG]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the use of a 2-mm miniplate as a dorsal blocking plate to stabilize the central avulsion fragment in a proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) volar fracture dislocation.

- **Methods**: This was a case series comprising 8 patients with volar fracture dislocation of the PIP joint. The average age of the patients was 36 years. The patients were managed by this technique within an average of 11 days following the injury. The clinical outcome measurements included the assessment of pain and range of motion of the PIP and distal interphalangeal joints.

- **Results**: The average follow-up duration was 20 months. The mean visual analog scale pain score was 1.9. The average range of motion of the PIP joint was 82°, whereas the average range of motion of the distal interphalangeal joint was 43°. Reduction of the subluxation was achieved in all cases, with no articular step remaining.

- **Conclusions**: A dorsal blocking plate is a simple technique, associated with a satisfactory outcome, for volar fracture dislocation injuries of the PIP joint.

- **Type of study/level of evidence**: Therapeutic V.

### Closed reduction percutaneous pinning versus open reduction with plate and screw fixation in management of unstable proximal phalangeal fractures: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Trhba]. Hand (2025). High credibility.

Proximal phalanx fractures are common, with surgical fixation indicated for unstable fractures. Traditionally, closed reduction percutaneous pinning (CRPP) resulted in decreased stiffness and tendon irritation compared to open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). We hypothesized that more recent studies would have outcomes that are more similar to CRPP. The purpose of this study was to compare CRPP and ORIF in terms of range of motion, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores, and complications.

- **Methods**: Four electronic databases were queried from 2010 to present. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, two independent reviewers performed a two-step review process to identify relevant articles. Patient demographics, total active motion (TAM), DASH scores, and complications were extracted. The methodological quality of each study included was assessed independently. Meta-analysis was performed for comparative trials.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria, including four comparative studies. Thirteen studies included TAM. The weighted average TAM was 228 ± 34° for CRPP and 223 ± 32° for ORIF (P = 0.07 with 95% confidence interval, -0.5 to 10.5). Seven studies evaluated DASH scores; the weighted average was 8.2 ± 8.9 for CRPP and 11.7 ± 6.5 for ORIF (P < .01 with 95% CI, 1.8–5.2). Two studies directly compared CRPP to ORIF, favoring ORIF for both TAM with d = 1.07 and DASH with d = 0.23. Rates of tenolysis or hardware removal were higher for ORIF (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: Recent literature suggests a more equitable outcome between CRPP and ORIF, though certain advantages for ORIF persist.
