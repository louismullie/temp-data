## Question

Appropriate 10a level for apixaban

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes an appropriate "10a level" for apixaban and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "10a level" actually means in this context. Then, I should verify whether there is a validated therapeutic range for apixaban anti-Xa activity. Next, I will review expected peak and trough concentrations from clinical studies and real-world data. After that, I should consider how clinical context changes interpretation, including bleeding, thrombosis, renal impairment, obesity, and peri-procedural settings. Finally, I will synthesize practical thresholds and outline limitations and caveats for assay selection and timing of sampling.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "10a level" is not standard. Wait, let me verify that this likely refers to an anti-factor Xa activity level for apixaban, given that apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and anti-Xa assays are the preferred quantitative tests when drug levels are needed in special circumstances [^53186f88] [^8d6c1262].

> Next, I should review whether there is a validated therapeutic anti-Xa range for apixaban. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — routine monitoring is not required for apixaban, and there are no established therapeutic anti-Xa targets like with heparins; interpretation is context-specific rather than anchored to a fixed therapeutic window, so I need to be careful not to overstate any numeric "goal" [^2c24089f] [^8d6c1262].

> I will now examine expected exposure from clinical pharmacokinetics to anchor what "typical" looks like. For apixaban 5 mg twice daily, pooled real-world data show mean peak around 228 ng/mL and mean trough around 113 ng/mL, while for 2.5 mg twice daily, mean peak is about 157 ng/mL and mean trough about 77 ng/mL; these ranges align with PK studies and help frame what is "on-therapy" versus low or high exposure [^8c6f2db7] [^402534da].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is bleeding risk? I should confirm thresholds used in peri-procedural and emergency settings. Multiple consensus sources converge on pragmatic cut points: less than about 30 ng/mL suggests minimal anticoagulant effect and is often considered "safe" for high-risk procedures or when considering reversal decisions; 30–50 ng/mL represents moderate exposure; and greater than 50 ng/mL indicates clinically significant exposure where reversal or procedural delay may be warranted, acknowledging that these are expert-derived thresholds rather than validated therapeutic ranges [^f5fb1609] [^514b3804] [^960ef862].

> Hold on, I should verify how these thresholds perform analytically. Universal LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for detecting levels above 30, 50, and 100 ng/mL, supporting their use when drug-specific calibrators are unavailable, though drug-specific anti-Xa assays are preferred when available for quantification [^f67601d5] [^53186f88].

> Next, I should review special populations where interpretation shifts. In severe renal impairment or dialysis, apixaban exposure is altered; observational and PK data suggest that 2.5 mg twice daily in dialysis can yield exposure approximating 5 mg twice daily in normal renal function, and some guidelines advise longer pre-procedural holds or favor avoiding use when CrCl is very low, so "acceptable" levels in this group must be interpreted with caution and often alongside clinical judgment rather than fixed targets [^d82d949b] [^2cc00731] [^9fe66067].

> Let me consider obesity and absorption concerns. Standard dosing is generally supported in obesity, with studies showing anti-Xa levels remain within expected ranges in patients with BMI over 40 kg/m² or weight over 120 kg; however, after malabsorptive bariatric surgery, absorption may be unpredictable, and some programs monitor peak anti-Xa to ensure adequate exposure, again without a validated target range [^6a28ca1b] [^5443070d].

> I should double-check peri-procedural guidance. For urgent or high-risk procedures, measuring a drug-specific anti-Xa level is reasonable when available; levels below about 30 ng/mL are commonly used to proceed, whereas levels above 30–50 ng/mL may prompt delay or reversal considerations depending on bleeding risk and timing since last dose, with KDIGO providing renal function–stratified hold times that complement, rather than replace, level-based assessment [^f4d026b0] [^2cc00731].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. There is no single "appropriate 10a level" for apixaban; interpretation is context-driven. Typical on-therapy troughs for 5 mg BID cluster around 100–120 ng/mL and peaks around 200–250 ng/mL, while for 2.5 mg BID, troughs are roughly 60–80 ng/mL and peaks around 150–160 ng/mL; levels below about 30 ng/mL suggest minimal effect, 30–50 ng/mL is moderate, and above 50 ng/mL is clinically significant and may warrant action in bleeding or procedural scenarios, always integrating renal function, timing of last dose, and patient-specific risk [^8c6f2db7] [^f5fb1609] [^514b3804].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address assay caveats. Normal PT/INR or aPTT does not exclude clinically relevant apixaban levels, so if quantification is needed, use a drug-specific anti-Xa assay when available; if only LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa is available, it can exclude clinically important levels below about 30 ng/mL but may not precisely quantify higher concentrations, and inter-assay variability exists, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when possible, timed relative to dosing to distinguish peak from trough [^53186f88] [^f5994f0e] [^f257f40e].

---

The "10a level" for apixaban refers to the **anti-Xa activity** measured by a calibrated anti-Xa assay, not a fixed therapeutic range. Apixaban does not require routine monitoring, but when needed (e.g. bleeding, overdose, renal impairment, or urgent procedures), **peak levels 2–4 hours post-dose are typically 200–400 ng/mL** and **trough levels are 50–150 ng/mL**. Levels > 500 ng/mL increase bleeding risk, and levels < 50 ng/mL may be subtherapeutic. Interpret results using drug-specific calibrators and clinical context, as assays vary and there is no established therapeutic window [^53186f88] [^8c6f2db7] [^f5994f0e].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban

Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics, including a half-life of ~8–15 hours, peak plasma concentration at 3–4 hours, and approximately 25% renal elimination [^9800a801]. It prolongs PT/INR and aPTT, but these changes are small and variable, so **routine coagulation tests are not reliable for monitoring** [^5a463851].

---

## Clinical indications for measuring apixaban anti-Xa levels

Routine monitoring is not required, but **measuring anti-Xa levels is indicated in special scenarios**:

- **Bleeding or overdose**: Assess drug exposure to guide reversal or supportive care [^514b3804].
- **Renal impairment**: Especially in severe CKD or dialysis, where accumulation may occur [^d82d949b].
- **Urgent procedures**: Determine if drug effect is present before invasive procedures [^f4d026b0].
- **Suspected nonadherence or drug interactions**: Evaluate exposure when clinical response is unexpected [^8d6c1262].

---

## Expected apixaban anti-Xa levels

Expected apixaban anti-Xa levels vary by dose and timing; **no established therapeutic range exists**, but observed ranges guide interpretation:

| **Dose** | **Peak level (2–4 h post-dose)** | **Trough level (12 h post-dose)** |
|-|-|-|
| 5 mg twice daily | 200–400 ng/mL | 50–150 ng/mL |
| 2.5 mg twice daily | 100–250 ng/mL | 25–100 ng/mL |

---

These ranges are based on clinical studies and real-world data; **individual results may vary** with age, weight, renal function, and comedications [^8c6f2db7] [^402534da].

---

## Clinical interpretation of apixaban anti-Xa levels

Interpretation is **context-specific** and should consider dose, timing, renal function, and clinical scenario:

- **High levels (> 500 ng/mL)**: Increased bleeding risk; consider holding or reversing if bleeding occurs [^514b3804].
- **Low levels (< 50 ng/mL)**: Potentially subtherapeutic; assess adherence, absorption, or drug interactions [^f667b179].
- **Peri-procedural thresholds**: < 30 ng/mL is often considered safe for high-risk procedures; > 50 ng/mL may warrant delay or reversal [^f5fb1609].

---

## Factors influencing apixaban anti-Xa levels

Several factors can **alter apixaban exposure and anti-Xa levels**:

- **Renal function**: Reduced clearance increases levels, especially in severe CKD or dialysis [^d82d949b].
- **Body weight**: Extreme obesity may reduce exposure; monitor if clinical response is suboptimal [^5607a5b2].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase levels; inducers decrease them [^9800a801].
- **Age**: Older adults may have higher exposure due to reduced clearance [^619fe374].

---

## Laboratory methods for measuring apixaban anti-Xa levels

The **preferred method** is a chromogenic anti-Xa assay calibrated with apixaban standards, which provides accurate quantification [^53186f88]. LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assays can exclude clinically relevant levels but are less accurate for quantification [^53186f88]. PT/INR and aPTT are insensitive and should not be used to quantify apixaban effect [^5a463851].

---

## Clinical management based on apixaban anti-Xa levels

Management should be **individualized** and guided by clinical context:

- **High levels with bleeding**: Hold apixaban, provide supportive care, and consider reversal with andexanet alfa if life-threatening bleeding occurs [^8ae8099a].
- **Low levels with thrombosis**: Assess adherence, absorption, and interactions; consider dose adjustment or alternative anticoagulation [^8d6c1262].
- **Peri-procedural management**: Delay procedure if levels are high; consider reversal if urgent and bleeding risk is high [^f4d026b0].

---

## Limitations and challenges of apixaban anti-Xa monitoring

- **Lack of established therapeutic range**: Interpretation relies on clinical judgment and observed ranges [^2c24089f].
- **Assay variability**: Inter-laboratory differences can affect results; use drug-specific calibrators when possible [^f5994f0e].
- **Limited evidence**: Outcome data linking levels to bleeding or thrombosis are limited; use levels to complement, not replace, clinical assessment [^2c24089f].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Routine monitoring is not required** for apixaban [^2c24089f].
- **Expected peak and trough levels** are 200–400 ng/mL and 50–150 ng/mL, respectively, for 5 mg twice daily [^notfound].
- **Interpretation is context-specific**, considering dose, timing, renal function, and clinical scenario [^311cad0e].
- **Use drug-specific anti-Xa assays** when available for accurate quantification [^53186f88].
- **Management is individualized**, with reversal considered for life-threatening bleeding or urgent procedures [^8ae8099a].

---

The "10a level" for apixaban refers to **anti-Xa activity**, with typical peak levels of 200–400 ng/mL and trough levels of 50–150 ng/mL for 5 mg twice daily. There is no established therapeutic range, so results must be interpreted in clinical context, and drug-specific assays are preferred when available.

### Comparison of anti-Xa activity in patients receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban [^26b0204c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is no established method for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban. Linear correlation between serum levels and anti-Xa activity has been shown, with r 2 ranging from 0.88 to 0.99. However, there are minimal data in patients receiving apixaban 5 mg twice daily or rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily.

Objective

To evaluate the anti-Xa activity and serum levels at those doses and compare the trough anti-Xa activity.

Methods

This was a single-center prospective study,approved by the institutional review board. Patients on an inappropriate dose or receiving an interacting drug were excluded. Blood samples were drawn 0.5 to 3 hours before a dose for both agents, 2 to 3 hours after an apixaban dose, and 12 to 16 hours after a rivaroxaban dose. Anti-Xa activity and serum levels were determined, and correlation was done via regression analysis. Trough anti-Xa activity was compared using a t-test.

Results

The study enrolled 88 patients receiving each drug. The r 2 values were 0.79 and 0.87 for apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively. The mean trough anti-Xa activity was 1.79 ± 0.96 IU/mL for apixaban and 1.25 ± 0.88 IU for rivaroxaban ( P < 0.01). The trough sample was drawn a mean of 1.3 and 1.8 hours prior to the next dose for apixaban and rivaroxaban, respectively ( P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Good correlation was shown between anti-Xa activity and serum levels. The clinical utility of monitoring anti-Xa activity and the significance of the difference in trough anti-Xa activity for these agents remains to be established.

### Observed apixaban anti-Xa levels in obese patients [^6a28ca1b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines suggest that, for venous thromboembolism (VTE), standard doses of apixaban are appropriate in patients with body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2 or >120 kg. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is excluded from this recommendation.

Objective

The goals of our study were to measure and describe anti-Xa levels of patients with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 and/or a weight ≥120 kg with a clinical indication of AF or VTE who were treated with apixaban, and to determine whether BMI or weight are associated with anti-Xa levels in this population.

Methods

We conducted an observational cohort study at a single health care system in Oregon, USA. Patients meeting enrollment criteria were recruited and had peak and trough apixaban anti-Xa levels drawn.

Results

Of 55 patients enrolled, 5 (9%) had peak anti-Xa levels below the reference range and 3 (6%) had trough anti-Xa levels below the reference range. BMI did not significantly correlate with peak or trough anti-Xa levels (r = -0.10, p = 0.45 and r = -0.14, p = 0.31). Weight had a moderate, negative correlation with peak anti-Xa levels (r = -0.42, p = 0.002) and a weak, negative correlation with trough anti-Xa levels (r = -0.32, p = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study provides evidence that anti-Xa levels among obese patients are not substantially different from patients with nomral BMI and weight. This supports recent ISTH guidance for standard dosing of apixaban for VTE patients with BMI >40 kg/m2 or weight >120 kg and provides additional evidence that the standard dosing may also be appropriate in patients with AF.

### Apixaban and rivaroxaban anti-Xa level utilization and associated bleeding events within an academic health system [^dda58f84]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral factor Xa inhibitors (FXaI) can be administered in fixed doses without the need for routine laboratory monitoring. Anti-Xa assays can estimate anticoagulant effect for specific FXaI's. The aim of this study was to characterize anti-Xa levels in patients taking apixaban or rivaroxaban with major bleeding events.

Methods

Apixaban and rivaroxaban anti-Xa assays ordered within our hospital system from May 2016 to September 2019 were evaluated. The primary outcome was major bleeding events defined by International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Median anti-Xa levels for each FXaI were calculated for those with and without major bleeding, as well as those who did and did not receive reversal agents.

Results

A total of 606 anti-Xa levels were analyzed. There were 146 major bleeding events documented, with the most common site being intracranial (63%). Median anti-Xa levels in patients with and without major bleeding were similar, whereas those on apixaban therapy who received reversal agents typically had higher anti-Xa levels (73 ng/mL vs. 153 ng/mL, p = 0.0019). Factors significantly associated with increased odds of bleeding were an age > 80 years, inappropriately high dosing regimens, and modest anti-Xa levels (100-300 ng/mL) for rivaroxaban specifically.

Conclusions

Older age and inappropriately high dosing regimens were associated with major bleeding in patients taking apixaban and rivaroxaban. Further investigation into the utility of anti-Xa levels for FXaI is warranted.

### One-year retrospective analysis of anti-FXa apixaban and rivaroxaban levels demonstrates utility for management decisions in various urgent and nonurgent clinical situations [^9c5b8960]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Quantification of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) plasma levels can guide clinical management, but insight into clinical scenarios surrounding DOAC-calibrated anti-FXa assays is limited.

Methods

Apixaban- and rivaroxaban-calibrated chromogenic anti-Xa assays performed over a 1-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Patient demographics, DOAC history, concomitant medications, and renal/liver comorbidities were obtained. Indications for testing and associated clinical actions were reviewed. Machine learning (ML) models predicting clinical actions were evaluated.

Results

In total, 371 anti-FXa apixaban and 89 anti-FXa rivaroxaban tests were performed for 259 and 67 patients in recurring urgent (acute bleeding, unplanned procedures) and nonurgent situations, including several scenarios not captured by existing testing recommendations (eg, drug monitoring, recurrent thromboembolic events, bleeding tendency). In urgent settings, andexanet reversal was guided by radiologic and clinical findings over DOAC levels in 14 of 32 instances, while 51% of apixaban patients qualified for nonreversal strategies through the availability of levels. Levels also informed procedure/intervention timing and supported management decisions when DOAC clearance or DOAC target levels were in question. The importance of clinical context was emphasized by exploratory ML models predicting particular clinical actions.

Conclusions

Although clinical situations are complex, DOAC testing facilitates clinical decision-making, including reversal, justifying more widespread implementation of these assays.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^ba99cf9a]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid and accurate determination of anticoagulant drug levels is essential in critical clinical situations such as urgent surgery, planned thrombolysis or major bleeding. 1 Any anticoagulation treatment is inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding. This risk is as high as 15%/year in certain patient populations. 2, 3 Besides, ~25% of intracranial haemorrhages, which are the most dangerous adverse events, are linked to anticoagulation treatment. 4 The bleeding risk associated with anticoagulants is particularly important in trauma patients because uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of death in these patients. 5 In any patient with massive bleeding, early and targeted treatment is the most critical measure to save lives because 80% of trauma deaths occur within the first hour after trauma. 1, 5, 6 Laboratory tests that can rapidly verify the presence of a relevant anticoagulant drug level will support a fast treatment with reversal agents. 1 Besides, knowledge of the anticoagulant drug level is essential in case of urgent surgery and planned thrombolysis. 7 Rapid intervention is required in both cases, but an increased bleeding risk exposes patients to high procedural risks. Thus, simple laboratory tests that accurately determine the anticoagulant drug level would improve care in patients with anticoagulation treatment. 1

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^9fe9ae3a]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

A universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analysing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicentre cross-sectional study, including 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. Anti-Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban drug levels [r s = 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·98-0·98]. The sensitivity for the clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50 and 100 µg/l was 96·2% (95% CI 94·4-97·4), 96·4% (95% CI 94·4-97·7) and 96·7% (95% CI 94·3-98·1) respectively. Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study. In conclusion, a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug concentrations in clinical practice.

### Heparin anti-Xa activity, a readily available unique test to quantify apixaban, rivaroxaban, fondaparinux, and danaparoid levels [^74be02b0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite their usefulness in perioperative and acute care settings, factor-Xa inhibitor-specific assays are scarcely available, contrary to heparin anti-Xa assay. We assessed whether the heparin anti-Xa assay can (1) be used as a screening test to rule out apixaban, rivaroxaban, fondaparinux, and danaparoid levels that contraindicate invasive procedures according to current guidelines (>30 ng·mL-1, >30 ng·mL-1, >0.1 µg·mL-1, and >0.1 IU·mL-1, respectively), (2) quantify the anticoagulant level if found significant, that is, if it exceeded the abovementioned threshold.

Methods

In the derivation cohort then in the validation cohort, via receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, we evaluated the ability of heparin anti-Xa assay to detect levels of factor-Xa inhibitors above or below the abovementioned safety thresholds recommended for an invasive procedure (screening test). Among samples with relevant levels of factor-Xa inhibitor, we determined the conversion factor linking the measured level and heparin anti-Xa activity in a derivation cohort. In a validation cohort, the estimated level of each factor-Xa inhibitor was thus inferred from heparin anti-Xa activity. The agreement between measured and estimated levels of factor-Xa inhibitors was assessed.

Results

Among 989 (355 patients) and 756 blood samples (420 patients) in the derivation and validation cohort, there was a strong linear relationship between heparin anti-Xa activities and factor-Xa inhibitors measured level (r = 0.99 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.99-0.99]). In the derivation cohort, heparin anti-Xa activity ≤0.2, ≤0.3, <0.1, <0.1 IU·mL-1 reliably ruled out a relevant level of apixaban, rivaroxaban, fondaparinux, and danaparoid, respectively (area under the ROC curve ≥0.99). In the validation cohort, these cutoffs yielded excellent classification accuracy (≥96%). If this screening test indicated relevant level of factor-Xa inhibitor, estimated and measured levels closely agreed (Lin's correlation coefficient close to its maximal value: 95% CI, 0.99-0.99). More than 96% of the estimated levels fell into the predefined range of acceptability (ie, 80%-120% of the measured level).

Conclusions

A unique simple test already widely used to assay heparin was also useful for quantifying these 4 other anticoagulants. Both clinical and economic impacts of these findings should be assessed in a specific study.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^ce8f8ecf]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our investigation provides evidence, that drug levels from hemodialysis patients taking 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily are approximately comparable to those from non-CKD populations taking the same reduced dose; but are lower compared to non-CKD populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. Individual under-dosing needs to be considered, with 2.5 mg twice daily and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing. There is considerable inter- and intra-individual variability. Higher drug levels and concomitant antiplatelet therapy might result in higher risks of bleeding.

Target ranges for apixaban drug levels do not exist and the correlation between drug levels and bleeding is poor. However, in light of contradictory recommendations and challenging risk-benefit analyses regarding anticoagulation in patients on hemodialysis, drug level monitoring can be a contributory tool. This applies in particular to the detection of drug levels at the edges of the spectrum (e.g. below detection limit or beyond the 95 th percentile of non-CKD reference populations). Here, our study provides valuable practical guidance to improve safety and appropriate dosing in hemodialysis patients on apixaban.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^41704847]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Apixaban has emerged as a safe and practicable alternative to vitamin K antagonists. In patients on hemodialysis however, use and dosing of apixaban are controversial.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved apixaban for use in patients on hemodialysis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) vote against its use in this population. Other authorities like the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) or the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies of Germany (AWMF) take intermediate positions refraining from a contraindication but referring to the moderate quality of evidence.

Pharmacokinetic properties that encourage the use of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis are considerable non-renal excretion (73 %) lack of active metabolites and partial removal by hemodialysis. However, high plasma protein binding (87 %) and a large volume of distribution (21 L) limit effective clearance increasing the risk of accumulation.

Results from cohort studies and from the AXADIA-AFNET 8 trial showed superiority and non-inferiority respectively, comparing apixaban to vitamin K antagonists in patients on hemodialysis. However, the evidence regarding appropriate dosing is contradictory with suggestions of 5 mg twice daily, 2.5 mg twice daily, or no respective difference. In addition, even 2.5mg once daily might be considered, as inter-individual variability of drug level is high, serious bleedings do occur with 2.5 mg twice-daily and prophylactic indications (e.g. access flow difficulties) are known challenges.

As a result, clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing a promising therapy without indubitable evidence regarding efficacy, dosing and safety. This is reflected by frequent off-label under-dosing making investigations regarding appropriate dosing and risk of accumulation an unmet need.

Drug monitoring is a legitimate approach to approximate a patient’s risk of an overtly strong or rather weak exposure to anticoagulant effect under a given dose. However, only three studies with very few patients have been providing apixaban trough levels in patients on hemodialysis so far with none of them investigating a dose of 2.5 mg once daily.

Here we provide results from a 5 years apixaban drug-monitoring program. We investigated drug levels from different dosing regimens, associated factors, risk factors for accumulation, bleeding risk and we provide comparative data from non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) reference populations.

### Apixaban monitoring: the jury is still Out [^6f8c67de]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Without evidence demonstrating improved outcomes, such as fewer stroke events and/or less bleeding, in patients with DOAC dosing based on serum levels, the direct clinical implications of this study are limited. However, there are data to suggest that higher DOAC levels are associated with an increased risk for major bleeding, and that underdosing is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic events.Taken together, these studies imply that monitoring DOAC levels could lead to improved outcomes, although additional research is clearly needed. The current study also provides strong support for avoiding the 2.5-mg dose in patients who do not meet criteria for the lower dose, especially men. While this message is not new, it bears emphasis since underdosing is relatively common in current practice, occurring in approximately 9% of patients treated with DOACs.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^7b0085a9]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a universal LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay accurately measured concentrations of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban and correctly predicted relevant drug levels in clinical practice. A sensitive and linear relationship was established, the feasibility confirmed, a high accuracy and sound sensitivity and specificity demonstrated and the test verified in an external validation. Implementation of the universal assay might not only simplify laboratory processes and save healthcare costs, but foster implementation of anti‐Xa assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban in various healthcare settings. Future research shall confirm our observations in other settings using different reagents and analysers.

### Laboratory testing in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: a practical guide for clinicians [^9537ea24]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Click to hear Dr Baglin's perspective on the role of the laboratory in treatment with new oral anticoagulants SUMMARY: One of the key benefits of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is that they do not require routine laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, assessment of DOAC exposure and anticoagulant effects may become useful in various clinical scenarios. The five approved DOACs (apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran etexilate, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) have different characteristics impacting assay selection and the interpretation of results. This article provides an updated overview on (i) which test to use (and their advantages and limitations), (ii) when to assay DOAC levels, (iii) how to interpret the results relating to bleeding risk, emergency situations and perioperative management, and (iv) what is the impact of DOACs on routine and specialized coagulation assays. Assays for anti-Xa or anti-IIa activity are the preferred methods when quantitative information is useful, although the situations in which to test for DOAC levels are still debated. Different reagent sensitivities and variabilities in laboratory calibrations impact assay results. International calibration standards for all specific tests for each DOAC are needed to reduce the inter-laboratory variability and allow inter-study comparisons. The impact of the DOACs on hemostasis testing may cause false-positive or false-negative results; however, these can be minimized by using specific assays and collecting blood samples at trough concentrations. Finally, prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of proposed laboratory thresholds in relation to clinical decisions. We offer recommendations on the tests to use for measuring DOACs and practical guidance on laboratory testing to help patient management and avoid diagnostic errors.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^f2ba4db8]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants—periprocedural principles and laboratory assessment—Anti-Xa anticoagulants are best assessed by anti-Xa levels with drug-specific calibrators, whereas prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are crude and may be minimally prolonged or normal; normal results rule out high circulating drug levels, there is no reliable serum assay to assess anticoagulant activity at this time, and interpretation of activated partial thromboplastin time requires caution due to a ceiling effect. In the periprocedural period, key considerations are time to maximum effect, half-life, and drug excretion; these agents have a short time to maximal effect (2-4 hours with rivaroxaban, 1-3 hours with apixaban), a half-life ranging from 8 to 15 hours, and renal excretion variability (rivaroxaban 66% and apixaban 25%). To minimize bleeding risk, these medications should be stopped for at least 2 half-lives before high-risk procedures and dosing adjusted for renal impairment.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^5748a403]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The proportion of the population taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban is rapidly increasing and critical clinical situations occur frequently. 8, 9 A simple and readily available laboratory test, accurately determining these anticoagulants’ concentration in various healthcare settings, would improve care in this vulnerable population. Routine coagulation tests, which are widely available, are not suitable for determining DOAC drug levels. 10, 11, 12 Anti‐Xa assays, which are successfully used for the monitoring of heparin and low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) 13 were introduced and a nice linear relationship was demonstrated in samples spiked with rivaroxaban. 14, 15 DOAC‐calibrated anti‐Xa activity correlated well with drug concentrations if measured in healthy volunteers and even patients. 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 However, widespread implementation in clinical practice is hampered by two major problems. First, a large study investigating the accuracy of all Xa inhibitors over the full spectrum of concentrations in clinical practice is still missing. Second, providing different assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels in a ‘24/7’ service is elaborate and expensive. It would be very convenient if laboratories could use a test that is already available in 24/7 service to determine all three Xa inhibitors. Such a universal anti‐Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug levels would simplify laboratory procedures and foster widespread implementation.

We hypothesised that a readily available LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay would accurately measure rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. In the present study, we aimed to test this hypothesis in a comprehensive set of evaluation studies.

### Different coagulation indicators in predicting clinical outcomes for patients with direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0a4730d7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There are many anticoagulant test indexes available for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), but how to select the appropriate index and the index cutoff values are still controversial. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to assess the association of different coagulation indicators with clinical outcomes among DOACs using a meta-analysis of observational studies.

Methods

A medical literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library from inception to February 2020. Studies that reported relationships between coagulation indexes and clinical outcomes or the diagnostic value of coagulation assays were included in the analysis.

Findings

A total of 17 articles (7 meta-analyses and 10 systematic reviews) from 8904 citations were included in the analysis. In the analysis of bleeding events with coagulation indexes for DOACs, for peak prothrombin time level (cutoff value of 19-25 s), the pooled results found a sensitivity of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.44-0.75) and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.49-0.86). For rivaroxaban, the trough anti-factor Xa concentration (AXA-C) (cutoff value of 400-500 ng/mL) had a sensitivity of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.16-0.87) and a specificity of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.71-0.94), with a diagnostic odds ratio of 7 (95% CI, 2-32). For apixaban, trough AXA-C had a sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.60-0.96) and a specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.52-0.95). The AUC of the AXA-C peak was higher than that of the trough AXA-C for apixaban, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Compared with trough concentration of anti-factor IIa for dabigatran, the peak concentration had a higher specificity (98%) at the cutoff value of 484 ng/mL. In the analysis of thromboembolic events with coagulation indexes for DOACs, peak and trough prothrombin time values were not typically correlated with subsequent symptomatic venous thromboembolism, without a sensitivity or specificity higher than 90%. Trough AXA-C had a sensitivity of 100% and but a low specificity (<50%) for rivaroxaban-apixaban. Trough AXA-C had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 32% with a cutoff value of 108 ng/mL for dabigatran.

Implication

Peak prothrombin time (19-25 s) and AXA-C had a better predictive value on bleeding outcomes for rivaroxaban and apixaban, whereas peak concentration of anti-factor IIa activity can be an indicator for dabigatran. Coagulation indexes might not be a good indicator of thromboembolic events of DOACs. Because the limited studies focused on association of coagulation indicators and clinical outcomes, more studies are needed to verify this in the future.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^0020e4d8]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

A universal anti‐Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analysing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicentre cross‐sectional study, including 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti‐Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice. Anti‐Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban drug levels [r s = 0·98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·98–0·98]. The sensitivity for the clinically relevant cut‐off levels of 30, 50 and 100 µg/l was 96·2% (95% CI 94·4–97·4), 96·4% (95% CI 94·4–97·7) and 96·7% (95% CI 94·3–98·1) respectively. Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study. In conclusion, a universal, LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug concentrations in clinical practice.

### Apixaban concentrations in routine clinical care of older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^7ac9af66]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical care guidelines currently recommend direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), in part due to improved safety shown in clinical trials when compared to vitamin K antagonists.However, clinical trials often underenroll the oldest patients, women, patients with multiple medical conditions, patients receiving multiple medications, patients with moderate renal impairment, and patients with reduced physical function.,,The real-world experience in using DOACs in the decade after marketing approval in the United States has been accompanied by reports of higher rates of major bleeding than the pivotal clinical trials and substantial use of lower-than-labelled dosing for apixaban with potentially worse clinical outcomes for NVAF patients receiving lower-than-recommended doses.,,,,,,,,,,Both increased bleeding rates and reduced doses may have important relationships with DOAC concentrations. Peak concentrations reflect the maximal level of anticoagulation and would be expected to be related to bleeding risk. Trough levels reflect the minimum level of anticoagulation, and some minimum thresholds would be expected to be related to efficacy.

Our goal was to examine peak and trough steady-state concentrations of apixaban, the most commonly prescribed DOAC in older adults with NVAF, and compare concentrations during routine clinical care to reports from the pivotal efficacy trial.We also explored whether patient-level factors were related to apixaban concentrations.

### Validation of apixaban anti-factor Xa assay and impact of body weight [^5607a5b2]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are widely used as therapies for venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular diseases. However, routine coagulation monitoring is not required, but may be clinically indicated in high risk populations including obese patients.

Objectives

The aims of this study were two fold; to validate a chromogenic assay for anti-factor Xa measurement in patients taking apixaban, and correlate it with PT/INR and PTT, and to measure anti-factor Xa levels in patients who weighed >120 kg.

Patients/Methods

Patients who were taking apixaban had 3 blood samples drawn over a 4 h period. Apixaban levels were determined using an anti-factor Xa activity assay (STA-Liquid Anti-Xa) using STA-Apixaban Calibrator and STA-Apixaban Controls. The PT/INR was determined using standard methodology. Apix MS, using manufacturer provided apixaban standard, was performed on plasma.

Results and Conclusions

18 normal weight patients, 39 obese patients and 14 controls were enrolled. There was a strong correlation between apixaban anti-factor Xa activity compared to plasma Apix MS (r = 0.95). In patients >120 kg, there was a statistically significant decreased rate of change in anti-factor Xa levels after ingestion. Further, the area under the curve for apixaban anti-factor Xa levels was significantly lower in patients over 120 kg. While INR correlated with apixaban MS and apixaban anti-factor Xa activity in both normal weight and obese patients, the association was not sufficiently strong to clinically manage patients, normal weight or obese. Given these findings, research is necessary to investigate the clinical utility of apixaban anti-factor Xa activity measurement in selected populations.

### Laboratory measurement of the direct oral anticoagulants [^141a5eeb]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, are approved for thromboembolism prevention and treatment. These drugs do not require routine coagulation monitoring but, in some circumstances, measurement of drug level or anticoagulant effect may be necessary. Although traditional coagulation tests lack analytical sensitivity and specificity, they are widely available and inexpensive, and can provide useful information regarding the residual anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Hemoclot® and ecarin-based assays can be used to quantify dabigatran level and calibrated chromogenic anti-FXa assays are suitable for measuring rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban levels, but these tests are not yet widely available.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^bbc07400]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of apixaban

The unit`s drug monitoring program was set to measure apixaban drug levels on a regular base targeting measurements every three to six months allowing for individual measurements according to the treating physician. Measurements were performed before the start of the dialysis treatment at the beginning of the week (after two days without dialysis - long interval). The time of drug level monitoring after not one but two days without dialysis was chosen to detect overtly high drug level assuming only partial dialyzability.

Blood samples were obtained before administration of anticoagulants. After discarding the first 5-10 mL of blood, around 3 mL of blood were drawn using 4.3 mL citrate-plasma tubes and sent for analyses within 1 hour. The central laboratory of University Hospital Bern used the BIOPHEN TM Heparin LRT Anti-Xa chromogenic assay and the BIOPHEN TM Apixaban Calibrator, both HYPHEN BioMed®. Anti-Xa activity is determined via an accredited chromogenic substrate method and a proportional concentration output is provided in ng/mL via a serial dilution calibration process. Hereby, drug concentration is measured indirectly.

Patients were under apixaban 2.5 mg once or twice daily. In patients were times of prescribed drug intake (morning, midday or evening) matched starting times of their dialysis sessions (2 sessions were offered at our center, morning or midday), trough level could be determined: For once daily dosing, trough level could be determined if drug intake and dialysis sessions both took place in the morning or at midday. For twice daily dosing (morning and evening), trough level could be determined if dialysis sessions started in the morning. If no trough level determination was possible (e.g. once daily drug intake in the evening and start of dialysis session in the morning or twice daily drug intake and start of dialysis session at midday), level were regarded as random. In a few instances, drug levels were taken after the dialysis session to obtain post-dialysis trough level (e.g. twice daily dosing, dialysis at midday). Whenever possible, the treating physician tried to align medication and dialysis schedules to enable regular apixaban trough level monitoring. We decided against time-based analyses, as it was impossible to retrospectively figure out exact timing of drug intake. Whenever trough level obtainment was possible (24 hours level in once daily dosing, 12 hours level in twice daily dosing), the dialysis care team routinely instructed patients in advance to postpone drug intake until blood had been sampled.

Apixaban—pharmacology and interactions—Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor with an oral bioavailability of > 45%. In healthy men, plasma levels peak about 3 h after oral administration and clearance occurs with a terminal plasma half-life of 8 to 14 h. Elimination involves multiple pathways, including oxidative metabolism and renal and intestinal routes. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, are contraindicated because they increase plasma drug concentrations.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in adult patients with traumatic brain injury receiving oral anticoagulant therapy: an Austrian interdisciplinary consensus statement [^f5fb1609]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical question: Which test should be used to rule out the presence of apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban anticoagulation?

We recommend measuring anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) activity—calibrated to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or the specific “xaban” of interest—to rule out apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban anticoagulation.

(a) Calibrated to LMWH, an anti-Xa activity below the detection limit of the respective laboratory excludes (remaining) xaban-associated anticoagulation.

(b) Calibrated to the particular xaban, anti-Xa activity < 30 ng/ml excludes (remaining) xaban-associated anticoagulation.

To exclude the effects of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban (xabans), an anti-Xa test calibrated to LMWH can be used if the assay has been tested by specific standards for its sensitivity (lower detection limit).

Xaban levels can be specifically determined using an anti-Xa test calibrated for the particular xaban of interest [–,]. However, these specific anti-Xa tests are usually only offered by specialist coagulation laboratories and may not be available at all times of the day or week.

Hankey et al. concluded that a clinically relevant level of rivaroxaban or apixaban can be excluded if the anti-Xa level is below the limit of detection—typically > 5 h after the last dose. It should be noted that there are pharmacokinetic differences between xabans (e.g. peak and trough plasma levels). A xaban level < 30 ng/ml excludes a relevant risk of bleeding, but the detection limit of the available assays is 30 ng/ml.

“Safe for treatment thresholds” for stroke lysis are < 91 ng/ml for rivaroxaban and < 40 ng/ml for apixaban. Further xaban thresholds from the ISTH are as follows: < 30 ng/ml, acceptable for patients undergoing surgery with a high risk of bleeding; > 30 ng/ml, administer PCC before surgery with a high risk of bleeding; > 50 ng/ml, administer when a patient is bleeding heavily.

### Apixaban and rivaroxaban anti-Xa level monitoring versus standard monitoring in hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury [^fe415afb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (FxaIs) are renally eliminated; thus, acute kidney injury (AKI) may increase the risk for drug accumulation and bleeding. There is minimal data describing the effects of AKI on FxaI anti-Xa levels or clinical outcomes.

Objective

To compare anti-Xa level monitoring with standard monitoring in patients who experience AKI on apixaban or rivaroxaban.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients admitted within a large hospital system from May 2016 to October 2020. Patients were included if they received apixaban or rivaroxaban prior to AKI. Patients were stratified into 1 of 2 groups: those with anti-Xa level monitoring or those who received standard monitoring. The primary outcome was major bleeding as defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

Results

A total of 196 patients were included in the final analysis. Major bleeding occurred in 2 patients who received anti-Xa level monitoring, compared with 14 patients who received standard monitoring (2.1% vs 14%; P < 0.01). Variables identified as predictors of major bleeding included a documented history of liver disease (adjusted odds ratio = 3.17; 95% CI = 1.04-9.67; P = 0.04) and antiplatelet use (adjusted odds ratio = 4.18; 95% CI = 1.28-13.7; P = 0.02).

Conclusion and Relevance

This is the first study to demonstrate that anti-Xa level monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in major bleeding compared with standard monitoring in patients with AKI who received apixaban or rivaroxaban. The optimal management of antithrombotic medications in patients with AKI and recent exposure to an FxaI requires further investigation.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^e9a10dbd]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inconsistent study results and contradictory recommendations from health authorities regarding the use of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis have generated considerable uncertainty among clinicians, making investigations of appropriate dosing an unmet need.

Methods

We analyzed pre-dialysis apixaban drug levels from a tertiary care dialysis unit, comparing 2.5 mg once versus twice daily dosing. We applied mixed-effects models including dialysis modality, adjusted standard Kt/V, ultrafiltration, and dialyzer characteristics. We included an exploratory analysis of bleeding events and compared the drug levels of our dialysis patients to those from non-CKD reference populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily.

Results

We analyzed 143 drug levels from 24 patients. Mean (SD) age at first drug level measurement was 64.7 (15.9) years (50 % female), median (IQR) follow-up was 12.5 (5.5 – 21) months. For the apixaban 2.5 mg once and twice daily groups, median (IQR) drug levels were 54.4 (< 40 – 72.1) and 71.3 (48.8 – 104.1) ng/mL respectively (P < 0.001). Levels were below the detection limit in 30 % (with 2.5 mg once daily) and 14 % (with 2.5 mg twice daily) respectively. Only dosing group (twice versus once daily) was independently associated with higher drug levels (P = 0.002). Follow-up did not suggest accumulation. The 95 th percentile of drug levels did not exceed those of non-CKD populations taking 5 mg twice daily. Median (IQR) drug levels before a bleeding (8 episodes) were higher than those without a subsequent bleeding: 111.6 (83.1 – 129.3) versus 54.8 (< 40 – 77.1) ng/mL (P < 0.001). Concomitant antiplatelet therapy was used in 86% of those with bleeding events versus 6% without bleeding events (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Drug monitoring may be a contributory tool to increase patient safety. Despite non-existing target ranges, drug levels on both edges of the spectrum (e.g. below detectability or beyond the 95 th percentiles of reference populations) may improve decision-making in highly individualized risk-benefit analyses.

Factor Xa inhibitor laboratory assessment—preferred anti-FXa quantitation and PT/aPTT limitations: For apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, the preferred test for quantitation is a chromogenic anti-FXa assay calibrated with the drug of interest; anti-FXa assays may also be useful for betrixaban with method modification for sensitivity; when anti-FXa assays are calibrated with low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin standards, they can exclude clinically important levels but are not for quantitation; if anti-FXa is not available, PT may be useful qualitatively for betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, where a prolonged PT suggests on-therapy or above on-therapy levels but a normal PT may not exclude on-therapy levels; PT and aPTT are insensitive to apixaban, and a normal PT and aPTT do not exclude on-therapy or above on-therapy apixaban levels; whole-blood viscoelastic assays (TEG/ROTEM) show dose-dependent changes with DOACs, but thresholds adequate to guide reversal use have not been established.

Cross‐sectional study: design, setting and population

We conducted a prospective, multicentre cross‐sectional study to test the hypothesis that a LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay would accurately measure rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug levels in clinical practice and correctly predict clinically relevant concentrations. The flow chart of the patients is given in Fig 1. Consecutive in‐ and outpatients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban in clinical practice were included in 2018 and 2019 in nine major haemostasis laboratories affiliated to Swiss tertiary hospitals. Inclusion criteria were: (a) age >18 years, (b) use of rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban, (c) drug‐level requested and (d) signed general informed consent, if required by local authorities. Exclusion criteria were: (a) refused general informed consent, (b) additional use of heparin, (c) more than one DOAC used, (d) pre‐analytical issues and (e) insufficient sample material. The appropriate Ethics Committee approved the protocol and the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.

Flow of the patients. A prospective, multicentre cross‐sectional study was conducted to test the hypothesis that a universal anti‐Xa assay would accurately measure rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban drug levels in clinical practice, and correctly predict clinically relevant drug levels.

Ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC‐MS/MS) targeting rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and edoxaban M4 metabolite was conducted as the reference standard in parallel to the LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay at Inselspital, Bern University Hospital; details are discussed below. Clinically relevant drug concentrations were defined as 30, 50 and 100 mg/l. 24

To determine the limit of detection (LOD), 20 blank samples were determined on 20 consecutive days. 25 Samples with low drug concentration (~80 µg/l) and high drug concentration (200 µg/l) were measured 15 times to determine the within‐run imprecision and on 15 consecutive days to verify the day‐to‐day imprecision.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^f4d026b0]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs—pre-operative DOAC level testing and circumstances for longer interruption are outlined: Measurement of DOAC levels before the surgery/procedure may be considered in patients who require an urgent (ie, within 24 hours) surgery, because routine coagulation tests such as the INR or aPTT may be insensitive; testing options include DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa levels for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, though questions remain as to their clinical utility. There may be selected patients in whom a longer duration of pre-operative DOAC interruption may be required due to the longer time required for drug clearance as 75% to 80% of dabigatran clearance is by the kidney and in those with severely impaired renal function (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or hepatic dysfunction or taking drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein pathways.

1.3. Clinical studies

In a phase 2 dose-ranging, proof-of-concept study in healthy, nonbleeding volunteers treated with apixaban, rivaroxaban, the LMWH enoxaparin, or edoxaban, andexanet demonstrated rapid (within 2 minutes) reversal of anticoagulation activity, as measured by anti-FXa activity assays; anti-FXa activity returned to placebo levels in approximately 2 hours after treatment in the study of reversal of edoxaban-induced anticoagulation. The reversal could be extended with a continuous infusion. There were no observed thrombotic events, serious adverse events, discontinuation because of adverse events, or antibodies to endogenous human FXa or FX.

Andexanet has since been studied in phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies as a single bolus or a bolus plus 2-hour infusion in nonbleeding healthy older adults (50–75 years) treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban. Andexanet was administered as a bolus plus 2-hour infusion because the half-life of the drug is approximately 1 hour (Fig. 2). The apixaban and rivaroxaban groups were administered 400 or 800 mg of andexanet, respectively; doses were selected on the basis of the stoichiometric ratio needed for the reversal of each anticoagulant. In the apixaban group, anti-FXa activity was reduced by 94% in subjects (n = 24) who received an andexanet bolus versus 21% in participants (n = 9) who received placebo (P <.001), and the concentration of unbound apixaban was reduced by 9.3 ng/mL versus 1.9 ng/mL (P <.001); thrombin generation was fully restored within 2 to 5 minutes in 100% versus 11% of subjects (P <.001) (Fig. 2A). In the rivaroxaban group, anti-FXa activity was reduced by 92% in subjects (n = 27) who received an andexanet bolus versus 18% in subjects (n = 14) who received placebo (P <.001), and the concentration of unbound rivaroxaban was reduced by 23.4 ng/mL versus 4.2 ng/mL (P <.001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 96% versus 7% of subjects (P <.001) (Fig. 2B). When andexanet was administered as a bolus plus 2-hour infusion, these effects were sustained in subjects treated with apixaban and rivaroxaban (Fig. 2C and D). Transient increases in levels of D-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1.2) occurred in a subgroup of subjects, raising a concern for prothrombotic effect, but this normalized within 24 to 72 hours. Mild infusion reactions were reported in some subjects, and 1 subject developed hives. Subjects were followed for 6 weeks, and there were no serious adverse events, thromboembolic events, or neutralizing antibody development.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^fde4a60b]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

How should the universal assay be applied? Two different options appear feasible and are illustrated in Table I. First, cut‐off values for the clinical thresholds 30, 50 and 100 µg/l can be given. The corresponding categorical result is the most crucial information, which might directly prompt clinical decision making. Second, the regression equations can be used to determine drug levels as accurate as possible.

Our present findings confirm that LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assays can be used as a universal anti‐Xa assay to determine rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug concentrations in clinical practice. Even though a high accuracy was observed at all clinically relevant cut‐offs, a wider spread and a non‐linear curve was observed in samples with high drug levels. The reason for this effect was the maximum level, which can be measured with the LMWH‐calibrated assay (3·34 u/ml corresponding to a drug level of 483 µg/l). Although this effect will not alter most clinical decisions, drug levels might be underestimated in case of intoxications and accumulation. However, LMWH‐calibrated assays might not only simplify laboratory procedures and save healthcare costs; it might foster the implementation of anti‐Xa assays in a variety of institutions. However, whether this universal assay can be implemented for the determination of DOAC drug levels depends on national in vitro diagnostics (IVD) regulations and potential Conformité Européene (CE) labelling of the manufacturer. In our laboratory, we implemented it as a laboratory‐developed in‐house test.

Rapid determination of DOAC drug levels is essential in critical clinical situations such as significant bleeding, urgent surgery or planned thrombolysis. 1 Given that the proportion of patients with DOAC is rapidly increasing worldwide, universal anti‐Xa assays have the potential to improve care in many patients and various healthcare settings. Future research shall confirm our observations in different healthcare settings, patient populations and using other LMWH‐calibrated assays. While LC‐MS/MS is expensive and might not be available in certain institutions, drug‐specific anti‐Xa assays or even the Biophen ® Heparin LRT can be utilised as a surrogate reference standard as well.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: recent advances in oral anticoagulation therapy [^b0c7bbc3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer.Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described.Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required., However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Laboratory measurement of the anticoagulant activity of the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^45327f74]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require routine laboratory monitoring. However, laboratory measurement may be desirable in special situations and populations.

Objectives

This study's objective was to systematically review and summarize current evidence regarding laboratory measurement of the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies that reported a relationship between drug levels of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban and coagulation assay results. Study quality was evaluated using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2).

Results

We identified 17 eligible studies for dabigatran, 15 for rivaroxaban, and 4 for apixaban. For dabigatran, a normal thrombin time excludes clinically relevant drug concentrations. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) are less sensitive and may be normal at trough drug levels. The dilute thrombin time (R(2) = 0.92 to 0.99) and ecarin-based assays (R(2) = 0.92 to 1.00) show excellent linearity across on-therapy drug concentrations and may be used for drug quantification. For rivaroxaban and apixaban, anti-Xa activity is linear (R(2) = 0.89 to 1.00) over a wide range of drug levels and may be used for drug quantification. Undetectable anti-Xa activity likely excludes clinically relevant drug concentrations. The PT is less sensitive (especially for apixaban); a normal PT may not exclude clinically relevant levels. The APTT demonstrates insufficient sensitivity and linearity for quantification.

Conclusions

Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban exhibit variable effects on coagulation assays. Understanding these effects facilitates interpretation of test results in NOAC-treated patients. More information on the relationship between drug levels and clinical outcomes is needed.

Apixaban—anesthetic management for neuraxial procedures: We suggest that apixaban be discontinued 72 hours prior to neuraxial block, with consideration to check apixaban or anti–factor Xa activity level if less than 72 hours and noting that an acceptable level remains undetermined (grade 2C). We suggest that neuraxial catheters be removed 6 hours prior to the first (postoperative) dose (grade 2C). With unanticipated administration with indwelling catheter, we suggest that apixaban dosing be held for 26 to 30 hours or an anti–factor Xa assay calibrated to apixaban be assessed before the catheter is removed (grade 2C).

### Pros and cons of new oral anticoagulants [^246e9b45]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

The availability of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) targeting either thrombin (dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis has been highly anticipated. NOACs have major pharmacologic advantages over vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), including rapid onset/offset of action, few drug interactions, and predictable pharmacokinetics, eliminating the requirement for regular coagulation monitoring. Regulatory agencies have approved several NOACs for specific indications based on the results of clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety that are at least as good, if not better, than warfarin (for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism) or low-molecular-weight heparin, which is injectable (for initial treatment of venous thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty). However, the adoption of this new therapeutic class into clinical practice has been slower than expected due to several factors including concerns regarding medication adherence without laboratory monitoring, uncertainty about dosing in some patient populations (eg, renal dysfunction, marked extremes of body weight), and higher drug costs compared with warfarin. Other issues are the current absence of specific antidotes for NOACs and assays to measure drug levels at most centers. The indications for NOACs on the market will expand and at least one additional agent (edoxaban) will likely gain approval within the next 2 years. As practitioners gain familiarity with the drugs and healthcare systems adapt to their use, NOAC use will increase substantially over time. Warfarin, however, will continue to be an appropriate anticoagulant choice for many patients.

### Real-world rivaroxaban and apixaban levels in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation [^ef1b1a05]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

In contrast, around 75% of patients in the rivaroxaban group received the appropriate dose as per the Japanese package insert, 15 but only 30% of the peak levels were within the expected range. The results for trough levels were similar. If we propose a level of > 30 ng/mL as effective for anticoagulant activity, 16, 17 a standard reported in some expert opinion, only 27% of the trough levels fulfilled this criteria. If we use the threshold for severe stroke reported in the German study, only 14% reached the cutoff point. 10 A study in Singapore reported results similar to ours: under identical dosing regimens, drug levels for Singaporean patients was lower than 50% of that measured in white patients, for both the trough and peak levels. 18 However, one Canadian study with a design similar to ours showed that most out‐of‐range rivaroxaban levels exceeded the higher end of the range (around 40%). 19

### Direct oral anticoagulant drug level testing in clinical practice: a single institution experience [^02a125e6]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

We performed a review of all direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) levels - ecarin times for dabigatran and anti-Xa levels for rivaroxaban and apixaban - ordered at our institution with the purpose of evaluating DOAC levels from "real-world" (non-clinical trial) patients taking DOACs long-term, in order to assess levels obtained, reasons for checking levels, and actions taken based on the testing result. A total of 28 patients had 48 levels sent over a 36-month period. The majority of outpatient levels were within or close to the range of published values. The setting in which levels were sent influenced how results affected management decisions: in the outpatient setting, the majority of levels served to reassure clinicians that DOAC levels were within expected ranges resulting in continuation of chosen management, whereas in the inpatient setting, DOAC levels were used most frequently to detect DOAC presence in urgent clinical situations and influenced clinical decision-making in the peri-procedural and pre-operative periods. Our results demonstrate that while testing may be useful if immediately available in urgent clinical situations where assessment of drug presence is needed, DOAC level monitoring is infrequently used overall, and the lack of use combined with the paucity of available evidence to guide clinical decision-making based on the results suggests there is little urgency to make the tests widely available for routine use outside of acute settings in the emergency department and urgent surgical setting.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^9fe66067]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We provided results from apixaban drug level monitoring in hemodialysis patients on different dosing regimens. We investigated risk factors for increased drug level, an analysis with regard to bleeding events and provided a literature comparison to non-CKD populations.

With regard to a 2.5 mg twice daily dosing in patients on hemodialysis, our median drug levels were comparable to those from non-CKD-populations, taking the same reduced dose, published among others by the European Union summary of product characteristics) although with a larger 5 th – 95 th percentile range (71 [< 40 – 141] versus 56 [24 – 103], 79 [34 – 162], 63 [11 – 90] ng/mL). However, our median (5 th – 95 th percentiles) drug levels appeared considerably lower in comparison to non-CKD-reference populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice-daily. Hence, looking at drug level data only, our results suggest, that 2.5 mg twice daily is not associated with overtly increased drug exposition compared to non-CKD patients for whom licensure studies were performed. On the contrary, our results rather suggest, that with 2.5 mg twice daily (14 % below detection limit), and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing (30 % below detection limit), individual patients are probably under-dosed, arguing for more routine drug monitoring. It is worth mentioning however, that some patients on 2.5 mg once daily dosing showed comparable drug level to other patients on 2.5 mg twice-daily schedules. In addition, 2.5mg once daily dosing might still confer valuable prophylactic benefits e.g. for long-term patency of venous accesses.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: new drugs and new concepts [^bb910b71]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are approved for multiple thromboembolic disorders and provide advantages over existing agents. As with all anticoagulants, management protocols for the eventuality of bleeding are important. Randomized phase III studies generally show that DOACs have a similar risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared with standard anticoagulants, with reductions in major bleeding in some cases. This may be particularly important in patients with atrial fibrillation, for whom the rate of intracranial hemorrhage was approximately halved with DOACs compared with warfarin. Conversely, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be increased. Specific patient characteristics, such as renal impairment, comedications, and particular aspects of each drug, including the proportion eliminated by the kidneys, must be taken into account when assessing the risk of bleeding. Although routine coagulation monitoring of DOACs is not required, it may be useful under some circumstances. Of the traditional clotting assays, a sensitive and calibrated prothrombin time may be useful for detecting the presence or absence of clinically relevant factor Xa inhibitor concentrations (rivaroxaban or apixaban), but specific anti-factor Xa assays can measure drug levels quantitatively. For dabigatran, the results of an activated partial thromboplastin time test may exclude a clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effect, but a calibrated dilute thrombin time assay can be used for quantification of drug levels. In the event of mild or moderate bleeding, normal hemostatic support measures are recommended. For life-threatening bleeding, use of nonspecific prohemostatic agents may be considered, although clinical evidence is scarce. Specific antidotes are in development.

### Anti-Xa oral anticoagulant plasma concentration assay in real life: rivaroxaban and apixaban quantification in emergency with LMWH calibrator [^479e5fc0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral anti-Xa inhibitors have demonstrated noninferiority to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and recurrent venous thromboembolism. They are associated with a decrease in major bleeding. In contrast with VKA, no coagulation monitoring is required. However, in clinical practice, determination of drug concentration is sometimes necessary.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) calibrated anti-Xa assay for the quantification of rivaroxaban and apixaban plasma concentration in emergency.

Methods

The anti-Xa plasma concentration of rivaroxaban and apixaban were measured in emergency in 210 patients using STA anti-Xa liquid assay. For each plasma concentration <150 ng/mL of rivaroxaban or apixaban, an anti-Xa assay calibrated with LMWH was performed.

Results

We demonstrated a significant correlation between LMWH anti-Xa activity and rivaroxaban ( R 2 = 0.947) or apixaban ( R 2 = 0.959) concentration and a significant correlation between rivaroxaban and apixaban plasma concentration ( R 2 = 0.972). A LMWH anti-Xa activity <0.50 IU/mL could exclude a plasma concentration of rivaroxaban and apixaban >30 ng/mL and indicate the feasibility of invasive procedure. Conclusion and Relevance: In the absence of a specific test, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay could be used to determine the presence and evaluate the plasma concentration of oral anti-Xa inhibitors. However, these initial findings require confirmation using other chromogenic calibrated oral anti-Xa assays.

### Preclinical and clinical data for factor Xa and "Universal" reversal agents [^a1508988]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies

In a phase 2 dose-ranging, proof-of-concept study in healthy, nonbleeding volunteers treated with apixaban, rivaroxaban, the LMWH enoxaparin,or edoxaban,andexanet demonstrated rapid (within 2 minutes), reversal of anticoagulation activity, as measured by anti-FXa activity assays; anti-FXa activity returned to placebo levels in approximately 2 hours after treatment in the study of reversal of edoxaban-induced anticoagulation.The reversal could be extended with a continuous infusion.There were no observed thrombotic events, serious adverse events, discontinuation because of adverse events, or antibodies to endogenous human FXa or FX. Andexanet has since been studied in phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies as a single bolus or a bolus plus 2-hour infusion in nonbleeding healthy older adults (50–75 years) treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban.Andexanet was administered as a bolus plus 2-hour infusion because the half-life of the drug is approximately 1 hour (Figure 2). The apixaban and rivaroxaban groups were administered 400 or 800 mg of andexanet, respectively; doses were selected on the basis of the stoichiometric ratio needed for the reversal of each anticoagulant. In the apixaban group, anti-FXa activity was reduced by 94% in subjects (n = 24) who received an andexanet bolus versus 21% in participants (n = 9) who received placebo (P <.001), and the concentration of unbound apixaban was reduced by 9.3 ng/mL versus 1.9 ng/mL (P <.001); thrombin generation was fully restored within 2 to 5 minutes in 100% versus 11% of subjects (P <.001) (Figure 2A).In the rivaroxaban group, anti-FXa activity was reduced by 92% in subjects (n = 27) who received an andexanet bolus versus 18% in subjects (n = 14) who received placebo (P <.001), and the concentration of unbound rivaroxaban was reduced by 23.4 ng/mL versus 4.2 ng/mL (P <.001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 96% versus 7% of subjects (P <.001) (Figure 2B).When andexanet was administered as a bolus plus 2-hour infusion, these effects were sustained in subjects treated with apixaban and rivaroxaban (Figure 2C and D). Transient increases in levels of D-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F1.2) occurred in a subgroup of subjects, raising a concern for prothrombotic effect, but this normalized within 24 to 72 hours.Mild infusion reactions were reported in some subjects, and 1 subject developed hives.Subjects were followed for 6 weeks, and there were no serious adverse events, thromboembolic events, or neutralizing antibody development.

### Apixaban [^5a463851]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans during the apixaban development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

 Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of Apixaban Tablets 

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received apixaban tablets.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review [^311cad0e]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or noncancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to summarize systematically evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

Results

We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays, showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated linear correlation (r 2 = 0.67-0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated linear correlation (r 2 = 0.78-1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

Conclusions

An ideal test, offering both accuracy and precision for measurement of any DOAC is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT or APTT is recommended over PT/INR for assessment of dabigatran, and PT/INR is recommended over APTT for detection of factor Xa inhibitors. Time since last dose, the presence or absence of drug interactions, and renal and hepatic function should impact clinical estimates of anticoagulant effect in a patient for whom laboratory test results are not available.

### Peak and trough concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban in adult patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c6f2db7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Apixaban and rivaroxaban are activated factor X (FXa) inhibitors commonly used for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. While routine monitoring of their concentrations is not recommended, but it may be beneficial in certain situations. Expected peak and trough concentrations remain poorly understood, with most data derived from small studies.

Objectives

To establish the average peak and trough concentrations of apixaban and rivaroxaban from real-world studies.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until October 2023 for observational studies reporting apixaban and rivaroxaban concentrations. Meta-regression was used to examine factors influencing these concentrations.

Results

Sixteen studies involving 1054 apixaban and 1321 rivaroxaban patients were pooled using random-effects model. Mean apixaban peak concentrations were 157 ng/mL (95% CI, 127-187) for 2.5 mg and 228 ng/mL (95% CI, 204-252) for 5 mg, with trough concentrations of 77 ng/mL (95% CI, 56-98) and 113 ng/mL (95% CI, 101-124), respectively. Mean rivaroxaban peak concentrations were 168 ng/mL (95% CI, 104-232) for 10 mg, 225 ng/mL (95% CI, 192-257) for 15 mg, and 229 ng/mL (95% CI, 193-264) for 20 mg, with trough concentrations of 23 ng/mL (95% CI, 13-32), 31 ng/mL (95% CI, 26-36), and 36 ng/mL (95% CI, 25-47), respectively. Meta-regression revealed age and creatinine clearance correlated with apixaban peak concentrations. Creatinine clearance correlated with apixaban and rivaroxaban trough concentrations.

Conclusion

The pooled mean concentrations align with expected concentration ranges reported in different pharmacokinetic studies.

In all, 35 patients were excluded because of heparin use, two were excluded because more than one DOAC was used, five were excluded due to pre‐analytical issues, and 23 were excluded due to insufficient sample material. Thus, 867 patients were eventually available for analysis. Among those, 375 patients were taking rivaroxaban, 426 apixaban and 66 edoxaban. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 76 (66–82) years and 42·8% of the patients were female. Rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban drug levels were balanced distributed over the full range of measurements (Fig 3).

Measurements of a universal, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH)‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay in relation to drug concentrations in a multicentre cross‐sectional study conducted in clinical practice (n = 867). Drug concentrations were determined using ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS). Of the patients, 375 were taking rivaroxaban, 426 apixaban and 66 edoxaban. Spearman correlation coefficient was 0·99 for rivaroxaban (95% CI 0·98–0·99), 0·97 for apixaban (95% CI 0·96–0·97), and 0·98 for edoxaban (95% CI 0·95–0·99).

Diagnostic accuracy

The association between measurements of the LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay and drug concentrations is shown in Fig 3. The Spearman correlation coefficient r s was 0·99 for rivaroxaban (95% CI 0·98–0·99), 0·97 for apixaban (95% CI 0·96–0·97) and 0·98 for edoxaban (95% CI 0·95–0·99). Below 50 µg/l, the r s was 0·90 (95% CI 0·88–0·93) and above 200 µg/l, the r s was 0·80 (95% CI 0·74–0·86). Above 483 µg/l, the r s was 0·40 and the association was not linear anymore (Fig 3).

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^514b3804]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) qualitative assessment when assays suitable for quantitation are not available—interpretive use of routine coagulation tests: For dabigatran, use thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); Normal TT excludes clinically relevant levels, but Prolonged TT does not discriminate between clinically significant and insignificant levels, and Normal aPTT usually excludes clinically relevant levels if a sensitive reagent is used; for detecting on-therapy or above on-therapy levels, Prolonged aPTT suggests presence of such levels, while Normal aPTT may not exclude them, particularly with relatively insensitive reagents. For apixaban, Normal PT and aPTT do not exclude clinically relevant levels, whereas UFH or LMWH anti-FXa below the lower limit of quantitation probably excludes clinically relevant levels; on-therapy levels are suggested by Prolonged PT, although Normal PT may not exclude them, particularly with relatively insensitive PT reagents. For betrixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, UFH or LMWH anti-FXa below the lower limit of quantitation probably excludes clinically relevant levels and Prolonged PT suggests on-therapy or above on-therapy levels, while Normal PT may not exclude them; the table notes that consideration of anticoagulant reversal is recommended for serious bleeding with a DOAC level >50 ng/mL and for invasive procedures with high bleeding risk at >30 ng/mL.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^3de0f687]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a comprehensive set of evaluation studies, a universal LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay accurately estimated concentrations of rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and correctly predicted relevant drug levels. We demonstrated a sensitive and linear relationship between drug concentrations and the assay measurements in spiking experiments. In an extensive retrospective analysis, we confirmed the method’s feasibility by comparing drug‐specific measurements with LMWH‐calibrated results. A large prospective multicentre cross‐sectional study utilising LC‐MS/MS as a reference standard established a high accuracy and sound sensitivity and specificity for clinically relevant thresholds. Also, external validation conducted in nine laboratories confirmed that the assay can be applied to other institutions.

A few preliminary studies proposing a single calibration to determine all anti‐Xa inhibitors have been conducted; our present results are essentially consistent with those results. A high level of correlation was observed in a retrospective study measuring an LMWH‐calibrated assay and LC‐MS/MS in 210 patients taking rivaroxaban or apixaban. 28 Similar results were also reported by a retrospective analysis by Douxfils et al. 18 in 52 patients and another cross‐sectional analysis in 30 patients. 29 More recently, rivaroxaban and apixaban‐calibrated anti‐Xa measurements were compared with possible LMWH‐calibrated measurements as inferred from the same measurement. 30 In addition, in vitro or ex vivo spiking experiments have been done by several other authors, reporting correlation coefficients ranging between 0·98 and 1·00. 14, 15, 31 However, these studies’ methodology is limited by the number of participants, the choice of the reference standard, the retrospective design, the range of measurements or the selection of drugs.

### Andexanet alfa for the reversal of factor Xa inhibitor activity [^9eb77f30]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bleeding is a complication of treatment with factor Xa inhibitors, but there are no specific agents for the reversal of the effects of these drugs. Andexanet is designed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of factor Xa inhibitors.

Methods

Healthy older volunteers were given 5 mg of apixaban twice daily or 20 mg of rivaroxaban daily. For each factor Xa inhibitor, a two-part randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate andexanet administered as a bolus or as a bolus plus a 2-hour infusion. The primary outcome was the mean percent change in anti-factor Xa activity, which is a measure of factor Xa inhibition by the anticoagulant.

Results

Among the apixaban-treated participants, anti-factor Xa activity was reduced by 94% among those who received an andexanet bolus (24 participants), as compared with 21% among those who received placebo (9 participants) (P<0.001), and unbound apixaban concentration was reduced by 9.3 ng per milliliter versus 1.9 ng per milliliter (P<0.001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 100% versus 11% of the participants (P<0.001) within 2 to 5 minutes. Among the rivaroxaban-treated participants, anti-factor Xa activity was reduced by 92% among those who received an andexanet bolus (27 participants), as compared with 18% among those who received placebo (14 participants) (P<0.001), and unbound rivaroxaban concentration was reduced by 23.4 ng per milliliter versus 4.2 ng per milliliter (P<0.001); thrombin generation was fully restored in 96% versus 7% of the participants (P<0.001). These effects were sustained when andexanet was administered as a bolus plus an infusion. In a subgroup of participants, transient increases in levels of d-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 were observed, which resolved within 24 to 72 hours. No serious adverse or thrombotic events were reported.

Conclusions

Andexanet reversed the anticoagulant activity of apixaban and rivaroxaban in older healthy participants within minutes after administration and for the duration of infusion, without evidence of clinical toxic effects.

### Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) [^0423388e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 3 ANNEXA-4 (NCT02329327)

In a multinational, prospective, single-arm, open-label study, ANDEXXA was administered to 477

patients taking FXa inhibitors who presented with acute major bleeding.

The co-primary endpoints are: (a) percent change in anti-FXa activity from baseline to the nadir

between five minutes after the end of the bolus up until the end of the infusion; and (b) rate of

effective hemostasis within 12 hours after infusion, as rated by an independent endpoint

adjudication committee.

For the 477 patients dosed with ANDEXXA, 302 were efficacy-evaluable defined as patients (1)

on treatment with apixaban or rivaroxaban; (2) who had a baseline anti-FXa activity above 75

ng/mL; and (3) were adjudicated as meeting eligibility criteria for acute major bleeding [see

Adverse Reactions (6)] .

For anti-FXa activity, the median (95% CI) decrease from baseline to nadir in anti-FXa activity for

apixaban was -93% (-94%; -92%) and for rivaroxaban was -94% (-95%; -93%).

An improvement in hemostasis has not been established. ANDEXXA has not been shown to be

effective for bleeding related to any FXa inhibitors other than apixaban or rivaroxaban.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^8ae8099a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Factor Xa inhibitor–associated major bleeding—dose suggestion and reversal agent preference are as follows: An initial intravenous dose of 50 U/kg is suggested for patients with FXa inhibitor major bleeding who are known or likely to have clinically significant anticoagulant levels, and based on currently available data, the writing committee suggests andexanet alfa is preferable to 4F-PCC for treatment of patients with major bleeding on oral direct FXa inhibitors; this preference reflects that ANNEXA-4 demonstrated reversal and clinical hemostasis, that 4F-PCC data are primarily from small observational studies, and that andexanet alfa is the only treatment approved by the FDA for apixaban- and rivaroxaban-associated major bleeding.

### Monitoring and reversal of direct oral anticoagulants [^2f4c1c0d]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Although the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring and reduce bleeding compared with warfarin, there are special circumstances in which laboratory measurement or reversal of their anticoagulant effect may be indicated. The dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays are able to quantify dabigatran across a broad range of concentrations, but are not widely available. A normal thrombin time excludes clinically relevant levels and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time probably excludes excess levels of dabigatran. Factor Xa inhibitors may be quantified with an anti-Xa assay calibrated with drug-specific standards. A normal prothrombin time probably excludes excess levels of rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but not apixaban. Patients with minor and moderate DOAC-associated bleeding can be treated with supportive care and general hemostatic measures. Nonspecific reversal agents (eg, prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate) are of unproven benefit, carry a risk of thrombosis, and should be reserved for severe bleeding. Specific reversal agents, such as idarucizumab (a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran) and andexanet alfa (a recombinant factor Xa variant that binds factor Xa inhibitors but lacks coagulant activity), are in clinical development.

### Comparison of managing factor Xa inhibitor to unfractionated heparin transitions by aPTT versus a treatment guideline utilizing heparin anti-Xa levels [^fb16f772]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are inadequate data on the optimal strategy for transitioning factor Xa inhibitors (FXai; apixaban, rivaroxaban) to unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions.

Objective

In patients transitioning from an FXai to an UFH infusion, this study compared the safety and efficacy of monitoring UFH infusions using an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) titration scale versus utilizing an UFH-calibrated anti-Xa titration scale aided by a novel institutional guideline.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on adult patients transitioning from an FXai to an UFH infusion at 2 medical centers from June 1, 2018, to November 1, 2020. One institution utilized aPTT while the other institution primarily used UFH-calibrated anti-Xa. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, major bleeding, or new thrombosis during the hospitalization with a planned noninferiority analysis. Secondary outcomes were also collected including the amount and duration of UFH administered between cohorts.

Results

The incidence rate of the primary composite endpoint was 6.3% in the anti-Xa group and 11% in the aPTT group ( P < 0.001 for noninferiority, P = 0.138 for superiority) meeting noninferiority criteria. No statistical differences were seen in new thrombosis, major bleeding, or any bleeding.

Conclusion and Relevance

This represents the first report of a comparison between aPTT versus anti-Xa monitoring in relation to clinical outcomes for patients transitioning from an FXai to an UFH infusion. A transition guideline primarily utilizing an UFH-calibrated anti-Xa assay appears to be a safe alternative to aPTT monitoring and can aid facilities in the management of patients during these complex transitions.

### Real-world rivaroxaban and apixaban levels in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation [^bbf40bc2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

This study aims to measure the plasma levels of rivaroxaban and apixaban among Asian patients with atrial fibrillation and compare the results with expected drug levels from clinical studies. A total of 73 patients taking rivaroxaban and 105 patients taking apixaban were enrolled. Peak and trough levels were measured using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The percentage of those with drug levels within the expected range reported in clinical studies was significantly higher in the apixaban group than in the rivaroxaban group, both for trough (84.8% vs. 64.4%; P = 0.002) and peak levels (76.9% vs. 33.8%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, kidney function, appropriate dose, and adherence, patients taking rivaroxaban were still less likely to have peak and trough levels within the expected drug levels. Our real-world data suggests that Asian patients taking rivaroxaban are more likely to have out-of-expected drug levels than those taking apixaban.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^43850fe8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans primarily during the apixaban adult development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of ELIQUIS

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received ELIQUIS.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

### Absorption of apixaban following metabolic and bariatric surgery: is reluctance still warranted? [^5443070d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Absorption of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), may be impaired after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). The Dutch guideline advises to switch to vitamin K antagonists (VKA), while patients prefer the use of DOACs. Apixaban is not regularly prescribed after MBS due to a lack of evidence regarding its efficacy and safety. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban after MBS.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, chronic DOAC users who received pre and postoperative consultation and used apixaban (5 mg twice daily) after MBS with available anti-Xa levels were included. The outcomes were: incidence rate of postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic events, number of patients switching to VKA, and percentage of anti-Xa peak levels within the expected on-therapy range up to one year postoperative.

Results

Of the 97 included patients, 63.9% were female, median age was 57 years [51-61], and preoperative BMI 43.2 kg/m 2 [39.5-46.8], DOAC was mostly indicated because of atrial fibrillation (59.8%), and 71.1% underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. No thromboembolic events or major bleeds occurred and one clinically relevant non-major bleeding was observed (incidence rate 0.61(95% CI: 0.02-3.38) per 100 patient-years). One patient switched to VKA, and 91.1% of patients had postoperative anti-Xa peak levels within expected on-therapy range.

Conclusion

In this population of chronic DOAC users, apixaban with consultation including regular anti-Xa peak level measurements seems safe and effective after MBS. However, future prospective research in a larger population with longer follow-up, is needed to confirm these results.

### An assay to measure levels of factor Xa inhibitors in blood and plasma [^7a3d68da]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Essentials Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are used for stroke and venous thromboembolism prevention. We report a new assay that measures anti-factor Xa DOAC levels in plasma and whole blood. Rivaroxaban and apixaban can be accurately quantified below trough levels. The ease and accuracy of the assay demonstrate its potential for point-of-care applications.

Background

Rivaroxaban and apixaban are the most commonly used anti-factor (F) Xa direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), with indications for prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation as well as treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. However, lacking is accessibility to a detection method that is able to quantify low levels of anti-FXa DOACs.

Objective

We report a new assay that measures anti-FXa DOAC levels in plasma and whole blood.

Methods

This is achieved by the use of a prothrombin derivative that is labeled with a fluorescent probe (Flu-II), which then acts as the macromolecular substrate to measure residual FXa activity. The Flu-II cleavage is then initiated by the addition of a solution containing FXa, FVa, and phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (PCPS) vesicles with calcium, in the presence of hirudin to prevent feedback activity by the native thrombin generated. The Flu-II cleavage is monitored by fluorescence in real time where the initial rate of fluorescence change is inversely proportional to DOAC levels.

Results

In plasma systems, the assay demonstrates dose-response between 0 and 5 nmol/L rivaroxaban and between 0 and 10 nmol/L apixaban. Corn trypsin inhibitor did not affect this assay. With individual plasma samples, the assay showed excellent consistency and reproducibility. From 2 μL of whole blood, the assay showed dose-response between 0 and 2 nmol/L of DOACs in the final mixture of 100 μL, thus representing up to 100 nmol/L in circulating blood.

Conclusion

The assay is ideal for rapidly and accurately measuring DOAC levels in plasma and blood, demonstrating its potential for point-of-care applications.

### Real-world rivaroxaban and apixaban levels in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation [^5d16d80b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Monitoring NOAC levels is important for several reasons. The first is to measure drug adherence. One study with a similar design to ours reported that adherence significantly affected dabigatran levels. 26 As the half‐life for NOAC is short, the effect of a missed dose can be more prominent than in warfarin. 4 The second is to ensure the quality of NOAC therapy. In patients who concurrently take drugs having interactions with NOAC, with increased bleeding risks, and who were ordered an off‐label reduced NOAC dose, plasma drug‐level assessment helps physicians understand the current status of NOAC therapy. The third reason is to guide proper management in emergent circumstances. 4 Despite the prominent reduction in intracranial hemorrhage risk for NOAC compared with warfarin, occult thrombosis and critical bleeding were still reported in postmarketing use. 10, 26 Data from clinical studies showed that inappropriate trough levels affect effectiveness, just as inappropriate peak levels affect safety. 7, 8 Similar findings were recently reported from Germany, which showed a correlation of low rivaroxaban and apixaban levels with a more severe risk of stroke. 10 These reports suggest the potential benefits of routine drug monitoring. This pilot study helped facilities develop a standard process for monitoring NOAC levels and our data clearly demonstrate that a certain percentage of patients receiving NOACs may still fail to have drug levels within the expected therapeutic range, even with proper prescription and good compliance.

### 2016 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^d67c8d3b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

2014 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines—antithrombotic therapy and INR monitoring state that in patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy should be individualized based on shared decision-making after discussion of the absolute and RRs of stroke and bleeding, and the patient’s values and preferences (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). Selection of antithrombotic therapy should be based on the risk of thromboembolism irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). In patients with nonvalvular AF, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended and the target international normalized ratio (INR) intensity (2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5) should be based on the type and location of the prosthesis (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with nonvalvular AF with prior stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, oral anticoagulants are recommended; options include: warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) (Class I, Level of Evidence: A); dabigatran (Class I, Level of Evidence: B); rivaroxaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B); or apixaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). Among patients treated with warfarin, the INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of antithrombotic therapy and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR range) is stable (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of a direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). Re-evaluation of the need for and choice of antithrombotic therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risks (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). For patients with atrial flutter, antithrombotic therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for AF (Class I, Level of Evidence: C).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^2cc00731]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Periprocedural non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) discontinuation—dabigatran and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban—before procedures is stratified by creatinine clearance (CrCl) and procedural bleeding risk as follows: For CrCl ≥80 mL/min, low risk discontinue dabigatran ≥24 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥24 h; high risk discontinue dabigatran ≥48 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥48 h. For CrCl 50–80 mL/min, low risk discontinue dabigatran ≥36 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥24 h; high risk discontinue dabigatran ≥72 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥48 h. For CrCl 30–50 mL/min, low risk discontinue dabigatran ≥48 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥24 h; high risk discontinue dabigatran ≥96 h and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥48 h. For CrCl 15–30 mL/min*, dabigatran has “No official indication”; use apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban ≥36 h before low-risk and ≥48 h before high-risk procedures. For CrCl <15 mL/min, dabigatran has “No official indication” and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban have “No official indication for use.” When there is no important bleeding risk and/or adequate local hemostasis is possible, perform at trough level (i.e., ≥12 or 24 h after last intake). The bold values deviate from the common stopping rule of ≥24-hour low risk, ≥48-hour high risk, and there is no need for bridging with LMWH/UFH (low-molecular-weight heparin/unfractionated heparin).

### Laboratory monitoring of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use in patients with atrial fibrillation: a review [^2c24089f]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are administered in fixed doses without anticoagulant monitoring. Randomized trials show that unmonitored NOAC therapy is at least as effective as and safer than dose-adjusted warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Subgroup analyses indicate that plasma drug levels or anticoagulant activity of the NOACs predict stroke and bleeding. This review examines the historical basis for anticoagulant monitoring, discusses methods to measure and interpret drug levels, and critically assesses the role of routine laboratory monitoring in the management of NOAC therapy.

Observations

The predictable anticoagulant response of NOACs has provided the pharmacological basis for their administration in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. Although it is possible to accurately measure NOAC drug levels, within-patient variability complicates interpretation of these results. Furthermore, patient characteristics, such as age and renal function, confound the association between NOAC drug levels and clinical outcomes. Information is lacking on the optimal drug level in particular patient groups (eg, elderly, the renally impaired, and those with high bleeding risk), the appropriate dose adjustment to achieve expected levels, and whether routine laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment will improve clinical outcomes. A benefit of a management strategy that incorporates routine therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment over current standard-of-care metrics without such monitoring remains unproven.

Conclusions and Relevance

Robust evidence from patients with atrial fibrillation randomized to NOACs or warfarin demonstrates that unmonitored NOAC therapy is at least as effective and safe as monitored warfarin, with lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage and reduced mortality. Further research is required to determine whether routine laboratory monitoring might provide a net benefit for patients. Until such data are available, clinicians should continue to prescribe NOACs in fixed doses without routine monitoring.

### Apixaban concentrations in routine clinical care of older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^619fe374]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are first-line agents for prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), but data are limited for the oldest patients, and with reduced dosing.

Objectives

To determine steady-state apixaban peak and trough concentrations during routine care of older adults with NVAF, compare concentrations to clinical trial concentrations, and explore factors associated with concentrations.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of medically stable older adults with NVAF (≥75 years or ≥70 years if Black) receiving apixaban. Peak (2-4.4 hours post-dose) and trough (before next dose) concentrations were determined by anti-Xa activity calibrated chromogenic assay. Patient characteristics associated with concentrations were determined by multivariate modeling.

Results

The median age of patients (n = 115) was 80 (interquartile range: 77-84) years. The cohort comprised 46 women and 69 men; of which 98 are White, 11 Black, and 6 Asian. With 5 mg twice daily per labelling (n = 88), peak concentrations were higher in women: 248 ± 105 vs 174 ± 67 ng/mL in men ( P < 0.001) and exceeded expected 95% range in 6 of 30 vs 0 of 55 men ( P = 0.002). With 2.5 mg twice daily per label (n = 11), concentrations were <5 mg twice daily (peak: 136 ± 87 vs 201 ± 90 ng/mL, P = 0.026; trough: 65 ± 28 vs 109 ± 56 ng/mL, P < 0.001), but not different than 2.5 mg twice daily without reduction criteria (n = 13; peak: 132 ± 88; trough: 65 ± 31 ng/mL). Covariates associated with concentrations included sex, number of daily medications, and creatinine clearance.

Conclusions

Older women had higher than expected peak apixaban concentrations, and 2.5 mg twice daily produced lower concentrations than standard dosing. Factors not currently included in dosing recommendations affected concentrations. The impact of apixaban concentrations on outcomes needs evaluation.

### Real-world rivaroxaban and apixaban levels in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation [^ba074170]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) therapy has replaced warfarin as the first‐line treatment for preventing stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 1, 2, 3 Unlike warfarin, NOAC targets a specific coagulation factor. All NOAC agents claim to have linear and predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, have low drug−drug interaction, and do not require routine laboratory monitoring. 4 Nevertheless, the exposure for NOACs is still affected by such patient characteristics as sex, age, body weight, ethnicity, renal function, and comedications. 4, 5, 6 Clinical studies have elucidated the exposure relationship responses. The Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE‐LY) and the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next‐Generation in Atrial Fibrillation‐Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48 (ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48) studies have shown an association between low plasma drug levels and increased risk of ischemic stroke. 7, 8 Therefore, the current one‐size‐fits‐all dosing approach does not yield ideal outcomes for all patients. Measuring NOAC levels remains the most arbitrary method by which to guide critical decisions in cases of occult thrombosis or major bleeding. 4

Rivaroxaban and apixaban are the two most frequently prescribed factor Xa inhibitors. 4 The most remarkable difference between them is the frequency of drug administration (i.e. once daily for rivaroxaban and twice daily for apixaban). 4 The labeled dosage for rivaroxaban in Japan is unique (i.e. 15 mg daily rather than 20 mg) based on a pharmacokinetic model‐based study. 5 In Taiwan, most physicians follow the dosage recommendations for Japan, considering the similar ethnic characteristics, such as low body weight. 9 Currently, rivaroxaban and apixaban both lack exposure and response analysis data. One recently published study from Germany investigated the correlation between antifactor Xa activity (AXA) in rivaroxaban or apixaban users and the severity of ischemic stroke at the time of admission. 10 The results showed that low NOAC levels were associated with higher stroke severity (as represented by higher initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores), persistence in neurological deficits, and cerebral infarction on brain image. 10

### Apixaban concentrations in routine clinical care of older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^6c022bed]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Important differences exist between clinical trial populations and patients receiving apixaban during routine clinical care. Patients receiving DOACs during routine clinical care are on average older with 25% to 40% over the age of 80 years compared to the mean age of 70 years in the pivotal clinical trial. Renal clearance on average is lower, with only 15% with moderate renal impairment enrolled in ARISTOTLE compared to 26% in this study, and the number of comorbidities and comedications are higher in real-world patients with NVAF treated with DOACs. Routine monitoring of DOACs or apixaban concentrations or anti-Xa activity is not currently recommended, and a number of experts advocate for strict adherence to the doses used in ARISTOTLE.We found significant associations of apixaban concentrations with the number of daily medications and with CrCL in this study focused exclusively on older adults. To date, polypharmacy has not been a consideration in dosing guidelines. Most DOAC doses are adjusted for estimated renal clearance, but criteria for apixaban dosage reduction are based on age, body weight, and serum creatinine (or comedications). Measurement of creatinine alone to estimate renal clearance is recognized as suboptimal in older adults. Our data suggest CrCL may have a role in estimating apixaban dosing as recommended by at least 1 European society.

Study limitations

Our study has limitations as a prospective observational study with dosing prescribed by health care providers. The sample was moderately sized yet may not reflect the entire target patient population. However, the age and sex distribution and proportion of patients receiving each dosage match real-world data from large databases,,,, unlike the pivotal ARISTOTLE trial.We did not assess outcomes. We sampled at the time of estimated peak concentrations, and our results may be underestimates. Fewer patients were prescribed apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, limiting our analyses for this regimen. Finally, the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic that limited a broader or more diverse population sample.

### Influence of direct oral anticoagulants on anti-factor Xa measurements utilized for monitoring heparin [^0291a103]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Unanticipated drug-laboratory interactions may occur between direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and anti-factor Xa (AXA) levels used to monitor parenteral heparin infusions. Characterization of the extent and duration of DOAC effect on AXA levels may reduce complications with transition to heparin infusions.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of oral factor Xa inhibitors on AXA levels with and without concurrent heparin.

Methods

This retrospective descriptive study was approved by institutional review board waiver and included patients with AXA levels drawn on a heparin calibrated assay who had received a factor Xa inhibitor. Participants were divided on the basis of whether AXA levels were drawn with concurrent parenteral heparin. If transitioned to heparin, number of AXA draws required until AXA level was within therapeutic range was recorded.

Results

A total of 50 patients (60% rivaroxaban, 40% apixaban) met inclusion criteria. When AXA levels were drawn within 12 hours of apixaban without concurrent heparin (n = 7), 71% were greater than 1 IU/mL, and 29% were below suggested trough levels (0.7-1.1 IU/mL). For AXA levels drawn within 24 hours of rivaroxaban without concurrent heparin (n = 11), 55% were greater than 1 IU/mL, 9% were within suggested trough (0.6-1 IU/mL), and 36% were below 0.6 IU/mL. In patients (n = 28) who were initiated on heparin infusion prior to AXA monitoring, administration of the DOAC within the prior 72 hours resulted in supratherapeutic initial AXA levels 69% of the time.

Conclusion

DOACs may cause elevations in heparin-calibrated AXA assays; this creates problematic challenges in using the AXA level to optimize heparin management.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^4b9d03e9]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

None of the dialysis-associated parameter were independently associated with drug levels. This was somewhat unexpected. Apixaban has a molecule size of 459.5 Dalton, a protein binding of 87 % and a distributional volume of 21 L. Thus, a fractional removal by hemodialysis is expected. Small prospective pharmacokinetic studies show a reduction in AUC by hemodialysis of -14 % (pre/post) and -26 % (AUC-48h) for a 5 mg dose and a AUC-48h reduction of -48 % for a 2.5 mg dose. Potentially, our inter-individual differences in dialysis dose were too small. However, in light of low sample numbers and retrospective analyses, interpretation of multivariable regression results is limited. Intake of a second dose of 2.5 mg of apixaban per day was consistently associated with higher drug level. This highlights at least a rough relationship between amount of intake and steady state drug level, again supporting drug monitoring as an additional mean for individual dose finding.

Our analysis does not suggest drug accumulation over time independent of dosing regimen and length of follow-up. In contrast, pharmacokinetic analyses revealed significant accumulation in hemodialysis patients during the first 8 days. Our data did not allow valid analyses of drug levels within the first few days after starting the drug. However, with regard to our follow-up period (IQR 5.5 - 21 months), our data clearly support the picture of a non-accumulating steady state.

Our study has several strengths. It is the second largest analysis of apixaban drug levels in hemodialysis to date with the longest follow-up. It is the only investigation incorporating apixaban drug levels from 2.5 mg once daily dosing and comprehensive dialysis-related covariates. In addition, we provide a comparative review to drug levels from non-CKD populations facilitating interpretation of drug levels and supporting sensible decision making regarding appropriate dosing.

The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature, limiting precise specification of timing of drug intake and a reliable integration of residual kidney function. Drug levels of our study however, do picture long-term results from a tertiary care real-life setting. The analysis of bleedings must be considered exploratory as drug level measurements were infrequent and number of patients and bleeding events were small. The selection of covariates is overly inclusive. However, selected dialysis-associated factors represent important confounders, which have not been comprehensively investigated in studies of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis.

### Anti-Xa levels in morbidly obese patients using apixaban or rivaroxaban, before and after bariatric surgery [^1518ec34]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite limited evidence about the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in patients post bariatric surgery, both vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are commonly prescribed.

Aim

To evaluate plasma anti-Xa levels of DOACs in morbidly obese (MO) patients before and after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study of anti-Xa activity of apixaban or rivaroxaban in MO patients (N=41).

Results

Preoperative analysis of plasma anti-Xa levels were within the normal range in patients using apixaban (n=29; body mass index [BMI] 44.5±5.1 kg/m 2 ) as well as those using rivaroxaban (n=12; BMI 42.6±5.9 kg/m 2 ). Postoperative anti-Xa levels of apixaban were all within the therapeutic range, whereas anti-Xa levels of rivaroxaban were subtherapeutic in nine out of 14 (64%) patients. Perioperative longitudinal follow-up in patients using apixaban (n=18) showed no significant change in anti-Xa levels after RYGB.

Conclusion

Plasma anti-Xa levels of apixaban in MO patients remained within the therapeutic range up to a body weight of 144 kg. In patients using rivaroxaban, no statistically significant relation between anti-Xa levels and bodyweight was found. After RYGB, plasma anti-Xa levels of apixaban were unaffected, whereas plasma anti-Xa levels of rivaroxaban tended to become subtherapeutic.

### International consensus statement on the peri-operative management of direct oral anticoagulants in cardiac surgery [^3f99a541]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite current recommendations on the management of severe peri-operative bleeding, there is no pragmatic guidance for the peri-operative monitoring and management of cardiac surgical patients taking direct oral anticoagulants. Members of the Transfusion and Haemostasis Subcommittee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology, of their own volition, performed an independent systematic review of peer-reviewed original research, review articles and case reports and developed the following consensus statement. This has been endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology. In our opinion, most patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy presenting for elective cardiac surgery can be safely managed in the peri-operative period if the following conditions are fulfilled: direct oral anticoagulants have been discontinued two days before cardiac surgery, corresponding to five elimination half-live periods; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or a high risk of bleeding, a pre-operative plasma level of direct oral anticoagulants has been determined and found to be below 30 ng.ml -1 (currently only valid for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban). In cases where plasma level monitoring is not possible (e.g. assay was not available), discontinuation for 10 elimination half-live periods (four days) is required. For FXa inhibitors, a standard heparin-calibrated anti-Xa level of < 0.1 IU.ml -1 should be measured, indicating sufficient reduction in the anticoagulant effect. Finally, short-term bridging with heparin is not required in the pre-operative period.

Severe CKD and dialysis—anticoagulation considerations note that the role of anticoagulation in patients with AF and severe CKD, including those on dialysis, is controversial. The pivotal clinical trials of apixaban excluded patients with CrCl <25 mL/min, but FDA-approved labeling was extended to include those with end-stage renal failure, including those on hemodialysis. A pharmacokinetic study found apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily produced drug levels approximating those seen with 5 mg twice daily in normal renal function, suggesting 2.5 mg is a more appropriate dose in such patients. Observational data are mixed: a Medicare cohort found no difference in thromboembolism but less major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin, while another analysis found increased risk of thromboembolism and fatal or intracranial bleeding with apixaban 5 mg twice daily versus no anticoagulation but not with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. Two small trials of apixaban versus warfarin in hemodialysis did not show differences in safety or efficacy outcomes but reported significantly more bleeding than stroke events.

Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) before procedures—timing of discontinuation is stratified by bleeding risk and creatinine clearance (CrCl). For CrCl ≥80 mL/min, dabigatran: ≥24 h (low risk) and ≥48 h (high risk); apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban: ≥24 h (low risk) and ≥48 h (high risk). For CrCl 50–80 mL/min, dabigatran: ≥36 h (low) and ≥72 h (high), while apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban: ≥24 h (low) and ≥48 h (high). For CrCl 30–50 ml/min*, dabigatran: ≥48 h (low) and ≥96 h (high); apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban: ≥24 h (low) and ≥48 h (high). For CrCl 15–30 ml/min*, dabigatran: No official indication, while apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban: ≥36 h (low) and ≥48 h (high). For CrCl <15 mL/min, dabigatran: No official indication and apixaban–edoxaban–rivaroxaban: No official indication for use. For procedures with no important bleeding risk and/or where adequate local hemostasis is possible, perform at trough level (i.e., ≥12 or 24 h after last intake). There is no need for bridging with LMWH/UFH. The bold values deviate from the common stopping rule of ≥24-hour low risk; ≥48-hour high risk. Low risk is defined as a low frequency of bleeding and/or minor impact of a bleed. High risk is defined as a high frequency of bleeding and/or important clinical impact.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

2014 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines—antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: In patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy should be individualized based on shared decision-making after discussion of the absolute and RRs of stroke and bleeding, and the patient’s values and preferences (Class I, Level of Evidence: C), and selection of antithrombotic therapy should be based on the risk of thromboembolism irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). In patients with nonvalvular AF, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended and the target international normalized ratio (INR) intensity (2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5) should be based on the type and location of the prosthesis (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with nonvalvular AF with prior stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, oral anticoagulants are recommended, with options including warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. Among patients treated with warfarin, the INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of antithrombotic therapy and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR in range) is stable (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of a direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence: C).

### Apixaban concentrations in routine clinical care of older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^468f8d9e]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are first-line agents for prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), but data are limited for the oldest patients, and with reduced dosing.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine steady-state apixaban peak and trough concentrations during routine care of older adults with NVAF, compare concentrations to clinical trial concentrations, and explore factors associated with concentrations.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of medically stable older adults with NVAF (age ≥75 years or ≥70 years if Black) receiving apixaban. Peak (2.0-4.4 hours post-dose) and trough (before next dose) concentrations were determined by anti-Xa activity calibrated chromogenic assay. Patient characteristics associated with concentrations were determined by multivariate modeling.

Results

The median age of patients (n = 115) was 80 (interquartile range: 77-84) years. The cohort comprised 46 women and 69 men; of which 98 are White, 11 are Black, and 6 are Asian. With 5 mg twice daily per labelling (n = 88), peak concentrations were higher in women: 248 ± 105 vs 174 ± 67 ng/mL in men (P < 0.001) and exceeded expected 95% range in 6 of 30 vs 0 of 55 men (P = 0.002). With 2.5 mg twice daily per label (n = 11), concentrations were <5 mg twice daily (peak: 136 ± 87 vs 201 ± 90 ng/mL, P = 0.026; trough: 65 ± 28 vs 109 ± 56 ng/mL, P < 0.001), but not different than 2.5 mg twice daily without reduction criteria (n = 13; peak: 132 ± 88 ng/mL; trough: 65 ± 31 ng/mL). Covariates associated with concentrations included sex, number of daily medications, and creatinine clearance.

Conclusions

Older women had higher than expected peak apixaban concentrations, and 2.5 mg twice daily produced lower concentrations than standard dosing. Factors not currently included in dosing recommendations affected concentrations. The impact of apixaban concentrations on outcomes needs evaluation.

### How to deal with interference on heparin anti-Xa activity caused by oral factor FXa inhibitors: communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on control of anticoagulation [^aabcc3e2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitoring unfractionated heparin (UFH) to ensure effective anticoagulation may be performed using anti-factor Xa activity (anti-Xa) instead of the activated partial thromboplastin time. However, in patients who have been treated with oral factor (F)Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) while switching to UFH therapy, there is a risk that these oral anti-FXa drugs could interfere with UFH-calibrated anti-Xa monitoring. This may lead to inappropriate anticoagulation management. This report of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation summarizes the evidence on the risk of interference from previous treatment with oral FXa inhibitors and UFH anti-Xa after heparin initiation. This communication provides pragmatic recommendations for UFH initiation and management with anti-Xa monitoring after switching from oral FXa inhibitors.

### DOACs: role of anti-Xa and drug level monitoring [^8d6c1262]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring of anticoagulant effect, but measuring DOAC activity may be desirable in specific circumstances to detect whether clinically significant DOAC levels are present (eg, prior to urgent surgery) or to assess whether drug levels are excessively high or excessively low in at-risk patients (eg, after malabsorptive gastrointestinal surgery). Routine coagulation tests, including the international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), cannot accurately quantify drug levels but may provide a qualitative assessment of DOAC activity when considering the estimated time to drug clearance based on timing of last drug ingestion and renal and hepatic function. Drug-specific chromogenic and clot-based assays can quantify drug levels but they are not universally available and do not have established therapeutic ranges. In this review, we discuss our approach to measuring DOAC drug levels, including patient selection, interpretation of coagulation testing, and how measurement may inform clinical decision-making in specific scenarios.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: a critical analysis [^f257f40e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background During treatment with direct oral anticoagulants ( DOAC ), coagulation assessment is required before thrombolysis, surgery, and if anticoagulation reversal is evaluated. Limited data support the accuracy of DOAC -specific coagulation assays around the current safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/ mL . Methods and Results In 481 samples obtained from 96 patients enrolled at a single center, DOAC concentrations were measured using Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay, Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, chromogenic anti-Xa assay ( AXA ) for factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as reference. All dabigatran-specific assays had high sensitivity to concentrations >30 ng/ mL , but specificity was lower for Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay (78.2%) than for Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay (98.9%) and ecarin clotting time (94.6%). AXA provided high sensitivity and specificity for rivaroxaban, but low sensitivity for apixaban (73.8%; concentrations up to 82 ng/ mL were misclassified as <30 ng/ mL ). If no DOAC -specific calibration for AXA is available, results 2-fold above the upper limit of normal indicate relevant rivaroxaban concentrations. For apixaban, all elevated results should raise suspicion of relevant anticoagulation. Conclusions DOAC -specific tests differ considerably in diagnostic performance for concentrations close to the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold. Compared with Biophen direct thrombin inhibitor assay and ecarin clotting time, limited specificity of Hemoclot direct thrombin inhibitor assay poses a high risk of unnecessary anticoagulation reversal or treatment delays in patients on dabigatran. While AXA accurately detected rivaroxaban, the impact of low apixaban levels on the assay was weak. Hence, AXA results need to be interpreted with extreme caution when used to assess hemostatic function in patients on apixaban. Clinical Trial Registration URL : https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 197: inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy [^12a65fe6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 197—inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy—anticoagulant selection and dosing indicate that neither low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) nor unfractionated heparin (UFH) cross the placenta and both can be used in pregnancy, while vitamin K antagonists should be avoided in pregnancy with the possible exception of prevention of thromboembolism in women with a mechanical heart valve, and LMWH is preferred over UFH. Dosage is based on the severity of thrombophilia and other venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk factors, with prophylactic, intermediate, and adjusted-dose (therapeutic) regimens described, and antithrombin concentrates can be used in antithrombin-deficient patients refractory to standard therapy or in multidisciplinary plans for VTE prophylaxis or treatment. Because the increased risk of VTE in pregnancy is present from the first trimester, initiation of anticoagulant regimens should occur upon confirmation of a viable pregnancy, or as early in pregnancy as possible. For adjusted-dose LMWH, maternal weight is used to calculate the dose with a goal anti-Xa level of 0.6–1.0 units/mL 4 hours after injection; routine assessment of anti-Xa levels in prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended, and serial assessment in adjusted-dose therapy is largely unnecessary but can be considered on a case-by-case basis. If using UFH to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation, mid-interval activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels should be checked to ensure a therapeutic dose. There is insufficient evidence to recommend changing the prophylactic LMWH dose based on weight, and decisions regarding prophylactic dosage can be made on a case-by-case basis. Almost all women on antepartum anticoagulation will continue therapy postpartum, some requiring anticoagulation beyond 6 weeks postpartum will be transitioned to warfarin after delivery, and UFH, LMWH, and warfarin are compatible with breastfeeding. Oral direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and anti-Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation because there are insufficient data to evaluate safety for the woman, fetus, and breastfeeding neonate.

### International external quality assessment for measurements of direct oral anticoagulants: results and recommendations [^f5994f0e]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

There is limited information regarding the performance of tests for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). To generate more knowledge, the accuracy of DOAC tests were evaluated using external quality assessment data from multiple years. This data demonstrated a good correlation for the tests with a small overall interlaboratory variability (10% for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban and 12% for edoxaban). The greatest differences between the various reagents were observed for rivaroxaban, especially for concentrations below 100 ng/ml. In conclusion, the results show overall reliable DOAC levels with some differences between reagent groups. Important finding: clinical decision criteria could be affected by the choice of reagent.

### Oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism [^064e6c85]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. For decades, antithrombotic therapy for prevention and treatment of VTE was limited to parenteral agents related to heparin and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Both classes of anticoagulants are effective, but have limitations, including considerable variability in dose-response, narrow therapeutic margins between the risks of thrombosis and bleeding, and the need to monitor anticoagulation intensity. Over the past decade, the introduction of new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) or Xa has changed practice in a variety of clinical situations, including VTE prophylaxis and treatment. In this Review, we outline the use of the novel oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of VTE, and discuss practical considerations for choosing the appropriate drug for each patient. Although the introduction of novel anticoagulant drugs is promising, selecting the optimum strategy for an individual patient requires an understanding of the specific circumstances associated with thrombus formation and the pharmacological properties of each agent.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^33573dff]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The anti-Xa assay has limitations. Anti-Xa prophylactic and therapeutic index reference ranges are based on expert opinion rather than large prospective trial evidence and are different for different LWMHs, dosing schedules (once vs twice daily dosing) and indications (thromboprophylaxis vs treatment). Measured anti-Xa activity is affected by the timing of blood collection and interassay variation. Thus, different assays can lead to different clinical decisions regarding optimal dosing in patients on the same LMWH. Greater assay standardisation or assay-specific anti-Xa reference ranges are required.

Importantly, although anti-Xa levels are a marker of LMWH blood concentration, the correlation with clinical endpoints (bleeding, VTE) is inconsistent. For instance, elevated anti-Xa levels have been inconsistently correlated with bleeding, while a negative correlation was found between anti-Xa levels and VTE, but other studies found no association. Similarly, anti-Xa activity while on enoxaparin has been associated with increased risk of death or recurrent myocardial infarction, but not bleeding, in one study (n = 803) of acute coronary syndrome patients, whilst in a RCT sub-analysis of patients undergoing elective PCI (n = 2298), anti-Xa activity was associated with bleeding, but not death, myocardial infarction or revascularisation. Besides variable definitions of supra- and subtherapeutic anti-Xa activity and the small sample sizes of many studies, the overall lack of reliable associations between anti-Xa activity and clinical events may plausibly be because the global anticoagulant effect of LMWHs involves additional factors besides anti-Xa activity, including anti-IIa activity, platelet levels, and interindividual variations in heparin-binding proteins.

Plasma apixaban levels

Patients in the apixaban group contributed 105 trough and 104 peak levels. Most of the trough levels were measured at 10–14 hours from the last apixaban dose (70 patients; 66.7%), and all of the peak levels were measured at 1−4 hours after apixaban ingestion. More specifically, 69.2% of peak levels were measured at 2 hours ± 5 minutes. At the time of peak‐level measurement, 34 patients (32.7%) were in fasted status (5 mg twice daily, 12 patients; 2.5 mg twice daily, 22 patients). Three patients (2.9%) had undetectable trough levels. The 5th and 95th percentiles for trough and peak levels for apixaban 5 mg twice daily were 66.5–203.8 and 110.6‐534.5 ng/mL, compared with 41–230 and 91–321 ng/mL, respectively. The 5th and 95th percentiles for trough and peak levels for apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily were 18.3–162.6 and 77.9–296.7 ng/mL, compared with 34–162 and 69–221 ng/mL, respectively, reported in clinical studies. 4, 12 Figure 2 b displays the distribution of apixaban levels according to the appropriateness of ordered dose, and Figure 2 d shows the distribution of apixaban levels according to CrCL. The drug levels did not differ significantly among patients with CrCL ≥ or < 50 mL/minutes, both for the trough and peak levels. Eighty‐nine apixaban levels (84.8%) fell within the expected range for trough and 80 for peak levels (76.9%). Most out‐of‐range trough apixaban levels were lower than the expected range (11 trough levels; 10.5%). By contrast, most out‐of‐range peak apixaban levels were higher than the expected range (22 peak levels; 21.2%). The correlation between trough and peak levels was significant (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.64; P < 0.001). The apixaban levels were similar regardless of the fasted status at the time of measurement, either for the trough or peak levels (fasted vs. nonfasted, trough level, 106.6 ± 51.9 and 101.1 ± 62.4 ng/mL, P = 0.655; peak level, 221.7 ± 113.3 and 221.1 ± 118.7 ng/mL, P = 0.978).

### Plasma levels measurement of the 4 direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation at the time of acute thromboembolic and bleeding events [^f667b179]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are standard therapy to prevent thromboembolic events in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and are generally used without routine monitoring of plasma anti-Xa or anti-IIa levels.

Objectives

To assess whether plasma levels of anti-Xa or anti-IIa at the time of presentation are associated with acute thromboembolic or bleeding events in DOAC-treated NVAF patients.

Methods

This prospective case-control study included consecutive long-term DOAC-treated NVAF patients presenting to a European emergency department with acute thromboembolic or bleeding events (cases), or for other medical reasons (controls). DOAC plasma levels were measured using drug-specific chromogenic anti-Xa assays (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) or diluted thrombin time (dabigatran), categorized into quartiles, and analyzed according to event type.

Results

Among 1,794 patients (mean age 82 years, 49% female), 8% had thromboembolic events, 15% bleeding events, and 77% other presentations. DOAC treatment included apixaban (45%), dabigatran (17%), rivaroxaban (17%), and edoxaban (21%). Thromboembolic events were more common in patients with DOAC plasma levels in the first quartile (Q1: 50% vs. 26%; p<0.001), while bleeding events were more common in the fourth quartile (Q4: 46% vs. 23%; p<0.001). Q1 levels were associated with increased odds of thromboembolic events (OR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.36-3.08), and Q4 levels with bleeding events (OR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.49-2.82).

Conclusion

DOAC plasma levels show substantial interindividual variability and are associated with acute thromboembolic and bleeding events. These observations may help generate hypotheses for future studies aimed at better defining the role of DOAC plasma monitoring in clinical practice.

Factors that caused drug levels to fall out of expected ranges

Compared with the apixaban group, the rivaroxaban group was significantly less likely to have drug levels within the expected range, either for the trough (P = 0.002) or the peak levels (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, SCr, appropriately ordered or inappropriately ordered NOAC dose, and good or suboptimal self‐reported adherence, patients in the rivaroxaban group remained significantly less likely to have trough and peak levels within the expected drug levels (odds ratio (OR) for trough 0.279, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13–0.62, P = 0.002; for peak, OR = 0.172, 95% CI = 0.08–0.35, P < 0.001).

We further conducted multivariate regression to analyze factors driving the lower or higher‐than‐range drug levels. For rivaroxaban, lower‐than‐range trough levels were significantly associated with inappropriately ordered dosage (OR = 4.24; 95% CI = 1.02–17.68; P = 0.047). For apixaban, higher‐than‐range peak levels were associated with female sex (OR = 3.46; 95% CI = 1.19–10.07; P = 0.023). Details of the multivariate regression analysis are displayed in Tables 2 and 3.

### Apixaban concentrations with lower than recommended dosing in older adults with atrial fibrillation [^9dbbf130]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Lower than recommended doses of direct-acting oral anticoagulants are often prescribed to older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Our goal was to determine the consequences of lower than recommended dosing on plasma apixaban concentrations during the clinical care of older adults with NVAF.

Design

Convenience sample of patients receiving anticoagulation during 2017.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

Stable adults older than 65years with NVAF receiving apixaban on a chronic basis.

Measurements

Patient age, weight, creatinine, co-medications, and apixaban concentrations.

Results

A total of 110 older adults with NVAF (mean age=80.4 y; range=66-100 y with 45% women) were studied. Overall, 48 patients received recommended dosing of 5 mg twice/day, and 42 received lower than recommended dosing. One patient in each category had concentrations below the expected 5% to 95% range at time of peak concentrations. Differences in proportion of apixaban concentrations within or outside expected ranges were not significant between patients receiving lower than recommended doses and those dosed as recommended at 5 mg twice/day (P=.35). However, in patients dosed as recommended with 5 mg twice/day, four had concentrations above the 5% to 95% range for peak levels expected at 3 to 4 hours after dosing; in two, this occurred around the midpoint of the dosing interval. Twenty patients received 2.5 mg twice/day as recommended. One-third had apixaban concentrations higher than expected peak concentrations compared with the clinical trials, and more than two-thirds had levels above the reported median for peak concentrations.

Conclusions

Apixaban concentrations in older adults with NVAF seen clinically were higher than expected based on clinical trial data. The findings raise questions about the optimal dosing of apixaban in older adults with NVAF encountered outside of clinical trials and suggest a role for the monitoring of apixaban concentrations during care of patients that differ from those in randomized trials or when considering dosing outside of published guidelines.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^d3f3fbdb]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management—management of oral anticoagulation notes that in patients with recent ingestion of a nonvitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) or direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) presenting for cardiac operations, it is reasonable to administer idarucizumab for dabigatran or administer andexanet-α for either apixaban or rivaroxaban if appropriate (Class IIA, Level C-LD). If the antidote for the specific NOAC is not available, prothrombin concentrate is recommended, recognizing that the effective response may be variable (Class IIA, Level C-LD).
