## Question

What did the SHORT trial show regarding noninferiority of short-course versus extended carbapenem therapy for high-risk chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever of unknown origin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the SHORT trial showed regarding noninferiority of short-course versus extended carbapenem therapy for high-risk chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever of unknown origin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it was appropriate to test noninferiority. Then, I should verify the primary endpoint and the noninferiority margin. Next, I will examine the intention-to-treat and per-protocol results and whether they meet the margin. After that, I need to check safety signals and secondary outcomes that could temper interpretation. Finally, I should integrate these findings with guideline context and outline practical, risk-stratified recommendations with caveats for patients who remain febrile or deteriorate.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population so I don't jump to conclusions. SHORT was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial in adults with high-risk febrile neutropenia of unknown origin, defined as expected neutropenia less than 0.5 × 10⁹/L for at least 7 days, and it excluded patients with documented infections or septic shock at baseline, which sets a clean comparator for fever of unknown origin in a high-risk hematology population [^6aec6b9d].

> I need to verify the interventions and timing. All patients received empiric carbapenem therapy and were randomized between 48 and 72 hours to either stop after a total of 72 hours if clinically stable versus continue for at least 9 days until afebrile for 5 days or neutrophil recovery, which operationalizes a short-course strategy against a prolonged, recovery-based regimen [^6aec6b9d].

> Next, I should review the primary endpoint and noninferiority margin. The composite primary outcome was treatment failure defined as recurrent fever or a carbapenem-sensitive infection between days 4 and 9, or septic shock, respiratory failure, or death from day 4 until neutrophil recovery, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 10% on the absolute risk difference, which is a conventional choice for clinically acceptable trade-offs in infection outcomes [^6aec6b9d].

> Now, let me examine the intention-to-treat results. In the ITT analysis, treatment failure occurred in 19% with short-course therapy versus 15% with extended therapy, yielding an adjusted risk difference of 4.0% with a 90% confidence interval of −1.7% to 9.7%, which sits within the 10% noninferiority margin, supporting noninferiority in the ITT population [^6aec6b9d].

> Hold on, I should verify the per-protocol analysis because noninferiority often hinges on adherence. In the per-protocol analysis, failure rates were 23% with short-course versus 16% with extended therapy, with an adjusted risk difference of 7.3% and a 90% CI of 0.3% to 14.9%, which crosses the 10% margin and therefore does not meet noninferiority in the per-protocol population, highlighting fragility when adherence and exclusions are considered [^6aec6b9d].

> I will now examine safety and secondary outcomes to ensure we aren't missing harm signals. Serious adverse events were more frequent with short-course therapy, largely driven by more readmissions, and 30-day mortality was numerically higher with short-course therapy, though the trial was not powered for mortality and these differences did not reach statistical significance, so I should be cautious not to overinterpret them while still maintaining vigilance in clinical practice [^6aec6b9d].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and guideline context so I don't overgeneralize. The ITT noninferiority supports that early discontinuation can be safe in carefully selected, clinically stable, afebrile patients with fever of unknown origin, aligning with stewardship principles and recent RCTs like HOW LONG that allowed discontinuation after 72 hours of apyrexia and clinical recovery, yet the per-protocol failure and safety signals remind us to individualize decisions, especially in patients who remain febrile or have mucositis, bacteremia, or other high-risk features [^6aec6b9d] [^4880df2c] [^c3d3e2b1].

> But wait, what if the patient is still febrile at 72 hours or deteriorating? The authors explicitly caution that patients with persistent fever or clinical instability may have higher failure rates with short-course therapy and recommend vigilance for non-susceptible pathogens and early resumption or escalation of therapy in those scenarios, which reinforces the need for close reassessment at 48–72 hours rather than a blanket rule to stop at 72 hours regardless of clinical status [^6aec6b9d].

> I should double-check how this fits with broader evidence. A Cochrane review of earlier, heterogeneous RCTs found no clear mortality difference with protocolized early discontinuation but highlighted very low certainty and more documented infections with short courses, whereas contemporary RCTs and stewardship-focused studies increasingly support early discontinuation in stable, afebrile patients, underscoring that SHORT adds to, but does not definitively close, the evidence base for high-risk fever of unknown origin [^a8b7e1d2] [^4880df2c] [^6aec6b9d].

> In practical terms, I need to ensure we apply this thoughtfully. For high-risk patients with fever of unknown origin who are afebrile and hemodynamically stable by 72 hours with no identified source or positive cultures, a 72-hour carbapenem course can be reasonable with close follow-up, whereas those who remain febrile, have mucositis, suspected or documented resistant organisms, or clinical deterioration should continue broad-spectrum therapy and be reassessed for alternative diagnoses and antifungal therapy per guideline-driven pathways, consistent with IDSA and ECIL guidance on duration and modification strategies [^1e5d211d] [^c3d3e2b1] [^f544d4a3].

> Bottom line, the SHORT trial showed that in high-risk febrile neutropenia of unknown origin, a 72-hour carbapenem course was noninferior to extended therapy in the ITT analysis but failed to meet noninferiority in the per-protocol analysis, with numerically more serious adverse events and readmissions in the short-course arm, so early discontinuation is feasible in selected, stable, afebrile patients but requires vigilant reassessment and readiness to resume therapy if fever persists or the patient worsens [^6aec6b9d].

---

The SHORT trial showed that **short-course carbapenem therapy (72 hours)** is non-inferior to extended therapy (≥ 9 days) for high-risk chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever of unknown origin, with a **treatment failure rate of 19% vs 15%** (adjusted risk difference 4.0%, 90% CI −1.7% to 9.7%) [^6aec6b9d]. Non-inferiority was met in the intention-to-treat analysis but not in the per-protocol analysis, and **serious adverse events were more frequent with short-course therapy** (16% vs 10%), mainly due to more readmissions. The authors conclude that short-course therapy is reasonable in afebrile, clinically stable patients after 72 hours, but clinicians should remain vigilant for persistent fever or deterioration and be ready to resume therapy if needed [^6aec6b9d].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial.
- **Population**: Adults with hematologic malignancies or HSCT recipients with high-risk neutropenia and fever of unknown origin.
- **Interventions**: Short-course carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem) for 72 hours vs extended therapy (≥ 9 days until afebrile for 5 days or neutrophil recovery).
- **Primary endpoint**: Composite treatment failure (recurrent fever or carbapenem-sensitive infection days 4–9, or septic shock, respiratory failure, or death from day 4 until neutrophil recovery).
- **Non-inferiority margin**: 10% absolute risk difference.

---

## Primary outcomes

In the **intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis**, treatment failure occurred in 19% (28/144) with short-course vs 15% (21/137) with extended therapy (adjusted risk difference 4.0%, 90% CI −1.7% to 9.7%), meeting non-inferiority. In the **per-protocol (PP) analysis**, failure occurred in 23% (24/104) vs 16% (19/121) (adjusted risk difference 7.3%, 90% CI 0.3% to 14.9%), not meeting non-inferiority.

---

## Secondary outcomes and safety

Serious adverse events were more frequent with short-course therapy (16% vs 10%), largely due to more readmissions. Mortality was low and similar between groups (3% vs 1%). Antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced in the short-course arm (median 3 vs 10 days).

---

## Clinical implications

Short-course therapy is **non-inferior in the ITT analysis** and can reduce antibiotic exposure, but the PP analysis and higher serious adverse event rates temper enthusiasm. Clinicians should use short-course therapy selectively in patients who are afebrile and clinically stable after 72 hours, with close monitoring for recurrence or deterioration [^6aec6b9d].

---

## Limitations

- **Open-label design**: Potential bias in clinical assessment.
- **Per-protocol analysis**: Did not meet non-inferiority, suggesting fragility of results.
- **Generalizability**: Limited to high-risk hematology patients; may not apply to other populations.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The SHORT trial supports **72-hour carbapenem therapy** as non-inferior in ITT for high-risk neutropenic fever of unknown origin, with substantial antibiotic-sparing benefits. Clinicians should apply this strategy cautiously, ensuring clinical stability and readiness to resume therapy if the patient deteriorates or fever persists [^6aec6b9d].

Background

Early antibiotic discontinuation has been advocated in haematology patients with fever of unknown origin during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, but its safety is unknown. We aimed to assess if short treatment with carbapenems is non-inferior to extended treatment.

Methods

This non-inferiority, open-label, multicentre, randomised trial was done in six hospitals in the Netherlands. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) who were treated with intensive chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) for a haematological malignancy, and had fever of unknown origin during high-risk neutropenia (< 0.5×10⁹/L expected for ≥ 7 days) were eligible. After onset of fever, patients received either 500 mg intravenous imipenem-cilastatin four times a day or 1000 mg intravenous meropenem three times a day. Between 48 h and 72 h of treatment, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated sequence to receive a short-term (72 h [60–84]; short treatment group) or extended (≥ 9 days until being afebrile for 5 days or neutrophil recovery; extended treatment group) carbapenem regimen. The composite primary endpoint was treatment failure, defined as recurrent fever or a carbapenem-sensitive infection between day 4 and day 9 and septic shock or respiratory failure or death from day 4 until neutrophil recovery. The study was designed to assess the non-inferiority of the short treatment compared with the extended treatment regimen, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. The primary outcome was adjudicated by an independent outcome committee, who were masked to treatment allocation, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The trial is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02149329.

Findings

Between Dec 1, 2014, and July 1, 2019, 281 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 144 (51%) patients were assigned to the short treatment group and 137 (49%) to the extended treatment group. Median age was 59 years (IQR 52–65); 109 (39%) patients were women and 172 (61%) were men; 205 (73%) patients received HSCT. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 28 (19%) of 144 patients in the short treatment group versus 21 (15%) of 137 patients in the extended treatment group had treatment failure (adjusted risk difference [ARD] 4.0% [90% CI -1.7% to 9.7%]; p = 0.25). In the per-protocol analysis (n = 225), 24 (23%) of 104 patients in the short treatment group and 19 (16%) of 121 patients in the extended treatment group had treatment failure (ARD 7.3% [0.3% to 14.9%]; p = 0.11). The most common grade 3–5 infection-related adverse events were mucositis (23 [20%] of 114 adverse events in the short treatment group vs 28 [29%] of 98 adverse events in the extended treatment group), fever of unknown origin (20 [18%] vs 16 [16%] events), and bacteraemia (15 [13%] vs 13 [13%] events). The number of serious adverse events were higher in the short treatment group (23 [16%] of 144 patients) than in the extended treatment group (14 [10%] of 137 patients), due to an increased rate of readmission (17 [12%] patients in the short treatment group vs ten [7%] in the extended treatment group). Death before 30 days after neutrophil recovery occurred in five (3%) participants in the short treatment group: two due to progressive leukaemia, two due to candidaemia, and one due to Enterococcus faecium bacteraemia and drug-induced pneumonitis. One (1%) patient died in the extended treatment group due to candidaemia. None of the deaths were related to carbapenem-sensitive infections.

Interpretation

Early discontinuation of carbapenem treatment in patients with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin does not result in increased treatment failure. Our study supports short treatment if patients are afebrile after 3 days of carbapenem treatment. However, because secondary analyses suggested that serious adverse events and all-cause mortality occurred more often in patients who are persistantly febrile the short treatment group, we recommend vigilance for non-susceptible pathogens and early resumption of empirical therapy in patients who are deteriorating.

### Short versus extended treatment with a carbapenem in patients with high-risk fever of unknown origin during neutropenia: a non-inferiority, open-label, multicentre, randomised trial [^64b8e3d3]. The Lancet: Haematology (2022). High credibility.

The study SHORT was published by Nick A de Jonge and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet Haematol. This study is related to the following diseases: Febrile neutropenia and Fever of unknown origin. In the SHORT study, the trial question was: is short antibiotic treatment noninferior to extended antibiotic treatment with carbapenems in patients with high-risk fever of unknown origin during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia? In the SHORT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SHORT study, the population was: 281 patients (109 female, 172 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had fever of unknown origin during high-risk neutropenia and were treated for hematological malignancy. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to use of imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem; corticosteroid use ≥ 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent for > 3 consecutive day during the previous 7 days; infection; symptoms of septic shock. In the SHORT study, the interventions were: n = 144 short treatment (500 mg intravenous imipenem-cilastatin QID or 1,000 mg intravenous meropenem TID for 72 hours) n = 137 extended treatment (500 mg intravenous imipenem-cilastatin QID or 1,000 mg intravenous meropenem TID for ≥ 9 days). In the SHORT study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in carbapenem­-sensitive infection or recurrent fever (19% vs. 15%; AD 4%, 90% CI -1.7 to 9.7). In the SHORT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of death within 30 days after the end of neutropenia (3% vs. 1%; AD 2.6%, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1) Borderline significant increase in duration of hospital admission (24 days vs. 24 days;). In the SHORT study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in serious adverse events (16% vs. 10%). In the SHORT study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had fever of unknown origin during high-risk neutropenia and were treated for hematological malignancy, short treatment was noninferior to extended treatment with respect to carbapenem­-sensitive infection or recurrent fever.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^0121772c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We found significant heterogeneity in de-escalation of empiric antibiotics relative to ANC recovery, with varying willingness in doing so in "bland" neutropenic fever, identified clinical infectious source, or microbiologically identified infections. In addition to the previously discussed evidence for de-escalation of empiric antibiotics in this setting, there are some additional limited data about the safety of de-escalation in bloodstream infections, whether to target the culture resultor to treat with a short course of broad antibiotics for low-risk microbes. This heterogeneity is consistent with the uncertainty in de-escalation reported in the prior US survey studyand highlights a need for more robust evidence for this practice, as well as its education and adoption across US institutions, in the context of local antibiograms and drug resistance.

Of note, even among those institutions with "early" de-escalation protocols, only 1 respondent was comfortable doing since before a period of apyrexia. This practice was consistent with the de-escalation protocol of the How Long trial, which used a 72-hour period of apyrexia, but was not consistent with the protocol used by de Jonge et al. The latter randomized one group to de-escalation after 72 hours of carbapenem treatment, regardless of febrile status at the time, compared to a control group of 9+ days of treatment and 5+ days of apyrexia. However, these results did not meet non-inferiority criterion in the per-protocol treatment failure comparison (23% vs 16% in treatment failure, 12% vs 7% in re-admission, and 3% vs 1% in 30-day mortality), with three patients noted to have gram-negative bacillus bacteremia. These findings may explain why our respondent institutions continue to be cautious with de-escalation in patients with continued fevers, despite the trial's top line findings, as the ongoing fevers likely represent a propensity for treatment failure with recurrent fever, whether from untreated infection or non-infectious fevers from malignant tumor.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^5c8357c8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomized trials in adults with neutropenic fever are fewer in number, though corroborate the safety of de-escalation prior to ANC recovery. A multicenter RCT from Spain comparing de-escalation after 72 hours of apyrexia versus continuing until ANC recovery, found no difference in adverse events and an expected improvement in antibiotic-free days. Another recent multicenter RCT in the Netherlands comparing a short (3 days) versus long (9+ days) of carbapenem treatment in neutropenic fever showed no statistical difference in treatment failure, though non-inferiority criterion was not met in the per-protocol treatment comparison. A third single-center study in cellular therapy patients with neutropenic fever also showed an increase in antibiotic-free neutropenia days with de-escalation after 48 hours of treatment, supported by use of a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, with similar rates of breakthrough infections and fevers, 30-day mortality, and cellular therapy-related toxicities. A recent systematic review of these studies, including both RCT and retrospective findings, showed no statistical difference in mortality, treatment failure (mostly defined by recurrence of fever or clinical infection), or bacteremia comparing short versus long-term duration of antibiotic management in neutropenic fever.

The implementation of strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure in neutropenic fever patients has been studied and described over time via survey studies in various geographical settings (selected surveys displayed in Table 1), primarily conducted in Europe and Asia. Notably, a US-based 2019 survey assessed the presence of institutional guidelines in the management of adult patients with neutropenic fever in US cancer centers. Here, we report an updated survey of US-based institutions, with an aim to augment and update these data in the setting of increasing evidence supporting antibiotic stewardship prior to neutrophil recovery. Furthermore, we sought to assess and describe real-world management of patients with neutropenic fever rather than institutional guidelines, which may diverge in clinical practice.

### NCT07051525-clinical trials… [^7ee664e4]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This study is designed to assess the safety, benefits and impacts of early cessation of empiric antibiotics in all fever and neutropenic) that develops post conditioning or chemotherapy until count recovery in high-risk hematology patients who meet clear inclusion criteria. This is in recognition of the fact that both PNF and NF are often not infective in nature, and that cessation is likely an important and safe approach in both scenarios. Secondly, the patient's pre-neutropenic and neutropenic status is highly fluid and can rapidly change from one to the other, making strict definitions of neutropenia arbitrary and not particularly useful for implementation in the clinical setting. Furthermore, as a programmatic-type intervention that is embedded in clinical workflow, approaching high-risk patients with fever in a standardized way would enable consistency and inform clear and concise management protocols.

Stratification will allow for assessment of each patient sub-group to provide more granular data. The study hypothesizes that early cessation of antibiotics in adult patients with high risk fever is safe, acceptable, cost-effective and will minimize an unnecessarily prolonged health care intervention Drug: Early antibiotic cessation alert
- 24/236
- 2024. 406
- ERM113654. AND develop fever between time of initiation of chemotherapy/conditioning administration and ANC recovery to ≥ 500 cells/mm3 post the ANC nadir, AND fever subsequently has settled for ≥ 48 and < 96h hours.

Exclusion Criteria:

- - Prolonged fever prior to defervescence
- Documented positive blood culture for bacteria since onset of fever episode and prior to randomisation
- Documented other infection requiring antibacterial treatment

### Mucositis-associated bloodstream infections in adult haematology patients with fever during neutropenia: risk factors and the impact of mucositis severity [^71ed08f4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted between December 1st, 2014 and August 1st, 2019 in six hospitals in the Netherlands: one academic hospital (Amsterdam University Medical Centres [UMC], location Vrije Universiteit medical centre [VUmc]) and five regional teaching hospitals (OLVG, location West [Amsterdam], HAGA hospital [the Hague], Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis ['s-Hertogenbosch], Spaarne Gasthuis [Hoofddorp] and Isala [Zwolle]). All centres had dedicated haematology units. This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the research ethics committee of the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc on October 29th 2014 and the ethical bodies of each of the participating centres. All participants gave written informed consent.

Participants

Eligible patients were adults (≥ 18 years) treated for a haematological malignancy with intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and had fever, (defined as one tympanic temperature measurement of ≥ 38.5 °C or two measurements of ≥ 38.0 °C measured at least 2 h apart) and high-risk neutropenia (< 500 cells/mL expected to last for ≥ 7 days) at onset of fever. All patients with expected high-risk neutropenia were asked informed consent at admission (i.e. before fever occurred). Only patients that experienced fever during neutropenia were analysed. (appendix p.4). Patients with fever of unknown origin after 72 h of empirical antibiotic treatment participated in a randomised clinical trial investigating short or extended treatment of a carbapenem in haematology patients with febrile neutropenia of unknown origin (NCT02149329). Those patients who were ineligible for participation in the main trial due to infection or septic shock before day 3 after fever onset, were still eligible for this study.

### European guidelines for empirical antibacterial therapy for febrile neutropenic patients in the era of growing resistance: summary of the 2011 4th European conference on infections in leukemia [^c3d3e2b1]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Owing to increasing resistance and the limited arsenal of new antibiotics, especially against Gram-negative pathogens, carefully designed antibiotic regimens are obligatory for febrile neutropenic patients, along with effective infection control. The Expert Group of the 4(th) European Conference on Infections in Leukemia has developed guidelines for initial empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients, based on: i) the local resistance epidemiology; and ii) the patient's risk factors for resistant bacteria and for a complicated clinical course. An 'escalation' approach, avoiding empirical carbapenems and combinations, should be employed in patients without particular risk factors. A 'de-escalation' approach, with initial broad-spectrum antibiotics or combinations, should be used only in those patients with: i) known prior colonization or infection with resistant pathogens; or ii) complicated presentation; or iii) in centers where resistant pathogens are prevalent at the onset of febrile neutropenia. In the latter case, infection control and antibiotic stewardship also need urgent review. Modification of the initial regimen at 72–96 h should be based on the patient's clinical course and the microbiological results. Discontinuation of antibiotics after 72 h or later should be considered in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin who are hemodynamically stable since presentation and afebrile for at least 48 h, irrespective of neutrophil count and expected duration of neutropenia. This strategy aims to minimize the collateral damage associated with antibiotic overuse, and the further selection of resistance.

### Seven vs fourteen days of antibiotics for Gram-Negative bloodstream infection… [^e916f9ad]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the PP analysis, the RR was 0. 93, corresponding to a
95. 1% probability of noninferiority. Conclusions and Relevance In this systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections and adequate source control, 7 days of antibiotic therapy had a high probability of being noninferior to 14 days. These findings support a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for appropriately selected patients like those in the included RCTs. Overall, 1884 patients were assigned to the 7-day and 1845 to the 14-day arm. For the ITT analysis, the RR for mortality with 7 vs 14 days of therapy was 0. 91, corresponding to a
97. 8% probability of noninferiority. In the PP analysis, 1527 patients were assigned to 7 days and 1599 to 14 days. The RR for mortality with 7 vs 14 days of therapy was 0. 93, which corresponded to a
95. 1% probability of noninferiority.

The control event rate was 12. 4%, corresponding to a noninferiority margin of
3. 1% on the absolute scale. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 4 RCTs with a total of 3729 patients, we found that 7 days of therapy had a 95. 1% to
97. 8% probability of noninferiority to 14 days of therapy for Gram-negative bloodstream infection with adequate source control. Limitations of this meta-analysis include a conservative estimate of the upper bound of the 95% CrI, given there are only 4 RCTs. The smaller sample size in the PP group also leads to wider 95% CrIs and slightly less probability of noninferiority. Nonetheless, even in the PP group, the probability of noninferiority exceeded 95% with a 68. 9% probability of superiority with shorter treatment duration.

### Extended vs bolus infusion of broad-spectrum β-lactams for febrile neutropenia: an unblinded, randomized trial [^115cbeb2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile neutropenia may be a sign of severe infection and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies. Extended infusion of β-lactam antibiotics is associated with greater clinical response than is bolus infusion in nonneutropenic critically ill patients, but data are lacking for febrile neutropenic patients.

Methods

We designed a single-center, nonblinded, randomized trial to compare extended infusion (4 hours) and bolus infusion (30 minutes) of piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftazidime in high-risk patients with febrile neutropenia. The primary endpoint was overall response on day 4, defined as the combination of resolution of fever, sterile blood cultures, resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, and no need for a change in the antibiotic regimen. Outcome was adjudicated by investigators blinded to treatment allocation.

Results

Of 123 enrolled patients, 105 had febrile neutropenia and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 47 in the extended infusion arm and 58 in the bolus infusion arm. Overall response occurred in 35 (74.4%) patients treated with extended infusion and 32 (55.1%) patients treated with bolus infusion (P = 0.044). The superiority of extended infusion was greatest for patients with clinically documented infections (overall response, 68.4% [13/19] vs 35.7% [10/28]; P = 0.039) and specifically for those with pneumonia (80% [4/5] vs 0% [0/8]; P = 0.007).

Conclusions

Extended infusion of β-lactams is associated with superior treatment outcomes compared with bolus infusion for high-risk patients with febrile neutropenia. The benefit of extended β-lactam infusion may be greatest for patients with pulmonary infections.

### Short-course antibiotics for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropaenia: retrospective cohort study [^610f77eb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent research in febrile neutropaenia (FN) has focused on reducing the intensity of treatment for those thought to be at low risk of significant morbidity or mortality. This has not led to a reduced burden of treatment for either families or healthcare systems. An alternative approach is to discharge all patients who remain well after 48hours of inpatient treatment, either with no ongoing treatment or with appropriate antibiotics if the cultures are positive. This paper aimed to demonstrate that this approach is safe.

Methods

Patients treated according to this approach in a single centre were reviewed retrospectively, with a random selection of patients from a 4-year period. Data were collected according to the Predicting Infectious Complications of Neutropenic sepsis in Children with Cancer dataset. In addition, all septic deaths over a 10-year period were reviewed in the same manner.

Results

179 episodes of FN were reviewed from 47 patients. In 70% (125/179) of episodes, patients were discharged safely once 48-hour microbiology results were available, with only 5.6% (7/125) resulting in readmission in the 48hours following discharge. There were no septic deaths in this cohort. There were 11 deaths due to FN over the 10-year study period. Almost all patients were identified as severely unwell in the early stages of their final presentation or had a prolonged final illness.

Conclusion

This paper indicates that the policy described provides a balance between safety and acceptability. Further work is needed to demonstrate non-inferiority and cost-benefit.

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^fec2d7e2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy (high-risk patients), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider modifying the initial empirical therapy in patients at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms, particularly if the patient's condition is unstable or if the patient has positive blood culture results suspicious of resistant bacteria (including MRSA, VRE, extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, and carbapenemase-producing organisms, including KPC).

### Shorter antibiotic courses in the immunocompromised: the impossible dream? [^0a0124bc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A growing number of studies have demonstrated similar outcomes with shorter courses of antibiotics for bacterial infections. Immunocompromised patients are frequently excluded from these studies despite anticipated benefits associated with shortening antibiotic courses (including lower risks of antibiotic toxicity, Clostridioides difficile infection, drug-resistant pathogens, and microbiome alterations).

Objectives

To critically review the literature that assesses shorter antibiotic courses in immunocompromised patients, specifically among solid organ transplant recipients and neutropenic fever (NF) syndromes among patients on antineoplastic chemotherapy and undergoing haematopoietic cell transplant.

Sources

References were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and clinical guidelines documents.

Content

Among organ transplant recipients, the majority of studies assessing outcomes associated with shorter antibiotic courses have been retrospective but have demonstrated similar rates of clinically relevant endpoints. Patients with high- and low-risk NF have been well-studied, including enrolment in randomized studies, albeit with heterogeneous patient populations and outcomes assessed. Clinical improvement-guided adoption of shorter courses has been associated with fewer antibiotic days and similar rates of fever recurrence and mortality.

Implications

Similar to studies demonstrating efficacy in immunocompetent patients, shorter antibiotic courses should be considered for immunocompromised hosts with presumed bacterial infections. Organ recipients and patients with NF syndromes should be prioritized for study in randomized controlled clinical trials assessing shorter course therapy.

### Early discontinuation of antibiotics for febrile neutropenia versus continuation until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer [^a8b7e1d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cancer with febrile neutropenia are at risk of severe infections and mortality and are thus treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy differs across guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the safety of protocol-guided discontinuation of antibiotics regardless of neutrophil count, compared to continuation of antibiotics until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with fever and neutropenia, in terms of mortality and morbidity. To assess the emergence of resistant bacteria in people with cancer treated with short courses of antibiotic therapy compared with people with cancer treated until resolution of neutropenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 1 October 2018. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished trials. We reviewed the references of all identified studies for additional trials and handsearched conference proceedings of international infectious diseases and oncology and haematology conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a short antibiotic therapy course in which discontinuation of antibiotics was guided by protocols regardless of the neutrophil count to a long course in which antibiotics were continued until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with febrile neutropenia. The primary outcome was 30-day or end of follow-up all-cause mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. For dichotomous outcomes with zero events in both arms of the trials, we conducted meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs) as well. For continuous outcomes, we extracted means with standard deviations (SD) from the studies and computed mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found, trials were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs comprising a total of 662 distinct febrile neutropenia episodes. The studies included adults and children, and had variable design and criteria for discontinuation of antibiotics in both study arms. All included studies but two were performed before the year 2000. All studies included people with cancer with fever of unknown origin and excluded people with microbiological documented infections. We found no significant difference between the short-antibiotic therapy arm and the long-antibiotic therapy arm for all-cause mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.62; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision and high risk of selection bias. The number of fever days was significantly lower for people in the short-antibiotic treatment arm compared to the long-antibiotic treatment arm (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.32; I² = 30%). In all studies, total antibiotic days were fewer in the intervention arm by three to seven days compared to the long antibiotic therapy. We found no significant differences in the rates of clinical failure (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.77; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for clinical failure due to variable and inconsistent definitions of clinical failure across studies, possible selection bias, and wide confidence intervals. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteraemia occurring after randomisation (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.66; very low-certainty evidence), while the incidence of any documented infections was significantly higher in the short-antibiotic therapy arm (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.57). There was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.31) and development of antibiotic resistance (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.61). The data on hospital stay were too sparse to permit any meaningful conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We could make no strong conclusions on the safety of antibiotic discontinuation before neutropenia resolution among people with cancer with febrile neutropenia based on the existing evidence and its low certainty. Results of microbiological outcomes favouring long antibiotic therapy may be misleading due to lower culture positivity rates under antibiotic therapy and not true differences in infection rates. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required that address this issue in the era of rising antibiotic resistance.

### Discontinuation of empirical antibiotic therapy in neutropenic acute myeloid leukaemia patients with fever of unknown origin: is it ethical? [^a27342bc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Based on recommendations of the ECIL-4, we prospectively evaluated discontinuation of empirical antibiotic therapy in high-risk neutropenic acute myeloid leukaemia patients with fever of unknown origin. Seven patients (median neutropenia duration 30 days) were included. Four of them remained afebrile but quickly recovered from neutropenia. The other three had rapid recurrent fever. Two of these three patients had bacteraemia with susceptible strains and one of them was transferred to the ICU for septic shock. Median duration of sparing of antibiotics for the seven patients was 3 days (2–4). Because of these limited results the study was stopped.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite outcome that included recurrent PA infection or death, both within 30 days of discontinuing antibiotic therapy (patients unable to complete the whole course of antibiotic treatment due to death or withdrawal of care were excluded from the study, because they did not have the chance to be evaluated for the outcomes, that is, to limit the impact of immortal time bias). The second outcome included recurrent PA infection within 90 days and recurrent fever within 7 days of discontinuing antibiotic therapy. Other endpoints observed included length of hospital stay. The recurrence of PA-BSI was defined as the subsequent isolation of PA from blood culture and presentation of infection related symptoms and signs within 90 days after stopping antibiotic therapy. And recurrent fever was defined as recrudescent fever after previously meeting the criteria for defervescence, except for fever caused by other pathogens.

Secondary outcomes

The median (IQR) duration of antibiotic administration after randomization, was significantly shorter in the stop arm [4.3 days (IQR: 0–10)] compared to the continuation arm [11 days (IQR: 7.2–15)] (p < 0.0001), as shown in Fig. 3. The median difference between the two arms was 6 days (95% CI: 5–7 days). Rates of hospital admission, use of third-line antibiotics, therapeutic antifungals, and mortality were not significantly different between the two arms (Table 2). The use of inotropes, mechanical ventilation, emergency visits, and transfusion of blood products also did not differ significantly. Granulocyte infusions and dialysis requirements were infrequent and comparable across groups (Table 2). Secondary outcomes and supportive care use for patients with de novo and relapsed ALL and AML are shown in Supplementary Table S4–7.

Fig. 3

Table 2
Secondary outcomes in each treatment arm.

Among patients with recurrent fever, blood cultures yielded microbiological growth in 9.6% (7/73) of the stop arm and 6.2% (4/65) of the continuation arm. Radiographically confirmed pneumonia was identified in 6.8% (5/73) and 1.5% (1/65) of patients with recurrence of fever, in the stop and continuation arms respectively.

In the stop arm, there were seven deaths among 140 patients (5%). Sepsis was the most common cause, reported in five patients, one patient died from haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and one death was attributed to disease progression. In the continuation arm, there were eleven deaths among 138 patients (7.9%), all of which were attributable to sepsis; one patient had intracranial bleeding during sepsis as well. Among patients with mortality, culture-positive infections were documented in six deaths in the stop arm and four deaths in the continuation arm. In the stop arm, bacterial pathogens were identified in three patients (Escherichia coli [carbapenem-resistant], Klebsiella pneumoniae [carbapenem resistant], and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) and Candida tropicalis in three patients. In the continuation arm, bacterial growth was detected in three patients (methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci in two, carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one) and C. tropicalis in one patient.

2.3 Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a Serious Medical Complication (SMC) within 30 days after the start of induction chemotherapy. An SMC was defined as either death or admission to the ICU. We chose this objective endpoint because our study was unblinded and an SMC is the most clinically relevant endpoint and the greatest fear for clinicians when stopping EBAT early.

Secondary outcome variables were all-cause mortality within 30 days and within 3 months after the start of the first induction chemotherapy, infection related mortality within 30 days, total duration of any antibiotic treatment (excluding prophylaxis), duration of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (i.e. meropenem), duration of gram-positive antibiotic treatment (i.e.g.lycopeptides or linezolid), the number of days with fever, incidence and types of clinically defined infections, incidence of bacteremia, the highest qSOFA-score for patients with bacteremia, and the type of microorganisms detected in blood cultures. To conclude, we calculated a number of outcome variables specifically for the group that received a short-course EBAT. Definitions are provided in the supplementary materials.

### Seven versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteremia: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^8205d2b7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gram-negative bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Data to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy are limited.

Methods

This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial. Inpatients with gram-negative bacteremia, who were afebrile and hemodynamically stable for at least 48 hours, were randomized to receive 7 days (intervention) or 14 days (control) of covering antibiotic therapy. Patients with uncontrolled focus of infection were excluded. The primary outcome at 90 days was a composite of all-cause mortality; relapse, suppurative, or distant complications; and readmission or extended hospitalization (> 14 days). The noninferiority margin was set at 10%.

Results

We included 604 patients (306 intervention, 298 control) between January 2013 and August 2017 in 3 centers in Israel and Italy. The source of the infection was urinary in 411 of 604 patients (68%); causative pathogens were mainly Enterobacteriaceae (543/604 [90%]). A 7-day difference in the median duration of covering antibiotics was achieved. The primary outcome occurred in 140 of 306 patients (45.8%) in the 7-day group vs 144 of 298 (48.3%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -2.6% [95% confidence interval, -10.5% to 5.3%]). No significant differences were observed in all other outcomes and adverse events, except for a shorter time to return to baseline functional status in the short-course therapy arm.

Conclusions

In patients hospitalized with gram-negative bacteremia achieving clinical stability before day 7, an antibiotic course of 7 days was noninferior to 14 days. Reducing antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia to 7 days is an important antibiotic stewardship intervention.

### Optimisation of empirical antimicrobial therapy in patients with haematological malignancies and febrile neutropenia (how long study): an open-label, randomised, controlled phase 4 trial [^4880df2c]. The Lancet: Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuation of empirical antimicrobial therapy (EAT) for febrile neutropenia in patients with haematological malignancies until neutrophil recovery could prolong the therapy unnecessarily. We aimed to establish whether EAT discontinuation driven by a clinical approach regardless of neutrophil recovery would optimise the duration of therapy.

Methods

We did an investigator-driven, superiority, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 4 clinical trial in six academic hospitals in Spain. Eligible patients were adults with haematological malignancies or haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients, with high-risk febrile neutropenia without aetiological diagnosis. An independent, computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to randomly enrol patients (1:1) to the experimental or control group. Investigators were masked to assignment only before randomisation. EAT based on an antipseudomonal β-lactam drug as monotherapy (ceftazidime or cefepime, meropenem or imipenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam) or as combination therapy (with an aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, or glycopeptide) was started according to local protocols and following international guidelines and recommendations. For the experimental group, EAT was withdrawn after 72 h or more of apyrexia plus clinical recovery; for the control group, treatment was withdrawn when the neutrophil count was also 0.5×10⁹ cells per L or higher. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of EAT-free days. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01581333.

Findings

Between April 10, 2012, and May 31, 2016, 157 episodes among 709 patients assessed for eligibility were included in analyses. 78 patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group and 79 to the control group. The mean number of EAT-free days was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (16.1 [SD 6.3] vs 13.6 [7.2], absolute difference -2.4 [95% CI -4.6 to -0.3]; p = 0.026). 636 adverse events were reported (341 in the experimental group vs 295 in the control group; p = 0.057) and most (580 [91%]; 323 in the experimental group vs 257 in the control group) were considered mild or moderate (grade 1–2). The most common adverse events in the experimental versus the control group were mucositis (28 [36%] of 78 patients vs 20 [25%] of 79 patients), diarrhoea (23 [29%] of 78 vs 24 [30%] of 79), and nausea and vomiting (20 [26%] of 78 vs 22 [28%] of 79). 56 severe adverse events were reported, 18 in the experimental group and 38 in the control group. One patient died in the experimental group (from hepatic veno-occlusive disease after an allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation) and three died in the control group (one from multiorgan failure, one from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and one from a post-chemotherapy intestinal perforation).

Interpretation

In high-risk patients with haematological malignancies and febrile neutropenia, EAT can be discontinued after 72 h of apyrexia and clinical recovery irrespective of their neutrophil count. This clinical approach reduces unnecessary exposure to antimicrobials and it is safe.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^11823e12]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study provides valuable insight into real-world practice patterns in the management of neutropenic fever at US healthcare institutions, with a robust survey sample accounting for a sizable proportion of oncologic care nationwide. There was relative agreement in the practice of prophylaxis and initial management of neutropenic fever, though with some variation in empiric coverage of non-gram-negative organisms, both upfront and in the case of prolonged fevers. Most notably, we found significant heterogeneity in the de-escalation of empiric gram-negative coverage, representing a potential opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. Though there has been increasing evidence for the safety of this practice, randomized data remain relatively scarce, highlighting the need for more research regarding this question to convince and guide both clinical guidelines and individual practitioners.

### Is short-course antibiotic therapy suitable for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections in onco-hematology patients with febrile neutropenia? Results of a multi-institutional analysis [^ad711f46]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on our real-world and retrospective study, short course antibiotic therapy is effective for PA BSI in part of hematologic malignancy patients and may have some potential benefits, such as reducing the exposure to antibiotics, lowering the cost of treatment and shortening hospital stays. The primary factors influencing recurrence and mortality were identified as MDR bacterial infections, perianal or pulmonary infections, and persistent or recurrent hematological malignancies. These findings highlight the importance of clinical attention to these factors in order to improve patient outcomes.

Our study also provides robust clinical evidence to support future RCTs. Onco-hematological patients are often excluded from RCTs, limiting the availability of compelling evidence. By utilizing a large-scale cohort matched analysis, our study demonstrates the comparable safety of short-course treatment, thus serving as a crucial foundation for the implementation of RCTs in clinical practice. Notably, onco-hematological patients at a lower risk of poor outcomes, including those showing rapid clinical improvement after antibiotic initiation, and those with milder levels of immunosuppression, should be given priority in RCTs enrollment. Clinical guidelines should also provide specific recommendations regarding antibiotic duration for immunocompromised patients, taking into account the potential for shorter treatment durations.

Given the retrospective nature of our study, certain limitations should be acknowledged. First, we screened a subset of patients into the final study through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although our intention was to better evaluate the indicators and avoid immortal time bias, this also made our study results not generalizable to all hematological malignancy patients. Second, there was randomness in the timing of repeating blood cultures after initiating targeted antibiotic therapy by the physicians in our study, which is a problem faced by many studies, as it is impossible to achieve fixed-time re-examination assembled in clinical trials. This may lead to bias in decision making of antibiotic duration. Further RCTs are necessary to validate the reproducibility of our findings.

In conclusion, we found that short course of antibiotic therapy was not inferior to the prolonged course of therapy in part of onco-hematological patients with PA BSI in our study, with the potential added benefit of earlier hospital discharge if treated with a shorter course.

### Is short-course antibiotic therapy suitable for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections in onco-hematology patients with febrile neutropenia? Results of a multi-institutional analysis [^5d697869]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Several studies have suggested that short-course antibiotic therapy was effective in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bloodstream infections (BSI) in immunocompetent patients. But similar studies in patients with hematological malignancies were rare.

Methods

This cohort study included onco-hematology patients at 2 hematology centers in China. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the confounding factors. Multivariate regression model was used to evaluate the effect of short-course antibiotic therapy on clinical outcomes.

Results

In total, 434 patients met eligibility criteria (short-course, 7–11 days, n = 229; prolonged, 12–21 days, n = 205). In the weighted cohort, the univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that short course antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes to the prolonged course. The recurrent PA infection at any site or mortality within 30 days of completing therapy occurred in 8 (3.9%) patients in the short-course group and in 10 (4.9%) in the prolonged-course group (P = 0.979). The recurrent infection within 90 days occurred in 20 (9.8%) patients in the short-course group and in 13 (6.3%) patients in the prolonged-course group (P = 0.139), and the recurrent fever within 7 days occurred in 17 (8.3%) patients in the short-course group and in 15 (7.4%) in the prolonged-course group (P = 0.957). On average, patients who received short-course antibiotic therapy spent 3.3 fewer days in the hospital (P < .001).

Conclusions

In the study, short-course therapy was non-inferior to prolonged-course therapy in terms of clinical outcomes. However, due to its biases and limitations, further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to generalize our findings.

### Is short-course antibiotic therapy suitable for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections in onco-hematology patients with febrile neutropenia? Results of a multi-institutional analysis [^97b8e748]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study, by including patients with hematological malignancies and balancing confounding factors through IPTW, yielded results indicating that there was no difference in fever relapse within 7 days, death or recurrent infection within 30 days, and recurrent infection within 90 days of completing antibiotic therapy regardless of whether patients were treated with a short course (median, 8 days) or prolonged course (median, 15 days) of antibiotics. Furthermore, patients treated with shorter courses were discharged from the hospital approximately 3.3 days sooner than those who received prolonged course of treatment.

Although current guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for PA BSI lasting more than 14 days, some studies in immunocompetent populations have already indicated that short-course therapy is non-inferior to prolonged treatment in terms of clinical and microbiological cure rates. Siddharth Swamy et al compared the effectiveness of short-course and prolonged-course treatments in a retrospective analysis of 178 patients with gram-negative BSI and found that short-course therapy for gram-negative bacteremia yielded comparable rates of clinical response (78.6% vs 80.6%, P = 0.202) and microbiological cure (83.3% vs 91.7%, P = 0.690). Rodrigues et al indicated that short-term therapy was not associated with 30-day mortality(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% CI.47–2.20, P = 0.98), Bae et al included 290 uncomplicated PA BSI and found that no significant difference in the risk of recurrence or 30 day mortality between the prolonged-course and short-course groups (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = .34–1.36, P = 0.28) and the recurrence of PA infection within 180 days (HR = 0.57, 95% CI = .29–1.10, P = 0.09). However, several retrospective studies involving immunocompromised populations are as follows. A study by Metais et al included 71 AML patients with 104 BSI episodes, of which 48 (46%) received short-course treatment. Only 8 (7.6%) BSI episodes relapsed within 30 days after discontinuation of antibiotics, with 5 of them having received short-course treatment. No significant association was found between the risk of relapse and short-course antibiotic treatment (P = 0.37). This study has limitations, including a small sample size, a mix of microbial infections comprising 42%, with gram-negative infections accounting for only 15%. In a study by Fabre et al, they included 249 patients with PA BSI for matched analysis. The authors claimed that 65% of the patients were immunocompromised, but only 23% had recent chemotherapy and 8% had allo-HSCT within a year, which does not reflect the reality in hematology wards. The sample size was also small, especially with only 72 cases in the short-course group, making it unclear if this treatment was safe for immunocompromised patients. Our study addresses this gap by including multicenter onco-hematology patients. To enhance the validity and generalizability of our research, we applied stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. We categorized the antibiotic duration into short course (7–11 days) and prolonged course (12–21 days) and excluded patients who received antibiotics outside this range to eliminate the confounding effect of inadequate or excessive antibiotic therapy. We also excluded patients who had death or other events before completing the antibiotic course to avoid the immortal time bias. Furthermore, we excluded patients who developed septic shock early in the course of infection, as they may have different antibiotic requirements and outcomes than other patients. These criteria minimized potential biases and confounders and approximated our study to the real-world scenario.

### Antibiotic treatment of common infections: more evidence to support shorter durations [^f2535d6f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although there is increasing recognition of the link between antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance, clinician prescribing is often unnecessarily long and motivated by fear of clinical relapse. High-quality evidence supporting shorter treatment durations is needed to give clinicians confidence to change prescribing habits. Here we summarize recent randomized controlled trials investigating antibiotic short courses for common infections in adult patients.

Recent Findings

Randomized trials in the last five years have demonstrated noninferiority of short-course therapy for a range of conditions including community acquired pneumonia, intraabdominal sepsis, gram-negative bacteraemia and vertebral osteomyelitis.

Summary

Treatment durations for many common infections have been based on expert opinion rather than randomized trials. There is now evidence to support shorter courses of antibiotic therapy for many conditions.

### Early antibiotic therapy discontinuation in patients with… [^cfad7794]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Early Antibiotic Therapy Discontinuation in Patients with Hematologic Conditions and Neutropenic Fever, END Trial. This phase III trial compares the effects of early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy versus standard of care on clinical outcomes in patients with hematologic conditions and neutropenic fever in which no bacterial infection has been identified. When individuals have a compromised immune system with a low white blood cell count, specifically with a low neutrophil count, they are at higher risk of developing infections. Currently, when individuals with a low neutrophil count develop a fever, they are treated with long courses of antibiotics in case of a bacterial infection, even if no bacterial infection is found. This trial evaluates whether a shortened period of antibiotic treatment after the development of a fever where no bacterial infection is identified is safe and still provides the same benefit as having the standard duration of antibiotics.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the rates of mortality within 60 days after first neutropenic fever in each arm. II. To compare the rates of acquisition of multidrug resistant gram-negative bacilli and vancomycin-resistant enterococci within 60 days after first neutropenic fever in each arm. III. To compare the rates of Clostridium difficile within 60 days after first neutropenic fever infection in each arm. IV. To compare the rates of candidemia and invasive candidiasis within 60 days after first neutropenic fever in each arm. V. To compare the rates of grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events in each arm within 60 days after first neutropenic fever. VI.

### Short antibiotic treatment in high risk febrile neutropenia… [^f70045bb]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Febrile neutropenia is a common complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and neutropenia related to the disease. It occurs in 80% of patients with hematological malignancies with a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. The issue of antibiotic treatment duration in febrile neutropenia is unresolved. The rationale for continuing antibiotics until neutrophil recovery is based on the concern that neutropenic patients may have an ongoing risk of life-threatening infection, and neutropenia may conceal classical manifestations of infection. On the other hand, prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment has been associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection and invasive fungal infections, as well as adverse effects and allergic reactions.

The evidence suggesting the beneficial effects of prolonged antibiotic treatment is derived from 2 small randomized controlled trials from the 1970s, which showed an increase in infections and mortality with early stoppage of antibiotics. Two recently done RCTs, the HOW LONG and the SHORT studies, suggested that early discontinuation of antibiotics is feasible and is not associated with adverse outcomes. However, the first was not powered for safety outcomes and the second included a lower-risk population and a de-escalation strategy. Despite these reassuring studies, most centres still utilize the resolution of neutropenia as one of the criteria for stopping antibiotics in patients with febrile neutropenia. Objective This pilot RCT will assess the feasibility of conducting a full future RCT.

In the full trial, the investigators will compare early antibiotic discontinuation to the continuation of antibiotics until the resolution of neutropenia in high-risk febrile neutropenic patients, aiming to prove non-inferiority. Methods The investigators will conduct a pilot open-label, multicentre RCT involving centres in Canada and Israel. The investigators will include adult patients with acute leukemia or patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation diagnosed with febrile neutropenia of unknown source. Patients who have received antibiotics for at least 72 hours and are still neutropenic will be recruited if afebrile for at least 24 hours.
- Patients with febrile neutropenia secondary to the treatment for solid malignancies, autologous HSCT, CAR-T cell therapy, hematologic malignancies besides acute leukemia when not in the context of allogeneic HSCT, AML treated with consolidation chemotherapy, or ALL treated with intensification and maintenance phase of chemotherapy.

### Cefepime or carbapenem treatment for febrile neutropenia as a single agent is as effective as a combination of 4th-generation cephalosporin + aminoglycosides: comparative study [^f9acb627]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

1998, a consensus meeting was held in Miyazaki, Japan, to develop an approach to management of febrile neutropenia (FN). The K-HOT study group decided to examine whether this proposal was applicable to clinical practice in a multicenter study. Patients who developed fever with neutrophil counts < 1,000/microL were randomized to receive either a single antibiotic, cefepime or one of the carbapenems, or a combination of cefepime and an aminoglycoside. Patients who became afebrile within the first 3 days were continued on the same treatment. Patients who remained febrile were switched to a combination regimen if they were randomized to receive a single agent, and patients on combination medication were changed from cefepime to another cephalosporin. A total of 165 patients were entered into the trial. One hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for response. The average age was 52 years, and 70% of the patients had acute leukemia. Severe neutropenia, defined as < 100/microL at the time of FN, was seen in 62% of the patients on entry and during the course of treatment 71% of patients experienced neutrophil counts of < 100/microL. Microbiologically documented infection was seen in 6.5% for monotherapy, and 10.5% for a combination treatment, and fever of unknown origin occurred in 75.3% and 59.2% of the patients in each regimen, respectively. Excellent to good response was seen in two-thirds of the patients in all treatment groups. Adverse events were minimal, and three early deaths were observed at days 9, 16, and 16 among patients treated with a single antibiotic and three in the combination regimen group at days 14, 15, and 20. These results indicate that cefepime or a carbapenem alone is as effective as a combination of cefepime and an aminoglycoside for treating FN.

### Is short-course antibiotic therapy suitable for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections in onco-hematology patients with febrile neutropenia? Results of a multi-institutional analysis [^902dc1b3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Several studies have suggested that short-course antibiotic therapy was effective in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bloodstream infections (BSI) in immunocompetent patients. But similar studies in patients with hematological malignancies were rare.

Methods

This cohort study included onco-hematology patients at 2 hematology centers in China. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the confounding factors. Multivariate regression model was used to evaluate the effect of short-course antibiotic therapy on clinical outcomes.

Results

In total, 434 patients met eligibility criteria (short-course, 7–11 days, n = 229; prolonged, 12–21 days, n = 205). In the weighted cohort, the univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that short course antibiotic therapy had similar outcomes to the prolonged course. The recurrent PA infection at any site or mortality within 30 days of completing therapy occurred in 8 (3.9%) patients in the short-course group and in 10 (4.9%) in the prolonged-course group (P = 0.979). The recurrent infection within 90 days occurred in 20 (9.8%) patients in the short-course group and in 13 (6.3%) patients in the prolonged-course group (P = 0.139), and the recurrent fever within 7 days occurred in 17 (8.3%) patients in the short-course group and in 15 (7.4%) in the prolonged-course group (P = 0.957). On average, patients who received short-course antibiotic therapy spent 3.3 fewer days in the hospital (P < .001).

Conclusions

In the study, short-course therapy was non-inferior to prolonged-course therapy in terms of clinical outcomes. However, due to its biases and limitations, further prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to generalize our findings.

### Prolonged vs short-term infusion of β-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of febrile neutropenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^90562da3]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimisation of the use of β-lactam antibiotics (BLA) via prolonged infusions in life-threatening complications such as febrile neutropenia (FN) is still controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the efficacy of this strategy in onco-haematological patients with FN.

Methods

A systematic search was performed of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, EMBASE, World Health Organization, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from database inception until December 2022. The search included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared prolonged vs short-term infusions of the same BLA. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were defervescence, requirement of vasoactive drugs, length of hospital stay and adverse events. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using random effects models.

Results

Five studies were included, comprising 691 episodes of FN, mainly in haematological patients. Prolonged infusion was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (pRR 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.47–1.48). Nor differences were found in secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

The limited data available did not show significant differences in terms of all-cause mortality or significant secondary outcomes in patients with FN receiving BLA in prolonged vs. short-term infusion. High-quality RCTs are needed to determine whether there are subgroups of FN patients who would benefit from prolonged BLA infusion.

### Seven versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in intensive care unit patients (OPTIMISE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial [^f564c6f4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed in R software version 4.3.1. A non-inferiority of the 7-day compared with 14-day course would be reached if the upper edge of the two-tailed 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the failure rate in the intervention group and the control group were not more than 10% in the intention to treat (ITT) and in the PP analyses. The risk difference (95% CI) was calculated using the Wald method.

Secondary outcomes were analysed as described in the supplementary material. All tests were two-tailed and a P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Six subgroups analysis were defined for the primary outcome: bacterial aetiology; carbapenem susceptibility profile; severity of infection criteria; appropriate empirical therapy; use of combination antimicrobial therapy; and risk for mortality of infection.

Post hoc analysis

A sensitivity analysis was performed including in the PP population, those who were excluded because they received > 8 days or < 13 days of antimicrobial therapy in the 7- and 14-day groups, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumed a worst-case scenario for the shorter therapy: 100% failure in patients newly included in the PP 7-day group and 0% failure in patients newly included in the PP 14-day group.

### Evaluation of imipenem 1.5 g daily in febrile patients with short duration neutropenia after chemotherapy for non-leukemic hematologic malignancies and solid tumors: personal experience and review of the literature [^1af39c22]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have demonstrated efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin, 50 mg/kg/day, as first line therapy in febrile patients with neutropenia of short duration consecutive to cytostatic chemotherapy. However, only two studies used low dosage of this antibiotic as 1.5 g/day, in prospective, double blind, randomized clinical trials, in this indication. Efficacy and tolerability of imipenem-cilastatin 0.5 g three times daily IV in 30-min infusions, as first-line empiric therapy, were retrospectively evaluated in our hematological unit. From January 1996 to September 2000, 30 neutropenic patients (12 females) with 45 febrile episodes were included. Median age was 57.5 years (31–75). Twenty-four of them had lymphomas, 4 solid tumors and 2 myelomas. There were 13 clinically documented infections, (CD, 28.8%), 16 microbiologically documented infections, (MD, 35.6%) and 16 febrile episodes corresponding to fever of unknown origin, (FUO, 35.6%). The median neutrophils count on nadir (n = 44), was 67/mm3 (8–369). The median duration of neutropenia was 5 days (3–15). Bacteremia was observed in 10 patients, urinary tract infection in 3 patients. The most frequently isolated microorganism was Escherichia coli. The overall success rate of the first line therapy was 66.7%. Adverse events were observed in 11.1% of the patients without necessity to stop treatment. The MD infections showed a lower rate of success compared with CD infections and FUO. These data were in accordance with the previous studies. The importance of number of microorganisms (p = 0.007) and of infected sites (p = 0.01) appeared as prognostic factors (univariate analysis). Although imipenem-cilastatin has been used in numerous studies as empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in the treatment of febrile neutropenic cancer patients, the exact dosage of this antibiotic is still not standardized. However, utilization of this antibiotic in monotherapy at low dosage seems to us to be safe and effective as usual dosage in the antimicrobial treatment ofthe febrile patients with post chemotherapy neutropenia of short duration.

### Progress in the fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria 2005–2016: modern noninferiority trial designs enable antibiotic development in advance of epidemic bacterial resistance [^cc3d9e6b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Other challenges to use of superiority design trials are logistical. Patients with an acute, severe infection must be identified by the clinical investigator within hours of presentation for care; prolonged screening and enrollment procedures severely constrain patient accrual. Furthermore, unless point-of-care rapid diagnostics are readily available, attempts to enroll patients with an infection caused by a specific resistant pathogen must be empirical and anticipatory, meaning that many-fold the final required sample size of patients must be enrolled to find a few with the targeted resistant organism. But, and as noted above, detection of a resistant pathogen would mandate use of an alternative comparator regimen predicted to be active against the infecting pathogen.

Finally, if a superiority standard is required, demonstrating superiority with one new agent resets the bar, effectively terminating development of other potential promising agents until resistance to the new agent also becomes widespread and thereby depriving patients and physicians of other potential benefits of new agents (eg, improved safety or tolerability; more convenient dosing regimens).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Febrile Neutropenic Patients

The safety and efficacy of empiric cefepime monotherapy of febrile neutropenic patients have been assessed in two multicenter, randomized trials comparing cefepime monotherapy (at a dose of 2 g intravenously every 8 hours) to ceftazidime monotherapy (at a dose of 2 g intravenously every 8 hours). These studies comprised 317 evaluable patients. Table 10 describes the characteristics of the evaluable patient population.

Table 11 describes the clinical response rates observed. For all outcome measures, cefepime was therapeutically equivalent to ceftazidime.

Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia). No data are available in patients with septic shock.

14.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections

Patients hospitalized with complicated intra-abdominal infections participated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing the combination of cefepime (2 g every 12 hours) plus intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 6 hours) versus imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 hours) for a maximum duration of 14 days of therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate equivalence of the two therapies. The primary analyses were conducted on the population consisting of those with a surgically confirmed complicated infection, at least one pathogen isolated pretreatment, at least 5 days of treatment, and a 4 to 6 week follow-up assessment for cured patients. Subjects in the imipenem/cilastatin arm had higher APACHE II scores at baseline. The treatment groups were otherwise generally comparable with regard to their pretreatment characteristics. The overall clinical cure rate among the primary analysis patients was 81% (51 cured/63 evaluable patients) in the cefepime plus metronidazole group and 66% (62/94) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. The observed differences in efficacy may have been due to a greater proportion of patients with high APACHE II scores in the imipenem/cilastatin group.

Trial details include a multicenter intra-abdominal infection RCT with "262 patients… median APACHE II score of 7" and "only four deaths occurred (one received CI piperacillin–tazobactam and three received SI)", another RCT of "78 patients with suspected Pseudomonas… with only one reported death in the SI group", where "only 20% had sepsis and about 90% of patients were treated empirically with only 24 positive cultures… from 8 cultures". In cancer populations, CI versus SI cefoperazone monotherapy was studied in "45 patients… (80%)", with "nine deaths… of which seven were attributed to cancer". Febrile neutropenia studies included one that "randomized 105 patients… and reported few deaths (1 vs 2 in the EI and SI groups, respectively)" and another with cefepime showing "(5 vs 3, p = 0.46, respectively)". One multicenter observational study reported reduced mortality with PI regimens including piperacillin–tazobactam, imipenem–cilastatin, and meropenem: "(HR 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.10–0.83)".

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^8472b76d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

This document updates and expands the initial Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Fever and Neutropenia Guideline that was published in 1997 and first updated in 2002. It is intended as a guide for the use of antimicrobial agents in managing patients with cancer who experience chemotherapy-induced fever and neutropenia. Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development and technology, clinical trial results, and extensive clinical experience have informed the approaches and recommendations herein. Because the previous iteration of this guideline in 2002, we have a developed a clearer definition of which populations of patients with cancer may benefit most from antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. Furthermore, categorizing neutropenic patients as being at high risk or low risk for infection according to presenting signs and symptoms, underlying cancer, type of therapy, and medical comorbidities has become essential to the treatment algorithm. Risk stratification is a recommended starting point for managing patients with fever and neutropenia. In addition, earlier detection of invasive fungal infections has led to debate regarding optimal use of empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy, although algorithms are still evolving. What has not changed is the indication for immediate empirical antibiotic therapy. It remains true that all patients who present with fever and neutropenia should be treated swiftly and broadly with antibiotics to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Finally, we note that all Panel members are from institutions in the United States or Canada; thus, these guidelines were developed in the context of North American practices. Some recommendations may not be as applicable outside of North America, in areas where differences in available antibiotics, in the predominant pathogens, and/or in health care-associated economic conditions exist. Regardless of venue, clinical vigilance and immediate treatment are the universal keys to managing neutropenic patients with fever and/or infection.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^192d58d2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenic fever is a significant source of mortality, morbidity, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs. Management of neutropenic fever results in prolonged periods of intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics, often for the duration of neutropenia. Although multidisciplinary guidelines – agree that appropriate prompt treatment of neutropenic fever is critical, the management decisions after initiation of antibiotic therapy are more complex, and guideline recommendations for these decisions have been less clear. This is in the context of increasing recognized harms of unnecessary antimicrobial use, including medication toxicity, healthcare utilization (including cost and length of stay), antimicrobial resistance, and risk of hospital-acquired infections (such as Clostridioides difficile).

Specifically, the decision to de-escalate from IV antimicrobial therapy in stable patients with neutropenic fever is of importance. Guidelines generally use an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) goal of 500 cells/uL as a target for stopping IV antibiotics based on a landmark study published in 1979, though some studies have found no difference in outcomes with lower ANC thresholds for antibiotic cessation. A growing set of literature has also suggested the safety of de-escalation prior to a dedicated ANC recovery threshold, described in many single- and multi-center retrospective analyses. – Indeed, 2023 International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline now reflect a recommendation for de-escalation prior to ANC recovery in clinically well and afebrile patients, based a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this population.

Panel deliberations.

The panel recommends reviewing institutional antibiograms to determine the most appropriate monotherapy. Evidence to establish the proportion of circulating strains that should be susceptible to the monotherapy agent is currently insufficient. The development of resistance was considered a critical outcome, but was not evaluated in these studies. Based on the biologic plausibility of resistance development, the panelists recommend that carbapenems be used only in patients at high risk for infection with cephalosporin/beta-lactam–resistant bacteria or in patients presenting with severe clinical illness.

The lack of evidence defining a "high rate" of resistant pathogens and unclear clinical definitions of stability versus instability limit the usefulness of these recommendations. Gram-negative bacteria resistant to monotherapy options may have high prevalence in guideline countries. Additional coverage may be warranted in patients developing infection while on broad-spectrum antibiotics or with past infection/colonization with resistant bacteria. In practice, a glycopeptide is often added in a patient with skin/soft tissue infection or recent chemotherapy with potential for mucosal damage. Clinical discretion is therefore advised when choosing the initial regimen and subsequent modifications.

8. The panel RECOMMENDS using outpatient management for low-risk pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia if the infrastructure is in place for careful monitoring and follow-up (Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

Three studies addressed this issue (186 patients; 248 episodes of febrile neutropenia),- but none was performed in an LMIC. Pooled results showed no significant difference between outpatient and inpatient management with regard to treatment success, overall mortality, and treatment duration (Data Supplement).

Panel deliberations.

Recommendation implementation is dependent on the infrastructure available to support outpatient antibiotic administration and follow-up, along with individual and social characteristics. This recommendation may decrease hospitalizations, but requires staffing and resources to support close follow-up. The clinician must select patients for outpatient management cautiously.

9. The panel RECOMMENDS either oral or intravenous administration as the route of antibiotic therapy in patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia (Quality of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Eight studies addressed this issue (763 patients; 1,049 episodes of febrile neutropenia); only 1 was performed in an LMIC. Pooled results showed no significant difference between oral and intravenous therapy with regard to treatment failure, mean days of fever, and neutropenia (Data Supplement).

### Clinical outcomes with extended or continuous versus short-term intravenous infusion of carbapenems and piperacillin / tazobactam: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb17859f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

We sought to study whether the better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam, when the duration of infusion is longer, were associated with lower mortality. PubMed and Scopus were searched for studies reporting on patients treated with extended (≥ 3 hours) or continuous (24 hours) versus short-term duration (20–60 minutes) infusions of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam. Fourteen studies were included (1229 patients). Mortality was lower among patients receiving extended or continuous infusion of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam compared to those receiving short-term (risk ratio [RR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI].41-.83). Patients with pneumonia who received extended or continuous infusion had lower mortality than those receiving short-term infusion (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26–0.96). Data for other specific infections were not available. The available evidence from mainly nonrandomized studies suggests that extended or continuous infusion of carbapenems or piperacillin/tazobactam was associated with lower mortality. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings before such approaches become widely used.

Subjects in the imipenem/cilastatin arm had higher APACHE II scores at baseline. The treatment groups were otherwise generally comparable with regard to their pretreatment characteristics. The overall clinical cure rate among the primary analysis patients was 81% (51 cured/63 evaluable patients) in the cefepime plus metronidazole group and 66% (62/94) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. The observed differences in efficacy may have been due to a greater proportion of patients with high APACHE II scores in the imipenem/cilastatin group.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^c3d69af2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe neutropenic fever management practices among healthcare institutions.

Design

Survey.

Participants

Members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America Research Network (SRN) representing healthcare institutions within the United States.

Methods

An electronic survey was distributed to SRN representatives, with questions pertaining to demographics, antimicrobial prophylaxis, supportive care, and neutropenic fever management. The survey was distributed from fall 2022 through spring 2023.

Results

40 complete responses were recorded (54.8% response rate), with respondent institutions accounting for approximately 15.7% of 2021 US hematologic malignancy hospitalizations and 14.9% of 2020 US bone marrow transplantations. Most entities have institutional guidelines for neutropenic fever management (35, 87.5%) and prophylaxis (31, 77.5%), and first-line treatment included IV antipseudomonal antibiotics (35, 87.5% cephalosporin; 5, 12.5% penicillin; 0, 0% carbapenem). We observed significant heterogeneity in treatment course decisions, with roughly half (18, 45.0%) of respondents continuing antibiotics until neutrophil recovery, while the remainder having criteria for de-escalation prior to neutrophil recovery. Respondents were more willing to de-escalate prior to neutrophil recovery in patients with identified clinical (27, 67.5% with pneumonia) or microbiological (30, 75.0% with bacteremia) sources after dedicated treatment courses.

Conclusions

We found substantial variation in the practice of de-escalation of empiric antibiotics relative to neutrophil recovery, highlighting a need for more robust evidence for and adoption of this practice. No respondents use carbapenems as first-line therapy, comparing favorably to prior survey studies conducted in other countries.

### Anti-pseudomonal β-lactams for the initial, empirical, treatment of febrile neutropenia: comparison of β-lactams [^25b8c511]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Several beta-lactams are recommended as single agents for the treatment of febrile neutropenia.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of different anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams as single agents in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. To compare the development of bacterial resistance, bacterial and fungal superinfections during or following treatment with the different beta-lactams.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 3, 2010. MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, FDA drug applications, conference proceedings and ongoing clinical trial databases up to August 2010. References of included studies were scanned.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antipseudomonal beta-lactam to another antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic, both given alone or with the addition of the same glycopeptide to both study arms, for the initial treatment of fever and neutropenia among cancer patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors applied inclusion criteria and extracted the data independently. Missing data were sought. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and pooled using the fixed effect model. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using a domain-based evaluation and its effect of results was assessed through sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Forty-four trials were included. The antibiotics assessed were cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem and meropenem. Adequate allocation concealment and generation were reported in about half of the trials and only two trials were double-blinded. The risk for all-cause mortality was significantly higher with cefepime compared to other beta-lactams (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.86, 21 trials, 3471 participants), without heterogeneity and with higher RRs in trials at low risk for bias. There were no differences in secondary outcomes but for a non-significantly higher rate of bacterial superinfections with cefepime. Mortality was significantly lower with piperacillin-tazobactam compared to other antibiotics (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.92, 8 trials, 1314 participants), without heterogeneity. Carbapenems resulted in similar all-cause mortality and a lower rate of clinical failure and antibiotic modifications as compared to other antibiotics, but a higher rate of diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in locations where antibiotic resistance profiles do not mandate empirical use of carbapenems. Carbapenems result in a higher rate of antibiotic-associated and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. There is a high level of evidence that all-cause mortality is higher with cefepime compared to other beta-lactams and it should not be used as monotherapy for patients with febrile neutropenia.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Febrile Neutropenic Patients

The safety and efficacy of empiric cefepime monotherapy of febrile neutropenic patients have been assessed in two multicenter, randomized trials comparing cefepime monotherapy (at a dose of 2 g intravenously every 8 hours) to ceftazidime monotherapy (at a dose of 2 g intravenously every 8 hours). These studies comprised 317 evaluable patients. Table 7 describes the characteristics of the evaluable patient population.

Table 8 describes the clinical response rates observed. For all outcome measures, cefepime was therapeutically equivalent to ceftazidime.

Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia). No data are available in patients with septic shock.

14.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections

Patients hospitalized with complicated intra-abdominal infections participated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing the combination of cefepime (2 g every 12 hours) plus intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 6 hours) versus imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 hours) for a maximum duration of 14 days of therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate equivalence of the two therapies. The primary analyses were conducted on the protocol-valid population, which consisted of those with a surgically confirmed complicated infection, at least one pathogen isolated pretreatment, at least 5 days of treatment, and a 4 to 6 week follow-up assessment for cured patients. Subjects in the imipenem/cilastatin arm had higher APACHE II scores at baseline. The treatment groups were otherwise generally comparable with regard to their pretreatment characteristics. The overall clinical cure rate among the protocol-valid patients was 81% (51 cured/63 evaluable patients) in the cefepime plus metronidazole group and 66% (62/94) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. The observed differences in efficacy may have been due to a greater proportion of patients with high APACHE II scores in the imipenem/cilastatin group.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America 2002 guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in patients with cancer and neutropenia: salient features and comments [^9cad09ae]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Infection remains the most common complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Bacterial infections predominate initially. Invasive fungal infections occur in patients with prolonged neutropenia. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended only for patients at high risk. Initial empirical therapy is based on local epidemiology and drug-susceptibility patterns. Patients at low risk can be treated as outpatients. Other patients need hospital-based, parenteral therapy. Several options are available, including combination regimens or monotherapy. Initial antimicrobial coverage against Pseudomonas species is necessary. Subsequent management depends on the nature of the febrile episode. If defervescence occurs within 3–5 days and no pathogen has been identified, the initial regimen or a suitable oral regimen can be used to complete a 7- to 10-day course. If the etiology has been established, therapy can be adjusted for optimal coverage (activity against gram-negative organisms must be maintained). If fever persists for longer than 3–5 days, assessment for a fungal infection, a resistant organism, or a new infectious focus should be conducted and empirical antifungal therapy instituted.

FAQ8 — duration and route for Enterobacterales bacteremia after HCT are specified as follows: Although data are limited, 10 to 14 days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is generally recommended (C-III). One randomized trial in uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia showed that 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of therapy, but immunocompromised patients were excluded. In uncomplicated central venous catheter (CVC)–related Enterobacterales bacteremia, a course as short as 7 days may be reasonable if management includes CVC removal, but other factors may warrant up to 14 days of therapy (C-III). HCT recipients who receive 14 days of therapy and remain neutropenic but without signs or symptoms of ongoing infection can often discontinue antibacterial prophylaxis or have antibacterial therapy discontinued. Although we recommend initial i.v. therapy, clinically improving patients without GI pathology can be transitioned to highly bioavailable oral therapies, such as fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, depending on susceptibility (B-III).

### Current antimicrobial practice in febrile neutropenia across Europe and Asia: the EBMT infectious disease working party survey [^a93fe89b]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of this survey was to summarize the current antimicrobial practice in febrile neutropenia and the presence of key aspects of antimicrobial stewardship. A questionnaire was sent to 567 centers, and complete responses were obtained from 194 (34.2%). Fluoroquinolone and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis are used in 57.1% and 89.1%, respectively. In 66.4%, the first-line empirical therapy is piperacillin/tazobactam, whereas 10.9% use carbapenems. Empirical combination therapy is used in stable patients without history of resistant pathogens in 37.4%. De-escalation to monotherapy is performed within 3 days in 35.3% and after 10 days in 19.1%. Empirical addition of a glycopeptide is performed when fever persists more than 2–3 days in 60.8%. Empirical escalation to a broader spectrum agent is performed when fever persists more than 3–5 days in 71.4%. In case of positive blood cultures with a susceptible pathogen and uncomplicated presentation, 76.7% of centers de-escalate and 36.6% discontinue before neutrophil recovery. In fever of unknown origin with uncomplicated presentation, 54.1% of centers de-escalate and 49.5% discontinue before neutrophil recovery. Recommendations put forward in the ECIL guidelines are not widely implemented in clinical practice. Specific problems include overuse of carbapenems and combination therapy and unjustified addition of glycopeptides without further de-escalation or discontinuation.

### Pathogen-targeted clinical development to address unmet medical need: design, safety, and efficacy of the ATTACK trial [^54c70c8a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Working with experts, the FDA crafted recommendations and guidance to industry for developing pathogen-targeted antibiotics. The key points were the following: (1) focus on a single pathogen at multiple body sites and organs; (2) optimize the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile; (3) conduct a single phase 3 noninferiority or superiority clinical trial, with supportive safety data from previous phase 1 and 2 studies; and (4) rapid diagnostic testing to confirm the causative pathogen should be used whenever possible. Using this approach, rationally designed antibiotics can be developed that target MDR pathogens and incorporate a streamlined development and regulatory pathway to approval.

The designs of clinical trials for pathogen-targeted antimicrobials face some unique challenges that are not encountered with those for traditional broad-spectrum agents. Infections due to MDR pathogens in nosocomial settings often arise in the presence of prolonged hospital stays, antibiotic use, indwelling device usage, and complicated illnesses, making them more difficult to treat. Clinical trials to evaluate effective therapies for MDR pathogens are equally difficult because of these factors, along with the challenge of identifying the targeted patient population while facing diagnostic uncertainty and delay. This is further complicated by small patient sample sizes and statistical ambiguity. For example, establishing an appropriate noninferiority margin is challenging when there is limited or varied information on comparator response rates. In the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CARE) Trial, which evaluated plazomicin in patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) or pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, only a fraction of the target number of subjects were enrolled. The CARE trial thus highlights the daunting challenges faced by clinical trial investigators focusing on MDR pathogens.

### Is current initial empirical antibiotherapy appropriate to treat bloodstream infections in short-duration chemo-induced febrile neutropenia? [^8662d2d0]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fever of unknown origin is by far the most common diagnosis in low-risk febrile neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy. The current empirical regimen combines amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and fluoroquinolones in low-risk neutropenic patients. The aim of this study was to assess the appropriateness of antibiotherapy and the outcome of bloodstream infections (BSI) in patients with expected neutropenia of short duration.

Methods

This 2-year monocentric retrospective study included all consecutive neutropenic febrile adult patients with expected duration of neutropenia ≤ 7 days. They were classified into low- and high-risk groups for complications using the MASCC index. Appropriateness of initial empirical antibiotic regimen was assessed for each BSI. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality.

Results

Over the study period, 189 febrile episodes with positive blood cultures in neutropenic patients were reported, of which 44 occurred during expected duration of neutropenia ≤ 7 days. Patients were classified as high-risk (n = 27) and low-risk (n = 17). Gram-negative bacteria BSI represented 57% of cases, including only two multidrug-resistant bacteria in high-risk patients. Initial empirical antibiotherapy was appropriate in 86% of cases, and inappropriate in the event of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus BSI (14%), although the outcome was always favorable. In low-risk patients, no deaths and only 12% of severe complications were reported, contrasting with mortality and complication rates of 48% (p < 0.001) and 63% in high-risk patients (p < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

Outcome of BSI is favorable in low-risk febrile neutropenic patients, even with inappropriate empirical initial antibiotic regimen for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus BSI. Initial in-hospital assessment and close monitoring of these patients are however mandatory.

### Experience with cefepime versus meropenem as empiric monotherapy for neutropenia and fever in pediatric patients with solid tumors [^d6d263e4]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

A prospective, open-label, randomized, comparative study in pediatric cancer patients was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefepime and meropenem in the empiric therapy of febrile neutropenic patients. Febrile episodes were classified as microbiologically documented infection, clinical documented infection, or fever of unknown origin. Clinical response to therapy was classified as success or failure. In this period 37 children with solid tumors including lymphoma, 25 males, 12 females, had neutropenia on 65 occasions. Microbiologically documented infections occurred in 21 episodes (32.31%). Frequency of positive bacteria isolated was higher than gram-negative bacteria. There was no infection-related death. There were no statistical differences between the cefepime and meropenem groups for duration of fever or neutropenia, response rate, and necessity for modification. Cefepime appears to be as effective and safe as meropenem for empiric treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic pediatric cancer patients.

### Seven versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in intensive care unit patients (OPTIMISE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial [^c964450e]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, despite similar clinical failure rates, including the 28-day mortality component, observed in both groups, the OPTIMISE trial could not determine the non-inferiority of 7-day compared to 14-day therapy for severe infections caused by MDR-GNB due to early termination related to the low recruitment rate. Since pathogen and susceptibility profile-specific randomised clinical trials are extremely difficult to be carried out, future trials addressing duration of therapy in MDR-GNB will remain a challenge to be conducted. Therefore, OPTIMISE trial's new results bring an important contribution to the scarce existing evidence on the duration of therapy in severe MDR-GNB infection in the critically ill patient.

### Is short-course antibiotic therapy suitable for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infections in onco-hematology patients with febrile neutropenia? Results of a multi-institutional analysis [^18557046]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Our cohort study included patients who regularly received treatment and follow-up at our center and had follow-up information on mortality and recurrence for 30 and 90 days after antibiotic therapy, which facilitating the accurate assessment of the short-term and long-term effects of antibiotic duration on infection outcomes. This made our study more comparable to the clinical trials and the results more reliable. Furthermore, the variables used in the weighted analysis were known major prognostic factors and can be acquired at the onset of BSI, which closely resembled the standard of randomization in RCTs. Our study population had a relatively low prevalence of comorbidities due to our populations being predominantly young, akin to the features of BSI in hematological patients. While regarding the sources of BSI, we observed that over 50% of cases were primary BSI, indicating the absence of signs of infection at other sites. Among patients in whom the source could be determined, pulmonary and the damaged mucosal including oral and perianal were the main sites, whereas the CRBSI and urinary tract were quite rare in our study. These findings deviated from previous studies reporting that gram-negative BSIs primarily originated from venous catheters and urinary sources. Those studies often involved intensive care unit (ICU) populations with a higher prevalence of invasive devices such as urinary catheters and central lines. Although the CRBSI rate was relatively low, which might be related to the use of a fixed catheterization room, and the standardized daily care. However, it was also related to the fact that some patients did not achieve bilateral double suction, thus failing to meet the diagnostic criteria for CRBSI. This is also an area that needs to be improved in infection control in the future. In total, our study revealed the main characteristics of PA BSI in patients with hematologic malignancies, which were more consistent with actual infection patterns compared to previously published researches. Although a very small number of patients did not completely recover from neutropenia when they stopped antibiotics, they had an upward trend in the ANC and were evenly distributed in both short-course and long-course groups. The neutropenia non-recovery populations had worse clinical outcomes, which warrant physicians to take measures other than prolonged the antibiotic duration.

Data Collection

Information regarding primary disease, management (chemotherapy, immunosuppression therapy, and allo-HSCT), tumor stage (induction, consolidation, and relapse/refractory disease), comorbidities (chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, and diabetes mellitus), ANC at the onset of BSI, ANC at the day of the end of antibiotics (if not available, the ANC from the previous or subsequent day can be used as a substitute), duration of neutropenia before BSI, sources of infection and control measures, clinical severity (shock), clinical complications (pneumonia, oral mucositis, perianal mucositis, observed until the day 7 after the onset of BSI), microbiology data (MDR and CRPA), and antibiotic treatment regimen, including clinical outcomes, were collected by chart review for all patients. The criteria for BSI sources used in our study were based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions for specific types of infections (accessed January 2023) (Supplementary Table 1). Source control required device withdrawal or replacement in cases of urinary catheter, vascular catheter and biliary prosthesis infections, or adequate surgical or image-guided drainage in cases of surgical site infection, skin and soft tissue infection.

Tumor remission is judged according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute leukemia and lymphoma. Immunosuppressive therapy is defined as receiving glucocorticoids and immunosuppressant drugs at the same hospitalization. Neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 0.5×10⁹/L, and severe neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 0.1×10⁹/L. Septic shock is characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the presence of a documented infection, leading to circulatory dysfunction, cellular and metabolic abnormalities, and organ dysfunction. Shock was defined as having a systolic pressure < 90 mmHg, unresponsive to fluid treatment or requiring vasoactive drug therapy.

Adequately empirical therapy was defined as receiving 1 or more antimicrobial agents with in vitro activity within 48 hours of the onset of PA BSI, whereas the opposite is an inadequate empirical therapy (IET48h). Fever is defined as a core temperature (rectal) of 37.5°C–38.3°C (99.5°F–100.9°F), a skin temperature (axillary) > 37.2°C. Defervescence was defined as a core temperature less than 37.5°C or a skin temperature (axillary) < 37.2°C or for more than 24 hours.

### Stopping antibiotic therapy after 72 h in patients with febrile neutropenia following intensive chemotherapy for AML / MDS (safe study): a retrospective comparative cohort study [^f9df9371]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study assessed and compared the safety of 2 febrile neutropenia treatment strategies in patients with AML or MDS undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. The results of this large retrospective comparative cohort study strongly suggest that the short-course EBAT strategy does not result in a higher risk for an SMC compared to a strategy where EBAT is continued until neutrophil recovery. Also, the number of patients that died in the 30 days after the start of chemotherapy and in whom death was considered infection related was low in both groups. Compared with the long-term EBAT strategy, the short-course strategy very significantly reduced the days that patients were receiving EBAT.

Recently, the How Long Trial demonstrated the safety of stopping empirical EBAT when neutropenic patients have been afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 72 h, compared to the continuation of EBAT until recovery from neutropenia. Also, a small prospective observational study described the apparent safety of stopping EBAT on day 5 regardless of fever or neutropenia resolution. The approach we describe here confirms these observations while going one step further. Indeed, it strongly suggests that EBAT can already be discontinued safely after 72 h and regardless of the resolution of fever as long as no infection was documented clinically or microbiologically. Compared with a strategy where EBAT is continued until neutrophil recovery, the 72 h approach led to a substantial 10-day decrease in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. This increase in antibiotic-free days is substantially higher than the 2.4 days observed in the How Long Trial.

It is clear that a reduction in the number of days on EBAT has several advantages. It reduces the risk for colonization (and subsequent infection) with resistant gram-negative and positive bacteria. Secondly, antibiotic therapy is not without direct or indirect side-effects, which occasionally can be life-threatening (e.g. pseudomembranous colitis). Finally, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy impacts the gut microbiome, which has been associated with a poorer outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations due to a higher risk of graft-versus-host-disease. Furthermore, longer exposure to EBAT can cause selection of certain bacterial taxa in the microbiome (mostly enterococci), to the disadvantage of some protective clostridiales. This dysbiosis might increase the risk of bacterial translocation and bacteremia.

### Seven versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in intensive care unit patients (OPTIMISE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial [^1ff7684b]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Shorter courses of antimicrobial therapy have been shown to be non-inferior to longer durations for the management of several infections. However, data on critically ill patients with severe infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) are scarce. In the duratiOn of theraPy in severe infecTIons by MultIdrug-reSistant gram-nEgative bacteria (OPTIMISE) trial, we assessed the non-inferiority of 7-day versus 14-day antimicrobial therapy for patients with intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired severe infections by MDR-GNB.

Methods

This was a randomised multicenter, open-label, parallel controlled, non-inferiority trial. Adult patients with severe infections by MDR-GNB initiated ≥ 48 h of ICU admission were eligible if they were hemodynamically stable and without fever > 48 h on the 7th day of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Patients were 1:1 randomised to discontinue antimicrobial therapy on the 7th (± 1) day or to continue for a total of 14 (± 1) days. The primary outcome was clinical failure, defined as death or relapse of infection within 28 days of randomisation. An upper edge of the two-tailed 95% confidence interval (CI) of the delta between the clinical failure rate in the 7- and the 14-day lower than 10% in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses was set as the non-inferiority criteria.

Results

A total of 106 patients composed the ITT population: 59 and 47 allocated to 7- and 14-day groups, respectively. The PP population included 75 patients: 47 and 28 in the 7- and 14-day groups, respectively. Clinical failure occurred in 42.4% and 44.7% of the ITT population in 7- and 14-day groups, respectively, (risk difference (RD) − 2.3, 95%CI − 21.3 to 16.7), and in 46.8% and 50.0% of the PP population in 7- and 14-day groups, respectively (RD − 3.2, 95%CI − 26.6 to 20.2). Most infections were of the respiratory tract (73/68.9%) and caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (42/39.6%). The study was interrupted before reaching planned sample size due to low recruitment rate.

Conclusion

The OPTIMISE trial could not determine the non-inferiority of 7-day compared to 14-day therapy for severe infections caused by MDR-GNB due to early termination related to the low recruitment rate.

Discussion

The management of febrile neutropenia in HSCT recipients remains challenging as there are many possible infectious and noninfectious causes for fever in these patients. In view of rising antimicrobial resistance in hematology patients, ECIL issued guidelines in 2011 introducing the concept of escalation/de-escalation of empirical therapy and suggesting discontinuation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy under certain conditions, which has been confirmed safe in several recent publications. Compliance with these recommendations has never been assessed and this survey was performed to quantify their current implementation rate in EBMT centers. In the survey there were no specifications made about circumstances or timing in the transplant journey, but typically questions on febrile neutropenia involve mainly pre-engraftment period. The rate of response to this questionnaire was similar to prior surveys. It demonstrated important discrepancies between guidelines and practices that should be addressed in order to optimize antimicrobial therapy and diminish development of resistance. Local definitions for fever, neutrophil cutoff and interpretation of clinical status of the patient (stable versus severe presentation) were used. This might cause some limitations to the interpretation of the data, but on the other hand represents the real world situation where definitions and practices might differ between centers and even between single clinicians within a center.

ECIL guidelines recommend an escalation approach, meaning monotherapy with noncarbapenem beta-lactams in stable patients without history of colonization/infection with resistant bacteria. Still, a third of centers use empirical combination therapy in first line and 10% use carbapenems. This finding does not correlate with geographical location and cannot be explained solely by epidemiological presence of multidrug resistant bacteria. Centers using empirical combination therapy and/or carbapenems often did not define themselves as using a de-escalation approach, indicating the need for education on escalation/de-escalation principles.

Streamlining of initial combination therapy is recommended after 72 h, including discontinuation of combination therapy if resistant bacteria were not cultured. However, only a third of centers using combination therapy, de-escalate within 3 days and SE centers are more likely to extend combination therapy for more than 10 days. Although timing of de-escalation depends on speed of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the large majority of centers (79.7% of total and 84.1% of SE centers) noted swift reporting of resistance figures. In case of positive blood cultures with a susceptible pathogen, many centers do not de-escalate, indicating clinicians may not feel confident enough in results of susceptibility testing and/or fear a decline after de-escalation.

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: the SAFER randomized clinical trial [^05f9c651]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common occurrence in childhood; consequently, evidence-based recommendations for its treatment are required.

Objective

To determine whether 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin for CAP was associated with noninferior rates of clinical cure compared with 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The SAFER (Short-Course Antimicrobial Therapy for Pediatric Respiratory Infections) study was a 2-center, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial consisting of a single-center pilot study from December 1, 2012, to March 31, 2014, and the follow-up main study from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019 at the emergency departments of McMaster Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Research staff, participants, and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Eligible children were aged 6 months to 10 years and had fever within 48 hours, respiratory symptoms, chest radiography findings consistent with pneumonia as per the emergency department physician, and a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. Children were excluded if they required hospitalization, had comorbidities that would predispose them to severe disease and/or pneumonia of unusual origin, or had previous β-lactam antibiotic therapy. Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 8, 2020.

Interventions

Five days of high-dose amoxicillin therapy followed by 5 days of placebo (intervention group) vs 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin followed by a different formulation of 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin (control group).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days.

Results

Among the 281 participants, the median age was 2.6 (interquartile range, 1.6–4.9) years (160 boys [57.7%] of 279 with sex listed). Clinical cure was observed in 101 of 114 children (88.6%) in the intervention group and in 99 of 109 (90.8%) in the control group in per-protocol analysis (risk difference, -0.016; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.087). Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days was observed in 108 of 126 (85.7%) in the intervention group and in 106 of 126 (84.1%) in the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference, 0.023; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.061).

Conclusions and Relevance

Short-course antibiotic therapy appeared to be comparable to standard care for the treatment of previously healthy children with CAP not requiring hospitalization. Clinical practice guidelines should consider recommending 5 days of amoxicillin for pediatric pneumonia management in accordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles.

Regarding specific circumstances for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (antibiotic therapy, modification and discontinuation), ASCO 2023 guidelines recommend to discontinue double coverage for Gram-negative infection or empiric glycopeptide (if initiated) after 24–72 hours in patients responding to initial empiric antibacterial therapy, if there is no specific microbiologic indication to continue combination therapy.

### Seven versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in intensive care unit patients (OPTIMISE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial [^1272b1ba]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this open-label, randomised clinical trial, it was not feasible to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 7 days compared to 14 days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of severe infections by MDR-GNB in critically ill patients who were afebrile and haemodynamic stable on the 7th day of therapy. Although rates of clinical failure were similar in 7- and 14-days groups, the upper limits of the 95% CI of the risk differences were higher than the pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority of 10% in both ITT (16.7%) and PP (20.2%) analyses. Each component of the composite outcome rates separately were also similar between groups. Unfortunately, the study had to be interrupted without reaching the planned sample size, a fact that made this study underpowered to meet the non-inferiority criteria.

### Seven versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in intensive care unit patients (OPTIMISE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial [^e72f69b2]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Similar rates of clinical failure were also found in the prespecified subgroups. Of note, clinical failure and mortality rates were numerically lower in the 7-day compared to 14-day arm, while relapse was in the opposite direction. This finding was likely related to the naturally longer time at risk for relapse in the 7-day arm, which falsely inflated the relapse differences between arms. Moreover, as observed in previous trials, these relapses were not associated with increased mortality, which corroborates this hypothesis. The statistically significant finding of lower rate of clinical failure in the 7-day arm in the prespecified subgroup of patients with P. aeruginosa infections of the PP population was based on a very low number of events, which makes it a fragile association. Likewise, the statistical significance found in the number of other GNB infections in the favouring the 14-day group in the PP population should be interpreted with caution, because there was only one event in this group, which was much lower than the number observed in the ITT population in which no significantly difference was observed, and, in contrast to the component of the primary outcome, relapse of MDR-GNB infections, these other GNB infections were not adjudicated by blinded infectious diseases physicians. Noteworthy, there were higher proportions of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in the 7-day group, which could have adversely impacted on the outcomes of this group. Despite of some differences in the proportion of sites of infection theoretically favouring the 14-day group, this has not affected the overall findings since the proportion of patients with sites of infection with high- and low-risk for mortality (76.2% and 72.3% of high-risk sites in 7- and 14-day groups respectively, were similar, and there were non-statistically significant differences in clinical failure rates in these subgroups.

### Progress in the fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria 2005–2016: modern noninferiority trial designs enable antibiotic development in advance of epidemic bacterial resistance [^a2ffb8e0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Points of Concern With Noninferiority Trials

Because success for noninferiority designs follows when a difference is not found, such trials are at risk of generating invalid conclusions due to experimental noise from patient heterogeneity, inclusion of patients lacking the target disease, poor adherence to study procedures, and/or use of ill-defined, nonstandardized endpoints. Such risks can largely be mitigated with careful trial design and implementation, which have been the focus of recent regulatory guidance. Further, efficacy analyses performed on a prespecified smaller population of treated patients focused on those with the prespecified pathogens of interest and without treatment confounders (such as excessive use of potentially efficacious prior antibiotics) also help to reduce the influence of experimental noise.

Although the term noninferiority might suggest the possibility of accepting inferior efficacy relative to the control, this risk is small when the design features previously outlined have been addressed. Uncertainty can be further reduced by demonstrating noninferiority in a second trial or by providing strong data on the pharmacological basis of activity.

One additional prominent concern has been the theoretical risk of "biocreep", wherein use of successively less efficacious comparator agents results in a sequential degradation of the acceptable efficacy of a new antibiotic. To preclude unwarranted complacency, this issue must remain front and center for drug development. It can be mitigated by ensuring there is always a review of the efficacy of the comparator for a trial as well as use of a comparator judged to be comparable to the best available agents for the given syndrome, and with a demonstrable benefit over no treatment or placebo. It is noteworthy that a number of recent noninferiority trials have in fact shown that inferior or reduced activity is detected by modern noninferiority trial designs.

### Optimal dosing of antibiotics in critically ill patients by using continuous / extended infusions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e6c53065]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The strengths of our study include the use of rigorous systematic review and meta-analytic methods consistent with PRISMA guidelines, including a reproducible and comprehensive literature-search strategy without language restrictions, clearly defined inclusion criteria, duplicate citation review, data abstraction, and quality assessment of individual studies, and a predefined statistical-analysis plan. Our meta-analysis also included more studies of critically ill patients: previous meta-analyses included only five to seven studies enrolling primarily critically ill patients, of which only two to six were RCTs, whereas our meta-analysis included 26 studies enrolling primarily critically ill patients, of which 13 were RCTs.

Our study also has limitations. The numbers of patients enrolled in the selected studies were relatively small, and most of the RCTs were unblinded and single center, with only a minority reporting on quality indicators, such as allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, and losses to follow-up after randomization. This makes further subgroup analysis not useful, given the small sample size in each study and the types of studies. To be comprehensive, we included all antibacterials, all study types, and all dosages of antibiotics and also studies targeting different PD end points, which resulted in clinical heterogeneity among included studies. Surprisingly, the pooled results, at least among RCTs, demonstrated no statistical heterogeneity; however, tests for heterogeneity have lower statistical power when the number of trials is small. Clinical cure is a subjective outcome that was defined by each study's authors, and potentially subject to bias, given that the studies were mainly unblinded, and the microbiologic causes of infections were different, and appropriateness of empiric antibiotics, a key determinant of outcomes, was not reported. Even a moderately sized additional RCT could negate the statistically significant improvement in this outcome. For example, a recently completed blinded placebo-controlled RCT in critically ill patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, which did not meet our inclusion criteria because it compared two different antibiotics for different durations of therapy (extended (4-hour) dose doripenem for 7 days versus intermittent dose imipenem/cilastatin for 10 days), found higher clinical failure rates in the extended-dose doripenem group (43/79 (54%) versus 38/88 (43%)). Adding data from this trial to our pooled result would make the improved clinical failure rates among the continuous/extended RCTs no longer statistically significant: eight RCTs, n = 732; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.15; P = 0.24. It would also eliminate statistically significant mortality improvements in the subgroup of extended-infusion cohort studies, and the subgroup of carbapenem studies.

### Comparative study of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the empiric treatment of pediatric cancer patients with fever and neutropenia [^7b2ff122]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

In view of the recent trend toward monotherapy in the treatment of bacterial infection, we evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of cefepime vs. ceftazidime for the empiric treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic pediatric cancer patients.

Methods

In a single site, open label study, 104 neutropenic pediatric cancer patients [96% with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of < 500 neutrophils/mm3] with a median age of 6 years were randomized (1:1) to receive either intravenous cefepime or ceftazidime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h; ≤ 6 g/day) for empiric treatment of fever (temperature > 38.0 degrees C occurring at least twice in 24 h, or single > 38.5 degrees C). Febrile episodes were classified as either microbiologically or clinically documented infection or fever of unknown origin. Therapy continued until the ANC was ≥ 1,000 neutrophils/mm3 or there was an increasing ANC in low risk patients (maximum duration of treatment, 8 weeks). The primary efficacy endpoints assessed were clinical and microbiologic response to assigned drug therapy. Secondary outcome measures were rate of early discontinuation of study drug and use of concomitant antibiotic therapy to modify initial study drug regimen.

Results

Of 68 patients who could be evaluated for efficacy, 74% (26 of 35) of cefepime-treated patients and 70% (23 of 33) of ceftazidime-treated patients responded to treatment. The small number of study patients precluded statistical analysis of results. In a modified intent-to-treat analysis, 59% of the patients treated with cefepime and 47% of ceftazidime-treated patients responded to therapy. Cefepime patients developed fewer new infections than ceftazidime patients (9% vs. 21%, respectively) and early discontinuation of study drug therapy occurred slightly more often in the ceftazidime group. Further, the use of concomitant systemic antimicrobial therapy (mostly vancomycin) occurred less often in the cefepime-treated patients, as compared with the ceftazidime group [35% [17 of 49] vs. 44% (24 of 55), respectively]. No deaths or serious adverse events were considered to be related to study therapy. The most frequent adverse event was rash that was moderate in severity, and it occurred equally in both groups.

Conclusion

Cefepime appears to be safe and effective compared with ceftazidime for initial empiric therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic pediatric cancer patients.

Recently, shorter courses based on favourable clinical response in the first days of therapy was found to be non-inferior to standard recommendations in critically ill patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, with reduced exposure to antimicrobials, suggesting that this strategy may be effective and safe in critically ill patients with severe infections, if signs of clinical response to therapy are present. The duratiOn of theraPy in severe infecTIons by MultIdrug-reSistant gram-nEgative bacteria (OPTIMISE) trial accessed the non-inferiority of 7 versus 14 days of antimicrobial therapy for severe infections by MDR-GNB in ICU patients who were hemodynamically stable and afebrile on the 7th day of appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Management of patients with fever and neutropenia through the arc of time: a narrative review [^a4697c9e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between fever and neutropenia and the risk for life-threatening infections in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy has been known for 50 years. Indeed, infectious complications have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. This review chronicles the progress in defining and developing approaches to the management of fever and neutropenia through observational and controlled clinical trials done by single institutions, as well as by national and international collaborative groups. The resultant data have led to recommendations and guidelines from professional societies and frame the current principles of management. Recommendations include those guiding new treatment options (from monotherapy to oral antibiotic therapy) and use of prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in high-risk patients. Of note, risk factors have changed with the advent of hematopoietic cytokines (especially granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in shortening the duration of neutropenia, as well as with the discovery of more targeted cancer treatments that do not result in cytotoxicity, although these are still the exception. Most guiding principles that were developed decades ago-about when to begin empirical treatment after a neutropenic patient becomes febrile, whether and how to modify the initial treatment regimen (especially in patients with protracted neutropenia), and how long to continue antimicrobial therapy-are still used today. This review describes how the treatment principles related to the management of fever and neutropenia have responded to changes in the patients at risk, the microbes responsible, and the tools for their treatment, while still being sustained over the arc of time.

### Can mortality of cancer patients with fever and neutropenia be improved? [^5fda0771]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neutropenic fever is the most common infective complication in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, and may result in severe sepsis, septic shock and mortality. Advancements in approaches to empiric antimicrobial therapy and prophylaxis have resulted in improved outcomes. Mortality may, however, still be as high as 50% in high-risk cancer populations. The objective of this review is to summarize factors associated with reduced mortality in patients with neutropenic fever, highlighting components of clinical care with potential for inclusion in quality improvement programs.

Recent Findings

Risks for mortality are multifactorial, and include patient, disease and treatment-related factors. Historically, guidelines for management of neutropenic fever have focused upon antimicrobial therapy. There is, however, a recognized need for early identification of sepsis to enable timely administration of antibiotic therapy and for this to be integrated with a whole of systems approach within healthcare facilities. Use of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria is beneficial, but validation is required in neutropenic fever populations.

Summary

In the context of emerging and increasing infections because of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in patients with neutropenic fever, quality improvement initiatives to reduce mortality must encompass antimicrobial stewardship, early detection of sepsis, and use of valid tools for clinical assessment. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin hold potential for inclusion into clinical pathways for management of neutropenic fever.

### New approaches to management of fever and neutropenia in high-risk patients [^6da4a137]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients receiving treatment for acute leukaemia and haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have prolonged neutropenia and are at high risk of neutropenic fever, with bacterial and particularly invasive fungal infections as feared complications, possessing potentially serious consequences including intensive care admission and mortality. Concerns for these serious complications often lead to long durations of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and escalation to even broader therapy if fever persists. Further, the default approach is to continue neutropenic fever therapy until count recovery, leaving many patients who have long defervesced on prolonged antibiotics.

Recent Findings

This article details recent progress in this field with particular emphasis on early discontinuation studies in resolved neutropenic fever and improved imaging techniques for the investigation of those with persistent neutropenic fever. Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that early cessation of empiric neutropenic fever therapy is well tolerated in acute leukaemia and autologous HCT patients who are clinically stable and afebrile for 72h. Delineation of the best approach to cessation (timing and/or use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis) and whether this approach is well tolerated in the higher risk allogeneic HCT setting is still required. Recent RCT data demonstrate utility of FDG-PET/CT to guide management and rationalize antimicrobial therapy in high-risk patient groups with persistent neutropenic fever.

Summary

Acute leukaemic and autologous HCT patients with resolved neutropenic fever prior to count recovery can have empiric therapy safely discontinued or de-escalated. There is an emerging role of FDG-PET/CT to support decision-making about antibiotic and antifungal use in high-risk persistent/recurrent neutropenic fever patients.
