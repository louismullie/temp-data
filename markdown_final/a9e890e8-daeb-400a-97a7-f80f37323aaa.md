## Question

Can furosemide be used in a patient with a sulfa allergy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether furosemide can be used safely in a patient with a sulfonamide ("sulfa") antibiotic allergy, and how to approach risk stratification and alternatives if needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chemical distinction between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotic sulfonamides like furosemide. Then, I should verify the immunologic rationale for cross-reactivity or lack thereof. Next, I will review the highest-quality clinical evidence on real-world risk. After that, I need to check what major guidelines and professional societies say. I will then examine exceptions, case reports, and labeling language that might contradict the general principle. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and alternatives, and ensure I have not overlooked any contraindications unrelated to sulfa allergy, such as anuria or prior furosemide hypersensitivity.

> Let me first confirm the chemical distinction, because mechanistic plausibility matters here. Sulfonamide antibiotics are arylamine sulfonamides with an N1 heterocyclic ring and an N4 arylamine, both of which are key immunogenic determinants; by contrast, furosemide is a non-arylamine sulfonamide lacking these structural features, which makes true immunologic cross-reactivity biologically unlikely, although not absolutely impossible in rare idiosyncratic contexts [^114YeJg8] [^116iyDpN].

> Wait, let me verify the immunologic rationale more carefully. The N₁ heterocycle is implicated in immediate IgE-mediated reactions, and the N₄ arylamine is linked to delayed cytotoxic and T-cell–mediated hypersensitivity. Furosemide lacks both, and T-cell clones reactive to sulfamethoxazole have not shown cross-reactivity with furosemide in experimental systems, which supports the structural argument for low cross-reactivity risk [^116QLVcX] [^116iyDpN].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality clinical evidence. The NEJM retrospective cohort of 969 patients with prior sulfonamide antibiotic hypersensitivity found that subsequent reactions to sulfonamide non-antibiotics were only modestly elevated and were better explained by a general predisposition to drug allergy rather than true cross-reactivity; importantly, the risk of reaction to penicillin was higher than to non-antibiotic sulfonamides, arguing against a sulfonamide-specific cross-reactivity signal [^116f8ki7].

> I will now examine supportive clinical data. In a series of 83 patients with sulfonamide allergy who received furosemide for diuretic renography, only two minor rashes occurred and there were no serious reactions, suggesting an extremely low risk signal in real-world practice, although I should note the observational design and relatively small numbers [^114pMG8X]. A separate retrospective series of patients with self-reported sulfa allergy treated with furosemide for intracranial hypertension likewise found no unpredictable allergic cross-reactions, which aligns with the low-risk interpretation [^116f8ki7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check what guidelines say. Contemporary allergy practice parameters conclude that cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotic sulfonamides is unlikely, and they support individualized risk assessment rather than blanket avoidance, which applies to loop diuretics like furosemide as well as other non-antibiotic sulfonamides [^111jVKfp]. Nuclear medicine society guidance for diuretic renography explicitly notes that furosemide lacks the N1/N4 determinants and that cross-reactivity is not expected, with thousands of administrations reported without allergic responses in this context [^114YeJg8].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions or conflicting signals. There are rare case reports of loop diuretic–associated pancreatitis in patients with sulfonamide antibiotic allergy, including a probable case with furosemide and rechallenges with other loop agents; these are hypothesis-generating and may reflect individual predisposition rather than class cross-reactivity, so I should not overgeneralize from them [^111eFZdP]. I should also double-check labeling language: FDA labeling for furosemide includes a generic caution that patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to furosemide, which is conservative and not inconsistent with a very low absolute risk; this means I need to document informed consent and monitor closely when using furosemide in this setting [^112fQAgQ] [^111d5EkJ].

> Let me consider risk stratification, because not all "sulfa" histories are equal. For patients with remote, benign cutaneous reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics, the risk appears very low and many can receive furosemide with routine monitoring; for those with recent or severe cutaneous adverse reactions, or with a documented furosemide allergy, caution is warranted and an alternative loop agent may be preferred; for anaphylaxis or SCARs to sulfonamide antibiotics, I should avoid furosemide and choose a non-sulfonamide alternative such as ethacrynic acid, which has been used successfully in imaging protocols when a sulfonamide-free diuretic is needed [^115o1Jss].

> I should confirm absolute contraindications unrelated to sulfa allergy so I don't conflate issues. Furosemide is contraindicated in anuria and in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to furosemide itself, so I need to screen for these before prescribing regardless of sulfa status [^1143UZ8K] [^113RFydL].

> Next, I should review practical administration and monitoring. If proceeding, I will start with a standard dose, observe for the first hour for any immediate reaction, and counsel on delayed rashes that can occur over the next several days. I will also monitor electrolytes, renal function, and volume status given furosemide's predictable adverse effects, and I will document the rationale for use and the patient's informed consent acknowledging the low but nonzero risk [^112fQAgQ] [^115mYtcS].

> Let me synthesize the conclusion. Yes, furosemide can generally be used in patients with a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy because cross-reactivity is unlikely based on structural differences and supported by large clinical data, with a very low observed reaction rate in exposed patients. However, I need to individualize risk based on the severity and timing of the prior sulfonamide reaction, avoid use if there was a life-threatening reaction or a documented furosemide allergy, and consider ethacrynic acid when a sulfonamide-free loop diuretic is preferred, documenting the rationale and monitoring carefully [^117W356d] [^111jVKfp] [^115o1Jss].

---

In general, **furosemide can be used in patients with a sulfa allergy** because cross-reactivity is low (about 2–3%) and is typically mild, such as a rash [^117W356d] [^114pMG8X]. However, **avoid furosemide in patients with severe sulfa reactions** (anaphylaxis, SJS/TEN) and consider ethacrynic acid or potassium-sparing diuretics instead [^115o1Jss]. If furosemide is necessary, monitor closely for hypersensitivity and use caution in patients with multiple drug allergies or severe reactions [^111d5EkJ] [^117W356d].

---

## Chemical structure and cross-reactivity

Furosemide contains a **sulfonamide moiety**, but lacks the N₁ heterocyclic ring and N₄ arylamine that drive IgE-mediated reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics; therefore, cross-reactivity is unlikely [^114YeJg8] [^111jVKfp]. The **risk of cross-reactivity** is about 2–3% and is usually mild (rash), whereas severe reactions (anaphylaxis, SJS/TEN) are rare [^117W356d] [^114pMG8X].

---

## Clinical evidence

- **Nuclear diuretic renography**: In 83 patients with sulfonamide allergy who received furosemide, only 2 had minor rashes; no serious reactions occurred [^114pMG8X].
- **Intracranial hypertension**: Among 21 patients with self-reported sulfa allergy treated with furosemide, no allergic cross-reactions were observed [^116f8ki7].
- **General population**: Large cohort data show no significant cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and nonantibiotic sulfonamides like furosemide [^117W356d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinion

Guidelines and expert reviews indicate that **cross-reactivity is unlikely** between sulfonamide antibiotics and nonantibiotic sulfonamides such as furosemide [^111jVKfp] [^114YeJg8]. Clinicians should **individualize decisions** based on reaction severity, timing, and patient-specific factors [^1125NNMY].

---

## Alternative diuretics

When furosemide is contraindicated, consider the following alternatives:

| **Diuretic class** | **Examples** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Loop diuretic (non-sulfonamide) | Ethacrynic acid | Preferred alternative in severe sulfa allergy |
| Potassium-sparing diuretics | - Spironolactone <br/> - Amiloride <br/> - Triamterene | Useful in heart failure, cirrhosis, and resistant hypertension |
| Thiazide diuretics | - Hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Chlorthalidone | Use cautiously; some cross-reactivity reported |

---

## Precautions and monitoring

- **Allergy history**: Document the specific sulfa reaction (type, severity, timing) [^113i3tBH].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for hypersensitivity reactions, especially with first dose [^112Txnhh].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about signs of allergic reactions and when to seek care [^112BrZov].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Furosemide can generally be used in patients with sulfa allergy, given the low risk of cross-reactivity; however, **avoid in severe reactions** (anaphylaxis, SJS/TEN) and use alternatives such as ethacrynic acid or potassium-sparing diuretics. If furosemide is used, monitor closely and tailor decisions to the patient's allergy history and risk profile [^117W356d] [^115o1Jss].

### Sulfonamide hypersensitivity [^111bnH7o]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sulfonamides, particularly antimicrobial sulfonamides, have been implicated as a common cause of a spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions. Immediate IgE-mediated reactions have been reported but are much less common than delayed cutaneous reactions. Delayed cutaneous reactions range from benign exanthems to severe cutaneous reactions such as Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Sulfonamides can be subclassified as antimicrobial sulfonamides and non-antimicrobial sulfonamides, which are also distinguished by key structural differences, resulting in very low risk of cross-reactivity between these two subclasses. Immediate and delayed skin testing and in vitro testing remain limited as options in evaluating antimicrobial sulfonamide hypersensitivity. Drug challenges continue to play an important role in the evaluation of both immediate and delayed reactions, with a growing body of evidence for the safety of direct challenges regardless of human immunodeficiency virus infection status. While numerous "desensitization" protocols have been described for the management of antimicrobial sulfonamide hypersensitivity, there is limited evidence that such procedures are successful because of an induction of tolerance.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to non-β-lactam antibiotics [^113WTzn9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

As alternatives to beta lactam antibiotics continue to be developed, an increasing number of patients are experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to these agents. Unfortunately, unlike penicillin, there are no validated skin testing reagents to aid in confirming the presence of specific IgE antibodies to these drugs. This review summarizes what is known about hypersensitivity reactions to non-beta lactam antibiotics, and includes practical approaches to readministering these drugs in selected situations. Sulfonamides, vancomycin, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and anti-virals are included in the discussion.

### Probable loop diuretic-induced pancreatitis in a sulfonamide-allergic patient [^111eFZdP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the case of a patient with a prior allergy to a sulfonamide antibiotic who subsequently developed the same reaction when administered various loop diuretics.

Case Summary

A 57-year-old female with cardiomyopathy and "sulfa" (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) allergy documented as pancreatitis presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis after use of furosemide. She subsequently developed similar symptoms after multiple rechallenges with various loop diuretics including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide. The patient was placed on ethacrynic acid until she was desensitized to furosemide. She had been receiving oral furosemide for 5 months at the time of this report, with no complications. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this reaction was probable.

Discussion

Reactions associated with arylamine sulfonamide-containing antibiotics have been commonly reported; however, cross-reactions with non-arylamine sulfonamide-containing medications have been rare. The time delay by which symptoms of pancreatitis presented following administration of loop diuretics suggests an immunologic pathway. In addition, while cases of loop diuretic-induced pancreatitis, including furosemide, have been published, the allergic manifestations with both sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotics in our patient suggest possible cross-reactivity between these 2 drug classes.

Conclusions

The mechanism by which loop diuretics induce pancreatitis appears to be via an immunologic pathway. While the true correlation remains unknown, allergic cross-reactivity may occur between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotics, such as loop diuretics. Torsemide appears to also be a part of a long list of agents that can cause pancreatitis.

5.6 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with TAF-containing products; while most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events, it is also possible these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir-related adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. SYMTUZA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute.

Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions.

Prior to or when initiating SYMTUZA and during treatment with SYMTUZA, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue SYMTUZA in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome.

Cobicistat, a component of SYMTUZA, produces elevations of serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration. This effect should be considered when interpreting changes in estimated creatinine clearance in patients initiating SYMTUZA, particularly in patients with medical conditions or receiving drugs needing monitoring with estimated creatinine clearance. The elevation is typically seen within 2 weeks of starting therapy and is reversible after discontinuation. Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg/dL should be closely monitored for renal safety.

5.7 Sulfa Allergy

Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Monitor patients with a known sulfonamide allergy after initiating SYMTUZA. In clinical studies with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy.

Methods

Methods

We included inpatients that were admitted to the hospital for a kidney biopsy with a clinical indication (allograft and native). Patients were admitted to the nephrology ward at the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia Ignacio Chavez. Patients needed to be older than 18 years, had a creatinine eGFR ≥ 15 ml/min by CKD-EPI and had to be hemodynamically stable. Subjects were excluded if they did not accept to participate in the study or if the medical team did not feel the patient was suitable for the study, if they had a known allergy to furosemide, were on renal replacement therapy or were pregnant (Fig. 1). The study was conducted between April 2015 and August 2017.

### Metolazone (zaroxolyn) [^115aZFc5]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Rapid Onset Hyponatremia And/Or Hypokalemia

Rarely, the rapid onset of severe hyponatremia and/or hypokalemia has been reported following initial doses of thiazide and non-thiazide diuretics. When symptoms consistent with severe electrolyte imbalance appear rapidly, drug should be discontinued and supportive measures should be initiated immediately. Parenteral electrolytes may be required. Appropriateness of therapy with this class of drugs should be carefully reevaluated.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia may occur with consequent weakness, cramps, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Serum potassium should be determined at regular and appropriate intervals, and dose reduction, potassium supplementation or addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic instituted whenever indicated. Hypokalemia is a particular hazard in patients who are digitalized or who have or have had a ventricular arrhythmia; dangerous or fatal arrhythmias may be precipitated. Hypokalemia is dose related.

Concomitant Therapy

Lithium

In general, diuretics should not be given concomitantly with lithium because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read prescribing information for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.

Furosemide

Unusually large or prolonged losses of fluids and electrolytes may result when ZAROXOLYN is administered concomitantly to patients receiving furosemide (see). PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions

Other Antihypertensive Drugs

When ZAROXOLYN is used with other antihypertensive drugs, particular care must be taken to avoid excessive reduction of blood pressure, especially during initial therapy.

Cross-Allergy

Cross-allergy may occur when ZAROXOLYN is given to patients known to be allergic to sulfonamide-derived drugs, thiazides, or quinethazone.

Sensitivity Reactions

Sensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, bronchospasm) may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma and may occur with the first dose of ZAROXOLYN.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^112AkrE3]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

In a similar study, Wall et al. surveyed licensed pharmacists to evaluate their attitudes toward filling and dispensing four systemic NAS in hypothetical patients with SA allergy. Although the authors did not include a scenario with any ophthalmic CAI, between 40% to 85% of the respondents would not fill and dispense NAS in these patients, with the highest rate corresponding to zonisamide, an oral CAI sulfonamide.

The concern surrounding the potential cross-reactivity between SA and NAS appears to stem from a 1955 report of Moseley and Baroody on the use of oral acetazolamide as a diuretic in oedematous patients mostly due to cardiac aetiology. The authors postulated a potential cross-reaction in one patient with history of valvuloplasty due to mitral stenosis and self-reported "sulfa" allergy who developed respiratory distress, limbs oedema, and haemoglobinuria two days after re-administering 250 mg/day of acetazolamide for the treatment of congestive heart failure. As later observed by Stock, these symptoms cited as an allergic reaction could be attributable to the patient's worsening congestive heart failure status, considering acetazolamide's weak diuretic action. Subsequently, only four more cases hypothesizing possible cross-reactivity with acetazolamide have been reported since this drug was approved in 1953. None of these cases clearly stated a history of SA hypersensitivity in the affected patient, and only one underwent a skin test which was positive for an unspecified sulfonamide solution. In contrast, a recent series showed no allergic reactions after acetazolamide was administered in three patients with a self-reported history of severe SA rash. Moreover, a single-masked study, found no cross-reactivity between SA and NAS, after skin test and controlled oral challenge test were performed in 28 patients with history of SA-induced fixed drug eruption.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^1123i26U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of Bumex should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of Bumex administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to Bumex.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### Sulfonamide hypersensitivity: fact and fiction [^1125NNMY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Sulfonamide antimicrobials are commonly reported as causing drug allergy and have been implicated in a variety of hypersensitivity reactions including immediate IgE-mediated reactions, benign T-cell-mediated rashes, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Cross-reactivity is unlikely between sulfonamide antimicrobials and sulfonamide non-antimicrobials. In patients who develop reactions to a sulfonamide non-antimicrobial, there is no evidence to suggest that sulfonamide antimicrobials and other sulfonamide non-antimicrobials would cross-react. Although immediate skin testing can be performed in patients with histories of immediate reactions, they are infrequently positive and wane over time. Delayed skin testing including patch tests to sulfonamides is rarely positive. Drug challenges are a useful tool for patients with both immediate and delayed reactions to sulfonamides. The role of sulfamethoxazole desensitization is controversial as rates of hypersensitivity reactions are similar between desensitization and drug challenge.

### Sulfonamide cross-reactivity: fact or fiction? [^112azXXe]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a critical and comprehensive review of the literature, specifically case reports and observational studies used to support the concept of cross-reactivity between sulfonylarylamines and non-sulfonylarylamines.

Data Sources

A list of medications was formulated from several different review articles. A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted (1966-March 2004) using the individual medications and the MeSH terms of drug hypersensitivity/etiology, sulfonamides/adverse effects, and/or cross-reaction.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A critical review of the methodology and conclusions for each article found in the search was conducted. The manufacturer's package insert (MPI) for each drug was examined for a statement concerning possible cross-reactivity in patients with a sulfonamide allergy. If indicated, the manufacturers were contacted to obtain any clinical data supporting the statement.

Data Synthesis

A total of 33 medications were identified. Seventeen (51.5%) of the MPIs contained statements of varying degrees concerning use in patients with a "sulfonamide" allergy; 21 case series, case reports, and other articles were found.

Conclusions

After a thorough critique of the literature, it appears that the dogma of sulfonylarylamine cross-reactivity with non-sulfonylarylamines is not supported by the data. While many of the case reports on the surface support the concept of cross-reactivity, on closer examination the level of evidence in many of the cases does not conclusively support either a connection or an association between the observed cause and effect.

### Four nephrology myths debunked [^1155YNjD]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are many controversial topics relating to renal disease in hospitalized patients. The aim of this review is to shed light on some important and often debated issues. Hypothyroidism, unlike myxedema, is not a cause of hyponatremia (although it can be sometimes seen in conjunction with the latter) and additional investigations should be done to determine its etiology. Sodium bicarbonate is effective for treatment of hyperkalemia primarily by enhancing renal potassium elimination rather than by translocating potassium into cells. Acetaminophen can be a cause of metabolic acidosis by causing 5-oxoprolinuria. Furosemide (and sulfa containing diuretics) can safely be used in patients with an allergy to sulfa-containing antibiotics (SCA).

### Application of pharmacovigilance tools in a case of subacute anterior angle narrowing while under furosemide exposure [^1172k9i1]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Sulfonamides have been related to drug-induced acute angle closure of the eye, but scarce reports exist concerning furosemide. We describe the second case of acute chamber narrowing (ACN) during furosemide exposure. A 65-year-old man with a renal transplant presented with ACN, after 3months of furosemide intake. Finally, the patient required a bilateral iridotomy and right lens replacement. ACN has been associated with drugs containing sulfonamide derivatives, but an evaluation with pharmacovigilance scales for adverse drug reaction (ADR)-standardised causality assessment has not been provided. We use this case to illustrate how medicines and an ADR should be evaluated and reported. The spreading of pharmacovigilance information on what should be a rare and unexpected condition related to a drug could mean that other reports emerge about ADR with this drug and regulatory agencies perform consequently, as happened with topiramate.

Lithium

In general, diuretics should not be given concomitantly with lithium because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read prescribing information for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.

Furosemide

Unusually large or prolonged losses of fluids and electrolytes may result when metolazone tablets, are administered concomitantly to patients receiving furosemide (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Other Antihypertensive Drugs

When metolazone tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, particular care must be taken to avoid excessive reduction of blood pressure, especially during initial therapy.

Cross-Allergy

Cross-allergy may occur when metolazone tablets are given to patients known to be allergic to sulfonamide-derived drugs, thiazides, or quinethazone.

Sensitivity Reactions

Sensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, bronchospasm) may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma and may occur with the first dose of metolazone tablets.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^113YCcCv]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors — mechanism, agents, and use: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) are known to lower IOP by suppressing aqueous production through blockade of carbonic anhydrase in local tissues, increasing CO2 and/or lowering pH to result in vascular dilation and increased blood flow, and CAIs include acetazolamide, brinzolamide, dorzolamide HCL and methazolamide. Allergies and previous reactions to sulfa drugs may limit the use of CAIs; topical CAIs (e.g., dorzolamide, brinzolamide) have fewer systemic concerns and may be used as monotherapy, though they are most often used in combination with other glaucoma medications.

### Bumetanide [^112kSfdg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^112ZqBxv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Sulfonamide challenge or desensitization in patients without HIV — success rates and candidate profile: Multiple-step challenge or "desensitization" protocols all had high success rates from 93% to 98%. The largest study evaluated 195 patients (without HIV) who underwent a full-dose challenge (n = 173) or a 2-step challenge (n = 22), with a 95% success rate in the 1-step full-dose group compared with 86% in the 2-step group. Importantly, all of these studies excluded patients with histories of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). Based on these data, a 1-step full-dose challenge seems appropriate for the majority of patients with nonanaphylactic, benign cutaneous reactions that occurred > 5 years ago.

### Erythematous desquamating rash after initiation of chemotherapy [^115YERPt]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pseudoporphyria
B. Photo recall dermatitis
C. Drug-induced phototoxic reaction
D. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction
E. Polymorphous light eruption

Answers:
A. Pseudoporphyria – Incorrect. Pseudoporphyria is a drug induced form of porphyria cutanea tarda that presents with blisters and scarring on sun exposed areas, most commonly the dorsal hands. Blistering occurs quickly after sun exposure, not in the area of previously healed sunburn. Common drug triggers include: naproxen, thiazides, voriconazole, and furosemide.
B. Photo recall dermatitis – Correct. Photo recall dermatitis is an acute inflammatory reaction involving previously sunburned areas that can be triggered by drugs, most commonly chemotherapeutic agents. Patients present with varying degrees of erythema and ulceration in the areas of previous ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, with the potential of progression to necrosis. Her preceding severe sunburn acted as the initial trigger with subsequent chemotherapy driving the cutaneous reaction.
C. Drug-induced phototoxic reaction – Incorrect. Drug-induced phototoxic reactions can present similarly, with the development of confluent erythema and occasional edema, blistering, and desquamation following exposure to a phototoxic substance and UVR. However, phototoxicity usually occurs within 48 hours after the initial exposure to an offending agent, whereas our patient developed an ulcerating rash 2 weeks after initial UVR exposure.
D. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction – Incorrect. Drug-induced photoallergic reaction is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in previously sensitized individuals to the same substance. Patients often complain of itching rather than burning and present with red, scaly papules and plaques in sun-exposed areas.
E. Polymorphous light eruption – Incorrect. Polymorphous light eruptions present as erythematous papules, vesicles, and plaques in sun-exposed areas. This rash tends to present minutes to hours after exposure to UVR and would be less likely to present with erythematous patches in the absence of papulovesicular lesions.

### Presumed "sulfa allergy" in patients with intracranial hypertension treated with acetazolamide or furosemide: cross-reactivity, myth or reality? [^116f8ki7]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether acetazolamide or furosemide produce allergic cross-reactions in patients with self-reported "sulfa allergy".

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

A retrospective review included patients with intracranial hypertension and a self-reported sulfa allergy treated with either acetazolamide or furosemide seen at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from 1972 to 2003. All presumed medication-related side effects were collected, including both predictable adverse effects (for example, paresthesias, fatigue) and unpredictable adverse reactions (for example, cutaneous fixed eruptions, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, anaphylaxis).

Results

We reviewed 363 charts. Of these, 329 patients (91%) were excluded. Of the remaining 34 cases that did report a so-called sulfa allergy, 13 (38%) received acetazolamide alone, 7 (21%) received furosemide alone, and 14 (41%) received both acetazolamide and furosemide. Of the 27 patients who received acetazolamide, 10 (37%) had no documented allergic cross-reaction to sulfa, and 2 (7%) cases had urticaria. The remaining 15 (56%) of acetazolamide-treated patients experienced predictable adverse reactions for this drug (for example, paresthesias). No patient experienced a severe allergic cross-reaction to sulfa. Of 21 patients who received furosemide, no unpredictable adverse reactions or allergic cross-reactions to sulfa were noted.

Conclusions

We find little clinical or pharmacological evidence to suggest that a self-reported sulfa allergy is likely to produce a life-threatening cross-reaction with acetazolamide or furosemide. These medications should be considered for intracranial hypertension if the risk-to-benefit ratio warrants their use.

### Allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfur-containing drugs [^113i3tBH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a literature review and clinical summary of the evaluation and management of sulfonamide drug reactions.

Data Sources

Published English-language medical literature.

Study Selection

Selected trials of drug desensitization protocols.

Results

Obtaining a detailed history is invaluable in assessing a history of reactions to sulfonamide medications, because allergy to these drugs remains a clinical diagnosis at present. Numerous efficacious drug desensitization protocols for management have been published and are reviewed in detail.

Conclusions

The term sulfa allergy is imprecise and misleading and therefore should be discouraged. There are important distinctions between sulfonylarylamines (antimicrobial sulfonamides), nonarylamine (nonantimicrobial) sulfonamides, and sulfones, with regard to allergic and other adverse drug reactions. Most reactions to sulfonylarylamines probably result from multifactorial immunologic and toxic metabolic mechanisms, whereas less is known about the precise mechanisms of reactions to other sulfur-containing drugs.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^112BrZov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE

Sulfonamide antibiotics are commonly prescribed for the immunocompromised population as prophylaxis and directed therapy for opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii. Sulfonamide antibiotics are the second most frequently reported antibiotic allergy, with 3% to 8% of patients reporting a sulfonamide allergy. Sulfonamide antibiotics can cause immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions with various reaction severities. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is also one of the most prevalent causes of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug reaction eosinophilia and systemic syndrome. –

Although there is limited evidence on the cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics, it has been demonstrated that sulfonamide antimicrobials and sulfonamide nonantimicrobials are unlikely to cross-react due to differences in chemical structure, with the exception of sulfasalazine, a prodrug composed of 5-aminosalicylic acid linked to the sulfa antibiotic sulfapyridine. Sulfonamide antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions target N₁ (heterocyclic ring) or N₄ (an aromatic amine), absent in sulfonamide nonantibiotics.

Risk stratification approach

Historically, patients with sulfonamide allergy histories consistent with a potentially immediate or benign delayed hypersensitivity were managed with desensitization or induction of tolerance procedures. Although skin testing with the nonirritant concentration was possible, it rarely yielded positive tests, and the test characteristics remain unknown. In patients with low-risk sulfonamide antibiotic allergies, a direct TMP/SMX challenge was tolerated in more than 94%. One- or 2-step TMP/SMX challenges have been described with up to 97% resulting in label removal in patients with low-risk allergy histories. However, it is unclear which patient populations may benefit from different allergy investigations or treatments. An analysis of older adults across 5 US sites recently found a lower 88% prevalence of sulfonamide antibiotic allergy delabeling after allergy testing. Interestingly, all 5 patients confirmed TMP/SMX allergic had immediate reactions observed in the office, with 1 individual receiving intramuscular epinephrine for progressive urticaria. Another consideration with sulfonamide antibiotic allergy delabeling is that most incident reactions are commonly delayed phenotypes. As such, drug challenge studies that have followed up delabeled patients with retreatment courses suggest that as many as 30% of patients may have delayed rashes with a full course. Therefore, all sulfonamide antibiotic allergy evaluations must include education and patient counseling regarding delayed reactions that can occur with the following treatment course.

Diuretic renal scintigraphy — safety of furosemide notes that furosemide is a nonantibiotic sulfonamide and cross-reactivity with sulfonamide antibiotics is not expected because the immunologic determinant of IgE-mediated responses to sulfonamide antibiotics is the N1 heterocyclic ring, which is not present in nonantibiotic sulfonamides such as furosemide; the lack of cross-reactivity is supported by recent reviews, the risk of an allergic reaction after a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was higher among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillins than among those with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics, most prescribers do not view the use of sulfonamide nonantibiotics as problematic in the sulfonamide-allergic patient, most members of the standards/guideline committee do not check for a history of allergic reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics and administer furosemide as a bolus over a few seconds, and based on a combined experience of several thousand patients using this approach, no allergic responses to furosemide have been observed by the members of the writing committee.

### Metolazone tablets (mykrox tablets) [^111LNn9S]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Rapid Onset Hyponatremia and/or Hypokalemia

Rarely, the rapid onset of severe hyponatremia and/or hypokalemia has been reported following initial doses of thiazide and non-thiazide diuretics. When symptoms consistent with severe electrolyte imbalance appear rapidly, drug should be discontinued and supportive measures should be initiated immediately. Parenteral electrolytes may be required. Appropriateness of therapy with this class of drugs should be carefully reevaluated.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia may occur with consequent weakness, cramps, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Serum potassium should be determined at regular and appropriate intervals, and dose reduction, potassium supplementation or addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic instituted whenever indicated. Hypokalemia is a particular hazard in patients who are digitalized or who have or have had a ventricular arrhythmia; dangerous or fatal arrhythmias may be precipitated. Hypokalemia is dose related.

In controlled clinical trials, 1.5% of patients taking ½ mg and 3.1% of patients taking 1 mg of MYKROX daily developed clinical hypokalemia (defined as hypokalemia accompanied by signs or symptoms); 21% of the patients taking ½ mg and 30% of the patients taking 1 mg of MYKROX daily developed hypokalemia (defined as a serum potassium concentration below 3.5 mEq/L); in another controlled clinical trial in which the patients started therapy with a serum potassium level greater than 4.0 mEq/L, 8% of patients taking ½ mg of MYKROX daily developed hypokalemia (defined as a serum potassium concentration below 3.5 mEq/L).

Concomitant Therapy

Lithium

In general, diuretics should not be given concomitantly with lithium because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read prescribing information for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.

Furosemide

Unusually large or prolonged losses of fluids and electrolytes may result when metolazone is administered concomitantly to patients receiving furosemide (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Other Antihypertensive Drugs

When MYKROX Tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, particular care must be taken to avoid excessive reduction of blood pressure, especially during initial therapy.

Cross-Allergy

Cross-allergy may occur when MYKROX Tablets are given to patients known to be allergic to sulfonamide-derived drugs, thiazides, or quinethazone.

### Sulfonamide hypersensitivity [^113gA3gD]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Sulfonamide antibiotics can result in a wide variety of hypersensitivity reactions. No validated diagnostic tests are available for sulfonamide reactions; therefore, clinicians must rely on the combination of a careful patient history, review of medical records, and a sound knowledge base regarding the common clinical manifestations of sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions. Although HIV-infected individuals have a high risk for hypersensitivity reactions to sulfamethoxazole, readministering the drug can usually be performed safely by using a desensitization protocol. Sulfonamide-containing medications that are not antibiotics also have the capacity for causing hypersensitivity reactions. Whether the sulfa moiety confers a risk of cross-reaction is controversial. The preponderance of available evidence suggests that sulfonamide antibiotics probably do not cross-react with sulfonamide nonantibiotics.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^116iyDpN]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sulfonamide antimicrobials (SA) are one of the agents most frequently reported as causing drug hypersensitivity reactions. It has been estimated that 3–8% of patients exposed to these antimicrobials report an allergic drug reaction, although pharmacovigilance studies report that after complete investigation, true drug-hypersensitivity rate may be significantly overestimated. The term "sulfa allergy" was originally coined to refer to SA; however, it misleadingly became associated with any medications containing a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2), which is not sufficient by itself to trigger hypersensitivity. Two chemical structures in SA have been established as the antigenic determinants: a heterocyclic ring at the N 1 position and, most importantly, an arylamine moiety at the N 4 position of the benzene ring (Fig. 1). While the former directly elicits a type I Ig E-mediated hypersensitivity, the latter undergoes biotransformation into metabolites responsible for the non-type I hypersensitivity by direct cytotoxicity, humoral, or cellular responses.

Fig. 1
Sulfonamide antimicrobial molecular structure containing a sulfonamide group and N1 and N4 moieties, compared with commonly used ophthalmic CAIs.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, dorzolamide, and brinzolamide are nonantimicrobial non-arylamine sulfonamides (NAS) used in ophthalmology mainly in the management of glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Because none of these ophthalmic CAI possess the N₁ or N₄ moieties, a cross-reactivity between SA and CAI is unlikely. Observational studies have concluded that there is no compelling evidence to support cross-reactivity between SA and NAS. Evidence rather points toward an idiosyncratic predisposition to a multiple drug hypersensitivity syndrome. Nonetheless, cautionary warnings for sulfonamide hypersensitivity or cross-reactivity remain in ophthalmic CAI manufacturers' package inserts in several countries, including the United States.

To our knowledge, eyecare providers' practice patterns toward CAI prescription in SA-allergic patients have not been previously evaluated. We hypothesize that provider's characteristics might affect CAI prescription in these patients. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed members of four US eyecare organizations to assess respondents' attitudes toward CAI prescription in hypothetical SA-allergic patients with different types of hypersensitivity responses.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^115f6Qsz]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, there is a limited number of observational studies that have evaluated cross-reactivity between SA and NAS, although no large-sample size research has specifically addressed cross-reactivity with CAI. The most relevant one is the large retrospective cohort reported by Strom et al. in 2003 who assessed the risk of allergic reactions within 30 days after receiving NAS among more than 20,000 patients. Their outcomes suggested that, although SA hypersensitivity increased the risk of subsequent hypersensitivity to NAS, a history of penicillin hypersensitivity was at least an equally strong risk factor. Moreover, patients with SA hypersensitivity subsequently exposed to penicillin showed a higher risk of hypersensitivity compared to those who received NAS. The authors concluded that the initial association between SA and NAS appeared to be due to an individual predisposition to allergic reactions rather than to a sulfonamide cross-reactivity. A year later, Lee et al. found that 7% of patients who self-reported non-life-threatening SA hypersensitivity and received acetazolamide for intracranial hypertension experienced urticaria as the only allergic reaction after long-term follow-up. Most recently, Guedes et al. evaluated adverse events in patients with self-reported hypersensitivity to any sulfonamide-containing drugs who later received topical antiglaucoma drugs (CAI and non-CAI). They concluded that it may be safe to use topical CAI in patients with self-reported sulfa allergy because the rate of systemic reactions was not significantly different among topical medication classes. Like Strom, the authors suggested that patients with a history of any medication allergies may be more likely to develop allergic reactions to other, unrelated drug classes.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^112YPukD]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Given a hypothetical patient with a history of SA hypersensitivity in which no other clinical information was disclosed, 130 (52%) respondents would avoid prescribing oral CAI, if this was a mild cutaneous reaction, such as acute rash and/or urticaria (scenario 3). Years in practice was the only significant factor associated with a respondent's decision to avoid oral CAI in this scenario. Participants with more than 10 years in practice are more likely to avoid oral CAI in patients with SA-related rash and/or urticaria than those with 10 years or fewer in practice (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.35–3.84, p = 0.002) (Table 3). More than 90% of respondents would avoid oral CAI in patients with a history of SA-related anaphylaxis/angioedema or SA-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome, with no significant difference in the provider's characteristics.

An additional 8 subjects were found to have minimal erythema (rated as "very slight erythema) after completion of the infusion and removal of the infusion set and adhesive. One subject experienced "Well Defined Erythema" (Score 2) during IV administration. A total of 6 subjects were found to have minimal swelling during or following SC administration (maximum severity rate as "Very Slight Edema", Score 1). All events resolved shortly after SC furosemide administration without treatment or further complications.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^11278G3E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Potassium supplementation, either in the form of medication or as a diet rich in potassium, should not ordinarily be given in association with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Excessive potassium intake may cause hyperkalemia in patients receiving spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide (see PRECAUTIONS: General).

Concomitant administration of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide with the following drugs or potassium sources may lead to severe hyperkalemia:

other potassium-sparing diuretics
ACE inhibitors
angiotensin II receptor antagonists
aldosterone blockers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., indomethacin
heparin and low molecular weight heparin
other drugs or conditions known to cause hyperkalemia
potassium supplements
diet rich in potassium
salt substitutes containing potassium

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered concurrently with other potassium-sparing diuretics. Spironolactone, when used with ACE inhibitors or indomethacin, even in the presence of a diuretic, has been associated with severe hyperkalemia. Extreme caution should be exercised when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are given concomitantly with these drugs (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function because minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.

Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs.

Sensitivity reactions to thiazides may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.

Sulfonamide derivatives, including thiazides, have been reported to exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.

### A comprehensive review of sulfonamide hypersensitivity: implications for clinical practice [^112GcQVo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sulfonamides, which are drugs commonly prescribed in hospital and outpatient settings, have historically been associated with a high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. It is believed that there is an increased risk of cross-reactions with other drugs that contain this functional group in their structure. However, it has not been conclusively established that the sulfonamide group is the sole cause of hypersensitivity reactions, as non-antibiotic sulfonamides do not share the same accessory groups with antibiotic sulfonamides. Therefore, cross-reactivity between different types of sulfonamides and sulfonamide-type antibiotics is not clearly demonstrated, and allergic reactions may involve other mechanisms. Misinformation about this topic can lead to inappropriate use of alternative antibiotics with lower efficacy or higher adverse effects, contributing to antibiotic resistance. It is crucial to individualize and monitor patients with a history of allergies to sulfonamide-type antibiotics when introducing a new drug containing sulfa and manage any adverse reactions promptly. Desensitization protocols may be a viable option for patients who specifically benefit from these antibiotics, particularly those who are immunosuppressed. This article provides a descriptive bibliographic review to update information on sulfa allergy, its prevalence, management, and recommendations to prevent such reactions and optimize pharmacotherapy, without underusing these drugs.

See FDA-approved Patient Labeling (Patient Information)

17.1 Drug Interactions

A statement to patients and healthcare providers is included on the product's bottle label: ALERT: Find out about medicines that should NOT be taken with LEXIVA.

LEXIVA may interact with many drugs; therefore, patients should be advised to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products, particularly St. John's wort.

Patients receiving PDE5 inhibitors should be advised that they may be at an increased risk of PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism, and should promptly report any symptoms to their healthcare provider.

Patients receiving hormonal contraceptives should be instructed to use alternate contraceptive measures during therapy with LEXIVA because hormonal levels may be altered, and if used in combination with LEXIVA and ritonavir, liver enzyme elevations may occur.

17.2 Sulfa Allergy

Patients should inform their healthcare provider if they have a sulfa allergy. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown.

17.3 Redistribution/Accumulation of Body Fat

Patients should be informed that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including LEXIVA, and that the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time.

### Structural bases for Na-clcotransporter inhibition by thiazide diuretic drugs and activation by kinases [^112Cp5Ss]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Thiazide and loop diuretics promote natriuresis and diuresis by inhibiting two distinct ion transport systems in the kidney, NCC and NKCC2, respectively, although they were developed from the same parental compound called sulfonamide based on the serendipitous discovery that sulfonamide, used as an antibiotic at the time, exhibits diuretic properties. How can thiazide and loop diuretics discriminate NCC and NKCC2 given that both classes of drugs evolved from sulfonamide and retain the sulfamoyl group and that NCC and NKCC2 share high sequence and structure similarity? Breakthroughs in NCC and NKCC1 (an NKCC2 ortholog that is equally inhibited by loop diuretics such as bumetanide) structural pharmacology have started to shed light on this long-standing mystery. Thiazide and loop diuretics assume an almost opposite pose in their respective receptor sites when the shared sulfamoyl group is used as a reference (Fig. 3g). In NCC co-structures, the sulfamoyl group of hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, and chlorthalidone points downward and almost reaches halfway into the membrane. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics all bear a chorine atom that clashes with the Cl − site 2. In contrast, our NKCC1/bumetanide co-structure showed that bumetanide occupies a more superficial pocket with its sulfamoyl group pointing toward the extracellular side and its carboxyl group facing down to coordinate a co-occluded K + ion. Atomic-level understanding of thiazide and loop diuretics pharmacology now makes it possible to rationally design NCC and NKCC2 orthosteric site-targeting small molecule therapeutics with improved potency and fewer side effects (e.g. sulfur-free compounds for treating patients who are contraindicated because of sulfur allergy). In the same vein, by exploring an exceptionally vast chemical space afforded by in silico docking based on co-structures of NCC and NKCC1 bound with diuretic drugs, it may be feasible to discover compounds that simultaneously inhibit both NCC and NKCC2; such dual antagonism is desirable to resolve drug-resistant edema that often afflicts patients with congestive heart diseases and liver cirrhosis.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^1137MhTM]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are often avoided in patients with sulfonamide antibiotics due to concern for a potential allergy, even without compelling evidence supporting true cross-reactivity.
Eyecare provider practice patterns in these situations has not been previously evaluated.

What this study adds

Despite no compelling evidence for cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, a significant number of eyecare providers would avoid these drugs in patients with a history of sulfonamide antibiotic allergy.

### Procedure guideline for brain perfusion SPECT using (99m) Tc radiopharmaceuticals 3.0 [^113cu3gZ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2009). Medium credibility.

Brain perfusion SPECT interventions — Vasodilatory challenge with acetazolamide or the equivalent is indicated to evaluate cerebrovascular reserve in transient ischemic attacks, to evaluate completed stroke or vascular anomalies, and to aid in distinguishing vascular from neuronal causes of dementia. Protocols include a split-dose 2-d repeated study and dual-isotope techniques, with the 2-d repeated study simplest and typically the challenge portion performed first; if results are normal, consideration may be given to omitting the baseline study, and if a baseline scan is performed, allow time for residual activity to clear (typically 24 h), with acetazolamide administered before image acquisition. Acetazolamide dosage is specified as in adults, give 1,000 mg by slow intravenous push; in children, give 14 mg/kg; and wait 15–20 min after administering acetazolamide before injecting tracer. Contraindications and cautions include that known sulfa allergy is a contraindication, acetazolamide may induce migraine in patients with a history of migraine, and it is generally avoided within 3 d of an acute stroke. Reported adverse effects include mild vertigo, tinnitus, paresthesias, and, rarely, nausea; these are generally self-limited and do not require specific treatment, and patients may experience postural hypotension when arising and should be appropriately warned and assisted, if necessary.

### Sequential drug-induced severe hyponatremia in a minimally symptomatic, 81-year-old patient [^116VuEPW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been previous cases of medication-induced hyponatremia with various causative agents reported. Severe hyponatremia, a common medical emergency, can vary widely in its presentation, ranging from seizures and comas to no clinical manifestations.

Case Report

An 81-year-old female patient presented to the Emergency Department with history of a fall. She had a known case of hypertension and was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide. When evaluated at the hospital, her sodium level was measured as 106 mmol/L and her clinical symptoms were unremarkable. She was simultaneously diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, for which she was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. A few hours after administration, her sodium level fell even further, and she quickly developed symptoms of hyponatremia. After discontinuation of ciprofloxacin and treatment with hypertonic saline (3% NS), she improved and made a full recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We present an unusual case of minimally symptomatic, severe consecutive multi-medication-induced hyponatremia. As hyponatremia can present asymptomatically, routinely checking sodium levels is recommended, especially when caring for patients who recently experienced a fall or started a thiazide diuretic.

### Deprescribing for all: a narrative review identifying inappropriate polypharmacy for all ages in hospital settings [^111yq88P]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Medications used to treat a side effect resulting in a prescribing cascade

Medications are sometimes prescribed to treat a side effect of other medications resulting in a prescribing cascade. These cascades often lead to polypharmacy as well as increased adverse drug reactions, and they are often associated with increased treatment costs. When a new symptom arises in a patient, it can be incorrectly diagnosed as a new medical condition instead of recognising that it is the result of an adverse reaction to an existing medication. This can lead to unnecessary prescribing of new medication(s) therefore resulting in other unnecessary drug interactions and side effects. For example, furosemide could be prescribed for transient leg swelling but not be discontinued, resulting in the development hypokalaemia, so the patient is prescribed a potassium supplement. This example is outlined in figure 2 and it illustrates how the failure to discontinue the original medication after the resolution of a transient symptom resulted in the treatment of the medication's side effects. See online supplemental abstract 4 for other examples of prescribing cascades described in recent literature. In addition, online supplemental abstract 5 lists medications and notorious adverse effects which may be interpreted as a new medical condition and lead to the prescribing cascade.

Figure 2
The prescribing cascade: adverse drug reaction from a medication, misdiagnosed as a new medical condition, which become treated with another medication leading to a cycle of prescribing for preventable harms.

A step-by-step strategy can be employed to prevent prescribing cascades. First, we can question if the patient's symptom(s) could have possibly originated as a side effect of an existing prescribed medication. It is important to rule-out a drug-induced adverse effect before proceeding further. The patient may also have trialled over-the-counter therapies and non-pharmacological treatments for this issue, so if the side effect is drug-induced, these self-treatments may also not be necessary. Second, assess if the offending medication is indicated for the patient or if it is no longer needed. Could it be switched to a safer alternative? Third, if that medication is still necessary, discuss the risks and benefits of continuing therapy with the healthcare team while including the patient in the process in order to educate and allow patients to make informed decisions.

Prescribing cascades can be easily overlooked and although the elderly are more at risk, this concept can be applied to any patient with multiple chronic morbidities and medications. Again, addressing these issues early on can prevent adverse drug reactions and polypharmacy in a more vulnerable older population.

### Differentiation of hydrochlorothiazide-induced dermatitis from stasis dermatitis [^112ujqPC]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of hypertension and stasis dermatitis presented to a primary care clinic with a bilateral, erythematous rash on the legs, stomach, and chest. Photosensitive rash and dermatitis may be caused by many conditions. Hydrochlorothiazide-induced dermatitis is a rare side effect of thiazide diuretics. Early identification of sulfa-sensitivity and photoallergic or phototoxic reaction is essential to accurate diagnosis and treatment of photosensitive dermatitis. Soliciting a targeted history is essential to delineating drug-induced dermatitis from stasis dermatitis. A thorough skin examination can elucidate the focal or extensive nature of the rash and is essential to making an accurate diagnosis. Immediate cessation of hydrochlorothiazide and switching drugs classes for hypertension management typically leads to resolution of symptoms.

### Safety of administering furosemide during nuclear diuretic renography in patients with sulfonamide allergies [^114pMG8X]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We reviewed the safety of nuclear diuretic renography with furosemide in patients with sulfonamide allergies. The electronic health record was used to uncover any drug effects reported within 30 days of diuretic renograms performed between January 2009 and December 2015.

Conclusion

Eighty-three of 1103 (7.5%) diuretic renograms were performed on patients with sulfonamide allergies. Two instances of minor rash occurred. No serious reactions occurred. Furosemide is associated with an extremely low risk of minor reactions in patients with sulfonamide allergies.

Results

Patients' characteristics and reference standard

From 112 initially selected patients, 12 were excluded for a contraindication to furosemide administration (1/12 allergy to sulfonamides; 11/12 hypotension). The clinical characteristics of included patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean PSA at the time of imaging was 1.6 ± 3.2 ng/mL (range 0.18–27.2 ng/mL). Histologic verification (n = 3), PSA response after external-beam radiation (n = 44), and imaging follow-up (n = 26) served as the reference standard in most cases. In the remaining patients (n = 27), PET/CT images were analyzed in a joint reading session by consensus of 2 expert readers, aware of all clinical data and validated through a multidisciplinary discussion. According to the standard of reference, [⁶⁸Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were negative in 38/100 patients (38%). Local, nodal, and distant recurrences were present in 27, 36, and 14 patients, respectively.

### International validation of the SULF-FAST risk-stratification tool for sulfonamide antibiotic allergy [^115oxf3q]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Safe re-exposure in patients allergic to sulfonamide antibiotic (SA) previously relied on resource-intensive procedures such as desensitization. Direct oral challenge (DOC) has recently been used to delabel low-risk patients. The SULF-FAST clinical decision rule has been proposed for risk stratification. Our study aimed to externally validate this tool and describe DOC outcomes in inpatients and outpatients.

### Absence of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfonamide nonantibiotics [^117W356d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The safety of sulfonamide nonantibiotics is unclear in patients with prior allergic reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the General Practice Research Database in the United Kingdom, examining the risk of allergic reactions within 30 days after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Patients with evidence of prior hypersensitivity after the receipt of a sulfonamide antibiotic were compared with those without such evidence. Similar analyses were also performed with the use of penicillins instead of sulfonamides, to determine whether any risk was specific to sulfonamide cross-reactivity.

Results

Of 969 patients with an allergic reaction after a sulfonamide antibiotic, 96 (9.9 percent) had an allergic reaction after subsequently receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic. Of 19,257 who had no allergic reaction after a sulfonamide antibiotic, 315 (1.6 percent) had an allergic reaction after receiving a sulfonamide nonantibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 3.7). However, the risk of allergic reactions was even greater after the receipt of a penicillin among patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to a sulfonamide antibiotic, as compared with patients with no such history (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 4.3). Furthermore, among those with a prior hypersensitivity reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide antibiotic, the risk of an allergic reaction after the subsequent receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was lower than the risk of an allergic reaction after the subsequent receipt of a penicillin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.9). Finally, the risk of an allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic was lower among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics than among patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillins (adjusted odds ratio, 0.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 0.8).

Conclusions

There is an association between hypersensitivity after the receipt of sulfonamide antibiotics and a subsequent allergic reaction after the receipt of a sulfonamide nonantibiotic, but this association appears to be due to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than to cross-reactivity with sulfonamide-based drugs.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^1134K5j4]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Reported SA allergy continues to complicate clinicians' decision to prescribe CAI. Therapeutic decisions regarding CAI prescription for patients with a history of SA allergy can be challenging for both healthcare providers and patients. In this study, we asked eyecare specialist members of four US eyecare organizations to indicate which hypersensitivity reaction would prevent them from prescribing oral or topical CAI in the context of hypothetical patients with a history of SA allergy. We assumed that survey participants acknowledge that CAI are sulfonamide-containing drugs and that they have no reason to disguise their choice.

Overall, a significant proportion of respondents would avoid prescribing CAI in hypothetical SA-allergic patients. Avoidance rates increased with increasing hypersensitivity severity, and providers reported about a 20% higher reluctance to prescribe oral compared to topical CAI in equivalent scenarios. Approximately half of respondents would not prescribe oral CAI even if the SA hypersensitivity was an acute mild cutaneous reaction. Our analysis shows that, in a general setting, respondents with more than 10 years in practice are more than twice as likely than to those with 10 years or fewer in practice to avoid oral CAI in a hypothetical patient with prior mild type I SA hypersensitivity. In 2000, Balas and Boren estimated that it took approximately 15 years from the publication of landmark clinical trials to strongly affect clinical practice, and an average of 9.3 years to implement evidence from reviews, papers, and textbooks. Accordingly, a plausible explanation of the lower avoidance rate among our younger respondents may be related to the fact that, although sulfonamide cross-reactivity retrospective landmark studies were reported within the last twenty years, several comprehensive review articles discussing the lack of evidence of cross-allergenicity between SA and NAS have been published within the past decade.

### Fosamprenavir calcium [^112emReH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir; review concomitant medications during therapy with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)].

5.2 Skin Reactions

Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 1 case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome among 700 subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium in clinical trials. Treatment with fosamprenavir calcium should be discontinued for severe or life-threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.3 Sulfa Allergy

Fosamprenavir calcium should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In a clinical trial of fosamprenavir calcium used as the sole protease inhibitor, rash occurred in 2 of 10 subjects (20%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 42 of 126 subjects (33%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy. In 2 clinical trials of fosamprenavir calcium plus low-dose ritonavir, rash occurred in 8 of 50 subjects (16%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 50 of 412 subjects (12%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^117EsrwM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Macrolide allergy — Allergic reactions to macrolides are less common than those to penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamide antibiotics, and fluoroquinolones, and the most common reactions are delayed cutaneous reactions that occur in about 1% of patients. When patients with convincing histories of allergic reactions undergo formal evaluation, only about 5% are confirmed to be allergic. Skin testing with macrolides is not validated or standardized because the allergenic determinants are unknown, and the utility of immediate-type skin testing using nonirritating concentrations of macrolides is uncertain.

### Drug interaction with T-cell receptors: T-cell receptor density determines degree of cross-reactivity [^116QLVcX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Immune-mediated adverse reactions to drugs are often due to T-cell reactivity, and cross-reactivity is an important problem in pharmacotherapy.

Objective

We investigated whether chemical inert drugs can stimulate T cells through their T-cell receptor (TCR) and analyzed the cross-reactivities to related compounds.

Methods

We transfected human TCRs isolated from two drug-reactive T-cell clones (TCCs) by PCR into a TCR-negative mouse T-cell hybridoma. The TCCs were isolated from a patient with drug hypersensitivity to the antibacterial sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole (SMX).

Results

The transfectants reacted to SMX only in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Glutaraldehyde-fixed APCs, however, were sufficient to elicit T-cell stimulation, indicating a processing-independent direct interaction of the drug with the TCR and MHC molecule. The transfected hybridomas secreted IL-2 in a drug dose-dependent manner, whereas the degree of reactivity was dependent on the level of TCR expression. One transfectant reacted not only to SMX but also to related sulfonamide compounds. Interestingly, high TCR expression increased cross-reactivity to other structurally related compounds. In addition, SMX-specific TCR cross-reacted only with sulfonamides bearing a sulfanilamide core structure but not with sulfonamides such as celecoxib, furosemide, or glibenclamide.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that the T-cell reactivity to drugs is solely determined by the TCR. Moreover, these results show that cross-reactivity of structurally similar compounds correlates with the density of the TCR. Stably transfected T-cell hybridomas may represent a powerful screening tool for cross-reactivity of newly generated sulfonamide-containing compounds such as celecoxib.

### Early versus standard initiation of renal replacement therapy in furosemide stress test non-responsive acute kidney injury patients (the FST trial) [^1137ozEf]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Trial design and oversight

The FST trial was funded by the Kidney Foundation of Thailand. The study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, two-group randomized trial conducted in five intensive care units (ICU) in Thailand from March 2016 to July 2017. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02730117). The institutional ethics boards of all participating centers approved the protocol. The investigators informed patients or their surrogates about the trial both orally and with a written document. Informed consent was obtained from participating patients or their substitute decision-makers before the FST was performed. Co-investigators at each participating site were responsible for enrolling patients, ensuring adherence to the protocol, and completing the case record form. All analyses were performed by an independent statistician in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Patients

All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) admitted to the ICU were screened. Patients with AKI at any stage (defined by KDIGO criteria) were assessed for additional inclusion criteria (both of the following needed to be fulfilled): 1) clinical diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (e.g. the presence of granular or epithelial cast, fractional excretion of sodium ≥ 1%, fractional excretion of urea ≥ 50%, plasma NGAL ≥ 150 ng/mL); 2) in the opinion of the treating team, the patient was well resuscitated and euvolemic; and 3) in the opinion of the treating team, the patient had neither an emergent indication nor a contraindication to RRT (Additional file 1: Appendix 1). We excluded patients with any of the following criteria: 1) baseline serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL (male) or ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (female); 2) history of renal allograft; 3) known pregnancy; 4) allergy or known sensitivity to loop diuretics; 5) moribund patients with expected death within 24 h or whose survival to 28 days was unlikely due to an uncontrollable comorbidity (i.e. end-stage liver or heart disease, untreatable malignancy); 6) patients with advanced directives who issued the desire not to be resuscitated; 7) prior treatment with RRT within 30 days; 8) serum albumin < 2 g/dL; and 9) patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or circulatory assistance (Additional file 1: Appendix 1). We considered the patients to be provisionally eligible if all the inclusion criteria were met, and no exclusion criteria were present.

### Paraphenylenediamine allergic contact dermatitis in an African American male [^112VSCf1]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients rarely consider the diagnosis of contact dermatitis to hair coloring because the scalp beneath the dyed hair, where they would expect a reaction to occur, is resistant to allergic contact dermatitis. This resistance has been attributed to a high concentration of T regulatory cells surrounding hair follicles. These cells play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis. Dermatologists can also miss the diagnosis of PPD-induced allergic contact dermatitis especially in darker skin types since erythema is obscured. We reviewed over 2000 publications and found images of only 3 cases of PPD sensitivity in patient with skin type V (see firstness study in Supplementary Material, available via Mendeley at). In addition, African American patients may have more limited access to specialized dermatologic care.

It is also notable that medications with a para-amino structure, such as hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, sulfamethoxazole, and/or benzocaine, may cross-react to PPD. This is particularly important since hydrochlorothiazide is a preferred initial monotherapy in hypertensive African American patients. In fact, our patient was taking hydrochlorothiazide. Finally, patients allergic to PPD often have negative patch test readings at the time of the first reading on day 2. Late readings, usually at day 7, are required to identify positive patch tests for a variety of allergens, including PPD, multiple metals, some preservatives, acrylates, and neomycin.

For these patients, it is critical to avoid contact with black hair dye containing PPD. Fortunately, PPD-free dyes and vegetable-based hair dyes are generally safe in PPD sensitized patients. These alternatives, however, should be used cautiously since compounds such as para-toluenediamine sulfates may be present and cross-react in 43% of individuals who are sensitive to PPD. In summary, a patient with a facial rash preceded by application of hair dye should be patch tested. PPD sensitivity responds to short courses of topical steroid and systemic steroids (10–14 days) and avoidance of the allergen.

### Tipranavir (Aptivus) [^115iVgtt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Sulfa Allergy

APTIVUS should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. Tipranavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and APTIVUS is unknown.

5.8 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia

New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-1 infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.

5.9 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including APTIVUS. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis, or reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

5.10 Fat Redistribution

Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.

5.11 Elevated Lipids

Treatment with APTIVUS co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir has resulted in large increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate; taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### International validation of the SULF-FAST risk-stratification tool for sulfonamide antibiotic allergy [^113ETaqB]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We prospectively validated the SULF-FAST tool in an international multicenter cohort, including inpatients and outpatients with a high area under the curve and negative predictive value. A score less than 3 stratified patients to safely receive a Co-T DOC, which was negative in over 95% with no serious adverse events. The time since the reaction was a key element in determining the risk of a positive test. The performance of SULF-FAST was similar to that of PEN-FAST, a tool validated for penicillin allergy.

A limitation of our study remains the small number of patients and the high prevalence of low-risk patients. Only patients with a score of 3 or more had skin testing, inducing a possible bias toward positive testing. Also, the number of patients with a score of 2 (strictly) was limited, and the proportion of positive testing was significant (33.3%). In addition, patients with type III, serum-sickness-like reactions (2 of 2 patients) reacted in our cohort, and we recommend not assessing these with SULF-FAST. Lastly, in the context of no validated challenge protocol for Co-T delayed reactions, we performed 1-dose challenges.

To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective external validation of an SA allergy risk-stratification tool. This study provides evidence for implementing SULF-FAST to enable SA use. However, its applicability by nontrained medical personnel needs to be further evaluated.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^112bE65t]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product and in patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and in patients with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. Because of the hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.

### Furosemide [^112fQAgQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients at high risk for radiocontrast nephropathy, furosemide can lead to a higher incidence of deterioration in renal function after receiving radiocontrast compared to high-risk patients who received only intravenous hydration prior to receiving radiocontrast.

In patients with hypoproteinemia (e.g., associated with nephrotic syndrome), the effect of furosemide may be weakened and its ototoxicity potentiated.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated.

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to furosemide. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.

Information for Patients

Patients receiving furosemide should be advised that they may experience symptoms from excessive fluid and/or electrolyte losses. The postural hypotension that sometimes occurs can usually be managed by getting up slowly. Potassium supplements and/or dietary measures may be needed to control or avoid hypokalemia.

Patients with diabetes mellitus should be told that furosemide may increase blood glucose levels and thereby affect urine glucose tests. The skin of some patients may be more sensitive to the effects of sunlight while taking furosemide.

### Cross-reactivity among p-amino group compounds in sulfonamide fixed drug eruption: diagnostic value of patch testing [^111yXLvz]. Contact Dermatitis (2004). Low credibility.

We studied 28 patients with fixed drug eruption (FDE) caused by sulfonamide antibiotics to investigate cross-reactivity between sulfonamide derivatives and p-amino compounds and to explore the usefulness of patch testing, as an alternative to controlled oral challenge testing (COCT), in diagnosis within this clinical area. COCT with sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethizole (SMZ), furosemide (FU), procaine (PRO) and glipizide (GPZ) was performed. Patch testing (PT) with SMX and SDZ was carried out. In all patients, the diagnosis of FDE was confirmed by positive COCT and allergy to trimethoprim ruled out by COCT. 42.8 and 31.8% of the SMX-induced FDE patients reacted to SMZ and SDZ, respectively. All patients (n = 28) tolerated FU, PRO and GPZ. COCT performed with the 3 sulfonamide antibiotics in 12 patients was positive in 2 subjects with the 3 drugs, in 2 patients only with SMX and SMZ and in the remaining 8, SMX was the only causative drug. PT was positive in 5 of 25 patients positive on COCT. The probability of obtaining a positive PT was higher among patients who had a residual lesion than that among those who lacked this. Cross-reactivity between different sulfonamide antibiotics is thus variable, being most likely between SMX and SMZ. We have found no cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and other sulfonamide derivatives or p-amino drugs in FDE. PT is a useful tool in the diagnosis of FDE, especially if there are residual lesions, because it avoided the need for COCT in 20% of patients.

### Prescribing carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to patients with "sulfa" antibiotics allergy: do we dare? [^113i2ZqY]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several barriers and factors that could explain most clinicians' attitudes and behavior toward CAI prescription in SA-allergic patients, despite pharmacological and clinical evidence do not support cross-reactivity between SA and NAS. First is the use of the term "sulfa allergy" to refer to allergic reactions related to all sulfonamide-containing drugs despite evidence that the N₁ and N₄ moieties — neither of which is present in ophthalmic CAIs — are responsible for the SA allergic response. A second factor could be the lack of randomized clinical trials or large prospective studies that could validate the lack of cross-reactivity suggested by the retrospective ones. Nevertheless, we believe that the most important factor that contributes to the concern among patients and clinicians is the manufacturers' package inserts for ophthalmic CAIs that contain warnings regarding sulfonamides hypersensitivity or cross-reactivity. These warnings could be a deterrent for clinicians out of fear of a possible severe allergic reaction in their patients and medico-legal liability from disregarding FDA-approved cautionary recommendations, even though these would not be aligned with current available evidence.

### Label: FUROSEMIDE tablet… [^111d5EkJ]. FDA (DailyMed) (2010). Low credibility.

Investigations into the mode of action of furosemide have utilized micropuncture studies in rats, stop flow experiments in dogs and various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. It has been demonstrated that furosemide inhibits primarily the absorption of sodium and chloride not only in the proximal and distal tubules but also in the loop of Henle. The high degree of efficacy is largely due to the unique site of action. The action on the distal tubule is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone. If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, furosemide tablets should be discontinued. Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests have been observed, and rarely, precipitation of diabetes mellitus has been reported. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated.

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to furosemide. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.

### Drug allergy [^111KWx69]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Drug allergy is one type of adverse reaction to drugs and encompasses a spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions with heterogeneous mechanisms and clinical presentations. A thorough history is essential to the management of drug allergy. Laboratory testing has a very limited role in the management of drug allergy. Graded dose challenges and procedures to induce drug tolerance might be required in patients with drug allergy when there is a definite need for a particular agent. Management of reactions to specific agents, including beta-lactam antibiotics, sulfonamides, local anesthetics, radiocontrast media, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and biologic modifiers, will be discussed in further detail.

### Granuloma annulare following acetazolamide challenge / rechallenge in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^114eqTE4]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 1 year later, she had recurrence of headaches and papilledema with corresponding increase in retinal nerve fiber layer on optical coherence tomography. Due to the recurrence of IIH, acetazolamide was restarted at 1 g daily.

When she returned 3 months later, her headaches had improved on acetazolamide, but she had another episode of a rash on her foot that was clinically consistent with GA (Fig 2). Blood work, including complete blood count, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, and antiphospholipid antibodies were all normal. The option of switching to a different medication was offered, but the patient elected to stay on acetazolamide despite ongoing rash, because of her well controlled symptoms.

Fig 2
Erythematous annular rash on the foot, clinically consistent with granuloma annulare. This rash appeared after the patient restarted acetazolamide.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of papular/plaque type GA induced by acetazolamide and the second reported case of acetazolamide-induced GA overall. The other published case was subcutaneous GA that occurred in a pediatric patient, also receiving acetazolamide for treatment of IIH. Topiramate, like acetazolamide, is a sulfonamide derivative and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and has a more frequently reported association with GA. The precise mechanism by which topiramate may cause GA has not been established but may be secondary to a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Prior studies have implicated overactivation of the T helper 1 pathway in GA, which supports a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction induced by the T helper 1 pathway. Due to the similarities in drug class between acetazolamide and topiramate, we hypothesize that acetazolamide may induce GA through a similar mechanism. Acetazolamide-induced GA fits into a broader category of immune-mediated reactions called interstitial granulomatous drug reaction, a term used to describe a rare cutaneous condition, typically appearing as an erythematous to violaceous annular plaque. Interstitial granulomatous drug reaction is characterized by granulomatous inflammation arising in response to a drug, with histopathologic features of interstitial granulomas and neutrophilic infiltration. Furosemide, another sulfa-containing drug, has been linked to this type of immune response, including delayed-type hypersensitivity, which is often involved in granulomatous reactions.

### Diuretic renal scintigraphy in patients with sulfonamide allergies: possible alternative use of ethacrynic acid [^115o1Jss]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Furosemide may trigger life-threatening sulfonamide cross-hypersensitivity reactions, posing a dilemma in patients who need diuretic renal scintigraphy.

Methods

We present our experience using ethacrynic acid as a nonsulfonamide alternative diuretic in 5 patients, with a discussion of the diuretic molecular structure, potential side effects, protocol development, and imaging results.

Results

Diuretic renal scintigraphy using ethacrynic acid provided useful information about the obstruction status in all patients, with no adverse clinical impact.

Conclusion

Ethacrynic acid is a potential alternative to furosemide for patients with severe sulfonamide reactions.
