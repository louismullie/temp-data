## Question

Does azithromycin prolong QT interval?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether azithromycin prolongs the QT interval and how to interpret that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and what the FDA labeling says. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and dose–response data. Next, I will review clinical evidence across populations, including healthy volunteers, real-world cohorts, and special groups like COVID-19 and pediatrics. After that, I need to consider drug–drug interactions and patient-specific risk factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation for monitoring and prescribing, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline consistency before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that frames the baseline risk signal. The FDA has repeatedly warned that azithromycin can prolong the QT interval and has updated labeling to reflect this risk, noting cases of torsades de pointes in postmarketing surveillance and advising caution in patients with baseline QT prolongation, electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia, heart failure, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, with particular vulnerability in older adults [^111fepF2] [^111uf4R7] [^111LzcCC].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism and dose–response before inferring clinical magnitude. Controlled studies in healthy volunteers show that azithromycin increases QTc in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner when combined with chloroquine, with mean QTcF increases of about 5–9 ms across 500–1500 mg oral doses; importantly, the FDA also notes that IV azithromycin may produce greater effects due to higher Cmax, which could matter in inpatient settings [^114v1eRD] [^111ZHwvU] [^113ysQf4]. Hold on, I should also consider mechanistic heterogeneity: beyond modest hERG block, chronic exposure may increase cardiac sodium current and promote calcium loading, offering a plausible explanation for proarrhythmia even without marked QT prolongation in some cases [^116nz6QB].

> Next, I should review real-world evidence to see how this translates clinically. Large observational cohorts comparing azithromycin to amoxicillin generally show no increased odds of composite cardiac events overall, but a consistent signal emerges when other QT-prolonging drugs are present; for example, azithromycin users on concurrent QT-prolonging agents had about a 40% higher odds of cardiac events in one analysis, and another found a 2.9-fold increase in cardiovascular death in a high-risk Medicaid cohort, highlighting that baseline risk and co-medications modify the signal substantially [^1135HEqg] [^114Rk27x] [^114aQ8HB] [^1147Gig7]. I should double-check that these effects cluster early in therapy; indeed, excess risk appears concentrated in the first 5 days of use, which aligns with pharmacokinetics and arrhythmia biology [^1147Gig7].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is COVID-19, where polypharmacy and inflammation are common. Multiple COVID-19 cohorts show that adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine increases the likelihood and magnitude of QTc prolongation, with roughly 12–23% of patients reaching QTc ≥ 500 ms or a ≥ 60 ms rise from baseline. Importantly, torsades was uncommon but documented, and guidelines consequently recommend against routine HCQ+AZ use and advise structured QT monitoring if such combinations are unavoidable [^113RYiUh] [^112szHJg] [^111HkVz8] [^112cBm2C]. Hold on, I should verify whether azithromycin alone behaves differently; in some hospitalized COVID-19 studies, azithromycin monotherapy produced smaller average QTc changes than the combination, though risk still rises with cumulative QT liability and patient factors [^112Bw1Fc] [^116xqsiH].

> I need to check special populations, especially pediatrics and chronic macrolide users. In children with cystic fibrosis receiving long-term azithromycin, randomized data did not show increased QTc prolongation versus placebo, and pediatric airway disease reviews suggest good tolerability without serious cardiovascular events, though vigilance remains prudent given adult signals and the absence of routine pediatric ECG screening recommendations [^111ByKwC] [^115khajV]. Let me reconsider whether any pediatric guidance flags QT; GINA does recommend ECG screening before chronic macrolide therapy in asthma, underscoring that adult and pediatric chronic-use contexts may warrant proactive risk assessment [^1125mY9c].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and patient-level risk modifiers. Concurrent QT-prolonging agents, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia, structural heart disease, and older age consistently amplify risk; female sex is a known risk factor for drug-induced torsades, though some COVID-19 series paradoxically showed greater mean QTc changes in men, likely reflecting confounding by indication and comorbidity burden rather than a true sex effect reversal [^111fepF2] [^113B4YSj] [^1124ecwg]. I should confirm that expert guidance advises baseline ECGs and electrolyte correction when risk factors are present; cardiology and infectious disease guidance endorse ECG screening and risk mitigation in such scenarios, including explicit thresholds for holding or discontinuing therapy [^112cBm2C] [^111HkVz8].

> Let me synthesize the magnitude and clinical relevance. In low-risk patients without interacting drugs or electrolyte disturbances, azithromycin produces modest, often subclinical QTc increases on the order of about 5–10 ms, and large cohorts generally do not show increased cardiac events versus amoxicillin. However, in high-risk patients or when combined with other QT-prolonging agents, the absolute risk of marked QTc prolongation and rare torsades rises enough to warrant active mitigation, consistent with FDA warnings and professional society guidance [^114v1eRD] [^1135HEqg] [^111fepF2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; rare events can be clinically consequential in large populations, so individualized risk–benefit assessment remains essential even when average risks appear small.

> I should now translate this into practical prescribing and monitoring. For patients with any of the following — baseline QTc ≥ 450–470 ms depending on risk, congenital long QT, bradyarrhythmias, heart failure, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs — obtain a baseline ECG and electrolytes, correct abnormalities before initiation, and repeat ECG within 3–5 days if risk is nontrivial. Hold or stop therapy if QTc exceeds 500 ms or rises by more than 60 ms from baseline, aligning with cardiology and IDSA COVID-19 guidance on thresholds and surveillance [^112cBm2C] [^113fakDf]. For low-risk patients on short courses without interacting drugs, routine ECG is not universally required, but clinicians should counsel on symptoms warranting urgent evaluation, such as palpitations, syncope, or seizures, and consider ECG if symptoms arise or if higher doses or IV administration are used [^111LzcCC] [^111ZHwvU].

> Final answer: Yes, azithromycin can prolong the QT interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner, with average increases of about 5–10 ms in controlled settings, and the clinical significance is largely determined by patient risk factors and co-medications. In high-risk patients or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs, the risk of clinically meaningful QTc prolongation and rare torsades de pointes is sufficient to justify baseline ECGs, electrolyte optimization, and serial monitoring with clear stop criteria [^114v1eRD] [^111fepF2] [^1135HEqg] [^112cBm2C].

Azithromycin can prolong the QT interval, especially in patients with risk factors or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs [^111fepF2]. The risk is **generally low but clinically significant**, with case reports and observational studies linking azithromycin to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes [^113viqm2] [^1147Gig7]. The FDA warns of **QT prolongation and torsades risk**, particularly in patients with existing QT prolongation, electrolyte disturbances, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^111fepF2] [^111uf4R7]. Clinicians should assess risk factors, correct electrolytes, and monitor ECGs in high-risk patients [^112cBm2C].

---

## Mechanism of QT prolongation

Azithromycin prolongs the QT interval by **blocking the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr)** [^112pJtwj], which delays ventricular repolarization and increases the risk of torsades de pointes [^111AqTVR].

---

## Clinical evidence of QT prolongation

Multiple studies and reports document azithromycin-associated QT prolongation and torsades de pointes:

- **Case reports**: Multiple cases of azithromycin-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported, including fatal events [^113viqm2].

- **Observational studies**: Large cohort studies have associated azithromycin with increased cardiovascular death, particularly in patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk [^1147Gig7] [^114aQ8HB].

- **Randomized controlled trials**: Clinical trials have demonstrated dose-dependent QT prolongation with azithromycin, especially when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs [^114v1eRD] [^1118gZJR].

---

## Risk factors for QT prolongation with azithromycin

Several patient-specific and drug-related factors increase the risk of **QT prolongation** with azithromycin:

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Patient-specific factors | - Advanced age <br/> - Female sex <br/> - Pre-existing QT prolongation <br/> - Congenital long QT syndrome <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Hypokalemia <br/> - Hypomagnesemia <br/> - Structural heart disease <br/> - Renal or hepatic impairment [^111fepF2] [^111uf4R7] |
| Drug-related factors | - Concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications (e.g. antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, fluoroquinolones, hydroxychloroquine) <br/> - High azithromycin doses <br/> - Intravenous administration [^111fepF2] [^111uf4R7] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following precautions when prescribing azithromycin:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate patients for existing QT prolongation, electrolyte disturbances, and concomitant QT-prolonging medications before initiating therapy [^112cBm2C].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to administration [^112cBm2C].

- **ECG monitoring**: Consider baseline and follow-up ECG monitoring in high-risk patients or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs [^112cBm2C].

- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider alternative antibiotics in patients with significant risk factors for QT prolongation [^114Rk27x].

---

## Comparison with other macrolide antibiotics

Among macrolides, azithromycin has a **lower risk of QT prolongation** than erythromycin and clarithromycin, which have more pronounced effects on cardiac repolarization. However, the risk is not negligible, especially in vulnerable patients [^116CrDpx] [^114aQ8HB].

---

## Clinical management of QT prolongation

If QT prolongation occurs during azithromycin therapy, recommended actions include:

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop azithromycin and any other QT-prolonging drugs [^114DuDGd].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia promptly [^112cBm2C].

- **Cardiac monitoring**: Provide continuous cardiac monitoring and manage arrhythmias as clinically indicated [^116HGFva].

- **Magnesium sulfate**: Administer intravenous magnesium sulfate for torsades de pointes [^114DuDGd].

---

Azithromycin can prolong the QT interval, particularly in patients with risk factors or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs. Clinicians should assess risk, correct electrolytes, and monitor ECGs in high-risk patients to mitigate the risk of torsades de pointes and other serious arrhythmias.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^114YnTys]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Macrolide therapy — moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with prior exacerbations: "For patients with moderate to severe COPD, who have a history of one or more moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in the previous year despite optimal maintenance inhaler therapy, we suggest the use of a long-term macrolide to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2A)". Safety notes specify that "patients should be carefully evaluated for predisposing conditions or medications before initiating therapy", and clinicians prescribing macrolides need to consider "prolongation of the QT interval and hearing loss as well as bacterial resistance". "The duration and exact dosage of macrolide therapy are unknown". Reported signals include colonization "with organisms that were resistant to azithromycin" with colonization "not associated with an increase in COPD exacerbations or pneumonia", and "a modest increase in the risk of hearing loss… although this effect was reversible". Additionally, macrolide therapy "is suggested (grade 2A)… and clinicians should be aware of the potential for adverse effects".

### Azithromycin (zithromax or zmax) and the risk of potentially… [^114z6C2S]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

This communication is a result of our review of a study by medical researchers as well as another study by a manufacturer of the drug that assessed the potential for azithromycin to cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart. The azithromycin drug labels have been updated to strengthen the Warnings and Precautions section with information related to the risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, a specific, rare heart rhythm abnormality. Information has also been added regarding the results of a clinical QT study which showed that azithromycin can prolong the QTc interval. Health care professionals should consider the risk of fatal heart rhythms with azithromycin when considering treatment options for patients who are already at risk for cardiovascular events.

F DA notes that the potential risk of QT prolongation with azithromycin should be placed in appropriate context when choosing an antibacterial drug: Alternative drugs in the macrolide class, or non-macrolides such as the fluoroquinolones, also have the potential for QT prolongation or other significant side effects that should be considered when choosing an antibacterial drug.
- Patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
- Patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic agents.
- Elderly patients and patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of arrhythmogenic drugs on the QT interval.
- The potential risk of QT prolongation should be placed in appropriate context when choosing an antibacterial drug: Alternative drugs in the macrolide or fluoroquinolone drug classes also have the potential for QT prolongation or other significant side effects that should be considered when choosing an antibacterial drug. FDA also evaluated the results of a clinical QT study conducted by the manufacturer assessing the effects of azithromycin on the QT interval in adults. The results of the study indicated that azithromycin prolonged the QTc interval. Information regarding the results of the QT study has been added to the Zithromax drug label. References.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [^1118gZJR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparison 3: HCQ + azithromycin versus standard care

One trial (444 participants) reported this comparison (Cavalcanti 2020). Due to the comparison not having been predefined, and this trial having a high risk of reporting bias and unclear risk of performance and detection bias, a separate 'Summary of findings' table is not provided.

Death was reported as showing no difference between study arms (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.07; 444 participants; 1 RCT; Analysis 3.1).

Time to negative PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 was not reported, and as this was a trial of hospitalized patients, neither was number of participants admitted to hospital (Cavalcanti 2020).

The number of participants requiring mechanical ventilation did not differ between study arms (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.15; 444 participants; 1 RCT; Analysis 3.2). Duration of mechanical ventilation was not reported (Cavalcanti 2020).

Length of hospital admission was similar between groups (MD 0.50 days longer with HCQ + azithromycin, 95% CI 0.81 days shorter to 1.81 days longer; 444 participants; 1 RCT; Analysis 3.3).

Time to clinical improvement was not reported.

Adverse events were experienced by a higher proportion of participants who received at least one dose of HCQ + azithromycin versus participants receiving neither HCQ nor azithromycin (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.38; 416 participants; 1 RCT; Analysis 3.4). Serious adverse events did not differ significantly between study arms (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.36 to 9.43; 416 participants; 1 RCT; Analysis 3.5).

When assessed, QT‐interval prolongation on ECG was more common amongst participants receiving HCQ + azithromycin (17/116) versus those receiving neither drug (1/58) (RR 8.50, 95% CI 1.16 to 62.31; 174 participants; 1 RCT; Analysis 3.6). Performance of ECG within seven days of enrolment appeared to be more frequent in the HCQ + azithromycin arm (116/239, 48.5%) than in the standard care arm (58/177, 32.8%).

### Effect of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin on the corrected QT interval in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^112Bw1Fc]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death.

Methods

Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin from March 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in Torsade de pointes. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation, and arrhythmogenic death.

Results

Two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine, and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was not observed in the entire population. Baseline corrected QT interval intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) versus those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; 440.6 ± 24.9 versus 439.9 ± 24.7 ms, P = 0.834). The maximum corrected QT interval during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group versus the monotherapy group (470.4 ± 45.0 ms versus 453.3 ± 37.0 ms, P = 0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to corrected QT interval prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported.

Conclusions

In the largest reported cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin, no instances of Torsade de pointes, or arrhythmogenic death were reported. Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy. Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^116nx5G5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

The original cohort included more than 44 million episodes of azithromycin and amoxicillin use. After taking a random sample of 25%, 9 507 450 users of azithromycin and amoxicillin (25% of each cohort) were eligible for inclusion. After matching with high-dimensional propensity scores at a 1:1 ratio, the final cohort included 2 141 285 episodes of each index therapy (N = 4 282 570). The combined cohorts included episodes of patients with a mean (SD) age of 35.7 (22.3) years, of whom 52.6% were female and 47.4% were male (Table 1). Except for the preferred provider organization insurance category (standardized difference, 0.18 [> 10%]), all of the baseline characteristics were similar between the amoxicillin and azithromycin cohorts. The duration of therapy was 5 days for 87.3% of azithromycin episodes and less than 10 days for 93.2% of amoxicillin episodes.

Table 1.
Patient Characteristics

Abbreviations: EPO, exclusive provider organization; HMO, health maintenance organization; PPO, preferred provider organization.

More than one-third of episodes (34.5%) included patients with a history of disease of the circulatory systems (Table 2). Among such episodes, 20.8% had hypertension, 11.1% had nonspecific chest pain, and 7.3% had cardiac dysrhythmias. More than one-half of episodes (53.5%) included patients with a history of respiratory infection, and almost one-quarter (23.7%) included patients with a mental illness. The prevalence of these conditions was similar between azithromycin and amoxicillin users. More than one-fifth of episodes (20.4%) included at least 1 concurrent use of a QT-prolonging drug, and 6.6% used at least 2 concurrent drugs with the index therapies (Table 3). Antidepressants (7.3%) and opiate agonists (2.3%) were the most commonly prescribed drugs. The use of at least 1 QT-prolonging drug with known risk was 6.0%; with possible risk, 5.5%; and with conditional risk, 12.8%. The use of concurrent QT-prolonging drugs was similar between the amoxicillin and azithromycin cohorts.

### Antimicrobial-associated QT interval prolongation: pointes of interest [^116CrDpx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Until recently, cardiac toxicity manifesting in the form of arrhythmias related to QT interval prolongation was uncommonly appreciated within the antimicrobial class of drugs, but it was well described among antiarrhythmic agents. Antimicrobials that are associated with QT prolongation include the macrolides/ketolides, certain fluoroquinolones and antimalarials, pentamidine, and the azole antifungals. Although, in most cases, mild delays in ventricular repolarization caused by these drugs are clinically unnoticeable, they may serve to amplify the risk for torsades de pointes (TdP) when prescribed in the setting of other risk factors. Conditions or variables that influence proarrhythmic risk include sex, age, electrolyte derangements, structural heart disease, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions, and genetic predisposition. It is important that clinicians be knowledgeable about drugs with QT liability, as well as the risk factors that increase the probability of TdP. Additionally, because TdP remains a difficult-to-measure adverse event, we must rely upon multiple data sources to determine the risk versus the benefit for newly approved drugs.

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^115dk7Ho]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine and azithromycin were developed in combination for the preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, and more recently were proposed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) treatment options. Billions of doses of chloroquine have been administered worldwide over the past 70 years but concerns regarding cardiotoxicity, notably the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), remain. This investigation aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic effects of chloroquine and azithromycin observed in a large previously conducted healthy volunteer study. Healthy adult volunteers (n = 119) were randomized into 5 arms: placebo, chloroquine alone (600 mg base), or chloroquine with either 500 mg, 1,000 mg, or 1,500 mg of azithromycin all given daily for 3 days. Chloroquine and azithromycin levels, measured using liquid‐chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and electrocardiograph intervals were recorded at frequent intervals. Time‐matched changes in the PR, QRS, and heart rate‐corrected JT, and QT intervals were calculated and the relationship with plasma concentrations was evaluated using linear and nonlinear mixed‐effects modeling. Chloroquine and azithromycin pharmacokinetics were described satisfactorily by two‐ and three‐compartment distribution models, respectively. No drug–drug interaction between chloroquine and azithromycin was observed. Chloroquine resulted in concentration‐dependent prolongation of the PR, QRS, JTc and QTc intervals with a minimal additional effect of azithromycin. QRS widening contributed ~ 28% of the observed QT prolongation. Chloroquine causes significant concentration‐dependent delays in both ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Co‐administration of azithromycin did not significantly increase these effects. The arrhythmogenic risk of TdP associated with chloroquine may have been substantially overestimated in studies which did not separate electrocardiograph QRS and JT prolongation.

### Azithromycin monohydrate [^116d3Spj]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that the allergic symptoms may reappear after symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)

Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.

5.4 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation, which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:

- patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure

- patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval

- patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### Hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin therapy and QT prolongation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^115oKfru]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to characterize corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in a cohort of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ/AZM).

Background

HCQ/AZM is being widely used to treat COVID-19 despite the known risk of QT interval prolongation and the unknown risk of arrhythmogenesis in this population.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients treated with HCQ/AZM was reviewed. The QTc interval was calculated before drug administration and for the first 5 days following initiation. The primary endpoint was the magnitude of QTc prolongation, and factors associated with QTc prolongation. Secondary endpoints were incidences of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and all-cause mortality.

Results

Among 415 patients who received concomitant HCQ/AZM, the mean QTc increased from 443 ± 25 ms to a maximum of 473 ± 40 ms (87 [21%] patients had a QTc ≥ 500 ms). Factors associated with QTc prolongation ≥ 500 ms were age (p < 0.001), body mass index < 30 kg/m² (p = 0.005), heart failure (p < 0.001), elevated creatinine (p = 0.005), and peak troponin (p < 0.001). The change in QTc was not associated with death over the short period of the study in a population in which mortality was already high (hazard ratio: 0.998; p = 0.607). No primary high-grade ventricular arrhythmias were observed.

Conclusions

An increase in QTc was seen in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/AZM. Several clinical factors were associated with greater QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were not associated with increased risk of death.

### Azithromycin [^114ZT8mk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)]

Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)

Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.

5.4 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:

patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure
patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19: is cardiotoxicity a concern? [^116HGFva]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Concern about azithromycin and increased cardiovascular death was raised in 2012 with the greatest risk in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. 8 The US Food and Drug Administration recognized this. Azithromycin can cause modest QT interval prolongation, but not through potent hERG channel blockade, rather when used chronically through an increase in peak and late cardiac sodium current to cause potential loading of cardiomyocytes with sodium and calcium to produce calcium overload. 9

How should we proceed with the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially combined with azithromycin, for COVID‐19 given that these agents bring some cardiac toxicity risk and their mechanisms for cardiac toxicity may not be the same? Is combining different and potentially additive mechanisms of cardiotoxicity wise? There are no available data from large randomized clinical trials defining dosing or duration of use for either prophylaxis or treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Whether in clinical trials or for empiric off‐label treatment, some patients are at higher risk of cardiac arrhythmic complications and likely should not be candidates for these drugs including patients with a prolonged QT interval, patients with known or suspected congenital long QT syndrome, patients receiving other QT interval–prolonging drugs, patients with marked electrolyte disorders (particularly low serum potassium), and possibly patients with significant, untreated conduction abnormalities. It is reasonable to obtain a baseline ECG before treatment whenever possible to exclude a prolonged QT interval or advanced conduction system disease. In addition, critically ill patients receiving treatment need to be monitored by telemetry to detect serious arrhythmias. Clinicians should be alert for the potential of proarrhythmia drug effects. Nevertheless, given the overall safety profile of these quinolones, one can anticipate relatively little cardiac toxicity for a short course in noncritically ill patients and in prophylactic uses in the absence of underlying cardiac disease. However, in critically ill COVID‐19 patients, the risk of adverse cardiac events secondary to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is greater given the impact on the myocardium of cytokine storm from aggressive pulmonary infection as well as possible hypoxia in addition to the potential for viral myocarditis. How great the risk is relative to the benefit in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 will need to await the outcome of ongoing, controlled clinical trials. The emerging treatments for COVID‐19 require not only rapid implementation but thoughtful considerations to minimize unintended consequences including arrhythmias.

### Azithromycin causes a novel proarrhythmic syndrome [^116nz6QB]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The widely used macrolide antibiotic azithromycin increases risk of cardiovascular and sudden cardiac death, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Case reports, including the one we document here, demonstrate that azithromycin can cause rapid, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of QT prolongation, indicating a novel proarrhythmic syndrome. We investigated the electrophysiological effects of azithromycin in vivo and in vitro using mice, cardiomyocytes, and human ion channels heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

Methods and Results

In conscious telemetered mice, acute intraperitoneal and oral administration of azithromycin caused effects consistent with multi-ion channel block, with significant sinus slowing and increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, as seen with azithromycin overdose. Similarly, in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, the drug slowed sinus automaticity, reduced phase 0 upstroke slope, and prolonged action potential duration. Acute exposure to azithromycin reduced peak SCN5A currents in HEK cells (IC₅₀ = 110 ± 3 μmol/L) and Na⁺ current in mouse ventricular myocytes. However, with chronic (24 hour) exposure, azithromycin caused a ≈2-fold increase in both peak and late SCN5A currents, with findings confirmed for Iₙₐ in cardiomyocytes. Mild block occurred for K⁺ currents representing Iₖᵣ (CHO cells expressing hERG; IC₅₀ = 219 ± 21 μmol/L) and Iₖₛ (CHO cells expressing KCNQ1+KCNE1; IC₅₀ = 184 ± 12 μmol/L), whereas azithromycin suppressed L-type Ca²⁺ currents (rabbit ventricular myocytes, IC₅₀ = 66.5 ± 4 μmol/L) and Iₖ₁ (HEK cells expressing Kir2.1, IC₅₀ = 44 ± 3 μmol/L).

Conclusions

Chronic exposure to azithromycin increases cardiac Na⁺ current to promote intracellular Na⁺ loading, providing a potential mechanistic basis for the novel form of proarrhythmia seen with this macrolide antibiotic.

### Long-term, low-dose macrolide antibiotic treatment in pediatric chronic airway diseases [^115khajV]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety of long-term, low-dose macrolide antibiotic therapy

The potential harm of long-term use of antibiotics is concerned. The effect of macrolides on drug resistance of common respiratory pathogens is an important factor to be considered in long-term use. Current evidence suggested an increased risk of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, etc. but did not increase the risk of respiratory exacerbations, intravenous antibiotics, or hospitalization. The effects of macrolides on respiratory pathogens and the optimal duration of efficacy of macrolide therapy need to be further studied. As for side effects, studies showed that children and adults treated with macrolides for a long time had a significantly higher incidence of diarrhea, no significant difference in nausea or vomiting compared with the control group, and had nothing to do with the type of macrolides. Moreover, the treatment was well tolerated and there were no patient drop out of the study because of diarrhea. The tolerance of azithromycin is better than that of other macrolides. Current data show that LLMAT in pediatric patients is well tolerated and no serious cardiovascular events have been reported. However, since there is no official recommendation for electrocardiogram examination before children take macrolide antibiotics, it is necessary to note potential cardiac side effects such as QT interval prolongation reported in adults. Therefore, long-term macrolide antibiotics therapy has good safety in children, the continuous evaluation of heart safety in the course of use cannot be ignored, and diarrhea should not be excessively worried. In conclusion, the clinical dilemma is that optimal dose and duration of macrolide antibiotics to produce positive effects in pediatric chronic airway diseases are still indefinite, and it is important to further evaluate the treatment options and advantages and disadvantages of LLMAT.

### Association of azithromycin use with cardiovascular mortality [^1147Gig7]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of more than 7.8 million antibiotic exposures, there was a statistically significantly increased relative risk and absolute risk of cardiovascular death associated with azithromycin exposure compared with amoxicillin within 5 days of index date but not within 6 to 10 days after index date. This study also found an increased risk of noncardiovascular and all-cause death within 5 days of exposure among individuals prescribed azithromycin. While the risk of cardiovascular death is consistent with proposed mechanisms, an increased risk of noncardiovascular mortality is not.

Reports of an association of erythromycin, one of the first macrolide antibiotics, with QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias first appeared more than 20 years ago. Subsequently, cardiac arrhythmias have been reported for clarithromycin and azithromycin, and macrolide antibiotics, as a class, are now known to cause QT prolongation in some at-risk populations. In most of the case reports of macrolide antibiotic use and cardiac arrhythmias, patients had other factors that put them at an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including underlying cardiac disease (ie, bradycardia, congestive heart failure, baseline QT prolongation, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial ischemia), metabolic anomalies that increase the risk of arrhythmia (ie, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypoxia), or concomitant use of other medications known to prolong the QT interval.

Our observed association of azithromycin with cardiovascular death is similar to that reported by Ray et alin a Tennessee Medicaid population but differs from the findings reported by Svanstrom et alin a Danish general population sample. When examining the findings across these studies, it is important to note key differences between populations. The incidence of cardiovascular death at Kaiser Permanente was 35.9 deaths per 1 000 000 azithromycin exposures, which was lower than the incidence found by Ray et al (85.2 deaths per 1 000 000 azithromycin exposures)yet higher than the incidence found by Svanstrom et al (15.4 deaths per 1 000 000 azithromycin exposures). These differences may largely be explained by baseline differences in population characteristics, although there also may have been differences in detection and classification of cardiovascular deaths.

### QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin [^112szHJg]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no known effective therapy for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns about the potential risk of QT interval prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the change in corrected QT (QTc) interval and arrhythmic events in patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of 251 patients from 2 centers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed electrocardiographic tracings from baseline and until 3 days after the completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc interval and the incidence of arrhythmia and mortality.

Results

The QTc interval prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc interval prolongation to > 500 ms, a known marker of high risk of TdP, had developed in 23% of patients. One patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suspected as TdP, requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc interval of patients exhibiting extreme QTc interval prolongation was normal.

Conclusion

The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc interval in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life-threatening arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in light of its unproven efficacy. Strict QTc interval monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.

### Cardiac corrected QT interval changes among patients treated for COVID-19 infection during the early phase of the pandemic [^112pJtwj]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 has resulted in the death of nearly half a million Americans, with few effective treatment options. At the beginning of the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were studied and frequently prescribed. Because both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolong corrected QT interval (QTc) (via I Kr or HERG), QTc interval changes and torsades de pointes (TDP) potential in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin was a focus of multiple single-group studies.,

Systemic inflammation prolongs QTc via cytokine-mediated effects on potassium channel expression. Specific viruses are also associated with QTc prolongation. Few analyses have compared QTc intervals between patients with and without COVID-19, an inflammatory viral condition. The present study used multivariable models to investigate which clinical characteristics were associated with prolonged QTc from baseline in patients with COVID-19 and to isolate the independent association of COVID-19 infection with QTc.

### How does COVID-19 kill at home and what should we do about it? [^113znMQQ]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognizing such behavioural changes is important, because they require appropriate corrective actions, e.g. through public campaigns in which citizens are advised to not defer a call for medical assistance in case of acute complaints, and bystanders to perform CPR as they would in the pre-COVID-19 era. Accordingly, CPR guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council were adapted to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 while providing CPR, and include instructions both for professionals and for citizen-rescuers. These actions are crucial to regain the increases in survival rates after OHCA that were painstakingly gained in the pre-COVID-19 era thanks to an intensive and successful partnership between professionals and citizen-rescuers.

What biological reasons underlie increased OHCA risk during COVID-19? Myocardial injury probably causes many cardiovascular effects of COVID-19, and may result from viral myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and/or other systemic consequences of COVID-19 infection, e.g. sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Myocardial injury may explain increased occurrence of malignant arrhythmias and OHCA, e.g. reentrant arrhythmias supported by myocardial scars. Indeed, elevated biomarker levels of injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are associated with higher risk of mortalityand of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Yet, half of hospitalized patients with malignant arrhythmias have no myocardial injury, suggesting that other factors with direct impact on cardiac electrophysiology enhance their arrhythmia risk. Several mechanisms are plausible, and all converge on blocking of cardiac potassium channels which largely drive cardiac repolarization. First, inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα)] may modulate the function and/or expression of these channels, leading to QT prolongation and increasing the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and OHCA. Clinical indications that inflammatory mediators invoked by viral infection may, in general, cause malignant arrhythmia are an increased incidence of such arrhythmias in carriers of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) during high influenza activity. Moreover, IL-6 inhibits cytochrome P450, which metabolizes various QT-prolonging drugs. This is relevant because some such drugs have been considered as COVID-19 treatments, e.g. chloroquine and azithromycin. Indeed, potentially hazardous QT prolongation was observed in hospitalized patients receiving these drugs. Also, QT prolongation occurs during heart failure secondary to down-regulation of various potassium channels. Finally, QT prolongation may result from psychosocial stress and anxiety, and lead to increased OHCA risk. This is mediated by dysregulation of cardiac ion channels by the autonomic nervous system, in particular, through sympathovagal imbalance.

### Azithromycin (azithromycin dihydrate) [^1148RBdh]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)

Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.

5.4 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:­

­Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^1135HEqg]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Conflicting evidence exists on the association between azithromycin use and cardiac events.

Objective

To compare the odds of cardiac events among new users of azithromycin relative to new users of amoxicillin using real-world data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used data from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2015. Patients receiving either amoxicillin or azithromycin and enrolled in a health care plan 365 days before (baseline period) the dispensing date (index date) were included in the study. Patients were matched 1:1 on high-dimensional propensity scores. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019.

Exposures

New use of azithromycin compared with new use of amoxicillin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome consisted of cardiac events, including syncope, palpitations, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or death as a primary diagnosis for hospitalization at 5, 10, and 30 days from the index date. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.

Results

After matching, the final cohort included 2 141 285 episodes of each index therapy (N = 4 282 570) (mean [SD] age of patients, 35.7[22.3] years; 52.6% female). Within 5 days after therapy initiation, 1474 cardiac events (0.03%) occurred (708 in the amoxicillin cohort and 766 in the azithromycin cohort). The 2 most frequent events were syncope (1032 [70.0%]) and palpitations (331 [22.5%]). The odds of cardiac events with azithromycin compared with amoxicillin were not significantly higher at 5 days (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98–1.20), 10 days (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97–1.15), and 30 days (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04). Among patients receiving any concurrent QT-prolonging drug, the odds of cardiac events with azithromycin were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.04–1.87) greater compared with amoxicillin. Among patients 65 years or older and those with a history of cardiovascular disease and other risk factors, no increased risk of cardiac events with azithromycin was noted.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found no association of cardiac events with azithromycin compared with amoxicillin except among patients using other QT-prolonging drugs concurrently. Although azithromycin is a safe therapy, clinicians should carefully consider its use among patients concurrently using other QT-prolonging drugs.

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^112fRoJ4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This study contributes evidence to the association of cardiac events with azithromycin. Using real-world data from an extensive claims database, we found no increased odds of cardiac events with azithromycin within 5 days after treatment initiation, but a small, clinically relevant association was found among patients concurrently using a QT-prolonging drug. Elderly patients, those with a history of cardiovascular disease, and those with other baseline risk factors had numerically higher odds of cardiac events with azithromycin.

The evidence from previous studies has also suggested a small increase in the absolute risk of cardiac arrhythmias with azithromycin, but such risk, when compared with that of another antibiotic, is negligible. In 2017, Trifirò et alconducted a study using data from 7 European countries and found no increase in cardiac arrhythmias with azithromycin compared with amoxicillin. Our findings are consistent with those of Trifirò et albut not with those of 2 other studies that similarly examined the risk among the US Veterans Health Administrationand Taiwanese cohorts. Compared with other studies, we included a younger cohort (on average, 10 years younger) and did not exclude patients based on their comorbid conditions to make our findings more generalizable. We also included the cardiac events syncope and tachycardia in our outcome definition because we strongly believe both conditions are intermediaries in the sequelae of cardiac arrhythmias. We also controlled for the previously identified factors associated with cardiac events among azithromycin users. Last, we used the high-dimensional propensity score method, whereas previous studies used a traditional propensity scoring method or matching to a control group for confounding. Such differences in cohort, definitions, and study methods could explain the inconsistencies in the findings between the studies.

### Azithromycin-induced proarrhythmia and cardiovascular death [^113viqm2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the possible association between azithromycin and increased cardiovascular risk.

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE (1946-August 2013) was performed using the search terms macrolide, azithromycin, QT prolongation, cardiovascular, and torsade de pointes. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language observational studies assessing the association between azithromycin and QT prolongation or cardiovascular risk were evaluated. Case reports describing this potential association were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

A total of 6 case reports have shown a possible association between azithromycin and QT prolongation. In 3 of these cases, proarrhythmic events were reported. In a prospective observational study of 47 individuals with low cardiovascular risk, electrocardiograms were compared before and after 5 days of azithromycin treatment. Mild prolongation of the QTc was noted, but it was statistically insignificant compared with baseline. No arrhythmias were observed. A large observational cohort study found a small increase in cardiovascular deaths after azithromycin therapy, primarily among patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk. Conversely, a second cohort study involving a population of young to middle-aged adults failed to find an association.

Conclusions

An emerging body of evidence suggests that azithromycin therapy may prolong the QT interval and, in rare cases, precipitate the potentially fatal arrhythmia torsade de pointes. Patients with additional risk factors for QT prolongation appear to be at highest risk, including women, elderly individuals; those with existing or prior history of cardiovascular disease, QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesium, or bradycardia; and those using concomitant drugs associated with QT prolongation. For patients without these additional risk factors, azithromycin appears to be relatively safe.

### Azithromycin [^111LzcCC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Serious heart rhythm changes that can be life-threatening, including heart stopping (cardiac arrest), QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, feeling that your heart is pounding or racing (palpitations), chest discomfort, or irregular heartbeat.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you or your child feel a fast or irregular heartbeat, get dizzy or faint. Azithromycin tablets may cause a rare heart problem known as prolongation of the QT interval. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and can be very dangerous. The chances of this happening are higher in people:

who are elderly
with a family history of prolonged QT interval
with low blood potassium
who take certain medicines to control heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics)
Worsening of myasthenia gravis (a problem that causes muscle weakness).

Certain antibiotics like azithromycin tablets may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems.

Diarrhea. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have watery diarrhea, diarrhea that does not go away, or bloody stools. You may experience cramping and a fever. This could happen after you have finished your azithromycin tablets.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^111oDJPh]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Minimizing the risk for QT prolongation is important for patient safety, particularly since TdP can be fatal. Although there is general agreement on general discontinuation rules (e.g. QT interval, corrected for cardiac frequency, > 500 ms, and increases > 60 ms), the need for baseline QT assessment and timing for electrocardiographic re-assessment may vary depending on the drug, as well as underlying expected susceptibility. General warnings and monitoring guidance are reported in the European summary of product characteristics and US prescribing information, commenting on risk of cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, as well as on the QT prolongation and risk of TdP. However, ECG monitoring is not part of the current standard practice when HCQ is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatological or dermatological conditions, and there is currently insufficient evidence on which to base specific monitoring recommendations.

The "American College of Rheumatology White Paper on Antimalarial Cardiac Toxicity" provided practice considerations on obtaining a baseline ECG in patients with additional risk factors for QT prolongation and avoidance (or deprescribing) additional drugs with known QT-prolonging potential. In this regard, the interactive website crediblemeds.org (and relevant apps) provided updated lists of drugs categorized by their potential to cause QT prolongation and/or TdP (with links to US label and PubMed articles), and additional features such as a list of clinical risk factors associated with QT/TdP risk, also in terms of quality of the evidence (e.g. bradycardia is a strong risk factor for TdP, with high quality of the evidence). For HCQ, ECG monitoring could be considered after 3–4 days of therapy initiation in patients with different patient-, drug- and disease-related risk factors (Figure 1): frail patients with severe renal/liver impairment, cancer, cardiovascular comorbidities (including COVID-19), uncorrected hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia (e.g. due to diuretics or gastrointestinal diseases/malabsorption), and exposure to multiple drugs that can interact via pharmacokinetic (e.g. strong CYP and P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil, azithromycin) and/or pharmacodynamic (potent hERG blockers such as haloperidol) mechanisms. A synopsis of key drugs with QT-prolonging potential and TdP liability is provided in Table 3. Patients should be also educated and involved in shared decision-making about the potential for HCQ cardiac effects as well as the effect of other medications that prolong the QT interval.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^112F77Vf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

AZ has been reported to exhibit antiinflammatory activity. These effects are described as an acute phase inhibition of inflammation and a late phase of resolution of chronic inflammation. HCQ also has antiinflammatory properties and is approved for the treatment of lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. These effects, while unlikely to contribute to antiviral activity, could ameliorate the inflammatory processes caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Furthermore, as bacterial coinfection has been noted in COVID‐19 patients, AZ may have a role in treatment of indicated pathogens.

Although not an approved indication, the combination of AZ and CQ was well tolerated in healthy subjects and patients infected with malaria. Available data on the concomitant use of AZ and CQ in these studies indicated no increased risk of QT prolongation above that of CQ alone. In a recent preprint, it was reported that in COVID‐19 patients (N = 84), 11% of patients treated with an unspecified dosage regimen of HCQ and AZ had recorded QT intervals > 500 msec and 12% of patients had a change from baseline of > 60 msec; there were no events of torsade de pointes recorded.

In conclusion, the literature presented here provides a foundation for the study of AZ combined with HCQ in prospective randomized clinical trials or other control methods defined a priori for the treatment of COVID‐19 that evaluate clinical outcomes, in addition to reductions in viral burden. As of April 8, 2020, there are 19 studies listed on clinicaltrials.gov using the search terms "azithromycin" and "COVID‐19" that will further examine the use of AZ.

COVID-19 resuscitation and arrhythmia management — For cardiac arrest in confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the number of personnel in the room "should be minimized", and "All participants should don PPE before entering the patient's room". Because of aerosolization risk, "consideration should be given to early intubation along with the use of external mechanical compression devices and airborne precautions during intubation". Therapeutically, "At the time of this writing, it is unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19", and "Although we are not recommending any specific treatment, safety guidance for clinicians using hydroxychloroquine may be requested of electrophysiology providers". Hydroxychloroquine "is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and can cause drug-induced long QT", and "The clinical arrhythmic toxicity (syncope and torsade de pointes) is largely limited to chronic use (because of its long half-life of 40 days), use of multiple concomitant QT-prolonging medications (eg, azithromycin)".

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^114WarPm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

There has also been debate over the measurement of the QT interval, and the relative merits of manual vs. machine reading, and uncertainty over the optimal rate correction for the QT interval. The Fridericia correction (1/RR⁰.³³) has been preferred for healthy subjects, whereas the Bazett correction (1/RR⁰.⁵⁰) often performs better in sick patients. This study was sufficiently large and detailed that individual corrections could be derived to avoid any confounding by heart rate. In addition, the circadian rhythm effects on ECG measurements were accounted for by modeling (Figure S5) time‐matched differences. Most clinical reports on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID‐19 prevention and treatment describe the QT interval changes, but they seldom report the other ECG intervals. The QT interval comprises the sum of ventricular depolarization and ventricular repolarization times. These two fundamentally different electrophysiological processes have very different implications for cardiotoxicity. Indeed, in chloroquine overdose, it is the QRS widening (intraventricular conduction delay) that has a greater prognostic value. A major finding of this study is that over one quarter (28.3%) of the observed QT prolongation caused by chloroquine resulted from QRS widening (ventricular depolarization). Nearly all the recent reports and viewpoints cautioning against hydroxychloroquine potential cardiotoxicity (i.e. QT prolongation) have not distinguished between QRS and JT prolongation. Thus, if this same ratio of QRS to JT prolongation observed in this study applies in patients with COVID‐19, then the degree of drug‐induced repolarization delay (and corresponding assumed tachyarrhythmia risk) has been overestimated substantially.

### Considerations for drug interactions on QTc interval in exploratory COVID-19 treatment [^113UsTVJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — QTc/torsade risk overview — reports both drugs as definite torsade de pointes causes, describes occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging QT and provoking torsade when used for systemic lupus erythematosus, and notes azithromycin is recognized as a rare cause of QT prolongation, serious arrhythmias, and increased risk for sudden death with advanced age and female sex implicated as risk factors; azithromycin can also provoke non–pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and an FDA perspective supports vulnerability to QTc prolongation and torsade. The page states the combination's effect on QT interval or arrhythmia risk has not been studied, there are very limited data on combination safety with multiple randomized trials being initiated, and seriously ill patients may have comorbidities increasing arrhythmia risk including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, fever, and an inflammatory state.

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^1127tpnv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Risks of iatrogenic torsades de pointes with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been inferred from the extent of QTc prolongation. These have previously assumed that QT prolongation derives solely from prolongation of ventricular repolarization (JT prolongation), whereas over one quarter derives from QRS widening. The risks of ventricular arrhythmia resulting from therapeutic doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been overestimated.

At the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, there was extensive speculation, intense politicization, and a wide diversity of opinions over the potential value of the 4‐aminoquinolines, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and the macrolide azithromycin, in the prevention and treatment of COVID‐19. This originated with a small study from France claiming therapeutic benefit for a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Following this report, there was widespread use of these drugs in combination across the world, and many countries included them in treatment recommendations. However, opinion swung strongly against hydroxychloroquine following a high‐profile publication describing a large multinational investigation in which hydroxychloroquine treatment of patients with hospitalized with COVID‐19 was associated with lethal cardiotoxicity. This alarming study was soon shown to be fabricated. It was retracted swiftly but, together with the extreme politicization, it left a "toxic milieu" which compromised subsequent research and objective evaluation of the 4‐aminoquinolines. It is now clear from large randomized controlled trials, that neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin benefit patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Whether these drugs provide benefit earlier in the course of disease, or in chemoprevention, remains to be determined.

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^1166ntzQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Q-PROTECT was not powered to assess rare events such as TdP. Neither TdP nor any ventricular dysrhythmia was seen. However, in considering large-scale use of HC ± AZ, even rare risks have important population-level implications. Q-PROTECT's adverse-effect results should not be construed as confirming safety of HC ± AZ. Exploration of rare but significant adverse effects remains the province of larger studies that are more focused on QT assessment.

The study's daily ECGs were judged to provide an acceptable safety margin for detection of significantly prolonged QT or concerning dysrhythmia. However, there remained important QT-related study limitations. The study methodology did not guarantee that for each participant, ECGs would be regularly timed (a few hours after medication dosing), performed by the same machine, and undergo cross-validation (since machine algorithms can over- or underestimate QT). Study participants' QT monitoring in the quarantine environment was characterized by use of different ECG machines, irregularly timed ECG execution, delayed availability of hardcopy ECG tracings, and lack of cross-checking of machine-reported QT. The study data are therefore not suitable for analysis of QT prolongation associated with HC ± AZ. Other investigators using appropriately rigorous methodology have already quantified QT prolongation by HC and AZ, confirming the fact that whatever benefits HC ± AZ may bring, come with attendant risk.

The lessons of Q-PROTECT must be considered in light of the trial strengths and weaknesses, the medication risks and benefits, and the existing evidence base. Taking all of these factors into account, the investigators conclude that HC ± AZ shows no sign of usefulness in the population studied, and that there is low likelihood of undiscovered drug benefits outweighing therapeutic risks.

### Current concepts in the mechanisms and management of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes [^114DuDGd]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is characterized by a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) and increased risk of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). We review mechanisms, predispositions, culprit agents, and management of this potentially fatal phenomenon. Virtually all drugs that prolong QTc block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (I(kr)). Some drugs prolong QTc in a dose-dependent manner, others do so at any dose. Most patients that develop drug-induced TdP have underlying risk factors. Female sex is the most common. Implicated drugs include class 1A and III antiarrhythmics, macrolide antibiotics, pentamidine, antimalarials, antipsychotics, arsenic trioxide, and methadone. Treatment for TdP includes immediate defibrillation for hemodynamic instability and intravenous magnesium sulfate. Potassium levels should be maintained in the high normal range, and all QT prolonging agents must be promptly discontinued.

Results

A total of 490 patients were admitted to our medical center with a verified or suspected diagnosis of COVID‐19 during the study time period, and 314 (64%) were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or the combination (Figure 1). Of these, 192 patients had a 12‐lead ECG performed during treatment, and a subgroup of 98 confirmed COVID infection or patients under investigation (age, 62 ± 17 years; 61% men) met criteria for inclusion in the study (Table 1). Ninety‐two of the excluded patients had either ECGs with indeterminate QT intervals (see Methods) or no ECG on day 2 of medication administration or later, and 2 patients had extreme variation in heart rate, with near doubling of heart rate between baseline and maximal QTc prolongation. Given the limitations of QT interval correction at significantly elevated heart rates, we excluded both patients from the final analysis. Only 1 patient included in the analysis required manual QT measurement using the MUSE electronic calipers and the tangent method of calculation. Of the 98 patients, 73 were COVID‐19 positive and 25 were patients under investigation. Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and the combination in 62%.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112E9Ttn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) long-term macrolide therapy reduces exacerbations but requires individualized risk assessment. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have confirmed a reduction in COPD exacerbations with long-term macrolides, yet the use of macrolides has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in some database studies; in one trial the 1-year incidence of cardiovascular death was minimal (1 out of 558 patients who received a macrolide) when patients with a resting heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, a corrected QT (QTc) interval greater than 450 msec, or use of QT-prolonging/torsades-associated medications were excluded, suggesting that the risk is low if patients are properly selected for macrolide therapy. In addition, chronic use of macrolides may be associated with the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, so macrolides are initiated on a case-by-case basis after carefully weighing the benefits versus risks for each patient.

Conclusions

In this large cohort study including more than 4 million episodes of both azithromycin and amoxicillin use, we found no increased odds of cardiac events with azithromycin in the overall cohort but a significantly higher odds among patients prescribed concurrent QT-prolonging drugs with azithromycin. Alternative antibiotic therapies should be considered among these patients.

Chloroquine and azithromycin effects on electrocardiographic changes

The ECG changes (ΔRR, ΔPR, ΔQRS, ΔQTc, and ΔJTc intervals) were calculated from the difference in the electrocardiographic interval measurements before and after the treatment using time‐matched data in order to adjust for the circadian rhythm effect (Figures 3, S7, and S8). The ECG changes (ΔPR, ΔQRS, ΔJTc, and ΔQTc) were modeled using a linear andrelationships with the observed plasma chloroquine and serum azithromycin concentrations. Thewas not superior to the linear model, and was not retained moving forward. The parameter estimates for the final ECG interval model were estimated precisely (Table 2). The goodness‐of‐fit of the final model is illustrated in Figures S9–S12. The visual predictive check plots for all models of ΔPR, ΔQRS, ΔJTc, and ΔQTc were satisfactory (Figures 4, S13–S16). The placebo‐adjusted ΔΔPR, ΔΔQRS, ΔΔJTc, and ΔΔQTc are presented in Figures 4 and S17–S20. Chloroquine produced concentration‐dependent QRS interval prolongation. The mean (SD; range) maximum QRS prolongation following 1,000 mg of chloroquine phosphate (600 mg base) was 12.1 (3.55; 3.66 to 21.3) ms. This corresponds to a mean (SD; range) increase of 13.5% (4.15%; 3.78 to 24.5%). JT interval prolongation was also concentration‐dependent. The mean (SD; range) maximum JT prolongation following 1,000 mg of chloroquine phosphate (600 mg base) was 30.9 (10.8; −2.02 to 61.8) ms. This corresponded to a mean (SD; range) increase of 9.72% (3.42%; −0.620 to 18.9%). As a result of the prolongation of these two intervals (which added together provide the QT interval), the QT interval prolongation was also concentration‐dependent. The mean (SD; range) maximum QT prolongation following 1,000 mg of chloroquine phosphate (600 mg base) was 38.8 (11.4; 6.66 to 69.1) ms. This corresponded to a mean (SD; range) increase of 9.45% (2.80%; 1.53 to 16.2%; Figures 5 and S21). Chloroquine prolonged the QTc interval by ~ 9.75 ms per 100 ng/mL, of which 28.3% resulted from QRS widening and 71.1% from JTc prolongation. Azithromycin exhibited a minimal effect on these ECG effects when co‐administered with chloroquine (Figure 5). The time course of each effect was tightly correlated, although maximal values did not always coincide.

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^111aQ2cg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this study are that this was a three‐dose evaluation so any effects from longer term administration would not have been observed. The long terminal elimination phase of chloroquine was not captured by this sampling schedule, but the two‐compartment disposition model was sufficient to describe the observed plasma concentrations adequately. Although the electrocardiographic interval effects were tightly correlated, the maximal effects did not always coincide so the sum of the mean maximal reported values for QRS and JT prolongation exceed the maximal QT prolongation value. Uncertainty in QT measurements, particularly in the presence of T‐wave morphology changes associated with strong hERG block, could also contribute to imprecise estimates. This was a healthy volunteer study so any disease interaction, such as myocardial involvement in severe COVID‐19, could not be evaluated.

Within 5 days after treatment initiation, the occurrence of cardiac events among the overall cohort was 0.03% (n = 1474), or 3.4 events per 10 000 episodes (Table 4). The most frequent diagnoses of cardiac events included syncope at 70.0% and palpitations at 22.5%. Seven hundred eight cardiac events occurred in amoxicillin users and 766 in azithromycin users within 5 days. The prevalence of cardiac events within 10 days was 4.9 events per 10 000 episodes; within 30 days, 10.0 events per 10 000 (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

Compared with amoxicillin, the odds of cardiac events within 5 days with azithromycin were similar (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98–1.20) (Table 5). Similar findings were observed when extending the follow-up period to 10 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97–1.15) and 30 (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04) days because there was no association between azithromycin use and cardiac events when compared with amoxicillin. In all subgroups, the rate of events was higher in the azithromycin group; however, none of the events were statistically significant. One exception was when the analysis was restricted to patients using QT-prolonging medications. In this subgroup, the azithromycin users had a 40% increased risk of cardiac events during the 5 days of follow-up when compared with amoxicillin users (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.04–1.87). The results of the sensitivity analyses of unique patients before and after the FDA warning, cardiac events identified from inpatient diagnosis only, and inclusion of patients regardless of their supply duration were consistent with the findings from our base-case analysis.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations of COVID-19: effect on cardiac activation and repolarization [^117P8cq8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

QT interval prolongation, reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is of concern as it may lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Early studies demonstrated marked QT prolongation in critically ill patients, often in the intensive care setting, which was largely attributed to hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. However, cardiac repolarization and QT intervals are affected by other factors such as electrolyte imbalances and other QT prolonging agents. In addition, since QRS duration is also part of the measured QT interval, prolongation of the QRS may also impact QT/corrected QT (QTc).

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may itself directly and/or indirectly involve the heart. Viral particles have been identified in myocardial tissue. Myocardial injuryand elevation in biomarkers such as troponin and b-natriuretic peptide (BNP) have been identified early in COVID-19 presentation. Viral myocarditis in other settings is rarely associated with QT interval prolongation, but may also be a factor in infected patients.

We hypothesize that electrocardiogram (ECG) changes described in patients with COVID-19 are related to direct and indirect cardiac involvement of the virus and to severity of disease. We performed our analysis on the initial ECG's of patients with COVID-19 as they first arrived in the emergency department (ED), prior to interventions or exposure to QT prolonging drugs. Analyzing activation and repolarization (represented on the ECG by QRS and QTc) at this early time point provides unique insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the electrophysiologic properties of the heart.

Data Collection and Definitions

We compared standard 12‐lead ECG parameters, including the QTc (Bazett formula) from the baseline ECG closest to and before medication administration, with the longest QTc observed postmedication administration, up to 24 hours after the last medication dose. Given variability in heart rates, QTc prolongation was also evaluated using the Fridericia formula for correction of the QT interval. QT measurements were independently reviewed and validated by a cardiologist (A.R.) to ensure accuracy of the automated measurement and manually remeasured if required. Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 groups, depending on which medication they received: azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or azithromycin+hydroxychloroquine. Patient demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, and medications were obtained from detailed chart review, including risk factors to calculate the Tisdale score 12 and the Elixhauser comorbidity index 13 for each patient. The Tisdale score consists of age ≥ 68 years, female sex, use of loop diuretics, potassium level ≤ 3.5 mEq/L, baseline QTc ≥ 450 ms, acute myocardial infarction, number of QT‐prolonging medications, sepsis, and heart failure and has been developed as a risk score for QTc prolongation. The Elixhauser comorbidity index incorporates 21 different variables, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, HIV, and cancer, and is used to predict in‐hospital mortality.

Outcome

The outcome of interest was postmedication critical QTc prolongation, defined as follows: (1) maximum postmedication QTc ≥ 500 ms (if QRS < 120 ms) or QTc ≥ 550 ms (if QRS ≥ 120 ms) and (2) mean increase from baseline QTc to maximum postmedication QTc of ≥ 60 ms. 14, 15

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Chloroquine is one of the most extensively used antimalarial drugs worldwide. Azithromycin is a very widely used antibiotic. They have very good safety records. The two drugs together have been evaluated in malaria prevention and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) treatment. Both prolong the electrocardiograph QT interval. It has been widely hypothesized that this could result in cardiotoxicity (ventricular tachyarrhythmias).
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

This study examined whether chloroquine and azithromycin have any pharmacokinetic or cardiac pharmacodynamic interaction. It also characterized the concentration‐effect relationships for electrocardiographic effects to inform risk assessments.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

Chloroquine was found to cause concentration‐dependent prolongation of the PR, QRS, JTc, and QTc intervals without any significant additional effects of azithromycin co‐administration. The concentration‐dependent QRS widening (ventricular depolarization) contributed over one quarter of the QT prolongation.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

### QT interval prolongation under hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin association for inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 lower respiratory tract infection [^1143dRjo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Association between Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZT) is under evaluation for patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Both drugs have a known torsadogenic potential, but sparse data are available concerning QT prolongation induced by this association. Our objective was to assess for COVID-19 LRTI variations of QT interval under HCQ/AZT in patients hospitalized, and to compare manual versus automated QT measurements. Before therapy initiation, a baseline 12 lead-ECG was electronically sent to our cardiology department for automated and manual QT analysis (Bazett and Fridericia's correction), repeated 2 days after initiation. According to our institutional protocol (Pasteur University Hospital), HCQ/AZT was initiated only if baseline QTc ≤ 480ms and potassium level > 4.0 mmol/L. From March 24 th to April 20 th 2020, 73 patients were included (mean age 62 ± 14 years, male 67%). Two patients out of 73 (2.7%) were not eligible for drug initiation (QTc ≥ 500 ms). Baseline average automated QTc was 415 ± 29 ms and lengthened to 438 ± 40 ms after 48 hours of combined therapy. The treatment had to be stopped because of significant QTc prolongation in two out of 71 patients (2.8%). No drug-induced life-threatening arrhythmia, nor death was observed. Automated QTc measurements revealed accurate in comparison with manual QTc measurements. In this specific population of inpatients with COVID-19 LRTI, HCQ/AZT could not be initiated or had to be interrupted in less than 6% of the cases.

### Azithromycin / chloroquine combination does not increase cardiac instability despite an increase in monophasic action potential duration in the anesthetized Guinea pig [^114Rj28j]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the electrocardiogram QT interval by some, but not all drugs, has been associated with increased incidence of sudden cardiac death. Current preclinical regulatory assays cannot discriminate the arrhythmia liability of these drugs. Consequently, many new medications that prolong the QT interval are not developed despite their potential therapeutic benefit. Alternans (action potential duration alternations) is a measure of cardiac instability in humans and animals associated with the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Due to potential arrhythmia risk from observed QT prolongation, alternans was assessed in the anesthetized guinea pig after azithromycin or chloroquine alone and after combination treatment at clinically relevant concentrations proposed for the management of malaria. Chloroquine alone, but not azithromycin, caused a profound increase in action potential duration but with only minimal effects on alternans (approximately 10 ms). Azithromycin alone and in combination with chloroquine showed no increase in alternans beyond vehicle baseline responses indicating no additional arrhythmia liability.

Conclusions

In this large cohort study of hospitalized patients at a quaternary academic medical institution in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that COVID-19 infection was independently associated with longer modeled QTc intervals from baseline, and patients at higher risk were 80 years or older, had elevated high-sensitivity troponin, or had significant kidney dysfunction. One-quarter of patients with COVID-19 not receiving hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin experienced QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported rarely in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)]

Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy is discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)

Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.

5.4 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:

patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure
patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^112xZoPK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths. Given a large cohort without many inclusion and exclusion criteria, our findings are likely to be generalizable to the entire population in the United States. We used a robust method and an extensive list of previously identified confounders to control for confounding.

Our findings are to be interpreted within the context of observational studies and their limitations. First, retrospective observational studies are always prone to unmeasured confounding and measurement error. Despite the large denominator, the power of the study was low. We used data from administrative health care claims, which are primarily used for billing and not research purposes. We were unable to ascertain essential risk factors, including race, smoking status, use of over-the-counter drugs, abnormal electrolyte levels, recent QT-interval prolongation, or body mass index because these variables were not available in the database. Because we could not measure these factors, we used high-dimensional propensity scores in our study such that proxies of these unmeasured confounders might be included, resulting in balance across the exposure groups. Although we were able to measure the outcome of death using ICD-9-CM codes, we know this would underestimate the number of deaths because we lacked information on death occurring in settings other than during an inpatient hospitalization. From our database, we did not have access to the reasons for death (cardiac vs no cardiac). As a result, our study findings should be interpreted in the context of risk of cardiac events and not death.

We analyzed changes in QTc interval after starting chronic azithromycin in a pediatric CF population. Adolescent males showed increased QTc intervals after initiation of therapy. Given the possible effects of azithromycin on the QTc interval, particularly in patients predisposed to cardiac events, we suggest that the QTc interval of CF patients should be monitored throughout the course of chronic azithromycin.

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^115TG8kj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite a lack of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (‐19). Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated withinterval prolongation.

Methods and Results

We analyzed a case series of‐19–positive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedicationinterval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12‐leads. Criticalc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximumc ≥ 500 ms (if < 120 ms) orc ≥ 550 ms (if ≥ 120 ms) and (2)c increase of ≥ 60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490‐19–positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73‐19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 62 ± 17 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline meanc was 448 ± 29 ms and increased to 459 ± 36 ms (P = 0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18 ± 43 ms versus −0.2 ± 28 ms in women; P = 0.02). A total of 12% of patients reached criticalc prolongation. Changes inc were highest with the combination compared with either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination versus azithromycin (17 ± 39 ms versus 0.5 ± 40 ms; P = 0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes.

Conclusions

Overall, 12% of patients manifested criticalc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating‐19 patients should be carefully assessed.

### Cost-effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to prevent maternal infection, sepsis, or death in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis of data from a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial [^112pGXEE]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Although the results of the A-PLUS trial and this cost-effectiveness analysis were promising, real-world implementation of intrapartum azithromycin requires several additional considerations. Azithromycin carries a risk of QT interval prolongation and fatal arrhythmias per US Federal Drug Administration data. Given this risk, the A-PLUS trial excluded women with arrhythmias or known cardiomyopathy. Recommendations for large-scale implementation of azithromycin should include clinical algorithms that limit its use among women at high risk of side-effects (eg, those with underlying cardiac disease including proarrhythmic conditions or known prolongation of the QT interval, or those taking concurrent medications that prolong the QT interval). The potential effect of recommending large-scale administration of antibiotic prophylaxis with intrapartum azithromycin on both maternal and neonatal AMR and the microbiome should be noted. There are few published data on long-term adverse outcomes and AMR following such administration. Following intrapartum azithromycin administration in The Gambia and Burkina Faso, Escherichia coli carriage in infants decreased but Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage and azithromycin resistance in both bacteria increased. The NICHD Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research is evaluating AMR and the microbiome as a sub-study of the A-PLUS trial, with both maternal and neonatal surveillance conducted up to 12 months postpartum. The results of this study will be particularly important to understand unintended effects of the intervention and their implications for real-world programmes. Future cost-effectiveness analyses of intrapartum azithromycin should be expanded to include the economic effect of AMR and microbiome effects.

In conclusion, we found intrapartum azithromycin results in net savings of $0·33 per person giving birth in LMICs; this result translates to spending $0·91 to get back $1·24 per woman planning a vaginal birth. Although local conditions, such as the cost of azithromycin or the cost of a facility admission might differ, the intervention was cost saving or cost-effective in most countries analysed. This evidence supports global consideration of intrapartum azithromycin as an economically efficient preventive therapy to reduce infection, sepsis, or death among women planning a vaginal birth in LMICs. There is a crucial need for further studies to delineate the implications of large-scale implementation of azithromycin prophylaxis on AMR and clinical risks; the results of such studies should be incorporated into future cost-effectiveness analyses. Future trials should also consider the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to non-antibiotic interventions (eg, infection prevention and control, improving quality of intrapartum care, and health promotion strategies) aimed at reducing maternal sepsis.

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^114keSZ7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Population pharmacokinetics and chloroquine concentration‐dependent ECG effects in healthy volunteers with chloroquine and azithromycin administration were characterized accurately in this large open‐label randomized healthy volunteer study. Plasma chloroquine and serum azithromycin concentrations were explained satisfactorily by two‐ and three‐compartment disposition models, respectively. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs. Chloroquine caused concentration‐dependent delays in atrioventricular (PR interval) and intraventricular depolarization (QRS interval) and repolarization (JTc interval). Over one quarter of the QTc prolongation resulted from QRS prolongation, which suggests that the arrhythmogenic risk inferred from QT prolongation measurement alone has been overestimated substantially.

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^1162UYZb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

At a single large community medical center, we studied 98 COVID‐19–positive or COVID‐19–suspected patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, administered either individually or in combination. Although lethal arrhythmias were not observed during the limited period of observation, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation was many‐fold higher when hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were administered in combination compared with azithromycin alone. Moreover, patients who achieved critical QTc prolongation were not distinguished by significantly higher Tisdale scores, nor by higher Elixhauser comorbidity indexes.

Our finding of greatest QTc prolongation in the combined hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin group is important. In our study, patients with lower values of QTc at baseline were more likely to be started on the combination of the 2 medications. In contrast, patients with a higher baseline QTc were more likely to receive either hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin rather than the combination. This suggests that prescription practice may have been driven by a concern about excessive QTc prolongation with the use of both medications in combination. Further review of our data showed that some practitioners decided on a staggered dosing regimen of one drug followed by the other drug later in the hospital stay. However, given the prolonged half‐lives of these medications, such practice still results in a combined drug effect on the QTc.

### Use of clarithromycin and roxithromycin and risk of cardiac death: cohort study [^113B4YSj]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Of note, the results suggested that the overall increase in risk with clarithromycin was largely driven by a strong association in women, although the difference in risk compared with men narrowly failed to reach statistical significance. This finding is consistent with female sex being a known risk factor for drug induced cardiac arrhythmia in general and macrolide induced arrhythmia in particular. In the previous studies that found increased risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular death with macrolides, subgroup analyses by sex were not reported. In our subgroup analysis by predicted risk score, the rates of cardiac death increased considerably with increasing risk score. No indication of a differential risk according to levels of baseline risk was, however, observed.

In sensitivity analysis, we observed an increase in risk with clarithromycin only in people with no previous antibiotic courses during the study period. This increased risk in first time users could point towards the possibility of a genetic predisposition, which has previously been suggested to underlie drug induced torsade de pointes. Prolongation of the QT interval and subsequent serious arrhythmia are thought to be the underlying mechanisms for acute cardiac toxicity with macrolides. Individual macrolides vary in their potency of I Kr inhibition and thus potential for QT prolongation and, therefore, potentially have different pro-arrhythmic properties. Notably, available mechanistic data comparing individual macrolides suggest that clarithromycin has higher potency of I Kr inhibition compared with roxithromycin. If true, the observed increased risk with clarithromycin but not roxithromycin may represent a clinical manifestation of these differing pharmacodynamic properties. Our study expands on the available knowledge of the cardiac safety of macrolides, being the first large scale population based observational study to show significantly increased cardiac risk with clarithromycin and the relative cardiac safety of roxithromycin.

ECG Characteristics

Of note, multiple patterns were observed for use, duration, and dosage of both medications. Although most patients (81.6%) received at least a 5‐day course of each medication, there were many patients who received a higher dose on day 1 compared with the dosage on days 2 to 5. For example, azithromycin was given either orally or intravenously, and the dosage was either 500 mg daily or 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily on days 2 to 5. For hydroxychloroquine, most patients (87.0%) received 400 mg orally twice daily before receiving a dosage of 200 mg orally twice daily on days 2 to 5. The medications were started together (50.8%), staggered by 1 day (29.5%), or administered > 1 day after the other (19.7%). Patients with lower values of QTc at baseline were more likely to be started on the combination of the 2 medications. In contrast, patients with a higher baseline QTc were more likely to receive either hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin rather than the combination.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113oUfwH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin — QT prolongation risk and monitoring are highlighted with quantitative signals and conditional actions: One randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggests increased risk of QT prolongation with HCQ+AZ vs no HCQ (RR: 8.50; 95% CI: 1.16, 62.31; Low CoE), and two studies reported significant QT prolongation in 10 of 95 HCQ+AZ recipients. A case-control study found higher QTc metrics with HCQ+AZ among COVID-19 cases vs healthy controls, including minimum (415 vs. 376 ms), mean (453 vs. 407 ms) and maximum QTc-interval (533 vs. 452 ms) with cases (n = 22) vs controls (n = 34). Additional reports note risk of prolonged QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia with AZ alone, and a large cohort observed increased sudden cardiac death risk during a five-day AZ course (HR 2.71 [1.58–4.64] vs 0.85 [0.45–1.60] compared to no antibiotic or amoxicillin, respectively). Given cumulative conduction effects with HCQ and AZ, if used together, baseline and follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring would be indicated along with careful surveillance for other QT‑prolonging medications. Although azithromycin has a low risk for cytochrome P450 interactions, gastrointestinal effects and QT prolongation should be carefully considered, particularly in the outpatient setting where frequent ECG monitoring is not feasible.

### Azithromycin use increases the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with hemodialysis-dependent kidney failure [^116FXp1j]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic with QT-prolonging potential commonly prescribed to individuals receiving hemodialysis. Hemodialysis patients have a high prevalence of clinical conditions, such as structural heart disease, that can enhance the pro-arrhythmic effects azithromycin, but were excluded from prior investigations evaluating the cardiac safety of azithromycin. Using data from the United States Renal Data System (2007–2017), we conducted two cohort studies to examine the cardiac safety of azithromycin relative to amoxicillin-based antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and levofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone antibiotic known to prolong the QT-interval) in the hemodialysis population. The primary outcome was five-day sudden cardiac death. Using inverse probability of treatment weighted survival models, we estimated hazard ratios, risk differences, and 95% confidence intervals. The azithromycin vs. amoxicillin-based antibiotic cohort included 282,899 patients and 725,431 treatment episodes (381,306 azithromycin and 344,125 amoxicillin-based episodes). Azithromycin vs. amoxicillin-based antibiotic treatment was associated with higher relative and absolute risks of sudden cardiac death, weighted hazard ratio of 1.70 (95% Confidence Interval, 1.36 to 2.11) and weighted risk difference per 100,000 treatment episodes of 25.0 (15.5 to 36.5). The azithromycin vs. levofloxacin cohort included 245,143 patients and 554,557 treatment episodes (387,382 azithromycin and 167,175 levofloxacin episodes). Azithromycin vs. levofloxacin treatment was associated with lower relative and absolute risks of sudden cardiac death, weighted hazard ratio of 0.79 (0.64 to 0.96) and weighted risk difference per 100,000 treatment episodes of -18.9 (-35.5 to -3.8). Thus, when selecting among azithromycin, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin-based antibiotics, clinicians should weigh the relative antimicrobial benefits of these drugs against their potential cardiac risks.

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^1124ecwg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Another interesting finding in our study was that men had significantly higher mean QTc prolongation than women. The incidence of torsades de pointes is known to be higher in women, and female sex is listed as a risk factor in the Tisdale score for QT prolongation. The reasons for this discrepancy still need to be explained, but this could be related to the majority of patients in our case series being men. Because rates of high Tisdale scores and Elixhauser comorbidity indexes were also not significantly varied between the sexes, this finding cannot be explained by differences in overall morbidity burden, and would benefit from further study.

Overall, our findings support the need to monitor the QTc during the period that these 2 medications are administered, especially when used in combination. We were not able to distinguish patients more likely to have critical QTc prolongation by the Tisdale score or Elixhauser index, making monitoring during medication administration likely to be a safer approach. 14 In addition to QTc prolongation as a result of KCNH2‐encoded hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel blockage, both drugs can provoke potentially lethal arrhythmias by additional mechanisms. 16, 17 In fact, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with azithromycin has been reported in the absence of QTc prolongation. 18 Given that critical QTc prolongation was observed with both administration of azithromycin (n = 5) and the combination of hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin (n = 7), monitoring of the QTc should not be restricted to the combination of these drugs alone. This is consistent with the 2013 black box warning issued by the Food and Drug Administration on the increased risk of torsades de pointes with azithromycin.

### Association of azithromycin use with cardiovascular mortality [^1156yHfi]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Azithromycin, a macrolide, is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the US, with an estimated 44.9 million prescriptions dispensed to outpatients in 2016. A safety concern was raised following a study by Ray et al in 2012that reported an association of azithromycin use with sudden cardiac death. Prompted by concern over QT prolongation and reports of cardiac deaths, the US Food and Drug Administration made changes to the product labeling between 2011 and 2013 advising against using azithromycin in patients with known risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia.

Epidemiological studies, subsequent to Ray et alhave produced conflicting results regarding an association between azithromycin and cardiac events. Of 6 epidemiological studies subsequently published, 3 reported an increased risk of cardiovascular deaths, serious cardiac arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction, and 3 reported no such associations. The conflicting results reported may, in part, be due to differences in the study populations, outcome measures, methods of confounding control, exposure risk periods, and statistical methods. In particular, studies have been limited in their ability to control for key confounders, such as indication for use.

In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration and the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee requested the manufacturer of azithromycin conduct additional epidemiological investigations to evaluate the association of azithromycin use with cardiovascular mortality. The primary objectives of this study were to estimate the relative and absolute risks of cardiovascular death and sudden cardiac death within 5 days and within 6 to 10 days of a dispensed azithromycin prescription among individuals aged 30 to 74 years.

### Cardiovascular safety of azithromycin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a prespecified pooled analysis of the COALITION I and COALITION II randomized clinical trials [^112J6U7i]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular safety from azithromycin in the treatment of several infectious diseases has been challenged. In this prespecified pooled analysis of 2 multicenter randomized clinical trials, we aimed to assess whether the use of azithromycin might lead to corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation or clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias. In the COALITION COVID Brazil I trial, 667 patients admitted with moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated to hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, or standard of care. In the COALITION COVID Brazil II trial, 447 patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly allocated to hydroxychloroquine alone versus hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. The principal end point for the present analysis was the composite of death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or ventricular arrhythmias. The addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine did not result in any prolongation of the QTc interval (425.8 ± 3.6 ms vs 427.9 ± 3.9 ms, respectively, mean difference -2.1 ms, 95% confidence interval -12.5 to 8.4 ms, p = 0.70). The combination of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine compared with hydroxychloroquine alone did not result in increased risk of the primary end point (proportion of patients with events at 15 days 17.2% vs 16.0%, respectively, hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.49, p = 0.65). In conclusion, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 already receiving standard-of-care management (including hydroxychloroquine), the addition of azithromycin did not result in the prolongation of the QTc interval or increase in cardiovascular adverse events. Because azithromycin is among the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents, our results may inform clinical practice. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT04322123, NCT04321278.

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^114aQ8HB]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Azithromycin is a widely prescribed antibiotic. More than 30 million prescriptions of azithromycin are dispensed every year in the United States. Compared with other macrolide antibiotics that carry some adverse cardiac risks, azithromycin was considered safest because of its lower arrhythmogenic activity.

More than 10 years after the drug's approval in the United States, an early signal from case reports described QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes (TdP), and ventricular tachycardia after the use of azithromycin. Since then, several retrospective, observational studies have investigated the risk of cardiac events with outpatient azithromycin use. In 2012, a study by Ray et alfound a 2.9-fold higher risk of cardiac deaths within 5 days of an initial dispensing of azithromycin compared with amoxicillin. The risk was higher among patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to caution prescribing azithromycin in patients with known risk factors, such as existing QT interval prolongation, TdP, electrolyte abnormalities, uncompensated heart failure, bradycardia, and concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval. Since then, 4 more studies, have examined the cardiac risks with azithromycin by measuring cardiac deaths, cardiac events such as ventricular arrhythmias, or both. Three of 5 studies, found an increased risk of deaths or arrhythmias with azithromycin. Two meta-analyses, evaluating evidence from randomized clinical trials and observational studies found no significant increase in cardiac events. In a recent study, we showed that the prevalence of cardiac risk factors among azithromycin users remained similar before and after the FDA warning. Thus, despite the FDA warning, prescribing practices do not seem to have been modified. This outcome may be owing to the inconsistency in the results from the previous studies, which indicates a need to continue to evaluate this potential association.

Our present objective was to investigate the association of cardiac events among patients treated with azithromycin and amoxicillin using an active-control, new-user design. Moreover, we sought to evaluate the risk in prespecified subgroups that include elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, patients using concurrent QT-prolonging drugs before and after the FDA warning from May 2012, and the presence of risk factors identified from previous studies.

developing this condition include those with known risk factors such as existing QT interval prolongation, low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, a slower than normal heart rate, or use of certain drugs used to treat abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. This communication is a result of our review of a study by medical researchers as well as another study by a. specific, rare heart rhythm abnormality. Information has also been added regarding the results of a clinical QT study which showed that azithromycin can prolong the QTc interval. Health care professionals should consider the risk of fatal heart rhythms with azithromycin when considering treatment options for patients who are already at risk for cardiovascular. events.

FDA notes that the potential risk of QT prolongation with azithromycin should be placed in appropriate context when choosing an antibacterial drug: Alternative drugs in the macrolide class, or non-macrolides such as the fluoroquinolones, also have the potential for QT prolongation.

-. therapy. The increase in total deaths was due to cardiovascular deaths and not due to an increase in deaths from other causes.

The excess risk of cardiovascular death, especially of sudden death, is consistent with arrhythmias from drug-related QT prolongation. FDA also evaluated the results of a clinical QT study conducted by the manufacturer assessing. the effects of azithromycin on the QT interval in adults. The results of the study indicated that azithromycin prolonged the QTc interval. Information regarding the results of the QT study has been added to the Zithromax drug label. References 1.

### Long-term azithromycin use is not associated with QT prolongation in children with cystic fibrosis [^111ByKwC]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic Azithromycin (AZM) is a common treatment for lung infection. Among adults at risk of cardiac events, AZM use has been associated with cardiovascular harm. We assessed cardiovascular safety of AZM among children with CF, as a secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled, clinical trial, in which study drug was taken thrice-weekly for a planned 18 months. Safety assessments using electrocardiogram (ECG) occurred at study enrollment, and then after 3 weeks and 18 months of participation. Among 221 study participants with a median of 18 months follow-up, increased corrected QT interval (QTc) of ≥ 30 msec was rare, at 3.4 occurrences per 100 person-years; and incidence of QTc prolongation was no higher in the AZM arm than the placebo arm (1.8 versus 5.4 per 100 person-years). No persons experienced QTc intervals above 500 msec. Long-term chronic AZM use was not associated with increased QT prolongation.

ITU, West Hertfordshire Hospital, Cambridge, UK

Critical Care 2021, 25 (Suppl 1): P047

Introduction: Several reports linked the use of repurposed drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir /ritonavir with QT prolongation in patient with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: Conducting retrospective analysis of critically ill patient admitted to ICU with prolonged QT interval definded as QT more than 500 ms. Patient demographics, baseline characteristics, laboratory values and medications known or suspected to prolong QT interval were collected.

Results: Out of the 111 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Qtc was significantly prolonged in 47 of them, patient with history if cardiac disease/surgery showed higher proportion of significant prolonged QTc. Additionally patient with hypokalemia, male patient had higher degree of QT prolongation. Respectively a total of 46 patient received HCQ, 28 received lopinavir and 5 received azithromycin. Multivariate regression analysis showed that cardiac disease was the only independent factor associated with significant prolonged QTc.

Conclusions: The prevalence of clinically significant QTC prolongation in critically ill patient with SARS-CoV-2 was high and independent of drug used.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

Since the mean Cmaxof azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hr is higher than the mean Cmaxof azithromycin following the administration of a 1,500 mg oral dose, it is possible that QTc may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one hour infusion of 500 mg.

### Evaluation of baseline corrected QT interval and azithromycin prescriptions in an academic medical center [^111WFK2o]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Azithromycin is used in the inpatient setting for a variety of conditions. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration released a warning regarding risk for corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and subsequent arrhythmias. Knowledge of inpatient prescribing patterns of QTc prolonging medications with respect to patient risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events can help recognize safe use in light of these new warnings.

Objective

To assess inpatient prescribing patterns, risk factors for QTc prolongation, and relationship between drug-drug interactions and cardiac monitoring in patients receiving azithromycin.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

One hundred inpatients ≥ 19 years of age were randomly selected from 1610 patient encounters between October 2012 and April 2013 who were administered at least 1 dose of azithromycin.

Measurements

Length of stay, reason for use, therapy duration, and concomitant medications were recorded. Telemetry charges and baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to administration were assessed.

Results

Seventy-nine percent of azithromycin use was empiric. Sixty-five percent of patients received a baseline ECG prior to prescribing azithromycin, of which 60% had borderline or abnormal QTc prolongation. Seventy-six percent of patients were prescribed 2 or more QTc prolonging medications, of which there were more abnormal ECGs at baseline (P = 0.03) despite having telemetry ordered less than half of the time.

Conclusions

In a cohort of hospitalized patients, azithromycin was prescribed despite risk factors for QTc prolongation and administration of interacting medications. Selection of azithromycin by providers appears to be independent from these risk factors, and education and vigilance to drug-drug interactions may be useful in limiting cardiac events with prescribing azithromycin.

### Risk of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multinational, retrospective study [^113RiqMi]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

In addition, QT lengthening is a known side-effect of all macrolides, including azithromycin, and physicians already use caution when prescribing macrolides concurrently with other medications that can interact to increase the QT interval. In this study, a relative risk of 2·19 (95% CI 1·22–3·94) for cardiovascular death was seen even with short-term hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin combination therapy, probably arising through their synergistic effects on QT length and subsequent induction of lethal arrhythmia. Considering that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are both contraindicated for use in patients with cardiac arrhythmias, this study assumes that clinicians are prescribing these medications for patients as per existing labelling advice. It is therefore concerning that cardiovascular effects were still seen in our study populations, possibly indicating that the true risks of these drugs are understated in the analysis.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose (two 250 mg tablets) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers, the mean (SD) pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC₀–₇₂ = 4.3 (1.2) mcg•h/mL; Cmax = 0.5 (0.2) mcg/mL; Tmax = 2.2 (0.9) hours. Two azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to a single 500 mg tablet. In a two-way crossover study, 12 adult healthy volunteers (6 males, 6 females) received 1500 mg of azithromycin administered in single daily doses over either 5 days (two 250 mg tablets on day 1, followed by one 250 mg tablet on days 2 to 5) or 3 days (500 mg per day for days 1 to 3). Due to limited serum samples on day 2 (3-day regimen) and days 2 to 4 (5-day regimen), the serum concentration-time profile of each subject was fit to a 3-compartment model and the AUC₀-∞ for the fitted concentration profile was comparable between the 5-day and 3-day regimens.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^113fakDf]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Overall, the limited and low-quality evidence does not endorse azithromycin's widespread use in the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, monotherapy is safe and therefore justifiable in a clinical trial setting. The data at least urges close monitoring when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs like hydroxychloroquine, or when other risk factors for long QT exist. A risk mitigation strategy such as applying strict ECG criteria to initiate (eg, only if QTc < 450) and halt (eg, if QTc exceeds 500 ms or increases > 60 ms since start of treatment) azithromycin may be warranted.

### Azithromycin dihydrate (azithromycin) [^111ideqc]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that the allergic symptoms may reappear after symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)

Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.

5.4 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation, which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:

patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure
patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### QT interval prolongation and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19… [^112GwpSa]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The overall median baseline QTc was 455 milliseconds. Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median change in QT interval compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone. Seven patients who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more.

Although the baseline QTc was shorter in patients receiving concomitant azithromycin compared with those taking hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with a greater change in QTc compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. Hydroxychloroquine is structurally and mechanistically similar to the class IA antiarrhythmic quinidine, which inhibits voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, prolonging the QT interval and increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death. 6 Azithromycin also has been implicated in QTc. It remains possible that the true degree of QTc prolongation was underestimated, given clinical practice variation and a limited follow-up period: 45 patients remained hospitalized, and 19 patients had no follow-up electrocardiograms.

However, for the observed duration, ΔQTc and prolongation findings aligned with preliminary reports of significant QTc prolongation in 11% to 25% of patients. 8, 13 Higher-risk groups may not have been represented, because institutional guidance recommended against hydroxychloroquine for individuals with prolonged baseline QTc intervals.

### Pharmacogenomics of COVID-19 therapies [^114rF3gA]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of clinical implications of pharmacogenomics for COVID-19

We found evidence that several genetic variants may alter the pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir and possibly tocilizumab, which hypothetically may affect clinical response and toxicity in the treatment of COVID-19. Although the level of evidence for most is weak, and has not been directly studied in patients with COVID-19, some of these potential pharmacogenetic associations are worth further exploration.

QT prolongation could hypothetically be exacerbated by a combination of drug–drug, drug–gene, and drug–disease interactions in the treatment of COVID-19. As previously described in this review, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and azithromycin can individually increase risk for QT prolongation, and those drugs have been used in combination in COVID-19 patients. This combination therapy showed higher odds of cardiac arrest in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in comparison to those on neither therapy (odds ratio 2.13 [95% CI: 1.12–4.05]). Hydroxychloroquine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor, which calls for a vigilance in drug–drug interactions in patients with COVID-19, who are at risk of polypharmacy. In particular, some QT-prolonging drugs, that are commonly used in hospitalized patients, are substrates of CYP2D6 which may be inhibited by hydroxychloroquine. This may dramatically increase the risk of QT prolongation. The CYP2D6✱4 nonfunctional allele is present in nearly 20% of patients with European ancestry, and thus patients with the CYP2D6✱4 allele may have even higher risk. Patients with the ABCB1 2677GG/3435CC genotype have higher peak concentrations of azithromycin, a QT-prolonging drug. Higher concentrations of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine may be particularly dangerous. Baseline QT interval evaluation prior to therapy is important since there is a greater risk of prolongation in individuals with high baseline values. The prevalence of high baseline QT intervals was reported to be 14.5% among those aged ≥ 40 years in a US population study. And finally, the potential combination of these arrhythmogenic risks may be further exacerbated in the setting of COVID-19, in which the disease is associated with myocardial injury and arrhythmias.

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^11498ahE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Before the COVID‐19 pandemic, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine had been used extensively over the past 70 years for malaria and rheumatic diseases, respectively, and azithromycin has been the first‐line treatment for bacterial infections for over 2 decades. These are among the most widely used anti‐infective drugs ever, and they have a very good record of tolerability and safety. Several billion chloroquine treatments have been given since the 1950s. Azithromycin has been given to hundreds of millions of healthy children in trachoma elimination programs. The main concern for both drugs has been the potential for cardiovascular toxicity and, in particular, the potential for lethal ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes (TdP)) as a consequence of delayed ventricular repolarization (reflected in the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval). Some observational studies suggested potentiation of QT prolongation when azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine are combined for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, but others did not. Concern over the potential for cardiotoxicity in COVID‐19 prevention or treatment has resulted in numerous commentaries, reviews, expressions of concern, and advisory statements, but little detailed prospective investigation. Meanwhile, a series of large randomized controlled trials and observational studies have provided reassuring evidence on cardiovascular safety.,

During the development of chloroquine and azithromycin as a potential combination for intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy, a large and detailed evaluation was performed in healthy volunteers, which provided important pharmacometric data to characterize the effect of chloroquine on the electrocardiographic intervals and the interaction with azithromycin. These data were used to evaluate the population pharmacokinetic and electrocardiographic effects of chloroquine and azithromycin.

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^111fx98B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Prescribing practices for azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine amid the COVID‐19 pandemic were found to be diverse, but most patients in our study received a combination of the 2 drugs. Among patients prescribed azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both, 12% achieved a critical level of QTc prolongation. QTc values were highest with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with QTc prolongation many‐fold higher in the combination group than with azithromycin alone. Especially if ongoing clinical trials indicate benefit from use of these medications, these findings could inform clinical therapeutics and ECG monitoring in COVID‐19 patients.

Table 1
Medline published studies that assess the effect of AZ in COVID-19

Studies that assess azithromycin monotherapy versus standard of care in hospitalised patients report a wide effect range, from a decreased adjusted OR for mortality of 0.60 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.85) in the retrospective cohort of Albani et al to a non-significantly increased adjusted OR of 1.30 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.64) in Kuderer et al. Even more heterogeneity is seen in studies that assess the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine, with a survival benefit (adjusted HR of 0.294; 95% CI 0.218 to 0.396) seen by Arshad et al, opposed to a significantly increased 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 2.93; 95% CI 1.79 to 4.79) reported again by Kuderer et al. In an outpatient setting, Guérin et al reported a significant reduction in the mean time to clinical recovery with azithromycin (12.9 days with azithromycin vs 25.8 days without; p < 0.0001). A significant difference in hospitalisation risk was, however, not withheld by Szente et al.(adjusted OR for azithromycin-containing vs no-azithromycin-containing regimens 0.93; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.90). The increased mortality reported for hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination by Kuderer et al together with increased incidence of adverse events of this regimen in Rosenberg et al and the randomised controlled trial of Cavalcanti et al strengthen the concerns about QT-prolonging drug–drug interactions. Importantly, no studies reported a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes with azithromycin monotherapy. Cavalcanti et al did not assess efficacy of azithromycin monotherapy, but found no increased adverse events in this treatment group, whereas QTc prolongation and increased transaminases were seen in the hydroxychloroquine containing regimens. Similarly, Rosenberg et al reported an increased incidence of cardiac arrest with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin coadministration (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.05) and when comparing hydroxychloroquine monotherapy with azithromycin monotherapy (adjusted OR, 2.97; 95% CI 1.56 to 5.64) but not for azithromycin vs neither drug (adjusted OR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.56).

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^11362ev1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

More than 200 drugs are associated with prolonging the QT interval. Such drugs may confound the association between azithromycin and cardiac events. Thus, similar to the study by Trifirò et al, 9 we controlled for the confounding effects of concurrent use of QT-prolonging drugs with azithromycin. In the subgroups, including episodes with concomitant use of QT-prolonging drugs, we found a significantly higher risk with azithromycin. Although we were unable to examine the risk of cardiac events by each therapeutic class of QT-prolonging drugs, we found that most episodes included patients who were prescribed QT-prolonging antidepressants. This finding suggests that cardiac risk may be modified by the presence of any QT-prolonging drug and not just antiarrhythmic drugs, as previously thought. In a sample of the cohort, we explored the likelihood of patients receiving a QT-prolonging medication with azithromycin vs amoxicillin. We found that patients were more likely to be prescribed QT-prolonging drugs with azithromycin. Although we were not able to ascertain the reasons for such findings, accounting for the use of QT-prolonging drugs when examining the risks associated with azithromycin may be necessary. We hypothesize that the confounding effect of other QT-prolonging drugs may help explain and resolve the inconsistent findings from previous studies.

Under conclusions and research needs, "The guideline panel recommends against the use of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZ in the hospital setting as higher certainty benefits (e.g., mortality reduction) are now highly unlikely even if additional high quality RCTs would become available". The document clarifies that "This recommendation does not address the use of azithromycin for secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 (Supplementary Table s2)".

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^111AqTVR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health challenge at a global level. 1 As of May 26, 2020, 1 618 757 Americans have tested positive and 96 909 of those patients have succumbed to this illness. 2 In the absence of a vaccine or any proven therapeutic agent, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, often used in combination, have emerged as a potential therapy on the basis of extremely limited clinical evidence. 3 These drugs are currently being prescribed in COVID‐19–positive or COVID‐19–suspected patients in growing numbers across the United States and around the world. 4

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has also been used to treat arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Both drugs prolong the QT interval by blocking the KCNH2‐encoded hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel, thereby increasing the risk of torsades de pointes. 5, 6, 7 In general, hydroxychloroquine is reasonably well tolerated and used chronically in arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients without heart rhythm monitoring. 8 In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for azithromycin following multiple reported cases of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation followed by torsades de pointes. 9 Because the use of these drugs in COVID‐19 patients is so recent and based largely on in vitro studies 10 and anecdotal observations, 11 randomized clinical trial data are lacking, and community prescribing practices are as yet unclear. More important, there is no information available about the extent of QTc prolongation with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. From first principles, simultaneous block of the hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel with both agents may cause critical QTc prolongation and an elevated risk of torsades de pointes. We therefore evaluated prescribing practices and monitored the QTc in COVID‐19–positive or COVID‐19–suspected patients who received these medications.

### Risk of QT interval prolongation associated with use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin among hospitalized patients testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113RYiUh]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia carries increased risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.

Objective

To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events.

Results

Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430–474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454–487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427–461] milliseconds; P < .001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10–40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; p = 0.03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (8%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03–11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75–28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.

### Azithromycin monohydrate (azithromycin) [^111ZHwvU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

Since the mean Cmaxof azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hr is higher than the mean Cmaxof azithromycin following the administration of a 1,500 mg oral dose, it is possible that QTc may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one hour infusion of 500 mg.

patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### Comparison of cardiac events associated with azithromycin vs amoxicillin [^114SrnFH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Covariates

Patient characteristics, including age, sex, geographic region, and insurance type, were collected at the index date. Baseline clinical conditions were categorized using Clinical Classifications Software. The software collapses diagnosis and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), which contains more than 14 000 diagnosis codes and 3900 procedure codes.

Drugs that prolong the QT interval or induce TdP were identified from a publicly available, well-established, and widely recognized list from the CredibleMeds website (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for the full list). The drugs were categorized into 24 different therapeutic classes and into known, possible, and conditional risk groups. Any QT-prolonging drugs prescribed within 90 days before the index date were considered. Concurrent use was defined based on an overlap of the days of supply (with a 15% allowed gap) of QT-prolonging drugs with the index date of the azithromycin or amoxicillin prescription.

Study End Point

The outcome was measured as a primary diagnosis during a hospitalization or first-listed emergency department visit based on ICD-9-CM codes for ventricular arrhythmia, palpitation, long QT syndrome, cardiac arrest, syncope, or death (codes 426.82, 427, 427.1, 427.2, 427.4, 427.5, 427.9, 427.41, 427.42, 780.2, 785.1, 798, 798.1, 798.2, or 798.9). This outcome definition was validated in previous studies with positive predictive values greater than 80%. We also applied an algorithm developed by another validation study to identify the outcomes originating from outpatient settings.

### Pharmacometric and electrocardiographic evaluation of chloroquine and azithromycin in healthy volunteers [^111KH6uM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine and azithromycin were developed in combination for the preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, and more recently were proposed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment options. Billions of doses of chloroquine have been administered worldwide over the past 70years but concerns regarding cardiotoxicity, notably the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP), remain. This investigation aimed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic effects of chloroquine and azithromycin observed in a large previously conducted healthy volunteer study. Healthy adult volunteers (n = 119) were randomized into 5 arms: placebo, chloroquine alone (600mg base), or chloroquine with either 500 mg, 1,000mg, or 1,500mg of azithromycin all given daily for 3days. Chloroquine and azithromycin levels, measured using liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and electrocardiograph intervals were recorded at frequent intervals. Time-matched changes in the PR, QRS, and heart rate-corrected JT, and QT intervals were calculated and the relationship with plasma concentrations was evaluated using linear and nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Chloroquine and azithromycin pharmacokinetics were described satisfactorily by two- and three-compartment distribution models, respectively. No drug-drug interaction between chloroquine and azithromycin was observed. Chloroquine resulted in concentration-dependent prolongation of the PR, QRS, JTc and QTc intervals with a minimal additional effect of azithromycin. QRS widening contributed ~28% of the observed QT prolongation. Chloroquine causes significant concentration-dependent delays in both ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Co-administration of azithromycin did not significantly increase these effects. The arrhythmogenic risk of TdP associated with chloroquine may have been substantially overestimated in studies which did not separate electrocardiograph QRS and JT prolongation.

### Azithromycin [^114v1eRD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

### Cardiac corrected QT interval changes among patients treated for COVID-19 infection during the early phase of the pandemic [^116qSdLm]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Critical illness, a marked inflammatory response, and viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 may prolong corrected QT interval (QTc).

Objective

To evaluate baseline QTc interval on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and ensuing changes among patients with and without COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 3050 patients aged 18 years and older who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had ECGs at Columbia University Irving Medical Center from March 1 through May 1, 2020. Patients were analyzed by treatment group over 5 days, as follows: hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, and neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin. ECGs were manually analyzed by electrophysiologists masked to COVID-19 status. Multivariable modeling evaluated clinical associations with QTc prolongation from baseline.

Exposures

COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean QTc prolongation, percentage of patients with QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater.

Results

A total of 965 patients had more than 2 ECGs and were included in the study, with 561 (58.1%) men, 198 (26.2%) Black patients, and 191 (19.8%) aged 80 years and older. There were 733 patients (76.0%) with COVID-19 and 232 patients (24.0%) without COVID-19. COVID-19 infection was associated with significant mean QTc prolongation from baseline by both 5-day and 2-day multivariable models (5-day, patients with COVID-19: 20.81 [95% CI, 15.29 to 26.33] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: -2.01 [95% CI, -17.31 to 21.32] milliseconds; p = 0.93; 2-day, patients with COVID-19: 17.40 [95% CI, 12.65 to 22.16] milliseconds; P < .001; patients without COVID-19: 0.11 [95% CI, -12.60 to 12.81] milliseconds; p = 0.99). COVID-19 infection was independently associated with a modeled mean 27.32 (95% CI, 4.63–43.21) millisecond increase in QTc at 5 days compared with COVID-19-negative status (mean QTc, with COVID-19: 450.45 [95% CI, 441.6 to 459.3] milliseconds; without COVID-19: 423.13 [95% CI, 403.25 to 443.01] milliseconds; p = 0.01). More patients with COVID-19 not receiving hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19 (34 of 136 [25.0%] vs 17 of 158 [10.8%], P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis revealed that age 80 years and older compared with those younger than 50 years (mean difference in QTc, 11.91 [SE, 4.69; 95% CI, 2.73 to 21.09]; p = 0.01), severe chronic kidney disease compared with no chronic kidney disease (mean difference in QTc, 12.20 [SE, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.89 to 22.51; p = 0.02]), elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.05 [SE, 1.19; 95% CI, 2.72 to 7.38]; P < .001), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (mean difference in QTc, 5.31 [SE, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.06 to 10.57]; p = 0.04) were associated with QTc prolongation. Torsades de pointes occurred in 1 patient (0.1%) with COVID-19.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, COVID-19 infection was independently associated with significant mean QTc prolongation at days 5 and 2 of hospitalization compared with day 0. More patients with COVID-19 had QTc of 500 milliseconds or greater compared with patients without COVID-19.

### Azithromycin (zithromax or zmax) and the risk of potentially fatal… [^115f67KZ]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

This communication is a result of our review of a study by medical researchers as well as another study by a manufacturer of the drug that assessed the potential for azithromycin to cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart. The azithromycin drug labels have been updated to strengthen the Warnings and Precautions section with information related to the risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, a specific, rare heart rhythm abnormality. Information has also been added regarding the results of a clinical QT study which showed that azithromycin can prolong the QTc interval. Health care professionals should consider the risk of fatal heart rhythms with azithromycin when considering treatment options for patients who are already at risk for cardiovascular events.

F DA notes that the potential risk of QT prolongation with azithromycin should be placed in appropriate context when choosing an antibacterial drug: Alternative drugs in the macrolide class, or non-macrolides such as the fluoroquinolones, also have the potential for QT prolongation or other significant side effects that should be considered when choosing an antibacterial drug.
- Elderly patients and patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of arrhythmogenic drugs on the QT interval.
- The potential risk of QT prolongation should be placed in appropriate context when choosing an antibacterial drug: Alternative drugs in the macrolide or fluoroquinolone drug classes also have the potential for QT prolongation or other significant side effects that should be considered when choosing an antibacterial drug. The duration of the elevated risk of all-cause mortality and of cardiovascular death corresponded to the duration of azithromycin therapy.

The increase in total deaths was due to cardiovascular deaths and not due to an increase in deaths from other causes. The excess risk of cardiovascular death, especially of sudden death, is consistent with arrhythmias from drug-related QT prolongation. FDA also evaluated the results of a clinical QT study conducted by the manufacturer assessing the effects of azithromycin on the QT interval in adults. The results of the study indicated that azithromycin prolonged the QTc interval. Information regarding the results of the QT study has been added to the Zithromax drug label. References.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1125mY9c]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to long-term macrolides, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering add-on azithromycin (3 times per week, for at least 6 months) after specialist referral in adult patients with persistent symptomatic asthma despite high dose ICSs-LABAs. Assess sputum for atypical mycobacteria and obtain an ECG for long QTc before initiation (and reassess after a month on treatment), taking into account the risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)]

Fatalities have been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:
