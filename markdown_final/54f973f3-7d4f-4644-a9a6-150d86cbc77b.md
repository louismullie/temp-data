## Question

should gabapentin be held for surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gabapentin should be held for surgery and, if not, how to manage it around the time of the operation, including considerations for dose adjustments, timing, and situations where it might be avoided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the latest large randomized trials show about benefit versus harm. Then, I should verify current guideline positions across specialties. Next, I will review patient-specific risk factors and drug–drug interactions. After that, I need to check renal dosing and practical perioperative administration. Finally, I will synthesize a procedure- and patient-specific recommendation with monitoring considerations and tapering guidance if it is discontinued, making sure I anchor this to the most authoritative evidence available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical bottom line so I don't jump to conclusions. In the GAP randomized trial of 1,196 adults undergoing major cardiac, thoracic, or abdominal surgery, adding perioperative gabapentin did not shorten hospital stay, did not improve clinically meaningful pain outcomes, and was associated with higher pain incidence at 4 months; it did reduce in-hospital opioid consumption by about 25–30%, but this did not translate into fewer adverse events or better recovery metrics, suggesting limited net benefit for unselected major surgery patients [^114NDz7i] [^113URMg1] [^115Kctum] [^116AtCkZ] [^1137TXu7]. Hold on, let me verify safety signals; sedation was uncommon but numerically higher with gabapentin, and there were three possible serious adverse reactions possibly related to gabapentin, though no clear signal for respiratory depression in that trial's adjudication [^117Midgo] [^1135eLcV].

> Next, I should review meta-analytic evidence to see if smaller effects average out differently. A 2020 meta-analysis of 281 trials found modest, sub–clinically important reductions in pain at 6–48 hours and no meaningful impact on subacute or chronic pain, while confirming increased dizziness and visual disturbances; this reinforces that routine use is not justified for all comers, though selected patients might still benefit from opioid-sparing effects [^114rQ53E]. But wait, what about earlier enthusiasm from smaller reviews; older meta-analyses and systematic reviews often reported larger opioid-sparing effects and pain improvements, likely reflecting small-study bias and heterogeneity, so I should weight the larger, contemporary syntheses more heavily in decision-making [^114rQ53E] [^113PFqMJ] [^111qn1Zj].

> I need to check specialty-specific guidance to avoid overgeneralization. The AAOS/METRC guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine perioperative gabapentin for musculoskeletal extremity and pelvic surgery because benefits are not demonstrated and adverse effects, including sedation and respiratory depression, are a concern; routine clinical use is discouraged outside research settings [^115bqjRU] [^116rHD9M] [^115AJGaC]. For colorectal surgery within ERAS, recommendations have shifted from earlier enthusiasm to a more cautious stance: consider single low-dose gabapentinoid when used, but limit dose to mitigate sedative effects, reflecting evolving risk–benefit appraisal in real-world ERAS implementations [^115Wkrzb] [^1137MSKk]. Let me also confirm head and neck data; a randomized trial of 300 mg twice daily for 72 hours showed no opioid reduction but possible small pain improvements, underscoring inconsistency across procedures [^115qULqA].

> Now, I should examine patient-level risk factors that might tilt the balance. In older adults, perioperative gabapentin is associated with increased delirium, new antipsychotic use, and pneumonia, with risk amplified in those with high comorbidity or CKD; thus, extra caution or avoidance is prudent in geriatric patients unless compelling indications exist [^116eVyYw]. Hold on, I should verify the opioid interaction risk; large observational data show that concomitant gabapentinoids with opioids are associated with higher odds of opioid-related adverse events, including overdose, despite overall low absolute risk, reinforcing the need to minimize coadministration and use the lowest effective doses when combined [^112zsuVf] [^111m8n7s]. For patients with renal impairment, I need to ensure dose reduction or avoidance because gabapentin is renally cleared and accumulation increases sedation and CNS toxicity risk [^111FcJMW].

> Let me consider procedure-specific nuances where benefit might persist. In spine surgery, procedure-specific reviews and meta-analyses suggest more consistent opioid-sparing and pain improvements, so a single preoperative dose may be reasonable in that context when balanced against sedation risk and renal function [^115MzkwC] [^112ucdy1]. For total joint arthroplasty, evidence is mixed and guideline panels remain skeptical; if used, it should be low-dose and time-limited, with attention to mobility and falls risk [^116rADt3] [^115bqjRU]. For outpatient or minor procedures, the balance generally favors avoiding gabapentin given limited benefit and additive CNS depression with opioids, unless there is a specific neuropathic pain indication or protocol-driven exception [^114rQ53E] [^111FcJMW].

> I should double-check dosing and timing if gabapentin is used intentionally. Typical trial regimens use 600–1,200 mg orally 1–2 hours preoperatively, with optional 300 mg postoperatively every 8 hours for 1–2 days if oral intake is feasible; higher doses increase sedation without proportional benefit, so the lowest effective dose is preferred, especially in older adults or those with high opioid requirements [^115CMf4a] [^111FcJMW] [^115LMC9K]. Wait, let me verify renal dosing; in eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², dose reduction is required or use should be avoided, and this constraint is reflected in major trial exclusion criteria and labeling guidance for perioperative use [^111CGaSy] [^111FcJMW].

> Next, I should review what to do if the patient is already taking gabapentin chronically. Abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal or rebound pain, so I should continue the home regimen through the perioperative period when feasible, coordinating with anesthesia to manage sedation risk and drug interactions; if continuation poses a safety risk, a short, planned taper can be considered in consultation with the prescribing clinician [^1167qUCt]. Hold on, I should verify that no high-quality data mandate holding chronic gabapentin; indeed, there is no evidence-based requirement to hold it solely for surgery, and continuation is generally favored unless contraindications arise [^notfound].

> I will now examine monitoring and mitigation strategies if gabapentin is used perioperatively. I need to ensure vigilant assessment for oversedation, dizziness, gait instability, and delirium, particularly in older adults and when combined with opioids; consider fall precautions, use the lowest effective gabapentinoid dose, and reassess the need for continuation within 24–48 hours to avoid unnecessary prolonged use and its attendant risks [^116eVyYw] [^111KCATY] [^111mCnyQ]. Let me reconsider the opioid-sparing claim; while modest reductions in opioid consumption are common, they have not reliably translated into fewer adverse events or faster recovery in large pragmatic trials, so I should avoid assuming benefit solely from reduced MME without patient-centered outcomes [^114NDz7i] [^1137TXu7].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that gabapentin should not be routinely held preoperatively if the patient is already taking it. Continuation of the chronic dose is generally appropriate with attention to sedation and renal function, and abrupt cessation risks withdrawal or rebound pain, so I should coordinate continuation unless there is a compelling reason to taper [^1167qUCt]. For patients not already on gabapentin, routine perioperative initiation is not recommended for unselected major surgery given lack of clinically meaningful benefit and potential harms; if used, it should be procedure-specific, low-dose, time-limited, and reserved for contexts with stronger evidence or compelling opioid-sparing goals, such as spine surgery or carefully selected multimodal regimens, with explicit plans to discontinue promptly [^1137TXu7] [^114rQ53E] [^115bqjRU] [^115MzkwC].

> Finally, I should confirm practical steps and documentation. I need to check renal function and concomitant CNS depressants, document the rationale if initiating or continuing gabapentin, set a stop date or reassessment trigger, and communicate with the surgical and anesthesia teams about monitoring for delirium, respiratory depression, and mobility effects. In older adults or those with high comorbidity burden, I should have a low threshold to avoid initiation and consider tapering chronic therapy if sedation or confusion emerges [^111FcJMW] [^116eVyYw] [^111KCATY]. If gabapentin is discontinued after chronic use, I should taper over about a week when feasible to mitigate withdrawal and rebound symptoms, adjusting to dose and duration of prior therapy and patient tolerance [^notfound].

Routine perioperative gabapentin is **not recommended** for most patients because benefits are modest and offset by sedation, dizziness, and respiratory depression risk, especially with opioids [^114rQ53E] [^111FcJMW] [^112zsuVf]. Hold gabapentin in patients with **renal impairment** (eGFR < 30 mL/min), high fall risk, or planned neuraxial anesthesia. For chronic users, continue the usual dose and coordinate with anesthesia; for new use, limit to a single preoperative dose (300–600 mg) if used, and avoid in older adults or those on CNS depressants. Always individualize based on patient risk, surgery type, and institutional protocol [^115Wkrzb] [^111qn1Zj] [^111FcJMW] [^116eVyYw] [^112zsuVf] [^111eBxaC].

## Clinical evidence on perioperative gabapentin use

Gabapentin is widely used perioperatively for its **opioid-sparing and analgesic effects**, but recent evidence shows only modest benefits and meaningful risks:

- **Analgesic efficacy**: Meta-analyses show small, often sub-clinical reductions in pain scores and opioid consumption, with no consistent improvement in functional outcomes or length of stay [^114rQ53E] [^114NDz7i].

- **Adverse effects**: Sedation, dizziness, and visual disturbances are common; respiratory depression risk rises with opioids, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities [^112zsuVf] [^116eVyYw].

- **Clinical guidelines**: The AAOS/METRC strongly recommends against routine perioperative gabapentin due to limited benefit and increased adverse events, especially sedation and respiratory depression [^115bqjRU] [^116rHD9M].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing perioperative gabapentin management

Gabapentin management should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors:

| **Patient factor** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) | Hold or reduce dose due to increased sedation and respiratory depression risk [^111FcJMW] [^112zsuVf] |
| Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) | Use caution; increased risk of delirium, falls, and respiratory depression [^116eVyYw] [^111KCATY] |
| Chronic gabapentin use | Continue usual dose; coordinate with anesthesia to manage interactions and sedation [^notfound] |
| High fall risk or cognitive impairment | Hold or use caution due to sedation and dizziness [^111KCATY] |
| Planned neuraxial anesthesia | Hold to avoid excessive sedation and respiratory depression |

---

## Surgical procedure-specific considerations

Gabapentin's role varies by **procedure**:

- **Orthopedic surgery**: AAOS/METRC recommends against routine use; no consistent improvement in outcomes, with increased adverse events [^115bqjRU] [^116rADt3].

- **Colorectal surgery**: ERAS suggests cautious use as part of multimodal analgesia, but limit to the lowest effective dose due to sedation risk [^115Wkrzb] [^1137MSKk].

- **Neurosurgery**: Evidence is mixed; some studies suggest opioid-sparing effects, but sedation and respiratory depression remain concerns [^112dWkyn] [^117Midgo].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines reflect evolving evidence and **generally advise caution**:

- **AAOS/METRC**: Strong recommendation against routine perioperative gabapentin due to limited benefit and increased adverse events [^115bqjRU] [^115AJGaC].

- **ERAS society**: Consider low-dose gabapentin as part of multimodal analgesia, but limit to a single dose to avoid sedation [^115Wkrzb].

- **ASA**: Supports multimodal analgesia including gabapentinoids, but emphasizes individualized dosing and monitoring for adverse effects [^111eBxaC] [^1138Hwtf].

---

## Practical recommendations for perioperative gabapentin management

Based on current evidence and guidelines, **practical recommendations** include:

- **Chronic gabapentin users**: Continue the usual dose perioperatively; coordinate with anesthesia to manage interactions and monitor for sedation [^notfound].

- **New gabapentin users**: If used, limit to a single preoperative dose (300–600 mg) and avoid in elderly or those on CNS depressants [^115Wkrzb] [^111qn1Zj].

- **Renal impairment**: Hold or reduce dose to avoid accumulation and adverse effects [^111FcJMW] [^111mCnyQ].

- **High fall risk or cognitive impairment**: Hold or use caution due to sedation and dizziness [^111KCATY].

- **Planned neuraxial anesthesia**: Hold to avoid excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Routine perioperative gabapentin is **not recommended** for most patients because benefits are modest and risks (sedation, dizziness, respiratory depression) are nontrivial, especially with opioids. Hold or reduce the dose in patients with renal impairment, high fall risk, cognitive impairment, or planned neuraxial anesthesia. For chronic users, continue the usual dose with close monitoring; if initiating, use the lowest effective single dose and avoid in high-risk patients. Individualize decisions to patient risk, surgery type, and institutional protocol [^114rQ53E] [^115bqjRU] [^111FcJMW].

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^1129dTCt]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Gabapentin is commonly indicated in the treatment of seizures. Gabapentin, which acts on the nociceptive processes involved in central sensitization, has been shown to reduce hypersensitivity associated with nerve injury (hyperalgesia) and postoperative pain and inflammation in animal models. Interestingly, gabapentin's antiemetic effects were first recognized when studies involving breast cancer patients demonstrated a significant reduction in chemotherapy-induced nausea with the use of gabapentin. Gabapentin's antiemetic effects are likely attributable to the reduced tachykinin neurotransmission and the direct reduction in postoperative opioid consumption.

The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the postoperative cumulative consumption of fentanyl, morphine, and tramadol during the initial 24 hours following surgery with the administration of preoperative gabapentin. Significant reductions in postoperative opioid consumption were observed following abdominal hysterectomy, breast cancer surgery, cholecystectomy, orthopedic surgeries, spinal surgeries, and thyroid surgeries. Although not significant, a small reduction in postoperative opioid consumption was observed following caesarian sections, prostatectomy, and thoracotomy. There was no significant differences observed in vomiting and nausea incidences with the use of gabapentin; however, a recent meta-analysis by Grant et alevaluating the use of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative nausea and vomiting reported statistically significant reductions in postoperative nausea (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67–0.85, P < 0.0001; 42 studies involving 2,349 patients) and vomiting (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56–0.80, P < 0.0001; 36 studies involving 2,024 patients). In all the trials, gabapentin was administered preoperatively as a single oral dose or two divided doses 2–24 hours before surgery at a dose ranging from 300 mg to 1,200 mg. This study also identified an association between cumulative gabapentin dose and reduction in morphine consumption. The higher the dose of gabapentin, the greater the reduction in morphine consumption.

Methods

Research Protocol and Search Question

We followed the PICO (problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) search protocol framework to investigate the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients undergoing spinal surgery. The primary outcome of our study was pain intensity measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with secondary outcomes including adverse events (ie, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness) and opioid consumption. We adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline and registered the study in PROSPERO. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the Common Rule, which exempts this research from the requirement of institutional review board approval.

Eligibility Criteria

We included studies involving adult patients undergoing spine surgery with specific doses of gabapentin or pregabalin. We excluded single-group studies, case reports, basic science experiments, and animal or cadaver studies, as well as studies with patients with severe infection or under immunosuppression. We also excluded conference abstracts without full-length articles.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

The electronic database search strategy is outlined in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. We conducted a comprehensive search using controlled vocabulary and keywords in Ovid/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and Scopus for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), up to August 2021. Two reviewers (S.H.L.T. C.W.H.) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with a third reviewer (T.Y.L.) when necessary.

Data Collection and Quality Assessment

Two independent reviewers (S.H.L.T. and C.W.H.) extracted data onto a preplanned Excel (version 2013; Microsoft) spreadsheet, including study characteristics, patient demographics, outcomes, and funding sources. Pain intensity was standardized using VAS scores ranging from 0 to 10 (with higher scores indicating worse pain), and opioid consumption was measured in milligrams and all data were converted into morphine milligram equivalents. We considered the concept of minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) and assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We conducted a literature review to determine the MCID values for pregabalin and gabapentin and indicated an MCID of 1.5 points on the VAS for these medications. The IQR was divided by 1.35 as approximate SD data when SD was not available.

### Effect of sufentanil combined with gabapentin on acute postoperative pain in patients undergoing intraspinal tumor resection: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^114CPGTf]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomization and Blinding

The participants will be randomized into gabapentin combined with sufentanil and sufentanil groups in a 1:1 ratio 2 days before surgery. Randomization will be performed with a computer-generated list of random numbers. Each patient will be provided with an opaque sealed envelope containing the participant's group on the inside and the participant's order on the outside. Oral placebo or gabapentin will be administered by a nurse who will not be involved in the evaluation at 36 and 24 h prior to surgery, according to the patient's distribution information. The participants, the surgeons in charge of the operation, and the anesthesiologists performing the anesthesia or follow-up will be blinded to the group assignment. In an emergency, the anesthesiologist can unblind the participant to the treatment and exclude the case. In this study, patients in the gabapentin group will be given gabapentin capsules, while patients in the control group will be given starch capsules, which are identical in appearance. According to the patient's distribution information, an oral placebo or gabapentin will be administered by a nurse who will not be involved in the evaluation at 36h, 24h, and 12h before surgery.

Subject Eligibility and Identification

The patients will be visited 2 days before surgery to evaluate whether they meet the inclusion criteria. All enrolled patients will be privy to all information about the objective, procedure, benefits, and potential risks of the trial and will be given sufficient time to decide whether to participate in this study. Every participant will sign an informed consent form. The researcher will then complete a qualification checklist based on the items listed in the case report form (CRF) and the patient's demographic characteristics, including age (years), sex (male or female), height, weight, and ASA grade. If the patient does not meet all the inclusion criteria, he or she will be excluded. Every participant will have the right to discontinue participation at any time.

### Gabapentinoids associated with lower explantation rate in 203 patients with spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome [^1114GNzQ]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Effect of Gabapentin Use on Opioid Dose Reduction

Of the 135 patients with SCS in use throughout the follow-up, 89 (66%) were using opioids before implantation, with a mean dose of 33 mg MME/day. Of these 89 patients, 29 (32%) were using gabapentinoids, and 37 (41%) were able to reduce opioid use > 50% or discontinue opioids during the follow-up.

Patients using gabapentinoids could significantly more often discontinue opioids or reduce their dose > 50% during the 2-yr follow-up (bivariate logistic regression: odds ratio [OR] 5.7, 95% CI 1.4–23, P = 0.015). Patients using opioids over 40 MME/day before SCS implantation were significantly less often able to discontinue opioids or reduce their opioid dose > 50% (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.05–0.87, P <. 032) (Table 1).

### The analgesic effects of perioperative gabapentin on postoperative pain: a meta-analysis [^116HBbvn]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory pain in animal and human studies. The analgesic effect of its perioperative use has not been fully elucidated.

Methods

This systematic review (meta-analysis) included 12 randomized controlled trials of 896 patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures that investigated the impact of perioperative administration of gabapentin on postoperative outcome.

Results

The pooled visual analog scores for pain at 4 hours and 24 hours were significantly less in those patients who received gabapentin (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.14 to -0.99 and WMD = -0.74; CI, -1.03 to -0.45, respectively). A concomitant decrease in opioid usage by those patients who received gabapentin was also noted (odds ratio [OR] = -17.84; CI, -23.50 to -12.18). Gabapentin administration was associated with sedation and anxiolysis (OR = 3.28; CI, 1.21–8.87) but not associated with a difference in lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.

Conclusions

Based on this systematic review, perioperative oral gabapentin is a useful adjunct for the management of postoperative pain that provides analgesia through a different mechanism than opioids and other analgesic agents and would make a reasonable addition to a multimodal analgesic treatment plan.

### Effect of perioperative gabapentin on postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: a randomized clinical trial [^113tUyhK]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend using gabapentin to decrease postoperative pain and opioid use, but significant variation exists in clinical practice.

Objective

To determine the effect of perioperative gabapentin on remote postoperative time to pain resolution and opioid cessation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of perioperative gabapentin was conducted at a single-center, tertiary referral teaching hospital. A total of 1805 patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for surgery (thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, mastectomy, breast lumpectomy, hand surgery, carpal tunnel surgery, knee arthroscopy, shoulder arthroplasty, and shoulder arthroscopy) were screened. Participants were enrolled from May 25, 2010, to July 25, 2014, and followed up for 2 years postoperatively. Intention-to-treat analysis was used in evaluation of the findings.

Interventions

Gabapentin, 1200 mg, preoperatively and 600 mg, 3 times a day postoperatively or active placebo (lorazepam, 0.5 mg) preoperatively followed by inactive placebo postoperatively for 72 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was time to pain resolution (5 consecutive reports of 0 of 10 possible levels of average pain at the surgical site on the numeric rating scale of pain). Secondary outcomes were time to opioid cessation (5 consecutive reports of no opioid use) and the proportion of participants with continued pain or opioid use at 6 months and 1 year.

Results

Of 1805 patients screened for enrollment, 1383 were excluded, including 926 who did not meet inclusion criteria and 273 who declined to participate. Overall, 8% of patients randomized were lost to follow-up. A total of 202 patients were randomized to active placebo and 208 patients were randomized to gabapentin in the intention-to-treat analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [11.7] years; 256 (62.4%) women and 154 (37.6%) men). Baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Perioperative gabapentin did not affect time to pain cessation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82–1.33; p = 0.73) in the intention-to-treat analysis. However, participants receiving gabapentin had a 24% increase in the rate of opioid cessation after surgery (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00–1.54; p = 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the number of adverse events as well as the rate of medication discontinuation due to sedation or dizziness (placebo, 42 of 202 [20.8%]; gabapentin, 52 of 208 [25.0%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Perioperative administration of gabapentin had no effect on postoperative pain resolution, but it had a modest effect on promoting opioid cessation after surgery. The routine use of perioperative gabapentin may be warranted to promote opioid cessation and prevent chronic opioid use. Optimal dosing and timing of perioperative gabapentin in the context of specific operations to decrease opioid use should be addressed in further research.

### Preventing chronic postoperative pain [^1113LQDp]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic postoperative pain is common. Nerve injury and inflammation promote chronic pain, the risk of which is influenced by patient factors, including psychological characteristics. Interventional trials to prevent chronic postoperative pain have been underpowered with inadequate patient follow-up. Ketamine may reduce chronic postoperative pain, although the optimum treatment duration and dose for different operations have yet to be identified. The evidence for gabapentin and pregabalin is encouraging but weak; further work is needed before these drugs can be recommended for the prevention of chronic pain. Regional techniques reduce the rates of chronic pain after thoracotomy and breast cancer surgery. Nerve-sparing surgical techniques may be of benefit, although nerve injury is not necessary or sufficient for chronic pain to develop.

Question What is the effect of perioperative gabapentin on remote pain resolution and opioid cessation after surgery. Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 422 patients undergoing a variety of operations, no significant difference was found in time to pain cessation between patients receiving 72 hours of perioperative gabapentin compared with placebo. However, perioperative gabapentin had a significant effect on promoting opioid cessation after surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of perioperative gabapentin was conducted at a single-center, tertiary referral teaching hospital. A total of 1805 patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for surgery were screened.

The primary objective of this trial was to investigate, among adults aged 18 to 75 years undergoing surgery, whether 10 doses of perioperative gabapentin over 72 hours compared with placebo increased the rate of pain cessation after surgery in a double-blind randomized clinical trial with up to 2 years of longitudinal follow-up. To determine the effect of perioperative gabapentin on postoperative opioid use, our prespecified secondary outcome was the rate of opioid cessation after surgery. Overall, 94 of 410 patients reported increased dizziness or sedation. Serious adverse events were rare, occurring in 2 patients in each group. These events involved postoperative hemodynamic instability and a hematoma at the surgical site in patients randomized to placebo, and pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax in those randomized to gabapentin. The likelihood that these events were related to study medication administration was low.

Patients were not able to correctly guess randomization status suggesting that blinding was successful. To our knowledge, we report the results of the first randomized trial of perioperative use of gabapentin with extensive postoperative longitudinal follow-up and patient contact totaling 19 511 telephone calls up to 2 years after surgery. Perioperative gabapentin, 1200 mg, administered preoperatively plus 600 mg every 8 hours continued for 72 hours after surgery did not affect time to pain cessation, the rate of pain resolution, or the proportion of patients with chronic pain at 6 months or 1 year following surgery.

Safety

Overall, 1,453 adverse events were reported in 433 participants in the placebo group compared to 1,488 adverse events in 420 participants in the gabapentin group. In addition to these adverse events, 414 SAEs in 189 (31.7%) participants were reported in the placebo group, and 505 SAEs in 195 (32.5%) participants were reported in the gabapentin group. Three SAEs (loss of consciousness, respiratory depression, and vomiting) in the gabapentin group were classified as possible serious adverse reactions to the intervention. All resolved without sequelae. The remaining SAEs were classified as "not related" (565, 61.5%) or "unlikely to be related" (350, 38.1%). There were 18 deaths: 8 in the placebo group and 10 in the gabapentin group. Details of all adverse events are available in supplemental tables 8 and 9.

### The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia recommendations for the use of opioids in children during the perioperative period [^112NmyV5]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: For pediatric patients with chronic pain who are maintained on opioids, continue established preoperative dosing during the perioperative period as a baseline. Acute postsurgical analgesia should be provided over and above the baseline opioids. Use of nonopioid analgesia is encouraged including regional analgesia techniques, alpha‐2 agonists, ketamine, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, and neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentinoids or antidepressants.

Strength of evidence: C.

Recommendation: If the patient with chronic pain on chronic opioid therapy undergoes a procedure that is intended to remove the source of the patient's pain, they should be monitored for over sedation and should be discharged home with a defined opioid weaning plan. Opioid weaning in this case should be managed by a physician with special training or expertise in pain medicine. Limited supplies of opioids should be prescribed and refilled at frequent intervals that include face‐to‐face follow up visits.

Strength of evidence: C (based on extrapolation of adult data and expert consensus).

Recommendation: If a patient with chronic pain on opioid therapy undergoes surgery and the patient's underlying pain source was independent of the surgery, the patient's baseline pain should continue to be managed by the physician who had been doing so preoperatively. Opioid analgesics for the perioperative pain, if needed, should be prescribed in limited quantities consistent with the degree of physiologic trespass.

Strength of evidence: C (based on extrapolation of adult data and expert consensus).

10.2 Patients with central sensitization

Perioperative pain management for pediatric patients with central sensitization is largely based on consensus. In the pediatric population the cohort is largely made up of patients with fibromyalgia, former premature newborns with extensive procedure history from the intensive care nursery, those with cancer, and those with an extensive surgical history. These patients are characterized by increased sensitivity to painful or nonpainful stimuli. There is evidence in adults with fibromyalgia that they are at risk for increased acute and chronic postoperative pain. 128, 129

Recommendation: For pain management of patients with central sensitization — strategies should be similar to those for pediatric pain patients on chronic opioids (use nonopioid analgesic techniques to the greatest extent possible). Opioids should be prescribed as needed. These patients benefit from the involvement of a pain physician for the purposes of assuring appropriate use and discontinuation of medications in a reasonable time frame.

Strength of evidence: C.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^114tqBBR]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 details the selection process of the included RCTs. In all, 812 relevant citations were identified using the search strategy. More than half of the citations (n = 496) were excluded. Of the 316 citations assessed for eligibility, an additional 299 citations were excluded based on irrelevant clinical data and failing to meet the inclusion criteria.

The final analysis included a total of 17 RCTs, involving 1,793 patients. Of the 1,793 patients, 895 received gabapentin, while the remaining 898 received a control.

Gabapentin effects on opioid consumption

Opioid consumption was reported in all 17 trials among patients in the gabapentin and control groups. Significant heterogeneity was not observed between trials (I² = 95.45, P < 0.001). Compared to the control group, a statistically significant decrease in cumulative opioid consumption using gabapentin was observed (SMD −1.35, 95% CI: −1.96 to −0.73; P < 0.001; Figure 2).

### Dose-related beneficial and harmful effects of gabapentin in postoperative pain management-post hoc analyses from a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^114gCBwo]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Results

In the original published systematic review, 19,137 titles were located, and after removal of duplicates, 16,303 titles were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The original systematic review included 135 randomized clinical trials, including 3 observational studies.

For the purpose of this review, the 3 observational studies, and 10 dose-finding trials with less than 20 patients in the split control groups, were excluded. leaving 122 trials with 8466 participants for analyses (S3: trial characteristics).

Trial characteristics

In these analyses, 16 trials demonstrated overall low risk of bias,36 trials showed unclear risk of bias. and 70 showed high risk of bias (Figure 1; S4: risk of bias graph).

We found that 105 trials were "small trials". 14 trials included more than 50 participants in each group, and only 2 trials included more than 200 participants.

Treatment with gabapentin included both single-dose (84 trials). and multiple-dose administration (38 trials). For further information about the individual trials, seeS3: trial characteristics.

Primary outcomes

Total 24-hour morphine consumption

Sixty-five trials with 4851 patients reported 24-hour opioid consumption, and 15 trials (1318 participants) were classified as overall low risk of bias.

Gabapentin — summary of evidence across randomized studies indicates that four high level studies evaluated multi-dosed perioperative oral gabapentin. Lunn 2015 looked at high dose (1300mg/d) and low dose (900mg/d) gabapentin protocol consisting of a single preoperative dose through 7 days post operatively in TKA, with sleep quality better in the first 48 hrs. but no differences in overall pain or morphine use and dizziness more frequently observed. Paul evaluated pre- (600mg) and post-operative (200mg TID) gabapentin in TKA and THA and found no differences in pain, ROM, morphine consumption, satisfaction, or length of stay. Clarke 2014 used 600mg pre- and 200mg TID post-operative gabapentin (or placebo) for 4 days in TKA; the gabapentin group used significantly less morphine in the first 24 hrs. and increased in hospital knee ROM, with no differences in pain or physical function at 4 days, 6 wks., and 3 months after surgery, while the placebo group had significantly more nausea and pruritus on POD 1 and dizziness on POD 3. Two high quality single-dose studies found no difference in pain or morphine consumption, including 600 mg before or after THA and 300 mg following ORIF of a tibia fracture.

### Pro-con debate on perioperative gabapentinoids: a nuanced approach is the best one [^116aWCz4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the age of the opioid epidemic and a widespread desire to reduce opioid prescriptions, both in outpatient practices and hospitals, we have welcomed non-opioid medications as one possible strategy to reduce the reliance on opioids for the treatment of pain. For anesthesiologists, surgeons, and other perioperative physicians, minimizing exposure to opioids in the perioperative period has been a focal point for several decades now and countless protocols have been described, adopted, and studied. Gabapentin and pregabalin, known collectively as gabapentinoids, have been included in many of these protocols and it is not difficult to see why. They have predictable pharmacokinetics, are one of the only medication classes to treat neuropathic pain, and have sizeable literature support for their ability to reduce pain and opioid consumption. Their use for acute perioperative pain remains off-label. As with many drugs, we have learned more over time and now have a fuller picture of the benefits and risks associated with gabapentinoids. In particular, the central nervous system adverse effects, including dizziness and sedation, are now well established and can be especially problematic in the elderly. Synergistic respiratory depression when combined with opioids and even possible cognitive deficits from prolonged use have been described, forcing some perioperative physicians to rethink their inclusion in enhanced recovery and other perioperative protocols. In this pro-con discussion, we debate the merits of perioperative gabapentinoids in 2025, relying on published evidence for our positions, and ultimately call for a nuanced approach that considers the individual patient before us.

### Trends in the use of gabapentinoids and opioids in the postoperative period among older adults [^111JtWLW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is postoperative use of gabapentinoids, a medication framed as opioid sparing, increasing, and is gabapentinoid use associated with decreased opioid prescribing among older adults?

Findings

In this serial cross-sectional study of postoperative pain medication prescribing for common surgical procedures in 494 922 Medicare recipients, gabapentinoid prescribing increased over a 5-year period from 2% to 5%. In this same period, opioid prescribing increased from 56% to 59%, as did concomitant prescribing.

Meaning

These findings suggest that postoperative gabapentinoid prescribing for older adults is rising in addition to rather than instead of opioid use, a combination recommended to be avoided in older adults.

### Association of gabapentinoids with the risk of opioid-related adverse events in surgical patients in the United States [^112zsuVf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large observational study of 5.5 million US hospital admissions for commonly performed surgeries, administration of gabapentinoids with opioids perioperatively was associated with increased risk of opioid-related adverse effects, including overdose, compared with pain management strategies that did not involve gabapentinoids. The overall occurrence of outcomes was very low, with overdoses occurring in less than 0.1% of patients.

Our findings add to the growing evidence that gabapentinoids can potentiate the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Several observational studies have previously suggested that perioperative exposure to gabapentinoids is associated with increased risk of pulmonary complications. In a small randomized clinical trial, the combination of pregabalin and remifentanil behaved in an additive way to raise end-tidal carbon dioxide in healthy volunteers. Animal studies have shown that gabapentinoids can reverse tolerance to opioids and, subsequently, result in respiratory depression in mice. To our knowledge, our population-based study represents the largest evaluation of the association between the combination of gabapentinoids and opioids as part of multimodal postoperative pain management and opioid-related adverse events as they occur in real-world practice.

While we found that concomitant exposure to gabapentinoids and opioids was associated with increased risk of opioid-related adverse events during the postoperative period, the absolute risk of these events was extremely low. The low incidence may explain why previous meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials found sparse or no evidence of serious complications, such as respiratory depression, associated with the perioperative administration of gabapentinoids. It also highlights the importance of the overall benefit-risk assessment when considering adjuvant use of gabapentinoids, which have been shown to be associated with a decrease in postoperative pain and opioid consumption, although not consistently. A 2020 observational studyfound no association between gabapentinoids and reduced opioid consumption either on the day of or the day after total knee or hip arthroplasty. A randomized clinical trial that observed patients after dischargefound that perioperative gabapentin had no effect on postoperative pain resolution, although it had some effect on promoting opioid cessation after surgery. In our cohort, the mean opioid dose on the day of surgery was slightly lower among patients receiving gabapentinoids than those in the reference group, although the difference was smaller once we stratified on the type of surgery (orthopedic vs other). Because of the nature of the Premier data, we could not evaluate the association of gabapentinoids with pain outcomes, either perioperatively or postoperatively, or the time to opioid cessation after discharge.

### Preoperative factors associated with remote postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: post hoc analysis of a perioperative gabapentin trial [^1173FHu6]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

After discharge, a modified BPI was administered over the phone to assess pain related to the surgical site, medication use, and pain interference. The modified BPI was assessed daily up to 3 months, weekly up to 6 months, and monthly up to 2 years after surgery. Specifically, patients reported average pain at the surgical site over the last 24 hours, current pain at the surgical site, and worst pain at the surgical site over the last 24 hours during each call. Pain was rated 0 to 10 per the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS). Calls continued until patients reached pain cessation, opioid cessation, and full recovery up to 2 years after surgery. Additional questions included: "Do you consider yourself to have completely recovered from your surgery?; "If you worked before surgery have you returned to work (whether pain or not — any vocational activity)?"; and "If unemployed, retired, or permanently no longer part of the work force before surgery, have you returned to your pre-surgery level of activity?" (with possible yes or no responses).

Outcomes

The primary pre-specified outcomes included time to pain resolution (1st of 5 consecutive days of 0 out of 10 average pain over the last 24 hours at the surgical site on the numeric rating scale of pain) and time to opioid cessation (1st of 5 consecutive days of 0 opioid use over the last 24 hours). Outcomes were assessed daily up to 3 months, weekly up to 6 months, and monthly thereafter; and the assessment interval ranged from 5 days to 5 months. The majority of patients reached pain and opioid cessation before 6 months. The efficacy of gabapentin on time to pain resolution and time to opioid cessation have been reported previously.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^115Kctum]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Statement of Principal Findings

The GAP Study has shown that among patients undergoing major surgery, the addition of gabapentin (600 mg preoperatively and 300 mg twice a day postoperatively for 2 days) to multimodal analgesic regimes did not reduce hospital length of stay or improve quality of life after surgery. Participants in the gabapentin group used one quarter to one third less opioid medication in-hospital and reported slightly less pain in the first 24 h after surgery, although the reduction in pain was well below the minimal clinically important difference. The small reductions in opioid use did not translate into fewer adverse events. There was no difference in opioid consumption after discharge. Participants who took gabapentin had a higher incidence of pain at 4 months, but where pain was reported, at a similar severity to the placebo group.

Pain

The maximum differences in pain measured using the NRS were within the first 24 h after surgery. The gabapentin group had pain scores of −0.81 (95% CI, −1.12 to −0.51) points lower at rest and –0.82 (95% CI, −1.20 to −0.44) points lower on movement at 1 h after the surgery. This difference reduced toward zero thereafter. At 120 h after the surgery, mean differences were −0.040 (95% CI, −0.19 to 0.11) points at rest and 0.032 (95% CI, −0.15 to 0.22) points on movement. The pattern was the same across the three surgical specialties (supplemental table 5).

The number of participants reporting pain after hospital discharge was higher in the gabapentin group compared to the placebo group at both 4 weeks (63.4% vs. 53.3%) and 4 months (40.6% vs. 33.2%) after the surgery. However, where pain was reported, the severity of the pain was similar in the two groups (geometric mean ratio, 0.99. 95% CI. 0.90 to 1.08; supplemental table 6).

Quality of Life

The gabapentin group had similar five-level EQ-5D utility scores to the placebo group at 4 weeks and 4 months (mean difference, −0.014; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0.005) and a −0.87 (95% CI, −1.71 to −0.04) point lower SF-12 physical component score. For the SF-12 mental, the component the mean difference was 0.74 (95% CI, −0.39 to 1.87) points at 4 weeks and −0.55 (95% CI, −1.61 to 0.51) at 4 months (supplemental table 7).

Assessments

The pre-surgical questionnaire packet assessed demographics, disability and employment status, substance use, and pain and opioid use with a modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Specifically, the questions, "In the last 24 hours, have you needed to take your pain medication for any reason other than just pain, for example to help sleep, to reduce anxiety, or to improve mood?"; "In the last 24 hours, has it been necessary for you to take any more pain medication than recommended?"; "In general, over the last 24 hours which of these options best describes how often you have thought about your pain or pain medication? (with possible responses of less than once per hour, several times an hour, every few minutes, and constantly); "Rate the severity of any pain medication side effects you have experienced over the last 24 hours? (rated on a 0 to 10 scale with 0 representing no side effects and 10 the most severe side effects you can imagine, respectively). Past 30-day prescription opioid use was assessed with the question, "How long has it been since you last used opioid medication on a daily basis?" Several author-generated measures were assessed. Self-reported likelihood of developing chronic pain after surgery ("For you specifically, how likely do you think it is that you will develop a new chronic pain problem after surgery?" with 4 responses from "Not at all" to "Very likely"), self-perceived likelihood of chronic pain after injury ("Do you think you are more or less likely to develop chronic pain following injury than the average person?" with 2 possible responses of "More likely" or "Less likely"), self-perceived sensitivity to pain ("How sensitive are you to pain?" with 3 responses from "Less than average" to "More than average"), self-reported prolonged recovery times from past injuries (Answering "Yes" or "No" to the question, "Have you had unexpectedly long recovery times from injuries in the past?"), and self-perceived likelihood of addiction to pain medication after surgery ("How likely do you think it is that you will develop an addiction problem from pain medication you take after surgery?" with 4 responses from 1: "not at all"; 2: "unlikely"; 3: "somewhat likely"; or 4: "very likely") were included. The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) was administered to identify patients at risk for opioid-related aberrant behaviors. Additional assessments included the Marlow-Crowne Social Desirability Scale to assess social desirability bias, Barratt Impulsivity Scale to measure impulsive personality traits, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist–Civilian Version (PCL-C) to measure post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure current symptoms of anxiety vs a generalized propensity to be anxious, respectively, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to assess the severity of depressive symptoms, and the Euroqol Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which is a vertical visual analogue scale with values between 100 (best imaginable health) and 0 (worst imaginable health), for patients to provide a global assessment of their health.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^113URMg1]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication with approval for use in neuropathic pain and epileptic disorders. It is frequently added to multimodal analgesic regimens during and after surgery to reduce opioid use while controlling pain effectively. There is little evidence to show its effectiveness in major surgery.

Methods

In this multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled trial, adults undergoing major cardiac, thoracic or abdominal surgery were randomized to receive either gabapentin (600mg before surgery, 300mg twice daily for 2 days after surgery) or placebo. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included acute and chronic pain, total opioid use, adverse health events and health related quality of life. Patients were followed up daily in-hospital until discharge and then at 4-weeks and 4 months after surgery.

Results

1196 participants were randomized (500 underwent cardiac, 346 thoracic and 350 abdominal surgery); 596 were allocated to placebo and 600 were allocated to gabapentin. Median length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups (gabapentin 5.94 (IQR 4.08–8.04) days, placebo 6.15 (IQR 4.22–8.97) days; hazard ratio 1.07, 95%CI 0.95–1.20, p = 0.26). Overall, 384 participants experienced one or more serious adverse events (gabapentin 189/596, 31.7%; placebo 195/599, 32.6%), with some variation across surgical specialties.

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing major cardiac, thoracic and abdominal surgery, adding gabapentin to multimodal analgesic regimes did not alter the length of hospital stay, or the number of serious adverse events.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^1137MSKk]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery — multimodal pain control: A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be used and implemented before the induction of anesthesia (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Scheduling narcotic alternatives such as oral acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gabapentin rather than as needed is described as a simple way to limit opioids, and the scheduled use of nonselective or selective NSAIDs (and cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors), when not contraindicated, and acetaminophen (by mouth or intravenously) has been shown to improve postoperative analgesia and reduce systemic opioid consumption. Regarding anastomotic safety, recent meta-analyses demonstrated that, in patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of NSAIDs in the first 48 hours after surgery, the risk of anastomotic leakage was not significantly increased, although the effect appears molecule/class specific and more pronounced with NSAIDs for a period > 3 days after surgery; another meta-analysis found higher risk exclusively in emergency colorectal surgery (OR = 1.70 (95% CI, 1.11–2.68)), and the evidence is inconclusive and does not support the avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with low cardiovascular risk. Systemic perioperative gabapentinoids, ketamine, lidocaine, and α₂-agonists have been administered to improve analgesia and reduce systemic opioid consumption, but psychotropic adverse effects, dizziness, and sedation may impair immediate recovery, and high-dose systemic steroids have been shown to improve analgesia and pulmonary function without increasing wound complications, although additional safety data are needed. Local strategies including wound infiltration and abdominal trunk blocks with liposomal bupivacaine have shown promising results; limited data suggest transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block may be associated with decreased length of stay in laparoscopic surgery and that preoperative TAP blocks may provide better analgesia than end-of-case TAP blocks, while the efficacy of preemptive analgesia remains controversial and mainly limited to epidural blockade and TAP blocks.

### Perioperative gabapentin does not reduce postoperative delirium in older surgical patients: a randomized clinical trial [^1154Rjme]. Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain and opioid use are associated with postoperative delirium. We designed a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, double-blinded trial to determine whether perioperative administration of gabapentin reduced postoperative delirium after noncardiac surgery.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 347) or gabapentin 900mg (N = 350) administered preoperatively and for the first 3 postoperative days. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, opioid use, and length of hospital stay.

Results

Data for 697 patients were included, with a mean ± SD age of 72 ± 6 yr. The overall incidence of postoperative delirium in any of the first 3 days was 22.4% (24.0% in the gabapentin and 20.8% in the placebo groups; the difference was 3.20%; 95% CI, 3.22% to 9.72%; P = 0.30). The incidence of delirium did not differ between the two groups when stratified by surgery type, anesthesia type, or preoperative risk status. Gabapentin was shown to be opioid sparing, with lower doses for the intervention group versus the control group. For example, the morphine equivalents for the gabapentin-treated group, median 6.7mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 1.3, 20.0mg), versus control group, median 6.7mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 2.7, 24.8mg), differed on the first postoperative day (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Although postoperative opioid use was reduced, perioperative administration of gabapentin did not result in a reduction of postoperative delirium or hospital length of stay.

Regarding perioperative care for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to preoperative anxiolytic premedication, ERAS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using opioid-sparing multimodal re-anesthetic medication with a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentinoids, adjusted according to age and renal function. Limit gabapentinoids to a single lowest dose to avoid sedative side effects.

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain: a qualitative and quantitative systematic review, with focus on procedure [^115MzkwC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug used in a variety of chronic pain conditions. Increasing numbers of randomized trials indicate that gabapentin is effective as a postoperative analgesic. This procedure-specific systematic review aims to analyse the 24-hour postoperative effect of gabapentin on acute pain in adults.

Methods

Medline, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for double-blind randomized placebo controlled trials of gabapentin for postoperative pain relief compared with placebo, in adults undergoing a surgical procedure.

Qualitative analysis of postoperative effectiveness was evaluated by assessment of significant difference (P < 0.05) in pain relief using consumption of supplemental analgesic and pain scores between study groups.

Quantitative analyses of combined data from similar procedures, were performed by calculating the weighted mean difference (WMD) of 24-hour cumulated opioid requirements, and the WMD for visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, (early (6 h) and late (24 h) postoperatively), between study groups. Side-effects (nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation) were extracted for calculation of their relative risk (RR).

Results

Twenty-three trials with 1529 patients were included. In 12 of 16 studies with data on postoperative opioid requirement, the reported 24-hour opioid consumption was significantly reduced with gabapentin. Quantitative analysis of five trials in abdominal hysterectomy showed a significant reduction in morphine consumption (WMD – 13 mg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19 to -8 mg), and in early pain scores at rest (WMD – 11 mm on the VAS, 95% CI -12 to -2 mm) and during activity (WMD -8 mm on the VAS; 95% CI -13 to -3 mm), favouring gabapentin. In spinal surgery, (4 trials), analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in morphine consumption (WMD of – 31 mg (95%CI – 53 to -10 mg) and pain scores, early (WMD – 17 mm on the VAS; 95% CI -31 to -3 mm) and late (WMD -12 mm on the VAS; 95% CI -23 to -1 mm) also favouring gabapentin treatment. Nausea was improved with gabapentin in abdominal hysterectomy (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9). Other side-effects were unaffected.

Conclusion

Perioperative use of gabapentin has a significant 24-hour opioid sparing effect and improves pain score for both abdominal hysterectomy and spinal surgery. Nausea may be reduced in abdominal hysterectomy.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^111CGaSy]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Trial Design and Oversight

The GAP Study was a multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of gabapentin as an adjunct to standard multimodal analgesia. Participants, clinical care teams, and research teams were blinded to the treatment allocation. The trial protocol has been published previouslyand was approved by a National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee (Sheffield, United Kingdom), the United Kingdom Health Research Authority, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. It was registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN63614165). All participants provided written informed consent.

Patients

Adults aged 18 yr or older undergoing nonemergency cardiac, thoracic, or abdominal surgery were screened. Patients were expected to require a postoperative hospital stay of at least 2 days and be able to swallow during the intervention delivery period. Patients who were already taking antiepileptic medication (including gabapentinoids), who had a known allergy to gabapentin or had renal impairment (an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL · min⁻¹ · 1.73⁻¹), or who weighed less than 50 kg were excluded.

Trial Procedures

Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to gabapentin or placebo using a secure internet-based randomization system. Randomization was stratified by surgical specialty and site to ensure approximately equal allocation to gabapentin and placebo in each specialty and site. Allocations were permuted blocks of varying sizes, i.e. blocks of four, six, or eight.

The gabapentin group received 600 mg gabapentin preoperatively (as close to surgery as possible) and 600 mg/day (300 mg twice daily) postoperatively for 2 days, once able to swallow (i.e. after extubation). The placebo group were given identical capsules at the same dosing intervals. The dose and timing of the treatment were informed by the findings and recommendations from the most recent systematic review available at the time the study was designed. Dosing windows were classified as 6 h either side of the prescribed time point. Other analgesia prescribed (i.e. the standard multimodal regimen used) was at the discretion of the treating clinician.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^111zTn2b]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Length of Hospital Stay

Six participants died before discharge, four in the cardiac specialty (one placebo and three gabapentin) and two in the thoracic specialty (both gabapentin). Those in the placebo group stayed a median 6.15 (IQR, 4.22 to 8.97) days, and those in the gabapentin group stayed a median 5.94 (IQR, 4.08 to 8.04) days postoperatively (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.20; P = 0.26; fig. 2 A). The hazard ratio for hospital discharge was similar across the three surgical specialties (P = 0.94). The target of a 12.5% difference in the proportion discharged within 5 days (cardiac and abdominal specialties) or 3 days (thoracic specialty) between the groups was not met in any specialty (table 2). The sensitivity analyses did not affect the conclusions (supplemental table 2,), and no subgroup differences were identified (fig. 2, B to D; supplemental table 3).

### Preoperative factors associated with remote postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: post hoc analysis of a perioperative gabapentin trial [^111JfP7h]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Eligible Participants

Data for this analysis was collected as part of the Stanford Accelerated Recovery Trial (START). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effect of perioperative gabapentin vs active placebo on postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort at a tertiary academic medical center. Administration of perioperative gabapentin had no effect on postoperative pain resolution, but had a modest, but significant, effect on reducing the duration of opioid use after surgery. Results from the primary analysis have been reported previously, along with the complete study protocol tracking protocol amendments, and trial methodology.

The study protocol was approved by the Stanford IRB, and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01067144). The surgical team introduced the study to patients, and the research team subsequently contacted participants for screening and enrollment. All participants provided written, informed consent. The primary study was designed to determine whether perioperative gabapentin promoted postoperative pain and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort of patients undergoing thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, primary or revision total hip replacement, primary or revision total knee replacement, unilateral or bilateral mastectomy, breast lumpectomy with or without sentinel node biopsy or axillary node dissection, hand surgery, carpal tunnel surgery, knee arthroscopy, shoulder arthroplasty, and shoulder arthroscopy. Exclusion criteria included known kidney disease, current gabapentin or pregabalin use, cognitive impairment, history of excessive sedation or adverse reaction to gabapentin, coexisting chronic pain (severity level of > 4 of 10 on the numeric rating scale of pain, with 10 being the most severe level) excluding the planned surgical site, conditions precluding postoperative follow-up, suicidality (as assessed by greater than 0 response to question 9 of the BDI-II), pregnancy, ataxia, dizziness, sedation, narrow-angle glaucoma, severe respiratory insufficiency, history of gastric bypass surgery, and obstructive sleep apnea requiring a continuous positive airway pressure device. A total of 1805 patients, aged 18 to 75 years-old, scheduled for an eligible operation were screened, and 422 patients were randomized for the trial from 2010 to 2014 and followed longitudinally for 2 years postoperatively.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^1115xJEg]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, ~51.4 million inpatient surgeries are performed annually and postoperative pain is experienced by as much as 75% of patients.–Effective postoperative pain management following surgery is critical. Inadequate postoperative pain management can negatively impact the patient's health, recovery, and overall experience. In addition to immediate discomfort, untreated pain is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and decreased quality of life. Furthermore, chronic postsurgical pain, pain that lasts 2 months and is not attributable to a preexisting medical condition, can develop. While the majority of surgical patients recover and return to a functional status, some patients are more likely to develop long-term opioid use and chronic postsurgical pain. Following limb amputations, breast cancer surgeries, and heart bypass surgeries, the incidence of postsurgical pain is especially high.

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain: a qualitative and quantitative systematic review, with focus on procedure [^1179sxqd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and complications such as nausea and vomiting, continues to be a major challenge in postoperative care and plays an important role in the early mobilization and well-being of the surgical patient. Opioid analgesics, with their well-known side-effects, continues to represent a cornerstone in postoperative pain control, and testing new analgesics as well as combinations of analgesics in order to reduce the need for opioids, is a key area in acute pain research.

Gabapentin, an anti-epileptic drug that has demonstrated analgesic effect in both diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia and neuropathic pain, affects the nociceptive process by binding to the α₂δ subunit of voltage dependent calcium channels. In pain models it has shown anti-hyperalgesic properties, possibly by reducing central sensitization, a prerequisite for postoperative hyperalgesia, and gabapentin, together with dextromethorphan and ketamine, represents a new option in postoperative pain care, which recently has been the subject of intensive research.

An increasing number of randomized trials indicate that gabapentin is effective as an postoperative analgesic. Until now, four meta-analyses with pooled data from rather few studies (7, 8, 12 and 16 trials, respectively), demonstrates that gabapentin displays an effect on both postoperative pain score and opioid usage. In these meta-analyses, data from studies with very different surgical interventions are pooled and therefore the effect in a particular surgical setting is difficult to predict. We find that the recent number of publications allows a more procedure-specific systematic review in this area, which is the purpose of this paper.

### Perioperative gabapentin may reduce opioid requirement for early postoperative pain in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113DszX3]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of perioperative gabapentin or pregabalin treatment on postoperative pain and opioid requirement reduction in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).

Methods

A systematic review of randomized control trials was conducted evaluating the effect of gabapentin or pregabalin on postoperative pain and opioid requirement for patients undergoing ACLR. The primary outcomes assessed were postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements. Secondary outcomes were complications, side effects, dosage, and timing of intervention.

Results

The initial search query identified 151 studies and 6 studies were included after full-text articles were reviewed. Three studies investigated the use of gabapentin and three studies investigated pregabalin. All three gabapentin studies reported significantly decreased or equivalent pain scores while also significantly reducing or removing total opioid consumption compared to control groups. Pregabalin demonstrated inconsistent efficacy for pain control and opioid consumption parameters across three studies. One study (pregabalin, n = 1) reported significantly increased incidence of dizziness with pregabalin compared to placebo.

Conclusions

There is moderate evidence demonstrating that preoperative gabapentin may be safe and effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption after ACLR. Gabapentin may be considered when employed as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen; however, the optimal protocol has yet to be determined. Currently, there is limited evidence demonstrating the efficacy of pregabalin on pain and opioid consumption in the setting of ACLR.

### Gabapentinoids and opioids for postoperative analgesia… [^111m8n7s]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

In this issue of JAMA Network Open, a large commercial database study of more than 5. 5 million adult surgical patients by Bykov and colleagues1 is presented. The authors used propensity score trimming and stratification to evaluate the putative association of perioperative coadministration of gabapentinoids and opioid analgesics with opioid-related adverse events. This unique study offers insight into opioid-induced respiratory depression, which may occur at any time in the perioperative period. 2 While the prevalence of OIRD in postsurgical patients varies by type of surgery, it can be substantial, ranging from approximately 3% to 17% and 72%. 3 With this in mind, the use of multimechanistic postoperative analgesic regimens for both pain control and reduction of opioid-associated adverse effects makes good intuitive sense, but the data are scarce.

The evidence in support of the analgesic benefit of gabapentinoids combined with opioids for postoperative analgesia is equivocal; there is no real support that adding gabapentinoids to opioid pain relievers offers additive, much less synergistic, enhancements to pain control. Indeed, the use of gabapentinoids as adjuvant agents for pain relief following surgery is an off-label indication, albeit an indication that is garnering more and more attention. This study found that of more than 5. 5 million eligible admissions, 441 overdose events could be identified, so the risk of opioid toxic effects was

1. 4 per 10 000 patients with gabapentinoid exposure, compared with 0. 7 per 10 000 patients without exposure. 1 This demonstrates an association of the combination regimen of gabapentinoids and opioids for postoperative pain with the risk of opioid-related adverse events, including opioid overdose.

This real-world cohort of surgical patients indicates that even the short-term use of opioids with gabapentinoids for postsurgical pain was associated with significantly increased risks of opioid-associated adverse effects, such as OIRD. Considering that combination analgesic regimens generally reduce overall opioid consumption, this study is important because it shows that this may not necessarily translate to reducing opioid-associated adverse events. As combination analgesia gains traction for in-hospital acute painful conditions, such as postsurgical pain, it is important to be guided by evidence rather than intuition.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^111FcJMW]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 17 — gabapentin or pregabalin for multimodal analgesia: The panel recommends that clinicians consider use of gabapentin or pregabalin as a component of multimodal analgesia (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Both medications are associated with reduced opioid requirements after major or minor surgical procedures, and some studies reported lower postoperative pain scores. Effective preoperative regimens in trials used 600 or 1200 mg of gabapentin or 150 or 300 mg of pregabalin, administered 1–2 hours preoperatively. These drugs are only available in oral form, potentially limiting their use in the immediate postoperative period. Potential adverse effects include dizziness and sedation that has not been linked to respiratory depression; dose reductions are recommended in patients with impaired renal function. Although evidence on effectiveness of gabapentin or pregabalin in children is limited, some randomized trials found beneficial effects of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative pain and opioid use.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^1137TXu7]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Clinicians or Policymakers

Guidance for use of gabapentin in the perioperative setting varies: Gabapentin is included as a "strong recommendation" as a component of multimodal analgesia for the management of postoperative pain in the United States, but not in Europe. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued a "recommendation for research" for the place of gabapentin in the perioperative setting. The findings of this study, taken together with previous research, suggest that gabapentin should not be part of standard perioperative analgesic regimens for unselected patients undergoing major body cavity surgery as it provides little benefit for either patients or care providers.

Unanswered Questions and Future Research

The GAP Study was not designed to test the place of gabapentin as "rescue" therapy for those whose pain is not controllable using conventional multimodal analgesia. The place of gabapentin in those with preexisting and persistent postsurgical pain must also be answered. Therefore, there is potential for studies to investigate the place of gabapentin in this setting. However, the differences in NRS between gabapentin and placebo at rest and on movement were small and clinically insignificant. It is therefore unlikely that it will be effective at controlling pain after major surgery, even as a rescue therapy.

Conclusions

Among participants undergoing major cardiac, thoracic, and abdominal surgery, the addition of gabapentin to multimodal analgesic regimes did not result in a clinically important change in hospital length of stay, opioid use, acute pain, nor quality of life. Participants who took gabapentin had a higher incidence of pain at 4 months.

Cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS) in the perioperative period — presentation, risk, monitoring, and treatment: CWS diagnosis per DSM-5 follows "abrupt cessation or reduction of heavy cannabis use accompanied by three or more symptoms including irritability or anger, anxiety, insomnia, decreased appetite, restlessness, altered mood, and a physical symptom causing significant discomfort", and symptoms "can occur 24 to 72 hours after cannabis cessation, peak in the first week, and can last up to 2 weeks". A Canadian panel advised high suspicion postoperatively in those consuming "greater than 1.5 g/ day of inhaled cannabis or 20 mg/day THC-dominant cannabis oil", and patients using unknown-content products "more than 2–3 times per day" are at risk. At-risk users "should be monitored" postoperatively, and "The Cannabis Withdrawal Scale can be used to monitor severity". In hospitalized patients, withdrawal can present as "disrupted sleep, inadequate pain control, changes in opioid use, agitation, restlessness, and even early discontinuation of treatment". Mechanistically, CB1 receptor changes "begin to reverse after 24–48 hours of abstinence before returning to normal in approximately 4 weeks". Pharmacologically, a "12-week" randomized trial in "50" outpatients showed "Gabapentin 1200 mg/day resulted in decreased withdrawal symptoms… compared with placebo". The panel statement notes highest risk with high/unknown THC exposure and less risk with CBD-dominant products "(> 10:1 CBD to THC ratio)" with "Level of certainty: Moderate". Recommendations: "Patients using cannabis should be counselled regarding the risk of CWS" and monitored using a validated scale "Grade C", and "initiating a cannabinoid agent such as dronabinol at a low dose is the best choice to treat severe CWS postoperatively. Grade C".

### Perioperative gabapentin use and in-hospital adverse clinical events among older adults after major surgery [^116eVyYw]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Gabapentin has been increasingly used as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen to reduce opioid use in perioperative pain management. However, the safety of perioperative gabapentin use among older patients remains uncertain.

Objective

To examine in-hospital adverse clinical events associated with perioperative gabapentin use among older patients undergoing major surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study using data from the Premier Healthcare Database included patients aged 65 years or older who underwent major surgery at US hospitals within 7 days of hospital admission from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2018, and did not use gabapentin before surgery. Data were analyzed from June 14, 2021, to May 23, 2022.

Exposures

Gabapentin use within 2 days after surgery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was delirium, identified using diagnosis codes, and secondary outcomes were new antipsychotic use, pneumonia, and in-hospital death between postoperative day 3 and hospital discharge. To reduce confounding, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% CIs were estimated.

Results

Among 967 547 patients before propensity score matching (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [7.4] years; 59.6% female), the rate of perioperative gabapentin use was 12.3% (119 087 patients). After propensity score matching, 237 872 (118 936 pairs) gabapentin users and nonusers (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.7] years; 62.7% female) were identified. Compared with nonusers, gabapentin users had increased risk of delirium (4040 [3.4%] vs 3148 [2.6%]; RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.23–1.34]; RD, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.75 [0.61–0.89] per 100 persons), new antipsychotic use (944 [0.8%] vs 805 [0.7%]; RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07–1.29]; RD, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.05–0.19] per 100 persons), and pneumonia (1521 [1.3%] vs 1368 [1.2%]; RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03–1.20]; RD, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.04–0.22] per 100 persons), but there was no difference in in-hospital death (362 [0.3%] vs 354 [0.2%]; RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.88–1.18]; RD, 0.00 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.05] per 100 persons). Risk of delirium among gabapentin users was greater in subgroups with high comorbidity burden than in those with low comorbidity burden (combined comorbidity index < 4 vs ≥ 4: RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.13–1.27] vs 1.40 [95% CI, 1.30–1.51]; RD, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28–0.53] vs 2.66 [95% CI, 2.08–3.24] per 100 persons) and chronic kidney disease (absence vs presence: RR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.19–1.33] vs 1.38 [95% CI, 1.27–1.49]; RD, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.42–0.69] vs 1.97 [95% CI, 1.49–2.46] per 100 persons).

Conclusion and Relevance

In this cohort study, perioperative gabapentin use was associated with increased risk of delirium, new antipsychotic use, and pneumonia among older patients after major surgery. These results suggest careful risk-benefit assessment before prescribing gabapentin for perioperative pain management.

### WITHDRAWN: gabapentin for acute and chronic pain [^115Dqmn6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

February 2009: The authors are aware of unpublished trial data for Gabapentin which could affect the results of this review. This information together with that from trials published since 2005, will be considered when this review is updated in 2009. Anticonvulsant drugs have been used in the management of pain since the 1960s. The clinical impression is that they are useful for chronic neuropathic pain, especially when the pain is lancinating or burning.

Objectives

To evaluate the analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects of gabapentin for pain management in clinical practice.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of gabapentin in acute, chronic or cancer pain were identified by MEDLINE (1966 to Nov 2004), EMBASE (1994 to Nov 2004), SIGLE (1980 to Jan 2004) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004). Additional studies were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. Date of most recent search: January 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of gabapentin in participants with subjective pain assessment as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent review authors, and trials were quality scored. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse effects and drug-related study withdrawal.

Main Results

Fourteen reports describing 15 studies of gabapentin were considered eligible (1468 participants). One was a study of acute pain. The remainder included the following conditions: post-herpetic neuralgia (two studies), diabetic neuropathy (seven studies), a cancer related neuropathic pain (one study) phantom limb pain (one study), Guillain Barré syndrome (one study), spinal chord injury pain (one study) and various neuropathic pains (one study). The study in acute post-operative pain (70 participants) showed no benefit for gabapentin compared to placebo for pain at rest. In chronic pain, the NNT for improvement in all trials with evaluable data is 4.3 (95% CI 3.5 to 5.7). Forty two percent of participants improved on gabapentin compared to 19% on placebo. The number needed to harm (NNH) for adverse events leading to withdrawal from a trial was not significant. Fourteen percent of participants withdrew from active arms compared to 10% in placebo arms. The NNH for minor harm was 3.7 (95% CI 2.4 to 5.4). The NNT for effective pain relief in diabetic neuropathy was 2.9 (95% CI 2.2 to 4.3) and for post herpetic neuralgia 3.9 (95% CI 3 to 5.7).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence to show that gabapentin is effective in neuropathic pain. There is limited evidence to show that gabapentin is ineffective in acute pain.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in acute postoperative pain: a meta-analysis [^113vsx6e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Multimodal treatment of postoperative pain using adjuncts such as gabapentin is becoming more common. Pregabalin has anti-hyperalgesic properties similar to gabapentin. In this systematic review, we evaluated randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) for the analgesic efficacy and opioid-sparing effect of pregabalin in acute postoperative pain. A systematic search of Medline (1966–2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar was performed. We identified 11 valid RCTs that used pregabalin for acute postoperative pain. Postoperative pain intensity was not reduced by pregabalin. Cumulative opioid consumption at 24 h was significantly decreased with pregabalin. At pregabalin doses of < 300 mg, there was a reduction of 8.8 mg [weighted mean difference (WMD)]. At pregabalin doses ≥ 300 mg, cumulative opioid consumption was even lower (WMD, -13.4 mg). Pregabalin reduced opioid-related adverse effects such as vomiting [risk ratio (RR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56–0.95]. However, the risk of visual disturbance was greater (RR 3.29; 95% CI 1.95–5.57). Perioperative pregabalin administration reduced opioid consumption and opioid-related adverse effects after surgery.

### Effect of perioperative gabapentin use on postsurgical pain in patients undergoing head and neck mucosal surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^115qULqA]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Effective postoperative pain management increases patient satisfaction, reduces cost, reduces morbidity, and shortens hospitalizations. Previous studies investigating multimodal pain therapy in otolaryngology patients focused on homogenous patient groups with short postoperative follow-up times.

Objective

To investigate the effect of perioperative gabapentin treatment on postsurgical pain in patients undergoing head and neck mucosal surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Adults undergoing head and neck mucosal surgery from July 25, 2016, through June 19, 2017, were included in this double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial and randomized to receive gabapentin, 300 mg twice daily, or placebo before surgery and up to 72 hours after surgery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was hourly narcotic use calculated in morphine equivalents. Secondary outcomes included subjective visual analog scale pain scores captured for resting, coughing, and swallowing using a 0- to 100-mm scale (a 100-mm line anchored with no pain on the left end and worst possible pain on the right end). A change of 10 mm or more was deemed to be clinically meaningful. Additional secondary outcome measures included degree of pain control, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.

Results

Of the 110 patients randomized to receive gabapentin or placebo, 11 and 10 withdrew from each group, respectively. Ninety patients were then analyzed: 44 in the gabapentin group (mean [SD] age, 61.1 [10.0] years; 33 [75%] male; 40 [91%] white) and 46 in the placebo group (mean [SD] age, 60.9 [11.3] years; 35 [78%] male; 43 [94%] white). Both groups had similar self-reported levels of preoperative pain and narcotic effectiveness. A median difference of 0.26 mg/h of morphine (95% CI, -0.27 to 0.94 mg/h) was found between groups. After controlling for comorbidity and self-reported baseline pain levels, mixed model analysis found the difference in marginal means of visual analog scale scores between groups to be lower in the gabapentin group compared with the placebo group for all categories (rest difference, 7.9 mm; 95% CI, -0.4 to 16.2 mm; cough difference, 8.9 mm; 95% CI, -0.5 to 18.3 mm; swallow difference, 9.4 mm; 95% CI, -1.2 to 20.0 mm). More patients in the gabapentin group reported that pain was always well controlled than in the placebo group (difference, 9.2%; 95% CI, -21% to 3%). Gabapentin and placebo groups reported similar levels of satisfaction with pain control (difference, 2%; 95% CI, -11% to 15%). There was no clinically meaningful difference in reported nausea between the 2 groups (difference, 6%; 95% CI, -14% to 26%).

Conclusion and Relevance

Perioperative gabapentin given 300 mg twice daily did not result in reduced narcotic use, but results were compatible with clinically meaningful reductions in pain scores. Satisfaction with pain control and adverse effects were similar between groups.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^111eBxaC]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

American Society of Anesthesiologists acute pain management — multimodal techniques: Whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain management therapy, and the following drugs should be considered as part of a postoperative multimodal pain management regimen: COX-2 selective NSAIDs (COXIBs), nonselective NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and calcium channel α₂δ antagonists (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin). Unless contraindicated, all patients should receive an around-the-clock regimen of NSAIDs, COXIBs, or acetaminophen, regional blockade with local anesthetics should be considered as part of a multimodal approach for pain management, dosing regimens should be administered to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events, and the choice of medication, dose, route, and duration of therapy should be individualized. Panel response distributions include the following examples: dosing regimens should be administered to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events (N 264; strongly agree 71.2*, agree 27.3, equivocal 1.1, disagree 0.4, strongly disagree 0.0) and whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain management therapy (N 267; strongly agree 56.2*, agree 28.1, equivocal 12.4, disagree 2.6, strongly disagree 0.7).

### Gabapentin in procedure-specific postoperative pain management-preplanned subgroup analyses from a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^111HrLUH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Most previous systematic reviews report favorable results for gabapentin treatment, similar to the findings from the all trials estimates in the subgroup analyses of the present review. In comparison with the systematic reviews of gabapentin for hysterectomy, cholecystectomy and thoracic surgeries, more trials have been included in our subgroups. Due to different inclusion criteria and subgroup analyses in the different published systematic reviews, it is not possible to conduct a full comparison of estimates.

However, none of the systematic reviews above have investigated the risk of SAEs, limiting the ability to weigh the benefit and harm of gabapentin in perioperative pain management.

Impact of the analyses

We observed no systematic differences in postoperative opioid consumption, pain intensity, or adverse- or serious adverse events between six different surgical procedures treated with peri-operative gabapentin.

SAEs were very poorly reported, and only half the subgroups reported this outcome. More than 80% of the SAEs were reported in the thoracic surgery trials, making it impossible to rely on the risk and subgroup differences between the surgical procedures. In the original review, excess SAEs were reported in the gabapentin versus control groups, and approximately twice as many SAEs were found in trials with low risk of bias, compared with all trials. Most trials have a short follow-up period and only report on SAEs and adverse effects for a short period postoperatively, which seems insufficient for a full evaluation. The inconsequent and diverse reporting of SAEs and adverse events complicates any reliable evaluation of these outcomes.

### A case illustrating the practical application of the AAOS clinical practice guideline: pharmacologic, physical, and cognitive pain alleviation for musculoskeletal extremity / pelvis surgery [^117WfLtj]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guideline "Pharmacologic, Physical, and Cognitive Pain Alleviation for Musculoskeletal Extremity/Pelvis Surgery" is a summary of the available literature designed to help guide surgeons provide a safe and effective means of pain alleviation for orthopaedic surgery patients. The following case study demonstrates these guidelines at work in a patient undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty. The recommendations listed in the following sentences are from the Clinical Practice Guideline. Preoperative patient education regarding the effects of opioids and benefits of early termination may help patients discontinue opioids earlier in their postoperative course. Perioperative use of intravenous ketamine and regional anesthesia continuous peripheral nerve catheters help reduce pain scores and decrease opioid use. Postoperative cryotherapy may provide a modest benefit in reducing pain scores. Postoperative cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) and oral acetaminophen improve pain and decrease opioid use. Combination opioid/NSAIDs may provide a modest improvement in pain scores at the expense of NSAID dose optimization in the postoperative period. Gabapentin has not been shown to improve patient outcomes; however, pregabalin may decrease pain and opioid use after total joint arthroplasty.

### Preoperative factors associated with remote postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: post hoc analysis of a perioperative gabapentin trial [^111bUptV]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Multivariable Analysis of Postoperative Pain Resolution

The final multivariable model for time to pain cessation was stratified by operation to control for confounding by varying degrees of tissue injury. A number of preoperative factors remained significantly associated with delayed pain resolution across all operations (Table 4). Every 1-point increase in the NRS at the future surgical site was associated with a 7% reduction in the rate of postoperative pain cessation (p -value = 0.034). A self-reported history of prolonged recovery times from past injuries was associated with a 38% reduction in the rate of postoperative pain cessation (p -value = 0.034). Every 10-point increase in the Trait Anxiety Inventory Score was associated with a 21% reduction in the rate of pain cessation (p -value = 0.002).

Table 4
Determinants of Pain Cessation Rate: Multivariable Analysis

Univariate Analysis of Postoperative Opioid Cessation

Univariate Cox regression analyses for time to opioid cessation was conducted with stratification by type of operation. A number of preoperative variables were significantly associated with prolonged opioid use (Table 5). Higher preoperative pain, higher self-perceived likelihood of developing chronic pain after surgery, higher self-perceived likelihood of chronic pain after injury, higher BDI-II score, higher State Anxiety Inventory score, female gender, randomization to active placebo, and past 30-day prescription opioid use were all significantly associated with prolonged opioid use after surgery.

Table 5
Determinants of Opioid Cessation Rate: Univariate Analysis

Multivariable Analysis of Postoperative Opioid Cessation

After stratification by type of operation, the final multivariable model for time to opioid cessation included several significant preoperative factors associated with delayed opioid cessation across all surgery types (Table 6). Past 30-day prescription opioid use before surgery was associated with a 40% reduction in the rate of postoperative opioid cessation (p -value = 0.020). Every 5-point increase in the BDI-II score was associated with an 12% decrease in the rate of postoperative opioid cessation (p -value = 0.017). Every 1-point increase in the NRS outside the future surgical site was associated with a 6% reduction in the rate of postoperative pain cessation (p -value = 0.046). Randomization to perioperative gabapentin treatment, after adjusting for these significant preoperative factors, resulted in a 37% increase in the rate of opioid cessation (p -value = 0.016).

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^117Y3tye]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Preoperative adjunct gabapentin administration significantly reduces opioid consumption within the initial 24 hours following surgery, with similar incidence rates of side effects. The greatest reduction was observed in gynecologic and breast cancers, cholecystectomy, and orthopedic and thyroid surgeries. The observed reduction in postoperative opioid consumption with preoperative gabapentin supports the notion of incorporating gabapentin in the multimodal analgesic treatment plans for postoperative pain management among patients undergoing elective surgery.

### Effectiveness of gabapentinoids in orthopedic surgeries: a systematic review and meta-analysis of postoperative pain, and opioid-sparing effects [^115XLaRf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Gabapentinoids, including gabapentin and pregabalin, were associated with statistically significant reductions in postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption following orthopedic surgeries. However, the absolute magnitude of these effects was limited and of uncertain clinical relevance. Additionally, the use of gabapentinoids was linked to an increased incidence of adverse effects, particularly dizziness and visual disturbances. These findings indicate that while gabapentinoids may have a role in select contexts, their routine use for postoperative pain management in orthopedic patients is not strongly supported by the current evidence. Clinical decisions should be individualized, taking into account the potential for side effects, patient-specific risk factors, and the type of surgical procedure. Further research is needed to better define optimal dosing, timing of administration, and patient populations that may derive greater benefit.

Results

Participants

Between April 2018 and May 2022, 3,405 patients were assessed for eligibility in seven United Kingdom NHS hospitals, of whom 2,209 were excluded. Reasons for exclusion can be found in the Supplemental Digital Content. Therefore, 1,196 participants were randomized into the study (596 allocated to placebo and 600 to gabapentin; fig. 1). Follow-up data at 4 weeks and 4 months were available for 1,153 of 1,196 (96.4%) and 1,120 of 1,196 (93.6%) randomized participants, respectively. Baseline characteristics were well balanced across the groups; the median age was 68 (interquartile range [IQR], 60 to 74) yr, 794 of 1,195 (66.4%) patients were male, 1,174 of 1,193 (98.4%) were of white/Caucasian ethnicity, and median body mass index was 27.3 (24.4 to 30.9) kg/m² (table 1; supplemental table 1).

One participant withdrew consent for their data to be used. The analysis population was therefore 1,195 participants. In total, 957 of 1,195 (80.1%) participants received all trial medication per protocol (487 of 596 [81.7%] in the placebo group and 470 of 599 [78.5%] in the gabapentin group). The most common protocol deviation was participants receiving fewer than the prescribed six capsules of trial medication or receiving medication outside of the dosing window (99 of 596 [16.6%] placebo and 124 of 599 [20.7%] gabapentin). In total, 27 participants withdrew after randomization: 13 participant decisions after surgery (1 participant moved to a nonparticipating institution, and 12 withdrew from follow-up), 2 due to clinicians deeming the participant no longer eligible, and 12 did not undergo surgery in the trial.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^114NDz7i]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication with approval for use in neuropathic pain and epileptic disorders. It is frequently added to multimodal analgesic regimens during and after surgery to reduce opioid use while controlling pain effectively. There is little evidence to show its effectiveness in major surgery.

Methods:

In this multicenter, double-blinded randomized controlled trial, adults undergoing major cardiac, thoracic, or abdominal surgery were randomized to receive either gabapentin (600 mg before surgery, 300 mg twice daily for 2 days after surgery) or placebo. The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included acute and chronic pain, total opioid use, adverse health events, and health-related quality of life. Patients were followed up daily in-hospital until discharge and then at 4 weeks and 4 months after surgery.

Results:

A total of 1,196 participants were randomized (500 underwent cardiac, 346 thoracic, and 350 abdominal surgery); 596 were allocated to placebo, and 600 were allocated to gabapentin. Median length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups (gabapentin, 5.94 [interquartile range (IQR), 4.08 to 8.04] days; placebo, 6.15 [IQR, 4.22 to 8.97] days; hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.20; P = 0.26). Overall, 384 participants experienced one or more serious adverse events (gabapentin, 189 of 596 [31.7%]; placebo, 195 of 599 [32.6%]), with some variation across surgical specialties.

Conclusions:

Among patients undergoing major cardiac, thoracic, and abdominal surgery, adding gabapentin to multimodal analgesic regimes did not alter the length of hospital stay or the number of serious adverse events.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^117Midgo]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation in the Context of Existing/Other Evidence

The most recent comprehensive meta-analysis, including 281 trials (24,682 participants), showed no clinically meaningful benefit of gabapentinoids on acute or chronic pain after surgery. Only 17 of 281 (2,463 participants) trials in this meta-analysis examined length of hospital stay. Length of stay is important, as it is reflective of all harms and benefits in the peri- and postoperative period, which are important to both patients and healthcare providers. While many studies of gabapentin in the perioperative period (including the GAP Study) report statistically significant differences in pain scores or opioid use, very few show clinically important differences in pain (10-mm difference on a 100-mm visual analog score) or time to cessation of pain. The mean NRS scores in the GAP Study were lower in the gabapentin group at all in-hospital time points. However, at no time point and in no specialty, at rest or on movement, was the mean difference in NRS score more than 1 point on a 10-point scale. Gabapentin also did not improve the incidence of or the experience of longer-term pain.

The GAP Study showed reductions of around one quarter to one third in the use of opioids for those undergoing thoracic and abdominal surgery in-hospital. These reductions were most marked during the period of intervention (i.e. for the first 2 days after surgery). However, these reductions were modest when viewed as absolute reductions in opioid use (maximum observed difference: abdominal surgery, day 2 postoperatively: placebo median 21.8 [IQR, 9.9 to 40.3] mg IV morphine equivalents versus gabapentin 14.5 (IQR, 4.4 to 32.1) mg IV morphine equivalents). The most cited risks of gabapentin in the postoperative period are somnolence and respiratory depression, particularly when combined with opioids. No serious adverse events of somnolence or respiratory depression were reported. Somnolence occurred in 4 participants (0.7%) randomized to placebo and 11 participants (1.8%) randomized to gabapentin during the trial. Respiratory depression was reported in 3 participants overall: 1 in the placebo group (0.2%) and 2 in the gabapentin group (0.3%). The number of adverse events in the neurologic and respiratory Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities classes was broadly similar (and inconsistently distributed) between the gabapentin and placebo groups.

### Do surgical patients benefit from perioperative gabapentin / pregabalin? A systematic review of efficacy and safety [^111qn1Zj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin and pregabalin have antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic properties useful for treating neuropathic pain. These properties may also be beneficial in acute postoperative pain. In this study we evaluated randomized, controlled trials examining the analgesic efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical value of gabapentinoids in postoperative pain.

Methods

A systematic search of Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases yielded 22 randomized, controlled trials on perioperative administration of gabapentinoids for postoperative pain relief.

Results

Pain relief was better in the gabapentin groups compared with the control groups. The opioid-sparing effect during the first 24 h after a single dose of gabapentin 300–1200 mg, administered 1–2 h preoperatively, ranged from 20% to 62%. The combined effect of a single dose of gabapentin was a reduction of opioid consumption equivalent to 30 ± 4 mg of morphine (mean ± 95% CI) during the first 24 h after surgery. Metaregression analysis suggested that the gabapentin-induced reduction in the 24-h opioid consumption was not significantly dependent on the gabapentin dose. Gabapentin reduced opioid-related adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention (number-needed-to-treat 25, 6, and 7, respectively). The most common adverse effects of the gabapentinoids were sedation and dizziness (number-needed-to-harm 35 and 12, respectively).

Conclusions

Gabapentinoids effectively reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and opioid-related adverse effects after surgery. Conclusions about the optimal dose and duration of the treatment cannot be made because of the heterogeneity of the trials. Studies are needed to determine the long-term benefits, if any, of perioperative gabapentinoids.

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain – a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113PFqMJ]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of perioperative gabapentin administration for the control of acute postoperative pain. We searched Medline (1966–2006), the Cochrane Library (2006), Scopus, CINAHL and bibliographies from clinical trials and review articles. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentin with inactive controls in surgical patients. Sixteen valid RCTs were included. Weighted mean difference (WMD) for postoperative pain intensity (0–100 mm visual analogue scale) was -16.55 mm at 6 h and -10.87 mm at 24 h for treatment with a single preoperative dose of gabapentin 1200 mg. Cumulative opioid consumption at 24 h was also significantly decreased with gabapentin (WMD, -27.90 mg). When gabapentin was administered at doses less than 1200 mg, pain intensity was also lower at 6 h (WMD, -22.43 mm) and 24 h (WMD, -13.18 mm). Cumulative 24 h opioid consumption was also lower (WMD, -7.25 mg). Gabapentin was associated with an increased risk of sedation (Peto OR 3.86; 95% CI 2.50–5.94) but less opioid-related side effects such as vomiting (Peto OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.39–0.86) and pruritus (Peto OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.10–0.74). In conclusion, gabapentin has an analgesic and opioid-sparing effect in acute postoperative pain management when used in conjunction with opioids.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111GCekE]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — ambulatory risk management and pharmacotherapy options emphasizes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy as soon as possible, with benzodiazepines recommended as first-line treatment; phenobarbital can be used as an alternative in Level 2-WM settings for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use but should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use. For patients at high risk of severe withdrawal, front loading with a benzodiazepine is recommended and patients should be closely observed for over-sedation and respiratory depression following administration. For lower-risk patients, providing at least a single or a few doses of benzodiazepine is appropriate, including when there is a history of severe or complicated withdrawal, risk for complications of significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric illness (particularly cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease), or signs/symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content. Risk stratification includes timing within the 6–36 hour window after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol consumption; if risk is unknown, patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours. For those at risk of developing mild or moderate withdrawal, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate options.

### Factors associated with acute pain estimation, postoperative pain resolution, opioid cessation, and recovery: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1126PYz8]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has limitations. As a secondary analysis, the data originate from a clinical trial, and future work to replicate these study findings are needed across a variety of surgical cohorts. Although categorization to the high pain cluster of the average acute pain trajectory was predictive of remote pain and opioid cessation, worst pain reported on POD 10 was predictive of all outcomes (persistent pain, prolonged opioid use, and delayed surgical recovery). External validation in separate surgical cohorts is needed to address the possibility of overfitting predictors to this specific cohort of patients. Future studies should seek to replicate the categorization of distinct surgical cohorts into high vs low acute pain clusters and determine the best acute pain predictors of remote outcomes. Also, the trial did not dictate a standard postoperative pain management protocol, and treatment with opioids was not actively discontinued or tapered after surgery. Given the ongoing opioid crisis and efforts to limit opioid prescribing for acute pain, it will be important to validate our findings in future surgical cohorts.

Randomization to active placebo was a risk factor for categorization to the high pain cluster of the average acute pain trajectory over the first 10 postoperative days in our cohort. Contrasting with the original START findings, which did not identify any differences in treatment group on remote pain resolution (5 consecutive postoperative reports of 0 of 10 levels of average pain at the surgical site on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale). Median time to pain resolution in the START was 84 days (IQR, 36–203) in patients receiving gabapentin and 73 days (IQR, 36–231) in patients receiving active placebo. Only 9.6% of patients who had received gabapentin and 5.6% of patients who had received active placebo had reached pain cessation by POD 10. Because both perioperative gabapentin and active placebo were administered up to 72 hours after surgery, treatment may have been associated with reducing the intensity of acute postoperative pain during the first 10 postoperative days, affecting categorization to the high vs low acute pain cluster rather than remote pain resolution originally reported in START.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^111MkWt4]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study

The major strengths of this study are that it was pragmatic, at low risk of bias, and integrated in the existing usual care pathways for major surgery across a number of centers. It was also conducted in three major surgical specialties, ensuring that findings are generalizable to all major body cavity surgery. No other study of gabapentin in the perioperative setting has included such a wide variety of surgery types. Most previous studies were limited to a single specialty and, in many cases, a single operation (e.g. hysterectomy, single joint replacement). Although more participants were recruited from the cardiac (500) than the thoracic (346) and abdominal (350) surgery specialties, the numbers of patients from the latter two specialties met the minimum number needed to achieve 80% power to detect the target difference in hospital length of stay in each specialty. Therefore, this imbalance in recruitment has no impact on the conclusions.

The GAP Study did not test the application of gabapentin to other major non–body cavity surgery (e.g. joint replacement) or nonmajor (e.g. day care) surgery. Care pathways and analgesic regimens for these other types of surgery are different, and therefore we cannot fully assess the impact of the addition of gabapentin to them. However, given the minimal impact of gabapentin on pain scores within the GAP Study, we would not anticipate that postoperative pain would be significantly improved in other settings as indicated by the most recent meta-analysis.

Other limitations of the trial include the nonvariable dose of gabapentin and the restricted period of the intervention. Therefore, we cannot assess the impact of a higher gabapentin dose on pain or the impact of a reduced dose on adverse effects in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and frail. However, since the NRS at rest were less than 2 of 10 (below the acceptable pain score at rest of 3), and pain scores on movement were less than 4 of 10 from 48 h after surgery, the impact of prolonged treatment with gabapentin beyond the time period assessed is likely to be limited.

### Gabapentin in procedure-specific postoperative pain management-preplanned subgroup analyses from a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^113CVSp3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

It has been argued that postoperative pain treatment should be "procedure-specific", since different analgesics may have specific effects dependent on the surgical procedure. The aim of the present subgroup analysis was to compare the beneficial and harmful effects of perioperative gabapentin treatment in different surgical procedures.

Methods

Relevant databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentin versus placebo. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were differences in 24-h morphine consumption, and serious adverse events (SAE) between surgical procedures. These subgroup analyses were predefined in a PRISMA compliant systematic review registered at PROSPERO (ID: CRD42013006538). It was predefined that conclusions should primarily be based on trials classified as overall low risk of bias.

Results

Seventy-four RCTs with 5645 patients were included, assessing benefit and harm in cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, mastectomy, and arthroplasty surgery, spinal surgery, and thoracic surgery. Only eight of 74 trials were classified as overall low risk of bias limiting our ability to conclude on the estimates in most meta-analyses. The differences between surgical procedures in these trials were not statistically significant when tested for subgroup differences. Fifteen trials with 1377 patients reported a total of 59 SAEs, most of which were observed in the thoracic surgery group.

Conclusion

Both beneficial and harmful effects in these subgroup analyses were influenced by bias and insufficient data, limiting conclusions. With these limitations, we could not adequately test for differences in beneficial or harmful outcomes between six surgical subgroups undergoing perioperative gabapentin treatment.

### Multimodal analgesia bundle and postoperative opioid use among patients undergoing colorectal surgery [^111jAn2n]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Patient Characteristics

A total of 842 patients had colorectal surgery between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019 (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [15.5] years; 421 [50%] men) (Table 1). None were lost to follow-up. The mean (SD) duration of surgery was 256 (114) minutes. Mean (SD) compliance with the ERAS pathway was 74% (12), and the median (range) postoperative length of stay was 5 (1–49) nights; 274 patients (33%) were discharged before the end of the observation time.

Implementation of the Care Bundle

The use of all 3 elements of the care bundle increased during the study period (Figure 1). From 2016 to 2019, the individualized opioids increased from 0% (0 of 206) to 100% (207 of 207) (χ² test not applicable), regular gabapentin from 28% (58 of 206) to 93% (193 of 207) (413 patients; χ² = 183.4; P < .001), and clonidine rescue from 18% (37 of 206) to 43% (89 of 207) (413 patients; χ² = 30.5; P < .001). The use of clonidine as rescue analgesia increased in 2018, while the use of the other 2 interventions increased already in 2017 (Figure 1). In 15 patients (2.3%) who received regular gabapentin, the drug was discontinued due to a suspected adverse event: sedation (6 patients), confusion (5 patients), visual disturbances (3 patients), and unsteadiness (5 patients). Among patients in whom the drug was discontinued, the mean (SD) age was 74.0 (14.3) years and 11 (73%) were women.

### Gabapentin: a multimodal perioperative drug? [^113GXNBi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Gabapentin is a second generation anticonvulsant that is effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. It was not, until recently, thought to be useful in acute perioperative conditions. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that perioperative administration is efficacious for postoperative analgesia, preoperative anxiolysis, attenuation of the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation, and preventing chronic post-surgical pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and delirium. This article reviews the clinical trial data describing the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the setting of perioperative anaesthetic management.

### Trends in the use of gabapentinoids and opioids in the postoperative period among older adults [^112cAq66]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pain management is a critical part of surgical care, and pain control is increasingly evaluated as part of quality measurement efforts. Pain control not only enhances patient satisfaction with care, but also speeds recovery and aids in patients' ability to participate in rehabilitation. In response to the opioid epidemic and with the goal of improving pain control, surgeons have increasingly initiated multimodal pain regimens to treat pain with a goal of reducing opioid use in the postoperative period. This regimen includes a wide range of nonopioid medications, including gabapentinoids. Studies indicate that a single preoperative dose of a gabapentinoid is associated with a decrease in postoperative pain and opioid consumption at 24 hours, and some societies began to recommend uptake of multimodal pain regimens, including consideration of gabapentinoids, to decrease pain for patients undergoing surgery. Unfortunately, gabapentinoids increase postoperative sedation, dizziness, and delirium in both the short and long term, and a more recent meta-analysissuggests that perioperative gabapentinoids may not in fact decrease pain as was hoped.

Older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) account for almost half of all patients undergoing surgery each year in the US. In this growing patient population, gabapentinoids are often poorly tolerated because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes associated with aging, comorbidities, and interactions with other medications. In addition, gabapentinoids are listed in the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria, which explicitly detail potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, including strong recommendations to avoid using gabapentinoids with opioids except when transitioning from one to the other, and include a caution to dose renally when necessary. Concomitant use has been shown to increase risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death, except when transitioning from one to the other. Additionally, postoperative prescribing of gabapentin is known to lead to prolonged use, with its own inherent risks of altered mental status and polypharmacy. Nevertheless, older age is one of several risk factors for receiving more opioids and multimodal pain medication in the postoperative period.

### Dose-related beneficial and harmful effects of gabapentin in postoperative pain management-post hoc analyses from a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^1124vxPp]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

During the last 15 years, gabapentin has become an established component of postoperative pain treatment. Gabapentin has been employed in a wide range of doses, but little is known about the optimal dose, providing the best balance between benefit and harm. This systematic review with meta-analyses aimed to explore the beneficial and harmful effects of various doses of gabapentin administered to surgical patients.

Materials and methods

Data in this paper were derived from an original review, and the subgroup analyses were predefined in an International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews published protocol: PROSPERO (ID: CRD42013006538). The methods followed Cochrane guidelines. The Cochrane Library's CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Google Scholar, and FDA database were searched for relevant trials. Randomized clinical trials comparing gabapentin versus placebo were included. Four different dose intervals were investigated: 0–350, 351–700, 701–1050, and > 1050 mg. Primary co-outcomes were 24-hour morphine consumption and serious adverse events (SAEs), with emphasis put on trials with low risk of bias.

Results

One hundred and twenty-two randomized clinical trials, with 8466 patients, were included. Sixteen were overall low risk of bias. No consistent increase in morphine-sparing effect was observed with increasing doses of gabapentin from the trials with low risk of bias. Analyzing all trials, the smallest and the highest dose subgroups demonstrated numerically the most prominent reduction in morphine consumption. Twenty-seven trials reported 72 SAEs, of which 83% were reported in the > 1050 mg subgroup. No systematic increase in SAEs was observed with increasing doses of gabapentin.

Conclusion

Data were sparse, and the small number of trials with low risk of bias is a major limitation for firm conclusions. Taking these limitations into account, we were not able to demonstrate a clear relationship between the dosage of gabapentin and opioid-sparing or harmful effects. These subgroup analyses are exploratory and hypothesis-generating for future trialists.

### Preoperative factors associated with remote postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: post hoc analysis of a perioperative gabapentin trial [^116j5Lcz]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

As preoperative pain outside the future surgical site is a risk factor for prolonged opioid use, patients may use opioids prescribed after surgery to treat overall body pain, and preoperative interventions to optimize pain management may ultimately promote postoperative opioid cessation. A variety of preoperative pain conditions including back pain, neck pain, arthritis, and centralized pain have been reported as risk factors for PPOU. Thus, preoperative pain intensity outside the future surgical site may be a proxy for the severity and cumulative effect of chronic pain conditions on PPOU.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^111mCnyQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Gabapentinoids

Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are antiepileptic medications that produce analgesia through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. These medications were traditionally used in the management of chronic neuropathic pain. However, some studies suggest that perioperative use of gabapentinoids may reduce acute postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. In addition, perioperative gabapentinoid use may also reduce the risk of developing persistent postsurgical pain although the evidence for this effect remains insufficient. Based on these findings, gabapentinoids have been included as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen in some ERPs. However, other studies have called into question the benefit of gabapentinoid use in the perioperative setting as they are associated with adverse effects, and their analgesic and opioid-sparing effects may in fact be clinically insignificant. In particular, use of gabapentinoids has been linked to sedation, visual disturbances, and dizziness that can hinder early postoperative mobilization and delay recovery. In addition, perioperative gabapentin use has been associated with risk of respiratory depression, especially in older patients and those receiving higher doses of opioids. Overall, the quality of evidence supporting the perioperative use of gabapentinoids remains low, and optimal dosing has not been clearly established. Furthermore, gabapentinoids are currently only available in oral formulations, which may limit their use in the acute postoperative setting. Therefore, while gabapentinoids are a potential opioid-sparing adjunct for management of postoperative pain, the risks and benefits of their use should be carefully considered for each individual patient. In particular, given their side effect profile, gabapentinoids should be used with caution in elderly patients as well as patients with renal dysfunction, which often necessitates dose reduction.

Frailty in older adults undergoing colorectal surgery — frail older adults should be managed with enhanced recovery protocols after surgery with modifications, as needed. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. Enhanced recovery protocols for managing patients after colorectal surgery are composed of multiple elements such as patient education, carbohydrate loading preoperatively and early feeding postoperatively, optimal fluid resuscitation, multimodality pain control, and early ambulation, and clinicians prescribing medications in the perioperative period should consider patients' unique medical history and current medications; medications that meet Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate medications for older adults should be used with caution or avoided altogether, and care should be taken when using gabapentin, which can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and confusion in older adults, especially when taken with opioids.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^113YqumJ]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's Perspective

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication with U.S. and United Kingdom regulatory approval to treat partial seizures and neuropathic pain. It reduces voltage-gated calcium channel activity in the central neurons and therefore reduces neuronal firing and neurotransmitter release. – It is widely used "off license" in the perioperative setting as an adjunct to opioid analgesia, and its use in this setting has risen substantially in many countries. – Opioids are the mainstay for managing moderate-to-severe pain after major surgery, but they have poor efficacy for movement-associated pain, and up to 80% of patients experience side effects including confusion, nausea, vomiting, itching, constipation, and respiratory depression. The rationale for using gabapentin is that it reduces opioid use and hence opioid-related adverse effects and promotes rapid early recovery and discharge. However, there have been concerns about the trade-off between the potential adverse effects of gabapentinoids (e.g. risk of abuse and respiratory depression) and their clinical benefits. –

More than 280randomized controlled trials have compared gabapentin with placebo in different surgical populations. Most are small and highly heterogeneous, both statistically and clinically. Gabapentin can reduce opiate use by around 20% in the first 24 h after surgery. However, there is inadequate information regarding the number and impact of adverse events and quality of life, preventing policy decisions from being made. This has led to varying guidance: gabapentin is included as a "strong recommendation" as a component of multimodal analgesia for the management of postoperative pain in the United Statesbut not in Europe. In the GAP Study, we tested the hypothesis that gabapentin reduces opioid use after surgery and speeds up recovery, therefore reducing postoperative hospital stay compared to standard multimodal analgesia (usual care).

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain: a qualitative and quantitative systematic review, with focus on procedure [^112dWkyn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the perioperative use of gabapentin has a significant 24-hour opioid sparing effect for both abdominal hysterectomy and spinal surgery patients, whereas the reduction in pain score is more inconsistent. Nausea may be reduced in abdominal hysterectomy. All other side-effects were non-significant between treatment groups.

Future trials in this area should include gabapentin as part of a multimodal postoperative treatment strategy, with focus on both acute and chronic pain states. Pain score during mobilisation is mandatory, and the effect of gabapentin on postoperative delirium needs further exploration.

### Perioperative use of gabapentinoids for the management of postoperative acute pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rQ53E]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Widely used for acute pain management, the clinical benefit from perioperative use of gabapentinoids is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the analgesic effect and adverse events with the perioperative use of gabapentinoids in adult patients.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials studying the use of gabapentinoids in adult patients undergoing surgery were included. The primary outcome was the intensity of postoperative acute pain. Secondary outcomes included the intensity of postoperative subacute pain, incidence of postoperative chronic pain, cumulative opioid use, persistent opioid use, lengths of stay, and adverse events. The clinical significance of the summary estimates was assessed based on established thresholds for minimally important differences.

Results

In total, 281 trials (N = 24,682 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with controls, gabapentinoids were associated with a lower postoperative pain intensity (100-point scale) at 6h (mean difference, -10; 95% CI, -12 to -9), 12h (mean difference, -9; 95% CI, -10 to -7), 24h (mean difference, -7; 95% CI, -8 to -6), and 48h (mean difference, -3; 95% CI, -5 to -1). This effect was not clinically significant ranging below the minimally important difference (10 points out of 100) for each time point. These results were consistent regardless of the type of drug (gabapentin or pregabalin). No effect was observed on pain intensity at 72 h, subacute and chronic pain. The use of gabapentinoids was associated with a lower risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting but with more dizziness and visual disturbance.

Conclusions

No clinically significant analgesic effect for the perioperative use of gabapentinoids was observed. There was also no effect on the prevention of postoperative chronic pain and a greater risk of adverse events. These results do not support the routine use of pregabalin or gabapentin for the management of postoperative pain in adult patients.

### Outpatient treatment with gabapentin in women with severe acute pain after cesarean delivery is ineffective: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117ALfLd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Most of the 1.1 million women who deliver by cesarean in the United States each year have an uncomplicated recovery. However, severe pain resistant to standard multimodal therapy within the first days after surgery is associated with an increased risk for prolonged pain and opioid use. The best outpatient management for parturients with severe resistant early onset pain is not known.

Methods

We performed a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of up to 12 weeks of outpatient treatment with gabapentin to evaluate its effectiveness to facilitate opioid cessation in women with at least 2 reports of severe pain during the immediate postpartum period resistant to standard multimodal pain management. Time to opioid cessation was the primary outcome. Time to pain resolution; time to discontinuation of gabapentin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen; time to self-reported recovery; and National Institute of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes System (PROMIS) surveys for anxiety, depression, fatigue, and physical function were assessed as secondary outcomes.

Results

There was no difference in time to opioid cessation between patients who were randomly assigned to be treated with gabapentin (Kaplan-Meier estimated median of 2 [25th-75th percentiles of 1–3] weeks, n = 35) versus those who were treated with placebo (2 [1–3] weeks, n = 35). The hazard ratio was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–1.8), P = 0.65. There were no differences in any secondary end points between the study groups.

Conclusions

Outpatient supplementation with gabapentin did not reduce time to opioid cessation, pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, or improve physical function in women with severe pain after cesarean delivery. Gabapentin should not be routinely added to the standard outpatient multimodal regimen of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and opioids.

### Preoperative factors associated with remote postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: post hoc analysis of a perioperative gabapentin trial [^1141DTpL]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Post Hoc Sensitivity Analysis

As additional sensitivity analyses, we included the type of operation as a covariate in each final model. Then, we evaluated the type of operation as an effect modifier of the association of baseline variables that remained significant in the multivariable models (see). No significant interaction effects were noted between any of the predictors of time to pain cessation and operation type. This further indicates that increased baseline pain at the future surgical site, self-reported unexpectedly long recovery times from past injuries, and elevated trait anxiety are significant, independent predictors of delayed pain resolution after surgery. After adding the type of operation to the final multivariable model for time to opioid cessation, past 30-day prescription opioid use and the BDI-II score remained significant predictors. No significant interaction effect was noted between preoperative BDI-II score and type of operation. However, a significant interaction effect was noted between preoperative past 30-day prescription opioid use and type of operation.

### Multimodal analgesia bundle and postoperative opioid use among patients undergoing colorectal surgery [^113efnPv]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, consecutive cohort of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery, we found that implementation of a multimodal care bundle was associated with a significant decrease in postoperative opioid consumption. In the final year of the study, the proportion of patients receiving less than 45 MME orally or parenterally over the first 6 days after surgery was 66%, corresponding to 3 doses of oxycodone at 10 mg. Furthermore, 31% received no opioids at all during the same period. These data demonstrate that the goal of nearly opioid-free major surgery is achievable in routine clinical practice, using alternative modalities to manage postoperative pain.

As the global opioid crisis kills more people each year, it is paramount that physicians prescribe as few doses of opioids as possible. In a study by Brummett et alit was reported that 10% of patients undergoing colectomy had developed new persistent opioid use after surgery.

In this study, the use of regular gabapentin was most strongly associated with a decrease in opioid consumption. Only 2% of study participants discontinued gabapentin due to a suspected adverse reaction. The adverse reactions were all mild and fully reversible.

The results of this study contradict findings in the most recent meta-analysis on gabapentinoids in postoperative analgesia, which concluded that gabapentinoids provide clinically irrelevant analgesia and are associated with too many serious adverse effects to be considered effective. Conversely, in our study, the association between gabapentin and a decrease in opioid consumption was significant and did not come at the cost of serious adverse reactions. We believe that dosing and the timing of the doses can be a part of an explanation. In our study, we administered 300 mg of gabapentin 3 times daily, a low dose in the normal range of prescription. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning regarding the risk of respiratory depression and other serious adverse events when gabapentinoids are combined with central nervous system depressants, such as opioids. Most participants in our study consumed no or small amounts of opioids, which may explain the absence of respiratory depression.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^116dDZBQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Gabapentinoids — A large meta-analysis involving 281 RCTs reported a significant reduction in the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with gabapentin and pregabalin (A1), with effects seen at both low doses (defined as < 300 mg pregabalin/day or < 900 mg gabapentin/day) and higher doses, given as a single or in multiple doses. Their use was associated with increased risk of dizziness and visual disturbances; use in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols has been challenged due to concerns about adverse events and the risk of respiratory depression when combined with opioids, and the analgesic and opioid sparing efficacy of gabapentinoids may not be clinically relevant.

### Single dose oral gabapentin for established acute postoperative pain in adults [^112pVqG5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug, also used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, which is the subject of a Cochrane review, currently under revision. Its efficacy in treating established acute postoperative pain has not been demonstrated.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of single dose oral gabapentin compared with placebo in established acute postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database. Additional studies were sought from reference lists of retrieved articles and reviews. Clinical trials databases were searched for unpublished studies; clinical trial reports of several unpublished studies have been made public following litigation in the US.

Selection Criteria

Single oral dose, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of gabapentin for relief of established moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were assessed for methodological quality and data extracted by two review authors independently. Numbers of participants with at least 50% of maximum possible total pain relief (TOTPAR) or summed pain intensity difference (SPID) with gabapentin or placebo were calculated and used to derive relative benefit (RB) or risk (RR), and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT). Numbers of participants using rescue medication, and time to its use, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected.

Main Results

Four unpublished studies met inclusion criteria; in three, participants had pain following dental surgery, and one followed major orthopaedic surgery; 177 participants were treated with a single dose of gabapentin 250 mg, 21 with gabapentin 500 mg, and 172 with placebo. At least 50% pain relief over 6 hours was achieved by 15% with gabapentin 250 mg and 5% with placebo; giving a RB of 2.5 (95% CI 1.2 to 5.0) and an NNT of 11 (6.4 to 35). Significantly fewer participants needed rescue medication within 6 hours with gabapentin 250 mg than with placebo; NNT to prevent use 5.8. About one third of participants reported adverse events with both gabapentin 250 mg and placebo. No serious adverse events occurred with gabapentin.

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin 250 mg is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of established acute postoperative pain, but the NNT of 11 for at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with gabapentin 250 mg is of limited clinical value and inferior to commonly used analgesics. Gabapentin 250 mg is not clinically useful as a stand-alone analgesic in established acute postoperative pain, though this is probably the first demonstration of analgesic effect of an antiepileptic in established acute pain.

### Preoperative factors associated with remote postoperative pain resolution and opioid cessation in a mixed surgical cohort: post hoc analysis of a perioperative gabapentin trial [^11516FCT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative patient-specific risk factors may elucidate the mechanisms leading to the persistence of pain and opioid use after surgery. This study aimed to determine whether similar or discordant preoperative factors were associated with the duration of postoperative pain and opioid use.

Methods

In this post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of perioperative gabapentin vs active placebo, 410 patients aged 18–75 years, undergoing diverse operations underwent preoperative assessments of pain, opioid use, substance use, and psychosocial variables. After surgery, a modified Brief Pain Inventory was administered over the phone daily up to 3 months, weekly up to 6 months, and monthly up to 2 years after surgery. Pain and opioid cessation were defined as the first of 5 consecutive days of 0 out of 10 pain or no opioid use, respectively.

Results

Overall, 36.1%, 19.8%, and 9.5% of patients continued to report pain, and 9.5%, 2.4%, and 1.7% reported continued opioid use at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Preoperative pain at the future surgical site (every 1-point increase in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale; HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87–1.00; P = 0.034), trait anxiety (every 10-point increase in the Trait Anxiety Inventory; HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68–0.92; P = 0.002), and a history of delayed recovery after injury (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40–0.96; P = 0.034) were associated with delayed pain cessation. Preoperative opioid use (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.39–0.92; P = 0.020), elevated depressive symptoms (every 5-point increase in the Beck Depression Inventory-II score; HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80–0.98; P = 0.017), and preoperative pain outside of the surgical site (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–1.00; P = 0.046) were associated with delayed opioid cessation, while perioperative gabapentin promoted opioid cessation (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.06–1.77; P = 0.016).

Conclusion

Separate risk factors for prolonged post-surgical pain and opioid use indicate that preoperative risk stratification for each outcome may identify patients needing personalized care to augment universal protocols for perioperative pain management and conservative opioid prescribing to improve long-term outcomes.

Perioperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) adjunct strategies — There is RCT evidence that adding total intravenous anesthesia with propofol to a multimodal antiemetic regimen "is superior to a multimodal antiemetic regimen with inhaled anesthetics". For intravenous acetaminophen, a meta-analysis of "30 RCTs including 2364 patients" found that dosing "either before surgery or before arrival in the postanesthesia care unit reduced the risk of nausea and pain", but it "was not effective in preventing PONV if given after the onset of pain". Regarding gabapentin, "There have now been 17 randomized controlled clinical trials" showing a quantitative meta-analysis in which the pooled relative risk of nausea and vomiting is "lower in patients who receive preoperative gabapentin", the benefits "appeared reduced in the presence of the use of propofol", and "the level of evidence is strong in support of gabapentin".

### Gabapentin in procedure-specific postoperative pain management-preplanned subgroup analyses from a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^113kyaB5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain management is a crucial component in postoperative care of the surgical patient. The combination of non-opioid and opioid analgesics, known as multimodal analgesia, is a cornerstone in the treatment of postoperative pain. Gabapentin has recently become a part of a wide array of postoperative multimodal analgesic regimens.

It has been argued that postoperative pain treatment should be "procedure-specific", that is, adapted to the particular surgical procedure, since different analgesics may have specific effects dependent on the nature of the surgery.

Gabapentin has been used in postoperative pain management since 2002. It is an anti-epileptic drug presumed to affect nociceptive processing through α₂δ-subunits of voltage gated calcium channels, thereby causing decrease in excitatory neurotransmitters, e.g. glutamate, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The anti-hyperalgesic properties have been investigated in several experimental and clinical trials.

In a recent systematic review we pooled data from all clinical trials and different surgical interventions with gabapentin. The conclusion from this review was, that firm evidence for use of gabapentin is lacking, as clinically relevant beneficial effects of gabapentin may be absent and harm is imminent, especially when added to multimodal analgesic regimens. In the present preplanned subgroup analyses and post hoc analyses, we aimed to compare the procedure-specific effects of peri-operative gabapentin on postoperative opioid consumption, pain intensity, and adverse- and serious adverse events in six different surgical procedures. It was our hypothesis that the reduction in 24-h morphine consumption and incidence of SAE's would differ between surgical procedures.
