what is lancet journal?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what The Lancet journal is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the journal's identity and founding. Then, I should verify its scope and prestige. Next, I will examine its editorial approach and influence. After that, I need to check its historical evolution and current initiatives. Finally, I should consider controversies, limitations, and how to characterize it succinctly and accurately with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the basics: The Lancet is a peer-reviewed general medical journal founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley, with a longstanding tagline of "the best science for better lives", which signals both scientific rigor and a mission-oriented stance toward improving health outcomes [^69e83b3e] [^2338824d].

> Wait, let me verify the scope and standing. The Lancet publishes original research, reviews, commentaries, and special series across clinical medicine, public health, and global health policy, and it consistently ranks among the highest-impact general medical journals, with a 2022 impact factor around 202.7, reflecting broad readership and frequent citation [^4d82b70b].

> I need to check the editorial philosophy next. The journal has a tradition of blending high-quality science with advocacy and policy engagement, often launching commissions, series, and countdowns that shape global health agendas, such as the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change and the EAT-Lancet Commission on sustainable diets, which illustrates its proactive stance in translating evidence into action [^71e14437] [^3119b749].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniformity over time. Historically, The Lancet evolved from a 19th-century reform-minded publication to a modern, globally oriented journal, and it has explicitly acknowledged and examined its own colonial-era legacies, demonstrating a reflexive approach to power, knowledge production, and equity in global health [^69e83b3e] [^f3b460da].

> I should confirm its current initiatives and reach. Beyond flagship research, The Lancet operates multiple specialty titles (e.g. Lancet Global Health, Lancet Oncology, Lancet Neurology), hosts regional and thematic commissions, and maintains high visibility in policy and media, which amplifies its influence on practice and policy worldwide [^71c15792] [^74bcb3af].

> But wait, what about limitations and controversies? Like other top journals, The Lancet faces scrutiny over industry influence, reprint sales, and occasional high-profile retractions or corrections; studies show high reprint orders correlate with industry funding, and editorial policies such as CONSORT enforcement have measurable effects on reporting quality, reminding us to read critically even in high-impact venues [^ae0ef8db] [^7f5c65e9].

> Let me reconsider how to synthesize this. The Lancet is best characterized as a premier, general medical journal with a 200-year history, a global readership, and a distinctive blend of rigorous science and policy-oriented advocacy; it shapes clinical practice and public health agendas through original research, commissions, and series, while continually evolving to address equity, sustainability, and the changing needs of the health community [^69e83b3e] [^71e14437] [^3119b749].

### The Lancet countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change [^5dfcaf5f]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, multidisciplinary research collaboration between academic institutions and practitioners across the world. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be "the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century". The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefits of climate change mitigation; economics and finance; and political and broader engagement. These focus areas form the five thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and represent different aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups will provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown ultimately aims to report annually on a series of indicators across these five working groups. This paper outlines the potential indicators and indicator domains to be tracked by the collaboration, with suggestions on the methodologies and datasets available to achieve this end. The proposed indicator domains require further refinement, and mark the beginning of an ongoing consultation process-from November, 2016 to early 2017-to develop these domains, identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's climate and health country profiles. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a collaborative and iterative process, which aims to complement existing initiatives, welcome engagement with new partners, and be open to developing new research projects on health and climate change.

### The 2020 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: responding to converging crises [^908483ec]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Executive summary

The Lancet Countdown is an international collaboration established to provide an independent, global monitoring system dedicated to tracking the emerging health profile of the changing climate.

The 2020 report presents 43 indicators across five sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. This report represents the findings and consensus of the 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies that make up the Lancet Countdown, and draws on the expertise of climate scientists, geographers, engineers, experts in energy, food, and transport, economists, social, and political scientists, data scientists, public health professionals, and doctors.

The emerging health profile of the changing climate

5 years ago, countries committed to limit global warming to "well below 2°C" as part of the landmark Paris Agreement. 5 years on, global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions continue to rise steadily, with no convincing or sustained abatement, resulting in a rise in the global average temperature of 1·2°C. Indeed, the five hottest years on record have occurred since 2015.

The changing climate has already produced considerable shifts in the underlying social and environmental determinants of health at the global level. Indicators in all domains of section 1 (climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities) are worsening. Concerning, and often accelerating, trends were seen for each of the human symptoms of climate change monitored, with the 2020 indicators presenting the most worrying outlook reported since the Lancet Countdown was first established.

These effects are often unequal, disproportionately impacting populations who have contributed the least to the problem. This fact reveals a deeper question of justice, whereby climate change interacts with existing social and economic inequalities and exacerbates longstanding trends within and between countries. An examination of the causes of climate change revealed similar issues, and many carbon-intensive practices and policies lead to poor air quality, poor food quality, and poor housing quality, which disproportionately harm the health of disadvantaged populations.

Vulnerable populations were exposed to an additional 475 million heatwave events globally in 2019, which was, in turn, reflected in excess morbidity and mortality (indicator 1.1.2). During the past 20 years, there has been a 53·7% increase in heat-related mortality in people older than 65 years, reaching a total of 296 000 deaths in 2018 (indicator 1.1.3). The high cost in terms of human lives and suffering is associated with effects on economic output, with 302 billion h of potential labour capacity lost in 2019 (indicator 1.1.4). India and Indonesia were among the worst affected countries, seeing losses of potential labour capacity equivalent to 4–6% of their annual gross domestic product (indicator 4.1.3). In Europe in 2018, the monetised cost of heat-related mortality was equivalent to 1·2% of regional gross national income, or the average income of 11 million European citizens (indicator 4.1.2).

Turning to extremes of weather, advancements in climate science allow for greater accuracy and certainty in attribution; studies from 2015 to 2020 have shown the fingerprints of climate change in 76 floods, droughts, storms, and temperature anomalies (indicator 1.2.3). Furthermore, there was an increase in the number of days people were exposed to a very high or extremely high risk of wildfire between 2001–04 and 2016–19 in 114 countries (indicator 1.2.1). Correspondingly, 67% of global cities surveyed expected climate change to seriously compromise their public health assets and infrastructure (indicator 2.1.3).

The changing climate has downstream effects, impacting broader environmental systems, which in turn harm human health. Global food security is threatened by rising temperatures and increases in the frequency of extreme events; global yield potential for major crops declined by 1·8–5·6% between 1981 and 2019 (indicator 1.4.1). The climate suitability for infectious disease transmission has been growing rapidly since the 1950s, with a 15·0% increase for dengue caused by Aedes albopictus in 2018, and regional increases for malaria and Vibrio bacteria (indicator 1.3.1). Projecting forward, based on current populations, between 145 million people and 565 million people face potential inundation from rising sea levels (indicator 1.5).

Despite these clear and escalating signs, the global response to climate change has been muted and national efforts continue to fall short of the commitments made in the Paris Agreement. The carbon intensity of the global energy system has remained almost flat for 30 years, with global coal use increasing by 74% during this time (indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). The reduction in global coal use that had been observed since 2013 has now reversed for the past 2 consecutive years: coal use rose by 1·7% from 2016 to 2018. The health burden is substantial — more than 1 million deaths occur every year as a result of air pollution from coal-fired power, and some 390 000 of these deaths were a result of particulate pollution in 2018 (indicator 3.3). The response in the food and agricultural sector has been similarly concerning. Emissions from livestock grew by 16% from 2000 to 2017, with 93% of emissions coming from ruminant animals (indicator 3.5.1). Likewise, increasingly unhealthy diets are becoming more common worldwide, with excess red meat consumption contributing to some 990 000 deaths in 2017 (indicator 3.5.2). 5 years on from when countries reached an agreement in Paris, a concerning number of indicators are showing an early, but sustained, reversal of previously positive trends identified in past reports (indicators 1.3.2, 3.1.2, and 4.2.3).

A growing response from health professionals

Despite little economy-wide improvement, relative gains have been made in several key sectors: from 2010 to 2017, the average annual growth rate in renewable energy capacity was 21%, and low-carbon electricity was responsible for 28% of capacity in China in 2017 (indicator 3.1.3). However, the indicators presented in the 2020 report of the Lancet Countdown suggest that some of the most considerable progress was seen in the growing momentum of the health profession's engagement with climate change globally. Doctors, nurses, and the broader profession have a central role in health system adaptation and mitigation, in understanding and maximising the health benefits of any intervention, and in communicating the need for an accelerated response.

In the case of adaptation in national health systems, this change is underway. Impressively, health services in 86 countries are now connected with their equivalent meteorological services to assist in health adaptation planning (indicator 2.2). At least 51 countries have developed plans for national health adaptation, and global spending in health adaptation rose to 5·3% of all adaptation spending in 2018–19, reaching US$18·4 billion in 2019 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.4).

The health-care sector, which was responsible for 4·6% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, is taking early but important steps to reduce its own emissions (indicator 3.6). In the UK, the National Health Service has declared an ambition to deliver a net-zero health service as soon as possible, building on a decade of impressive progress in reducing delivery of care emissions by 57% since 1990, and by 22% when considering the service's supply chain and broader responsibilities. Elsewhere, the Western Australian Department of Health used its 2016 Public Health Act to conduct Australia's first climate and health inquiry, and the German Federal Ministry of Health has established a dedicated department on health protection and sustainability responsible for climate-related matters. This progress is becoming more evenly distributed around the world, with 73% of countries making explicit references to health and wellbeing in their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, and 100% of countries in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions doing so (indicator 5.4). Similarly, least-developed countries and small island developing states are providing increasing global leadership within the UN General Debate on the connections between health and climate change (indicator 5.4).

Individual health professionals and their associations are also responding well, with health institutions committing to divest more than $42 billion worth of assets from fossil fuels (indicator 4.2.4). In academia, the publication of original research on health and climate changed has increased by a factor of eight from 2007 to 2019 (indicator 5.3).

These shifts are being translated into the broader public discourse. From 2018 to 2019, the coverage of health and climate change in the media increased by 96% world-wide, outpacing the increased coverage of climate change overall, and reaching the highest observed point to date (indicator 5.1). Just as it did with advancements in sanitation and hygiene and with tobacco control, growing and sustained engagement from the health profession during the past 5 years is now beginning to fill a crucial gap in the global response to climate change.

The next 5 years: a joint response to two public health crises

Dec 12, 2020, will mark the anniversary of the 2015 Paris Agreement, with countries set to update their national commitments and review these commitments every 5 years. These next 5 years will be pivotal. To reach the 1·5°C target and limit temperature rise to "well below 2°C", the 56 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalent (GtCO 2 e) currently emitted annually will need to drop to 25 GtCO 2 e within only 10 years (by 2030). In effect, this decrease will require a 7·6% reduction every year, representing an increase in current levels of national government ambition of a factor of five. Without further intervention during the next 5 years, the reductions required to achieve this target increase to 15·4% every year, moving the 1·5°C target out of reach.

The need for accelerated efforts to tackle climate change during the next 5 years will be contextualised by the impacts of, and the global response to, the COVID-19 pandemic. With the loss of life from the pandemic and from climate change measured in the hundreds of thousands, the potential economic costs measured in the trillions, and the broader consequences expected to continue for years to come, the measures taken to address both of these public health crises must be carefully examined and closely linked. Health professionals are well placed to act as a bridge between the two issues, and analogically considering the clinical approach to managing a patient with COVID-19 might be useful in understanding the ways in which these two public health crises should be jointly addressed.

First, in an acute setting, a high priority is placed on rapidly diagnosing and comprehensively assessing the situation. Likewise, further work is required to understand the problem, including: which populations are vulnerable to both the pandemic and to climate change; how global and national economies have reacted and adapted, and the health and environmental consequences of these actions; and which aspects of these shifts should be retained to support longer term, sustainable development. Second, appropriate resuscitation and treatment options are reviewed and administered, with careful consideration of any potential side-effects, the goals of care, and the life-long health of the patient. Economic recovery packages that prioritise outdated forms of energy and transport that are fossil fuel intensive will have unintended side-effects, unnecessarily adding to the 7 million people that die every year from air pollution. Instead, investments in health imperatives, such as renewable energy and clean air, active travel infrastructure and physical activity, and resilient and climate-smart health care, will ultimately be more effective than these outdated methods.

Finally, attention turns to secondary prevention and long-term recovery, seeking to minimise the permanent effects of the disease and prevent recurrence. Many of the steps taken to prepare for unexpected shocks, such as a pandemic, are similar to those required to adapt to the extremes of weather and new threats expected from climate change. These steps include the need to identify vulnerable populations, assess the capacity of public health systems, develop and invest in preparedness measures, and emphasise community resilience and equity. Indeed, without considering the current and future impacts of climate change, efforts to prepare for future pandemics are likely to be undermined.

At every step and in both cases, acting with a level of urgency proportionate to the scale of the threat, adhering to the best available science, and practising clear and consistent communications, are paramount. The consequences of the pandemic will contextualise the economic, social, and environmental policies of governments during the next 5 years, a period that is crucial in determining whether temperatures will remain "well below 2°C". Unless the global COVID-19 recovery is aligned with the response to climate change, the world will fail to meet the target laid out in the Paris Agreement, damaging public health in the short term and long term.

### The Lancet 1823–2023: the best science for better lives [^69e83b3e]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The Lancet celebrates its 200th anniversary in 2023. In this survey of the journal's history, we explore how it has contributed to shaping medicine both in the UK and internationally, and how it has demonstrated a commitment to "The best science for better lives". For two centuries, the journal has published pioneering articles on key developments in medical science and the organisation of health care. We explore the campaigning and advocacy work of the journal through several indicative areas where science and policy meet, balancing national and global themes over the 19th and 20th centuries. Themes include the raising of professional standards; environmental health in urbanising Britain; the transformation of surgery; the emergence of tropical medicine; the science and politics of vaccination; the advance towards universal health coverage; and the transition from international to global health. In the imperial era, both the journal's research reports and editorial stance were sometimes inflected with colonial attitudes, although it consistently presented medicine as an international endeavour. The Lancet's blend of science and advocacy demonstrates a track record of campaigning for medicine in the cause of social betterment.

### The Lancet commission to reduce the global burden of sudden cardiac death: a call for multidisciplinary action [^7dd7a41e]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Despite major advancements in cardiovascular medicine, sudden cardiac death (SCD) continues to be an enormous medical and societal challenge, claiming millions of lives every year. Efforts to prevent SCD are hampered by imperfect risk prediction and inadequate solutions to specifically address arrhythmogenesis. Although resuscitation strategies have witnessed substantial evolution, there is a need to strengthen the organisation of community interventions and emergency medical systems across varied locations and health-care structures. With all the technological and medical advances of the 21st century, the fact that survival from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains lower than 10% in most parts of the world is unacceptable. Recognising this urgent need, the Lancet Commission on SCD was constituted, bringing together 30 international experts in varied disciplines. Consistent progress in tackling SCD will require a completely revamped approach to SCD prevention, with wide-sweeping policy changes that will empower the development of both governmental and community-based programmes to maximise survival from SCA, and to comprehensively attend to survivors and decedents' families after the event. International collaborative efforts that maximally leverage and connect the expertise of various research organisations will need to be prioritised to properly address identified gaps. The Commission places substantial emphasis on the need to develop a multidisciplinary strategy that encompasses all aspects of SCD prevention and treatment. The Commission provides a critical assessment of the current scientific efforts in the field, and puts forth key recommendations to challenge, activate, and intensify efforts by both the scientific and global community with new directions, research, and innovation to reduce the burden of SCD worldwide.

### The 2023 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: the imperative for a health-centred response in a world facing irreversible harms [^71e14437]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Executive Summary

The Lancet Countdown is an international research collaboration that independently monitors the evolving impacts of climate change on health, and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. In its eighth iteration, this 2023 report draws on the expertise of 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies worldwide to provide its most comprehensive assessment yet.

In 2022, the Lancet Countdown warned that people's health is at the mercy of fossil fuels and stressed the transformative opportunity of jointly tackling the concurrent climate change, energy, cost-of-living, and health crises for human health and wellbeing. This year's report finds few signs of such progress. At the current 10-year mean heating of 1·14°C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is increasingly impacting the health and survival of people worldwide, and projections show these risks could worsen steeply with further inaction. However, with health matters gaining prominence in climate change negotiations, this report highlights new opportunities to deliver health-promoting climate change action and a safe and thriving future for all.

The rising health toll of a changing climate

In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5).

Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3).

Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3).

The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts — both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change.

The human costs of persistent inaction

The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world's populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO 2 emitted each second, each moment of delay worsens the risks to people's health and survival.

In this year's report, new projections reveal the dangers of further delays in action, with every tracked health dimension worsening as the climate changes. If global mean temperature continues to rise to just under 2°C, annual heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 370% by midcentury, assuming no substantial progress on adaptation (indicator 1.1.5). Under such a scenario, heat-related labour loss is projected to increase by 50% (indicator 1.1.4), and heatwaves alone could lead to 524·9 million additional people experiencing moderate-to-severe food insecurity by 2041–60, aggravating the global risk of malnutrition. Life-threatening infectious diseases are also projected to spread further, with the length of coastline suitable for Vibrio pathogens expanding by 17–25%, and the transmission potential for dengue increasing by 36–37% by midcentury. As risks rise, so will the costs and challenges of adaptation. These estimates provide some indication of what the future could hold. However, poor accounting for non-linear responses, tipping points, and cascading and synergistic interactions could render these projections conservative, disproportionately increasing the threat to the health of populations worldwide.

A world accelerating in the wrong direction

The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people's lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating.

The 2022 Lancet Countdown report highlighted the opportunity to accelerate the transition away from health-harming fossil fuels in response to the global energy crisis. However, data this year show a world that is often moving in the wrong direction. Energy-related CO 2 emissions increased by 0·9% to a record 36·8 Gt in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1), and still only 9·5% of global electricity comes from modern renewables (mainly solar and wind energy), despite their costs falling below that of fossil fuels. Concerningly, driven partly by record profits, oil and gas companies are further reducing their compliance with the Paris Agreement: the strategies of the world's 20 largest oil and gas companies as of early 2023 will result in emissions surpassing levels consistent with the Paris Agreement goals by 173% in 2040 — an increase of 61% from 2022 (indicator 4.2.6). Rather than pursuing accelerated development of renewable energy, fossil fuel companies allocated only 4% of their capital investment to renewables in 2022.

Meanwhile, global fossil fuel investment increased by 10% in 2022, reaching over $1 trillion (indicator 4.2.1). The expansion of oil and gas extractive activities has been supported through both private and public financial flows. Across 2017–21, the 40 banks that lend most to the fossil fuel sector collectively invested $489 billion annually in fossil fuels (annual average), with 52% increasing their lending from 2010–16. Simultaneously, in 2020, 78% of the countries assessed, responsible for 93% of all global CO 2 emissions, still provided net direct fossil fuels subsidies totalling $305 billion, further hindering fossil fuel phase-out (indicator 4.2.4). Without a rapid response to course correct, the persistent use and expansion of fossil fuels will ensure an increasingly inequitable future that threatens the lives of billions of people alive today.

The opportunity to deliver a healthy future for all

Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM 2·5; indicator 3.2.1), and a large proportion of the 78 deaths per 100 000 people associated with exposure to indoor air pollution (indicator 3.2.2). Additionally, the just development of renewable energy markets can generate net employment opportunities with safer, more locally available jobs. Ensuring countries, particularly those facing high levels of energy poverty, are supported in the safe development, deployment, and adoption of renewable energy is key to maximising health gains and preventing unjust extractive industrial practices that can harm the health and livelihoods of local populations and widen health inequities.

With fossil fuels accounting for 95% of road transport energy (indicator 3.1.3), interventions to enable and promote safe active travel and zero-emission public transport can further deliver emissions reduction, promote health through physical activity, and avert many of the 460 000 deaths caused annually by transport-derived PM 2·5 pollution (indicator 3.2.1), and some of the 3·2 million annual deaths related to physical inactivity. People-centred, climate-resilient urban redesign to improve building energy efficiency, increase green and blue spaces, and promote sustainable cooling, can additionally prevent heat-related health harms, avoid air-conditioning-derived emissions (indicator 2.2.2), and provide direct physical and mental health benefits.

Additionally, food systems are responsible for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 57% of agricultural emissions in 2020 being derived from the production of red meat and milk (indicator 3.3.1). Promoting and enabling equitable access to affordable, healthy, low-carbon diets that meet local nutritional and cultural requirements can contribute to mitigation, while preventing many of the 12·2 million deaths attributable to suboptimal diets (indicator 3.3.2).

The health community could play a central role in securing these benefits, by delivering public health interventions to reduce air pollution, enabling and supporting active travel and healthier diets, and promoting improvements in the environmental conditions and commercial activities that define health outcomes. Importantly, the health sector can lead by example and transition to sustainable, resource-efficient, net-zero emission health systems, thereby preventing its 4·6% contribution to global GHG emissions, with cascading impacts ultimately affecting the broader economy (indicator 3.4).

Some encouraging signs of progress offer a glimpse of the enormous human benefits that health-centred action could render. Deaths attributable to fossil-fuel-derived air pollution have decreased by 15·7% since 2005, with 80% of this reduction being the result of reduced coal-derived pollution. Meanwhile the renewable energy sector expanded to a historical high of 12·7 million employees in 2021 (indicator 4.2.2); and renewable energy accounted for 90% of the growth in electricity capacity in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1). Supporting this, global clean energy investment increased by 15% in 2022, to $1·6 trillion, exceeding fossil fuel investment by 61% (indicator 4.2.1); and lending to the green energy sector rose to $498 billion in 2021, approaching fossil fuel lending (indicator 4.2.7).

Scientific understanding of the links between health and climate change is rapidly growing, and although coverage lags in some of the most affected regions, over 3000 scientific articles covered this topic in 2022 (indicators 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Meanwhile, the health dimensions of climate change are increasingly acknowledged in the public discourse, with 24% of all climate change newspaper articles in 2022 referring to health, just short of the 26% in 2020 (indicator 5.1). Importantly, international organisations are increasingly engaging with the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation (indicator 5.4.2), and governments increasingly acknowledge this link, with 95% of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement now referring to health — up from 73% in 2020 (indicator 5.4.1). These trends signal what could be the start of a life-saving transition.

A people-centred transformation: putting health at the heart of climate action

With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine — rather than protect — the future of people alive today and generations to come.

Safeguarding people's health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all.

### The Lancet and colonialism: past, present, and future [^f3b460da]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The historical and contemporary alignment of medical and health journals with colonial practices needs elucidation. Colonialism, which sought to exploit colonised people and places, was justified by the prejudice that colonised people's ways of knowing and being are inferior to those of the colonisers. Institutions for knowledge production and dissemination, including academic journals, were therefore central to sustaining colonialism and its legacies today. This invited Viewpoint focuses on The Lancet, following its 200th anniversary, and is especially important given the extent of The Lancet's global influence. We illuminate links between The Lancet and colonialism, with examples from the past and present, showing how the journal legitimised and continues to promote specific types of knowers, knowledge, perspectives, and interpretations in health and medicine. The Lancet's role in colonialism is not unique; other institutions and publications across the British empire cooperated with empire-building through colonisation. We therefore propose investigations and raise questions to encourage broader contestation on the practices, audience, positionality, and ownership of journals claiming leadership in global knowledge production.

### Examining the Lancet commission risk factors for dementia using mendelian randomisation [^48d8f281]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

A key assumption in the PAF calculation and interpretation is that the relationship between the risk factor and outcome is causal. However, although a mixture of study designs examining risk factors was included in the Lancet Commission review, the bulk of the evidence comes from epidemiological studies. A limitation to reporting PAF statistics based on epidemiological studies is that causal relationships cannot be established in these types of observational studies. One reason for this is that observed associations can arise as an artefact of unmeasured confounders. Another reason is that reverse causation cannot be ruled out and this may be particularly problematic when the disease in question has a long preclinical period as is the case with dementia. Therefore, one of the key messages of the Lancet commission report (modifying the 12 lifestyle risk factors may prevent or delay up to 40% of dementias in the population) is based on the assumption that the results of the studies included in the report have provided evidence to support causality.

### The 2024 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: facing record-breaking threats from delayed action [^e07d0cce]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Executive summary

Despite the initial hope inspired by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world is now dangerously close to breaching its target of limiting global multiyear mean heating to 1·5°C. Annual mean surface temperature reached a record high of 1·45°C above the pre-industrial baseline in 2023, and new temperature highs were recorded throughout 2024. The resulting climatic extremes are increasingly claiming lives and livelihoods worldwide.

The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established the same year the Paris Agreement entered into force, to monitor the health impacts and opportunities of the world's response to this landmark agreement. Supported through strategic core funding from Wellcome, the collaboration brings together over 300 multidisciplinary researchers and health professionals from around the world to take stock annually of the evolving links between health and climate change at global, regional, and national levels.

The 2024 report of the Lancet Countdown, building on the expertise of 122 leading researchers from UN agencies and academic institutions worldwide, reveals the most concerning findings yet in the collaboration's 8 years of monitoring.

The record-breaking human costs of climate change

Data in this year's report show that people all around the world are facing record-breaking threats to their wellbeing, health, and survival from the rapidly changing climate. Of the 15 indicators monitoring climate change-related health hazards, exposures, and impacts, ten reached concerning new records in their most recent year of data.

Heat-related mortality of people older than 65 years increased by a record-breaking 167%, compared with the 1990s, 102 percentage points higher than the 65% that would have been expected without temperature rise (indicator 1.1.5). Heat exposure is also increasingly affecting physical activity and sleep quality, in turn affecting physical and mental health. In 2023, heat exposure put people engaging in outdoor physical activity at risk of heat stress (moderate or higher) for a record high of 27·7% more hours than on average in the 1990s (indicator 1.1.2) and led to a record 6% more hours of sleep lost in 2023 than the average during 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.4).

People worldwide are also increasingly at risk from life-threatening extreme weather events. Between 1961–90 and 2014–23, 61% of the global land area saw an increase in the number of days of extreme precipitation (indicator 1.2.3), which in turn increases the risk of flooding, infectious disease spread, and water contamination. In parallel, 48% of the global land area was affected by at least 1 month of extreme drought in 2023, the second largest affected area since 1951 (indicator 1.2.2). The increase in drought and heatwave events since 1981–2010 was, in turn, associated with 151 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity across 124 countries assessed in 2022, the highest recorded value (indicator 1.4.2).

The hotter and drier weather conditions are increasingly favouring the occurrence of sand and dust storms. This weather-environmental phenomenon contributed to a 31% increase in the number of people exposed to dangerously high particulate matter concentrations between 2003–07 and 2018–22 (indicator 1.2.4). Meanwhile, changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are favouring the transmission of deadly infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, West Nile virus-related illness, and vibriosis, putting people at risk of transmission in previously unaffected locations (indicators 1.3.1–1.3.4).

Compounding these impacts, climate change is affecting the social and economic conditions on which health and wellbeing depend. The average annual economic losses from weather-related extreme events increased by 23% from 2010–14 to 2019–23, to US$227 billion (a value exceeding the gross domestic product [GDP] of about 60% of the world's economies; indicator 4.1.1). Although 60·5% of losses in very high Human Development Index (HDI) countries were covered by insurance, the vast majority of those in countries with lower HDI levels were uninsured, with local communities bearing the brunt of the physical and economic losses (indicator 4.1.1). Extreme weather and climate change-related health impacts are also affecting labour productivity, with heat exposure leading to a record high loss of 512 billion potential labour hours in 2023, worth $835 billion in potential income losses (indicators 1.1.3 and 4.1.3). Low and medium HDI countries were most affected by these losses, which amounted to 7·6% and 4·4% of their GDP, respectively (indicator 4.1.3). With the most underserved communities most affected, these economic impacts further reduce their capacity to cope with and recover from the growing impacts of climate change, thereby amplifying global inequities.

Concerningly, multiple hazards revealed by individual indicators are likely to have simultaneous compounding and cascading impacts on the complex and inter-connected human systems that sustain good health, disproportionately threatening people's health and survival with every fraction of a degree of increase in global mean temperature.

Despite years of monitoring exposing the imminent health threats of climate inaction, the health risks people face have been exacerbated by years of delays in adaptation, which have left people ill-protected from the growing threats of climate change. Only 68% of countries reported high-to-very-high implementation of legally mandated health emergency management capacities in 2023, of which just 11% were low HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Moreover, only 35% of countries reported having health early warning systems for heat-related illness, whereas 10% did so for mental and psychosocial conditions (indicator 2.2.1). Scarcity of financial resources was identified as a key barrier to adaptation, including by 50% of the cities that reported they were not planning to undertake climate change and health risk assessments (indicator 2.1.3). Indeed, adaptation projects with potential health benefits represented just 27% of all the Green Climate Fund's adaptation funding in 2023, despite a 137% increase since 2021 (indicator 2.2.4). With universal health coverage still unattained in most countries, financial support is needed to strengthen health systems and ensure that they can protect people from growing climate change-related health hazards. The unequal distribution of financial resources and technical capacity is leaving the most vulnerable populations further unprotected from the growing health risks.

Fuelling the fire

As well as exposing the inadequacy of adaptation efforts to date, this year's report reveals a world veering away from the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1·5°C, with concerning new records broken across indicators monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that enable them.

Far from declining, global energy-related CO 2 emissions reached an all-time high in 2023 (indicator 3.1.1). Oil and gas companies are reinforcing the global dependence on fossil fuels and — partly fuelled by the high energy prices and windfall profits of the global energy crisis — most are further expanding their fossil fuel production plans. As of March, 2024, the 114 largest oil and gas companies were on track to exceed emissions consistent with 1·5°C of heating by 189% in 2040, up from 173% 1 year before (indicator 4.2.2). As a result, their strategies are pushing the world further off track from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, further threatening people's health and survival.

Although renewable energy could provide power to remote locations, its adoption is lagging, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The consequences of this delay reflect the human impacts of an unjust transition. Globally, 745 million people still lack access to electricity and are facing the harms of energy poverty on health and wellbeing. The burning of polluting biomass (eg, wood or dung) still accounts for 92% of the energy used in the home by people in low HDI countries (indicator 3.1.2), and only 2·3% of electricity in these countries comes from clean renewables, compared with 11·6% in very high HDI countries (indicators 3.1.1). This persistent burning of fossil fuel and biomass led to at least 3·33 million deaths from outdoor fine particulate matter (PM 2·5) air pollution globally in 2021 alone (indicator 3.2.1), and the domestic use of dirty solid fuels caused 2·3 million deaths from indoor air pollution in 2020 across 65 countries analysed (indicator 3.2.2).

Compounding the growth in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, almost 182 million hectares of forests were lost between 2016 and 2022 (indicator 3.4), reducing the world's natural capacity to capture atmospheric CO 2. In parallel, the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which contributed to 11·2 million deaths attributable to unhealthy diets in 2021 (indicator 3.3.2), has led to a 2·9% increase in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions since 2016 (indicator 3.3.1).

Health systems themselves, although essential to protect people's health, are also increasingly contributing to the problem. Greenhouse gas emissions from health care have increased by 36% since 2016, making health systems increasingly unprepared to operate in a net zero emissions future and pushing health care further from its guiding principle of doing no harm (indicator 3.5).

The growing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is pushing the world to a future of increasingly dangerous health hazards and reducing the chances of survival of vulnerable people all around the globe.

Health-threatening financial flows

With the availability of financial resources a key barrier to tackling climate change, a rapid growth in predictable and equitable investment is urgently needed to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. A growing body of literature shows that the economic benefits of a transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions will far exceed the costs of inaction. Healthier, more resilient populations will further support more prosperous and sustainable economies (indicators 4.1.2–4.1.4).

However, although funding to enable potentially life-saving climate change adaptation and mitigation activities remains scarce, substantial financial resources are being allocated to activities that harm health and perpetuate a fossil fuel-based economy. The resulting reliance on fossil fuel energy has meant many countries faced sharp increases in energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruption of fossil fuel supplies. To keep energy affordable to local populations, many governments resorted to increasing their explicit fossil fuel subsidies. Consequently, 84% of countries studied still operated net negative carbon prices (explicit net fossil fuel subsidies) in 2022, for a record high net total of $1·4 trillion (indicator 4.3.3), with the sums involved often comparable to countries' total health budgets. In addition, although clean energy investment grew by 10% globally in 2023 — exceeding fossil fuel investment by 73% — considerable regional disparities exist. Clean energy investment is 38% lower than fossil fuel spending in emerging market and developing economies outside China. Clean energy spending in these countries only accounted for 17·4% of the global total. Moreover, investment in energy efficiency and end use, essential for a just transition, decreased by 1·3% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1).

The resulting expansion of fossil fuel assets is increasingly jeopardising the economies on which people's livelihoods depend. On the current trajectory, the world already faces potential global income losses ranging from 11% to 29% by 2050. The number of fossil fuel industry employees reached 11·8 million in 2022, increasing the size of a workforce whose employment cannot be sustained in a world that avoids the most catastrophic human impacts of climate change (indicator 4.2.1). Meanwhile, ongoing investments in coal power have pushed the value of coal-fired power generation assets that risk becoming stranded within 10 years (between 2025 and 2034) in a 1·5°C trajectory to a cumulative total of $164·5 billion — a value that will increase if coal investments persist (indicator 4.2.3). The prioritisation of fossil fuel-based systems means most countries remain ill-prepared for the vital transition to zero greenhouse gas emission economies. As a result of an unjust transition, the risk is unequally distributed: preparedness scores for the transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy were below the global average in all countries with a low HDI, 96% of those with a medium HDI, and 84% of those with a high HDI, compared with just 7% of very high HDI countries (indicator 4.2.4).

Defining the health profile of people worldwide

Following decades of delays in climate change action, avoiding the most severe health impacts of climate change now requires aligned, structural, and sustained changes across most human systems, including energy, transportation, agriculture, food, and health care. Importantly, a global transformation of financial systems is required, shifting resources away from the fossil fuel-based economy towards a zero emissions future. Putting people's health at the centre of climate change policy making is key to ensuring this transition protects wellbeing, reduces health inequities, and maximises health gains. Some indicators reveal incipient progress and important opportunities for delivering this health-centred transformation.

As of December, 2023, 50 countries reported having formally assessed their health vulnerabilities and adaptation needs, up from 11 the previous year, and the number of countries that reported having a Health National Adaptation Plan increased from four in 2022 to 43 in 2023 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Additionally, 70% of 279 public health education institutions worldwide reported providing education in climate and health in 2023, essential to build capacities for health professionals to help shape this transition (indicator 2.2.6). Regarding the energy sector, the global share of electricity from clean modern renewables reached a record high of 10·5% in 2021 (indicator 3.1.1); clean energy investment exceeded fossil fuel investment by 73% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1); and renewable energy-related employment has grown 35·6% since 2016, providing healthier and more sustainable employment opportunities than those in the fossil fuel industry (indicator 4.2.1). Importantly, mostly as a result of coal phase-down in high and very high HDI countries, deaths attributable to outdoor PM 2·5 from fossil fuel combustion decreased by 6·9% between 2016 and 2021 (indicator 3.2.1), showing the life-saving potential of coal phase-out.

Important progress was made within international negotiations, which opened new opportunities to protect health in the face of climate change. After years of leadership from WHO on climate change and health, its Fourteenth General Programme of Work, adopted in May, 2024, made responding to climate change its first strategic priority. Within climate negotiations themselves, the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) featured the first health thematic day in 2023: 151 countries endorsed the COP28 United Arab Emirates Declaration on Climate and Health, and the Global Goal on Adaptation set a specific health target. The outcome of the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement also recognised the right to health and a healthy environment, urging parties to take further health adaptation efforts, and opened a new opportunity for human survival, health, and wellbeing to be prioritised in the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) due in 2025. The pending decision of how the Loss and Damage fund will be governed and the definition of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance during COP29 provide further opportunities to secure the financial support crucial for a healthy net zero transition.

Although still insufficient to protect people's health from climate change, these emerging signs of progress help open new opportunities to deliver a healthy, prosperous future. However, much remains to be done.

Hanging in the balance

With climate change breaking dangerous new records and emissions persistently rising, preventing the most catastrophic consequences on human development, health, and survival now requires the support and will of all actors in society. However, data suggest that engagement with health and climate change could be declining across key sectors: the number of governments mentioning health and climate change in their annual UN General Debate statements fell from 50% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, and only 47% of the 58 NDCs updated as of February, 2024, referred to health (indicator 5.4.1). Media engagement also dropped, with the proportion of newspaper climate change articles mentioning health falling 10% between 2022 and 2023 (indicator 5.1).

The powerful and trusted leadership of the health community could hold the key to reversing these concerning trends and making people's wellbeing, health, and survival a central priority of political and financial agendas. The engagement of health professionals at all levels of climate change decision making will be pivotal in informing the redirection of efforts and financial resources away from activities that jeopardise people's health towards supporting healthy populations, prosperous economies, and a safer future. As concerning records continue to be broken and people face unprecedented risks from climate change, the wellbeing, health, and survival of individuals in every country now hang in the balance.

### Whose voice counts? Achieving better outcomes in global sexual and reproductive health and rights research [^a4100250]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

What are the methodological and content characteristics of the journal articles?
Who are the influential authors and where are they located?
Are there critical methodological and content gaps in the articles? If so, what are they?

Our approach integrated a series of quantitative and qualitative analyses outlined in figure 1. The iterative approach to this research began with a small group to scope the project, followed by engagement with all authors to develop, inform and finalise analyses and interpretation. We interrogated the literature through a mix of descriptive and bibliometric analyses coupled with thematic analyses that led us to generate recommendations.

Figure 1
Research process helix. SRHR, sexual and reproductive health and rights.

We conducted a search in the Web of Science Core Collection using the terms in the SRHR definition to form a detailed search string (see figure 2). We used a combination of citation counts and Web of Science's Journal Citation Reports (eg, using the number of citations to find articles that were in the top 1% when compared with other articles in the same field) as indicators of journals with the most impact within global SRHR. Using that filter, BMJ Global Health, The Lancet and The Lancet Global Health emerged as the top journals. We limited results by year, from January 2014 to November 2022, and to research articles and review articles. The 'analyse results' feature in Web of Science was used to generate Excel data files for the detailed analyses (see figure 2).

### The human crisis in cancer: a Lancet oncology commission [^bfc33bce]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Amid unprecedented scientific progress in oncology, a growing body of evidence reveals a parallel and profound crisis in the human experience of cancer care. Despite overall survival outcomes improving, the systems designed to deliver care increasingly fall short in addressing the emotional, relational, and existential dimensions of cancer. Although examples of compassionate and attentive care can be found in every setting, patients and families across global contexts continue to report being unheard, unsupported, and, at times, actively harmed by care structures that prioritise technical precision over human presence. This Lancet Oncology Commission proposes that the human crisis of cancer is not defined by pathology, mortality, or cause, but by the erosion of meaning, connection, and compassion in the experience of cancer. This crisis is shaped by what is present and what is absent: the presence of fragmented, costly, and impersonal systems and the absence of human connection, psychological safety, and relational care. It is a crisis that spans delivery, mental health, palliative care, research, and education-one that is not peripheral to oncology's progress but central to its failures. The impacts of this crisis are felt most acutely by those already made vulnerable by inequity, discrimination, and economic precarity, but it is a system-level failure that ripples across every context, from the most resource-rich to the most resource-constrained settings. Addressing this crisis will require more than good intentions; it will demand confronting the structural incentives and ideologies that have devalued the relational foundations of cancer care. This Commission identifies a growing imbalance between technological innovation and the human dimensions of cancer care. As the field has increasingly prioritised biopharmaceutical development, genomic precision, and market-driven efficiencies, it has often neglected core practices that uphold dignity, alleviate suffering, and build trust.

### Football is medicine: it is time for patients to play! [^9a9664f2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Is there evidence that sport provides health benefits?

In a 2012 Lancet review, it was concluded that 'sport may contribute to the health of nations'. A subsequent meta-analysis published in 2015 concluded that, in terms of health effects of sport, 'the best evidence was found for football and running', and that 'evidence for health benefits of other sport disciplines was either inconclusive or tenuous'. Since then, high-quality research has emphasised the preventive effects of several ball games for sedentary adults, and we report that the evidence for the health benefits of football (soccer) is even stronger. More than 150 peer-reviewed articles published in 35 international scientific journals tell us that football is a joyful, social and popular sporting activity that is effective and versatile; a multipurpose type of training with marked positive effects for almost all types of people and across their lifespan. The most popular sport in the world is much more than entertainment: football is broad-spectrum medicine against lifestyle diseases. In this editorial, we guide the reader to the crux of the evidence.

### How the EAT-Lancet commission on food in the anthropocene influenced discourse and research on food systems: a systematic review covering the first 2 years post-publication [^3119b749]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission's report on food in the Anthropocene presented a planetary heath diet to improve health while reducing the environmental effect of food systems globally. We assessed EAT-Lancet's immediate influence on academic research and debate by conducting a systematic review of articles citing the Commission and others published from January, 2019, to April, 2021. The Commission influenced methods, results, or discourse for 192 (7·5%) of 2560 citing articles, stimulating cross-disciplinary research and debate across life sciences (47%), health and medical sciences (42%), and social sciences (11%). Sentiment analysis of 76 critiquing articles indicated that opinions were, on average, more positive than negative. Positive sentiments centred on benefits for informing policy, public health, and raising public awareness. Negative sentiments included insufficient attention to socioeconomic dimensions, feasibility, and environmental effects other than emissions. Empirical articles predominantly evaluated the effects of changed diets or food production on the environment and wellbeing (29%), compared current diets with EAT-Lancet recommendations (12%), or informed future policy and research agendas (20%). Despite limitations in EAT-Lancet's method, scope, and implementation feasibility, the academic community supported these recommendations. A broad suite of research needs was identified focusing on the effects of food processing, socioeconomic and political drivers of diet and health, and optimising consumption or production for environment and health.

### Development of an EAT-Lancet index and its relation to mortality in a Swedish population [^774d554b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the health aspects of the EAT-Lancet diet were based on the literature, knowledge about the health effects of different populations following the EAT-Lancet diet is sparse and has only been evaluated in the context of health outcomes to a limited extent. Some attempts have been made to develop diet scores measuring adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. However, there is no consensus as yet on how to quantify the diet, and proposed methods vary depending on the scoring method used and the interpretation of foods to emphasize and limit. For example, previous diet scores have limited the possibility to capture intake variation outside proposed reference levels of the EAT-Lancet diet, as they are comprised of binary food components.

In this study, the aim was to develop a new index to measure adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and evaluate adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and its association with mortality in a large, population-based Swedish cohort. We also examined food components included in the index and their individual associations with mortality. The new index is based on a novel scoring system that allows us to measure the degree of adherence to the proposed EAT-Lancet diet reference levels for different foods, and thereby extends the ability to differentiate between individuals' dietary patterns and associated sustainability performance.

### A spotlight on maternal health [^af7a596d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Included in this issue is our Series on, jointly published in eClinicalMedicine and The Lancet Global Health on Dec 6, 2023. Against the backdrop offor 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.1, this four-paper Series provides the scientific basis for embracing new perspectives in tackling global maternal health issues. We hope that this Series will trigger a paradigm shift in both opinion and clinical practice in implementing a holistic, human rights-based approach to addressing maternal ill-health and acknowledging the ever-present power imbalances.

Although this Series is focused on maternal health, it is important to acknowledge that maternal health, and indeed women's health at large, encompasses much more than reproductive health. It is well established that, generally, health conditions that affect women more than men garner. Furthermore, focusing on maternal mortality as the most important measure of maternal health risks ignoring other important aspects of women's health and reinforces deleterious stereotypes about a woman's primary role in society being that of reproduction. We need a broader vision for women's health, and — whilst acknowledging that mortality is the worst possible outcome — need to prioritise preventing the morbidity incurred by mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period. This begins with more extensive research. For example, into the various medium-term and long-term sequelae mothers experience after childbirth (eg, depression, urinary and anal incontinence, and sexual dysfunction), as covered inof the Series — which calls for the postnatal period to be extended past the current 6 weeks post-birth.

### The 2021 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: code red for a healthy future [^74bcb3af]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic will alter the trends of many of the indicators reported; some of these trends can be identified in this report and others will become apparent in the coming years. COVID-19 has also altered population demographics, mortality rates, and the structure and size of the labour force. These changes are not reflected in the current indicators, presenting methodological challenges in the assessment of the health impacts of climate change. How the COVID-19 pandemic affects the methods and assumptions of the Lancet Countdown's indicators will become clearer in future reports as more data will be available.

The global reach of the Lancet Countdown is expanding. Two regional offices, one in South America (Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru) and one in Asia (Tsinghua University, Beijing, China), were established in 2020 and an office in Europe was established in 2021 (Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, Barcelona, Spain). These regional collaborators contributed indicators to the 2021 report and are working on nationally-relevant and regionally-relevant health and climate change research, accompanied by local communications and policy engagement. A third regional office, based at the University of the West Indies (Kingston, Jamaica), was established in September, 2021, and aims to build on the network and evidence base of health and climate change in small island developing states (SIDS). The Lancet Countdown is also working in collaboration with the European Environment Agency, incorporating policy-relevant data from its indicators into the European Climate and Health Observatory.

National and regional reports were published for Australia (in partnership with the Medical Journal of Australia), China, and SIDS. – For the third year, the data underpinning each of the Lancet Countdown's indicators have been shared through an, where they can be explored at finer spatial and temporal scales.

The work of this collaboration is driven by the ongoing support from The Lancet and the Wellcome Trust, the Lancet Countdown's scientific advisory group and higher-level advisory board, and, importantly, the Lancet Countdown's authors and collaborators. The collaboration welcomes offers of support from new experts and new institutions willing to build on this analysis as the Lancet Countdown monitors the world's response to the health effects of climate change during this decade.

### Chronic symptoms and Lyme… [^34cce57c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview Lyme disease is an illness caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and spread by blacklegged ticks. Although most people recover completely when treated with a 2- to 4-week course of oral antibiotics, some can have prolonged symptoms of fatigue, body aches, or difficulty thinking. Studies published in the American Journal of Medicine and The Lancet Regional Health-Europe found that 6 months after treatment these symptoms are 5–10% more common among people who have had Lyme disease than among people who have not. Chronic Lyme Disease because it implies that prolonged symptoms are caused by an ongoing bacterial infection when, in fact, the cause is not currently known. Regardless of the term used, prolonged symptoms can have devastating effects on a person's life. There is a critical need to better understand the causes of prolonged symptoms in people who have had Lyme disease and best approaches to treatment and care.

What CDC is doing CDC collaborates with public health partners, healthcare providers, patients who have Lyme disease, and advocacy groups to:

- Conduct research to better understand the occurrence, risk factors, and impact of prolonged symptoms and Lyme disease.
- Develop a common research agenda for infection-associated illnesses to better understand how to treat, manage, and support people with prolonged and chronic symptoms.
- Provide education to healthcare providers regarding diagnosis and care for patients suffering from chronic symptoms. CDC is committed to raising awareness about the growing threat of Lyme and other tickborne diseases, and the need for early and accurate Lyme disease diagnosis and prevention.

### Affordability of the EAT-Lancet reference diet: a global analysis [^a198455a]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Measuring affordability relative to household per capita income, we estimated that the cost of an EAT– Lancet reference diet exceeds total income for at least 1·58 billion people, out of which 80% (1·26 billion) are in middle-income countries (table 3). The prevalence of individuals with total household income per person below the estimated least-cost of the EAT– Lancet reference diet is highest in sub-Saharan Africa (57·2%) followed by south Asia (38·4%).

Table 3
Number and share of people with daily income below the cost of the EAT– Lancet reference diet, by country income levels, and major regions

Measuring affordability relative to alternative sources of essential nutrients, an EAT– Lancet reference diet is more expensive by a factor of 1·60 (IQR 1·41–1·78). The added cost of meeting EAT– Lancet standards varies widely across income levels and geographical regions (figure 3). The main cost differences between the EAT– Lancet reference diet and the cost of nutrient adequacy largely originate from the larger quantity of animal source foods in the EAT– Lancet reference diet than would be required for nutrient adequacy alone (appendix).

Figure 3
Comparing the cost of EAT– Lancet reference diets to the minimum cost of nutrient adequacy, by level of national income or geographical region

We used price data from the International Comparison Program to estimate the cost of the EAT– Lancet diet in 159 countries, and computed the cost of meeting only estimated average requirements, upper limits and average macronutrient distribution ranges for essential nutrients. At the dashed vertical line, the two diets would have identical cost. Data shown are the cost of an EAT– Lancet diet as a multiple of the nutrients-only diet — for example, a value of 1·5 represents a 50% higher cost. The size of the box indicates the IQR. The bottom and top rule marks the bottom fifth and top fifth percentiles, respectively. The vertical bar rule inside the box shows the median value for the income group or geographical region.

### The association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and cognitive ageing [^c90314fc]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The EAT-Lancet commission has proposed a dietary pattern that is both sustainable and healthy. However, the impact of this diet on cognition in older adults remains unexplored. Therefore, we examined the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and cognitive ageing.

Methods

We used data from a previous intervention study involving cognitively healthy community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years. Adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was calculated using a recently published index and a 190-item food frequency questionnaire. Global and domain-specific cognitive functioning were assessed at baseline and after 2 years using a neuropsychological test battery. Multivariate-adjusted linear regression was conducted to examine associations between EAT-Lancet diet adherence and cognitive functioning (n = 630) and 2-year change (n = 302).

Results

Greater adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was associated with better global cognitive functioning (β per SD = 3.7 points [95% CI]: 0.04 [0.00, 0.08]) and slower rate of decline (β per SD [95% CI]: 0.05 [0.02, 0.08]). With respect to domain-specific functioning, beneficial associations were observed cross-sectionally for executive functioning (P < 0.01), and longitudinally for change in executive functioning (P < 0.01) and attention and working memory (P < 0.01). The degree of adherence to the EAT-Lancet was not associated with (changes in) information processing speed or episodic memory.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that greater adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet is associated with better global cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline among cognitively healthy older adults. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess the potential benefits of the EAT-Lancet diet for the ageing population in a broader context.

### Global assessment of palliative care need: serious health-related suffering measurement methodology [^43e023d2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Medium credibility.

The Lancet Commission report presented a breakthrough by introducing the concept of serious health-related suffering (SHS) to quantify the global and country-specific need for palliative care and pain relief in terms of both the number of individuals who experience SHS (population in need of palliative care services), and the number of days of each type of SHS (as an input to develop more effective health system responses to address palliative care need) in a given year. Building on more limited efforts to measure population-based need for palliative care in previous publications, the Commission estimated the 2015 global burden of SHS at 61 million: 25.5 million people who died — 45% of the 56.2 million deaths worldwide and an additional 35.5 million people who experienced an SHS-associated condition and did not die in that year, with at least 6 billion symptom days experienced by those people. The estimates were calculated by a systematic process documented briefly in the Lancet Commission report and in its entirety in a white paper.

The Lancet Commission Report has been cited by over 1000 research article publications as of this writing, and the data has been used by various international organizations and initiatives including the International Narcotic Control Board (INCB), the Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance (WHPCA), and the Disease Control Priorities (3rd edition), as well as various country champions of palliative care in their evidence generation, policy making and advocacy endeavors. –

The Lancet Commission Secretariat was transformed into an interdisciplinary Research Hub on Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief — jointly led by the University of Miami Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care to promote evidence generation, dissemination, and translation to policy and practice to achieve universal access to palliative care. The research hub built on the original Commission methodology — SHS 1.0 to generate the next iteration — SHS 2.0.

### Hearing impairment and dementia: cause, catalyst or consequence? [^65c42dae]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The relationship between hearing impairment and dementia has attracted significant attention, the 2024 Lancet Commission report identifying hearing loss as the largest modifiable risk factor for dementia from mid-life. The nature of this linkage between dementia and hearing remains unclear and is likely to be complex. In principle, hearing impairment could cause (directly promote), catalyze (amplify) or be a consequence of neurodegenerative pathology and cognitive decline. Here we use this framework to examine different lines of evidence for the association between hearing impairment and dementia, and consider how this evidence speaks to potential mechanisms and treatment implications. We conclude by considering practical clinical implications for management of patients with hearing impairment and dementia, the potential role for central hearing tests as 'auditory biomarkers' of dementia, and the need for further collaborative and mechanistically motivated research in this area.

### Social determinants of dementia: a scoping review [^05ee3dd1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Review of reviews

The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care has published three reports. These reports summarised results from systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of associations, as well as specific additional studies on genetic epidemiology, mechanistic evidence, and interventional evidence. Although modifiable risk factors were predominantly reviewed through an individual‐level paradigm (e.g. hypertension, physical activity), the reports have also comprehensively presented evidence related to some SDOD, such as education, air pollution, and inequalities. The first report was published in 2017and was updated in 2020and 2024.

We then searched for systematic reviews that examined evidence linking specific social determinants of health, not comprehensively covered in the Lancet Commission reports, to dementia risk. We searched Medline via Ovid on the 22nd of February 2024, using terms for "dementia" and " social determinants of health", and " review " without date restrictions (see Table S2 for the full search strategy). We included systematic reviews that were conducted using a clearly reported systematic literature search and reported on a specific synthesis of literature pertaining to the longitudinal associations of one or more social determinants of health and incident dementia. The social determinants must have been measured at a time when the subject was dementia‐free, dementia status must then also be ascertained at a later time point (with the exception of ethnicity/race, for which we included cross‐sectional analyses as ethnicity/race is obtained by birth). We required that dementia was ascertained either by clinical assessment (direct, self‐reported clinical diagnosis, or via healthcare record linkage) or using a validated algorithm for establishing dementia status based on cognitive and/or functional tests in cohort studies. Two reviewers (Se.W. and A.G.) independently screened articles for inclusion and resolved conflicts through discussion.

Data from all included reviews, including the Lancet Commission reports, were extracted using a template that captured the information presented in Table S3.

### Academic output in global surgery after the Lancet commission on global surgery: a scoping review [^dc80a16d]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) published its seminal report in 2015, carving a niche for global surgery academia. Six years after the LCoGS, a scoping review was conducted to see how the term 'global surgery' is characterized by the literature and how it relates to LCoGS and its domains.

Methods

PubMed was searched for publications between January 2015 and February 2021 that used the term 'global surgery' in the title, abstract, or key words or cited the LCoGS. Variables extracted included LCoGS domains, authorship metrics, geographic scope, and clinical specialty.

Results

The search captured 938 articles that qualified for data extraction. Nearly 80% of first and last authors had high-income country affiliations. Africa was the most frequently investigated region, though many countries within the region were under-represented. The World Journal of Surgery was the most frequent journal, publishing 13.9% of all articles. General surgery, pediatric surgery, and neurosurgery were the most represented specialties. Of the LCoGS domains, healthcare delivery and management were the most studied, while economics and financing were the least studied.

Conclusion

A lack of consensus on the definition of global surgery remains. Additional research is needed in economics and financing, while obstetrics and trauma are under-represented in literature using the term 'global surgery'. Efforts in academic global surgery must give a voice to those carrying the global surgery agenda forward on the frontlines. Focusing on research capacity-building and encouraging contribution by local partners will lead to a stronger, more cohesive global surgery community.

His fullest biography is more than a century old, but still provides a good account of the struggles and achievements of this extraordinary yet at times rather difficult and overstretched man. Nonetheless, there are gaps, and this anniversary provides a chance to fill in a few of them.

### Trade and health: an agenda for action [^9b7e2af5]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

The processes of contemporary globalisation are creating ever-closer ties between individuals and populations across different countries. The health of a population, and the systems in place to deliver health care, are affected increasingly by factors beyond the population and health system. The Lancet's Series on trade and health has provided an overview of these links between international trade, trade liberalisation, and health, and raised the key issues that face the health community. In this final paper in the Series, we call for a substantial and sustained effort by those within the health profession to engage with issues of trade, to strengthen institutional capacity in this area, and to place health higher on the agenda of trade negotiations. The rapid rise of trade agreements and treaties, as well as trade that occurs beyond these institutional boundaries, means that further action is required by a range of actors, including WHO, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), regional agencies, foundations, national governments, civil society, non-governmental organisations, and academics. The stewardship of a domestic health system in the 21st century requires a sophisticated understanding of how trade affects, and will affect, a country's health system and policy, to optimise opportunities to benefit health and health care while minimising the risks posed though the assertion of health goals in trade policy. To acheive this will place a premium on all those engaged in health to understand the importance of trade and to engage with their counterparts involved in trade and trade policy. We hope that this Series has prompted the reader to become involved in these efforts.

### Towards better evidence-informed global action: lessons learnt from the Lancet series and recent developments in physical activity and public health [^06d5629c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Correlates and determinants

Identifying the correlates (from cross-sectional studies) and determinants (from longitudinal studies) is important for understanding the causes of physical inactivity and informing activity-promotion strategies. According to the 2012 Lancet series, a plethora of studies had examined the correlates of physical activity at the individual, interpersonal, environmental and policy levels, but fewer studies have examined determinants. Furthermore, an evidence gap was observed in LMIC. An updated review in 2016 found that despite the increasing number of studies, particularly in LMIC, the field is still dominated by cross-sectional studies and the evidence from LMIC is mainly based on studies conducted in Brazil and China. We conducted another updated search (through March 2019) using the 2016 search protocol and found 40 original studies from LMIC and 11 literature reviews published since 2016 (online supplementary appendix 1–3). The overall pattern of the literature remained unchanged, where 93% (n = 37) of newly published studies are cross-sectional, 60% (n = 24) of the LMIC studies are from Brazil and China, and no studies from low-income countries, indicating little change in researchers' practices in this area.

While studies on behavioural correlates and determinants have led to a better understanding of why some people are more active than others, several common issues have limited the usefulness of many studies. First, although the fundamental rationale for correlate and determinant research is informing interventions, this link has not been made explicit by many studies, and the body of research has evolved to become a stand-alone field, where evidence has seldom been generated with the intended research translation. Second, the body of literature on correlates and determinants of physical activity has been predominantly focused on the individual and interpersonal levels of influence, while making real-world population-level changes requires societal, policy, political and macroeconomic changes. Third, the field still lacks evidence from studies that apply longitudinal designs, are based on population-representative samples or those that examine behavioural mechanisms. In summary, many correlate studies have been published since 2012. Although the number of studies from LMIC has increased (mainly driven by Brazil and China), the gaps and limitations in the field identified in the 2012 Lancet series remain largely unaddressed, and journals continue to publish many cross-sectional studies on well-established correlates.

### Development of an EAT-Lancet index and its relation to mortality in a Swedish population [^b95ce610]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

In future studies, our index could also be examined in relation to the incidence of chronic diseases. In addition, other associated sustainability benefits require further research: for example, by linking our index components to life cycle assessment data to estimate how environmental impact varies depending on adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. Moreover, although modeling studies show that adequate intake of most nutrients is met with the EAT-Lancet diet, the nutritional adequacy of the EAT-Lancet diet as assessed with our index has not been studied and might also be of interest. Applying the index on a diet consumed today would also be an interesting area of future research, since we expect different co-consumption patterns today compared to the dietary habits in the 1990s examined in this cohort. Last, evaluating our index in other populations, including those of low- or middle-income countries, would also be relevant to test and develop it for global usage. Similarly, it would be valuable to examine the previously described EAT-Lancet score by Knuppel et al. in the MDCS cohort and compare the findings.

We are familiar with the debate that has surrounded the EAT-Lancet diet due to methodological considerations, lack of adaptation to local contexts and different populations, and feasibility in terms of costs and missing environmental perspectives. Nevertheless, the considerable reductions in mortality shown in this study provide strong arguments for prioritizing healthy diets similar to the EAT-Lancet diet in policy, in education, and on the overall global agenda.

In conclusion, we developed a new dietary index to investigate adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet, and this study indicates that the EAT-Lancet diet, as assessed with this EAT-Lancet index, is associated with a lower risk of mortality. Our findings show the value of providing a set of recommendations that reflects a dietary pattern, and contribute to the evidence base to be used when developing sustainable dietary guidelines and policies.

### Development of an EAT-Lancet index and its relation to mortality in a Swedish population [^ef8d05ed]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current global food systems threaten human health and environmental sustainability. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems defined the first global reference diet to improve both areas, but there is no consensus on how to quantify the EAT-Lancet reference diet as a diet index, and its relation to mortality has not been widely studied.

Objectives

We sought to develop a new dietary index to quantify adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and assess its association with mortality in a large, population-based Swedish cohort. We also examined food components included in the index and their individual associations with mortality.

Methods

We used the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort (n = 22,421; 45–73 years old at baseline). Dietary data were collected using a modified diet history method. The EAT-Lancet index was developed based on intake levels and reference intervals of 14 food components defined in the EAT-Lancet diet (0–3 points per component; 0–42 points in total). Associations with mortality were examined based on registers during a mean of 20 years of follow-up and were adjusted for potential confounders.

Results

Divided into 5 adherence groups, the highest adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet (≥ 23 points) was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67–0.85), cancer mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.92), and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.84) than the lowest adherence (≤ 13 points). Several food components included in the index contributed to the observed reductions in mortality.

Conclusions

We developed a new dietary index to investigate adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. The findings indicate a 25% lower risk of mortality among those with the highest adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet, as defined using our index, which adds to the evidence base for the development of sustainable dietary guidelines.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: part 1) systematic review [^924a3d67]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

See Article The Lancet Oncology 2023; published online March 27th: DOI:This is the first in a Series of two papers on MASCC Clinical Practice Guidelines. (papers 2 appears in The Lancet Oncology)

Despite technological advancements to improve skin dose homogeneity and reduce reaction severity, such as intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and skin-sparing techniques, ARD remains a prominent adverse reaction that can negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL), diminish cosmesis, cause infection or sepsis, and treatment interruptions. Common QoL issues reported in patients with ARD include decreased self-esteem, embarrassment, increased financial burden associated with treatment, pain, and an impaired ability to complete daily activities.

Currently, clinical care for ARD is highly variable due to a lack of standardization in approaches to prevent and manage skin reactions, which hampers the homogeneity of clinical practice recommendations worldwide. In 2013, the Skin Toxicity Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) released a clinical practice guideline in attempt to standardize the care of ARD. While this guideline was valuable to care-providers at the time, it lacked definitive recommendations on ARD care due to a lack of high-quality evidence and therefore received limited uptake in clinical settings. Other guidelines have also been published by institutions, but suffer from similar issues. Therapeutic interventions recommended by these guidelines for both prevention and management include aqueous creams, corticosteroids, and dressings, but a recent narrative review comparing ARD guidelines across cancer institutions revealed significant discrepancies across recommendations, revealing the need for up-to-date, evidence-based guidelines on ARD care. An update to the MASCC ARD guidelines is therefore warranted due to publication of numerous high-quality studies since 2013.

### Biochemical and pain comparisons between the laser lancing device and needle lancets for capillary blood sampling: a randomized control trial [^fd0113b2]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Patients around the world use a lancing device to perform self-monitoring of blood sugar (SMBG). However, there are always fears of needles and pain. Therefore, less painful devices are being developed. The purpose of this study was to compare the usefulness and safety of a laser lancing device (without a needle) to a conventional needle lancet (with a needle) for capillary blood sampling.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A total of 40 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Capillary blood was collected from a laser lancing device (without a needle) and a conventional needle lancet (with a needle) on opposite fingers, the choice of which was randomly selected. The laser lancing device (LMT-3000) uses a 2940nm mono-pulse laser, a radiation field of 350μm, laser energy of 210mJ, and a 3.7V battery. One week later, capillary blood was obtained by switching the devices and fingers. The biochemical measurements and pain were compared between the two groups. Puncture pain was measured on a pain scale from 0 to 10.

Result

All patients were tested with both a laser lancing device and a conventional needle lancet. In the biochemical analysis, the blood glucose level was 103.21 ± 17.20mg/dl in laser lancing device group and 102.25 ± 22.44mg/dl in the conventional needle lancet group, and there were no significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.940). The pH, CO 2, O 2, lactate and hematocrit levels of the blood were no significant differences between the two groups. In the first trial, the median pain score (interquartile range) of patients using laser lancing device was 2.0 (1.0–3.0), whereas it was 2.5 (2.0–4.0) in patients using a conventional needle lancet (P = 0.029). In the second trial, one week later, the median pain score in the laser lancing device group was 2.5 (1.0–4.0), whereas it was 3.5 (2.25–5.0) in the conventional needle lancet group (P = 0.001). The difference in pain scores between the first and second trials was significant in the conventional needle lancet group (P = 0.007), but not in the laser lancing device group (P = 0.150).

Conclusion

There was no difference in biochemical results between the laser lancing device group and the conventional needle lancet group. The laser lancing device demonstrated comparatively lower pain than the conventional needle lancet. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

### The evolution of serious health-related suffering from 1990 to 2021: an update to the Lancet commission on global access to palliative care and pain relief [^5f477818]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Lack of access to palliative care is an opprobrium of global health; it continues to be one of the most neglected and inequitable facets of health systems, despite stark evidence of enormous, preventable global suffering and disparity. Indeed, increasing access to palliative care, a core component of universal health coverage, is essential to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.8 and continues to be a challenge for health systems of countries throughout the world and at all income levels.

In 2017, The Lancet Commissionon global access to palliative care and pain relief developed a measure of the need for palliative care — serious health-related suffering (SHS) — defined as health-related suffering that becomes serious when it cannot be relieved without professional intervention and when it compromises physical, social, spiritual, or emotional functioning. The Commission showed that, each year, tens of millions of people live and die with unrelieved SHS. Yet, more than 80% of individuals with SHS reside in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with little or no access to the palliative care that could reduce their suffering burden. Incorporating the SHS data, researchers projected a near doubling of SHS by 2060, concentrated in LMICs and with the largest rise in low-income countries (LICs), where health systems are least prepared. The Commission produced a blueprint for national and global health systems to develop palliative care policies aligned with the 2014 World Health Assembly resolution that declared palliative care as an essential component of comprehensive health coverage.SHS was also incorporated in the reporting of the International Narcotics Control Board and WHO.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

The Lancet Commission on global access to palliative care and pain relief introduced the concept of serious health-related suffering (SHS) — a novel measure for measuring palliative care need. Using WHO Global Health Estimate data, the Commission reported that over 60 million people had SHS in 2015. The global SHS burden included 25·5 million decedents (45% of all annual deaths) and 35·5 million non-decedents; HIV and cancer accounted for over half of the total cases of SHS. The method developed by the Lancet Commission to measure SHS burden has been applied in subsequent studies. For example, in a 2019 projections paper, Sleeman and colleagues estimated that the number of people who die with SHS (decedents) will increase from 26 million in 2016 to 48 million in 2060.

### Human health and the health of planet earth go together [^fc6f93e3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the planetary health approach was highlighted by the report of The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health in 2015 and changed how we comprehend human well-being. The report advocates integrating the health of other living beings and Earth's natural systems as intrinsic components of human health. Drawing on over three decades of experience in respiratory epidemiology and environmental health, this article outlines how my perspective on human health underwent a transformative shift upon reading the abovementioned report. The planetary health approach offers a lens through which human health issues and potential solutions can be understood within the context of the Anthropocene. It addresses the pressing existential challenges arising from humanity's transgression of planetary limits. Embracing the planetary health paradigm within the field of health sciences can catalyze transformative changes essential for cultivating a sustainable and equitable future.

### Validation of probable COPD as proposed by the Lancet commission at a smoking cessation clinic [^98961c74]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The recently published recommendations of the Lancet Commission, the presence of respiratory symptoms or exacerbation in risky people, and the COPD assessment test (CAT) score ≥ 10 points could be defined as possible COPD without using computed tomography and spirometry, particularly in low-income countries. We aimed to validate this recommendation by spirometry in patients applying to our smoking cessation clinic.

Methods

Subjects aged ≥ 40 years with a smoking history of ≥ 15 pack-years were included in the study. Individuals with known chronic lung diseases, except childhood asthma, were excluded. All participants completed a detailed case report form, including the CAT questionnaire, and underwent spirometry testing.

Results

A total of 224 participants, with a mean age of 53.2 ± 8.7 years of which 49.6% were female, were enrolled in the study. According to the Lancet Commission's definition, 90 participants were identified as having probable COPD. Among these individuals, 21 (23.3%) were also diagnosed with COPD based on the pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. In contrast, out of the 134 subjects, who did not meet the criteria for probable COPD, 12 (9%) were diagnosed with COPD (P = 0.003).

Conclusion

This study is the first pilot study to validate the probable COPD definition recommended by the Lancet Commission using spirometry. Approximately 25% of at-risk patients identified as having probable COPD were diagnosed with COPD based on the pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. Future studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic approach outlined in the algorithm proposed by the Lancet Commission.

### Radiation therapy skin marking with lancets versus electric marking pen (COMFORTATTOO)-6 months results on cosmesis, fading, and patients' satisfaction from a randomized, double-blind trial [^225d3bfa]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Most of radiation oncology centers rely on set-up skin markings for patient setup during treatment delivery. Permanent dark-ink tattooing is the most popular marking method. COMFORTATTOO is a unicentric, randomized trial testing 2 permanent methods: lancets against an electric marking pen (Comfort Marker 2.0, CM). One substudy was undertaken to test if using the CM translates into a cosmesis, fading, or satisfaction benefit compared with the lancets.

Methods and Materials

Patients aged 18 years or older referred to our department to receive RT were recruited. They were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive set-up markings using lancets or CM. This substudy aimed to recruit all the living participants included in the main study. The primary endpoints were tattoos cosmesis, tattoos fading, and patients' satisfaction 6 months after finishing the RT. Cosmetic and fading assessments were scored on a 5-point ascending scale and patients' satisfaction on a 10-point ascending scale. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT05371795).

Results

Between April and September 2022, 92 patients were enrolled (45 assigned to lancets and 47 to CM) and assessed for the outcomes. Patients receiving CM had significantly better cosmetic markings, with a median score of 4.4 (vs 3.7 for lancets, P < .001). On the fading assessment, the CM was associated with lower scores compared with the lancets (median score of 1.3 and 3.3, respectively; P < .001). No differences in patients' satisfaction were observed with either method (median score of 10 for both arms, P = 0.952).

Conclusions

Our substudy results demonstrated that, 6 months after the end of RT, the CM produces better cosmetic markings with less fading compared with the lancets. These differences didn't translate into patients' satisfaction superiority toward any method.

### Ethnicity and gender trends of UK authors inand theover the past two decades: a comprehensive longitudinal analysis [^4d82b70b]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The British Medical Journal (The BMJ), founded in 1840, and the Lancet, founded in 1823, are two of the oldest and most prominent journals in medicine. The Lancet has the highest impact factor of any general medical journal (impact factor [IF] of 202.7), and The BMJ ranks fourth (IF 93.3). Both The BMJ and the Lancet have a large and diverse readership, reaching millions of clinicians, policymakers, researchers, and patients annually. With extensive media coverage and impact, both journals actively influence and guide conversations among all those engaged in patient care and health policy, both in the UK and globally.

In recent years, with the goal of increasing both gender and ethnic diversity in academic authorship, the Lancet announced a Group Diversity Pledge and a No All-Male Panel Policy in 2018. The BMJ has similarly taken steps with No All-Male Panels and launched its first Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Initiatives in 2019. Despite these endeavours to improve gender and ethnic representation, there have been few studies analysing their impact on ethnic diversity, and almost no studies that explore the intersectionality of gender and ethnicity. This is despite the fact that many studies have demonstrated the existence of diversity barriers, along both gender and ethnic lines, to academic authorship. Further, increasing diversity among medical students, residents, and physicians does not correspond with an increasing diversity across academic authorship in most medical specialities; in fact, the opposite trend has been noted to be true.

### The EAT-Lancet diet, genetic susceptibility and risk of atrial fibrillation in a population-based cohort [^fa399267]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a global reference diet with both human health benefits and environmental sustainability in 2019. However, evidence regarding the association of such a diet with the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) is lacking. In addition, whether the genetic risk of AF can modify the effect of diet on AF remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the association of the EAT-Lancet diet with the risk of incident AF and examine the interaction between the EAT-Lancet diet and genetic susceptibility of AF.

Methods

This prospective study included 24,713 Swedish adults who were free of AF, coronary events, and stroke at baseline. Dietary habits were estimated with a modified diet history method, and an EAT-Lancet diet index was constructed to measure the EAT-Lancet reference diet. A weighted genetic risk score was constructed using 134 variants associated with AF. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

During a median follow-up of 22.9 years, 4617 (18.7%) participants were diagnosed with AF. The multivariable HR (95% CI) of AF for the highest versus the lowest group for the EAT-Lancet diet index was 0.84 (0.73, 0.98) (P for trend < 0.01). The HR (95% CI) of AF per one SD increment of the EAT-Lancet diet index for high genetic risk was 0.92 (0.87, 0.98) (P for interaction = 0.15).

Conclusions

Greater adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet index was significantly associated with a lower risk of incident AF. Such association tended to be stronger in participants with higher genetic risk, though gene-diet interaction was not significant.

### Adherence to EAT-Lancet diet, biological aging, and life expectancy in the UK biobank: a cohort study [^71badccb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The EAT-Lancet diet was proposed to nurture human health and support environmental sustainability. However, the interactions between EAT-Lancet diet, biological aging, and life expectancy have not been explored.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the associations of adherence to EAT-Lancet diet pattern with biological aging and life expectancy, as well as the potential modifying effect of genetic susceptibility.

Methods

Data from the UK Biobank cohort study were analyzed. The EAT-Lancet diet index was calculated using 24-h dietary recall data to assess adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were constructed to evaluate genetic risk of biological aging. Multivariable linear regression and flexible parametric survival models were used to investigate the association of EAT-Lancet diet index with biological aging acceleration and with residual life expectancy, respectively. Mediation analysis was used to identify potential mediators.

Results

Among 141,562 included participants (56.02 ± 7.94 y; 45.12% male), those with higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet were significantly associated with a slower pace of biological aging [for Stubbendorff EAT-Lancet diet index: KDM-BA acceleration: -1.37 y, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.51, -1.24; PhenoAge acceleration: -0.93 y, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.86; comparing extreme quartiles, both P < 0.001]. At age 45, participants with the highest adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet also gained 1.13 y of life expectancy than those with the lowest adherence. Similar patterns were observed when we used the Knuppel EAT-Lancet diet index. Adiposity indices, particularly waist-to-height ratio, mediated 29.31%-35.40% of this association. No significant interaction was found between EAT-Lancet diet and genetic risks. The protective effects remained robust in a series of sensitivity analyses and across different subgroups.

Conclusions

Adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet is linked to delayed biological aging and increased life expectancy, regardless of genetic predisposition. This suggests that promoting this sustainable dietary pattern could serve as a practical nutritional strategy for enhancing healthy longevity.

### Human rights and HIV: rhetoric or determinants? [^f8cb2371]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

International donors and UN agencies emphasise the importance of human rights as a key determinant of HIV vulnerability and of access, uptake and retention in HIV prevention and treatment services. Yet, the extent to which HIV researchers are incorporating rights into their research, the specific rights being examined and the frequency of research assessing rights-based approaches, is unknown.

Methods

We examined all articles published in the five highest impact-factor HIV journals: (1) Lancet HIV; (2) AIDS and Behavior; (3) AIDS; (4) Journal of the International AIDS Society (JIAS); and (5) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (JAIDS), between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022, for reference to 'human right(s)' or 'right(s)'. We analysed articles to assess: (1) what populations were identified in relation to specific human rights concerns; (2) what specific rights were mentioned; (3) whether researchers cited specific legal frameworks; and (4) if and what types of rights-based interventions were examined.

Results

Overall, 2.8% (n = 224) of the 8080 articles reviewed included a mention of 'human right(s)' or 'right(s)'. Forty-two per cent of these (n = 94) were original research articles. The most common key population discussed was men who have sex with men (33 articles), followed by sex workers (21 articles) and transgender people (14 articles). Of the 94 articles, 11 mentioned the right to health and nine referenced reproductive rights. Few articles identified a specific authority-whether in national, regional or international law-for the basis of the rights cited. Fourteen articles discussed rights-based interventions.

Conclusion

Despite global recognition of the importance of human rights to HIV outcomes, few HIV researchers publishing in the top five cited HIV journals include attention to human rights, or rights-based interventions, in their research. When rights are mentioned, it is often without specificity or recognition of the legal basis for human rights.

### Key concepts in genetic epidemiology [^55a4a542]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

This article is the first in a series of seven that will provide an overview of central concepts and topical issues in modern genetic epidemiology. In this article, we provide an overall framework for investigating the role of familial factors, especially genetic determinants, in the causation of complex diseases such as diabetes. The discrete steps of the framework to be outlined integrate the biological science underlying modern genetics and the population science underpinning mainstream epidemiology. In keeping with the broad readership of The Lancet and the diverse background of today's genetic epidemiologists, we provide introductory sections to equip readers with basic concepts and vocabulary. We anticipate that, depending on their professional background and specialist knowledge, some readers will wish to skip some of this article.

### Examining the Lancet commission risk factors for dementia using mendelian randomisation [^a4ab96e6]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Method

Study design

GWAS data were available for 10 out of the 12 Lancet Commission risk factors for dementia, and data were not available for traumatic brain injury or pollution. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis was used to investigate potential causal relationships between 10 of the Lancet Commission risk factors for all-cause dementia and 3 different subtypes of dementia: AD (using 4 different GWAS datasets), DLB and FTD. We followed the reporting guidelines provided by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology — Mendelian Randomisation.

Data sources

The current study used publicly available summary statistics and therefore no additional ethics or approvals were required. We searched the GWAS catalogue to find the latest GWAS studies for dementia outcomes and the Lancet Commission risk factors for dementia. Publicly available GWAS summary statistics were obtained for each of the 10 risk factors and the 3 dementia-related outcomes (table 1).

### The EAT-Lancet diet, genetic susceptibility and risk of atrial fibrillation in a population-based cohort [^e3b3aa3c]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In the current study with nearly 30 years of follow-up, we examined the associations of the EAT-Lancet diet index with the risk of AF. We hypothesized that the EAT-Lancet diet index would be associated with a lower risk of AF. In addition, we evaluated the interaction between the EAT-Lancet diet index and genetic susceptibility on the risk of AF and hypothesized that the importance of the EAT-Lancet diet index would differ between those with low, medium, and high genetic susceptibility to AF.

### Prevention of chronic diseases: a call to action [^0cf330d9]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Chronic (non-communicable) diseases — principally cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes — are leading causes of death and disability but are surprisingly neglected elements of the global-health agenda. They are underappreciated as development issues and underestimated as diseases with profound economic effects. Achievement of the global goal for prevention and control of chronic diseases would avert 36 million deaths by 2015 and would have major economic benefits. The main challenge for achievement of the global goal is to show that it can be reached in a cost-effective manner with existing interventions. This series of papers in The Lancet provides evidence that this goal is not only possible but also realistic with a small set of interventions directed towards whole populations and individuals who are at high risk. The total yearly cost of the interventions in 23 low-income and middle-income countries is about US$5.8 billion (as of 2005). In this final paper in the Series we call for a serious and sustained worldwide effort to prevent and control chronic diseases in the context of a general strengthening of health systems. Urgent action is needed by WHO, the World Bank, regional banks and development agencies, foundations, national governments, civil society, non-governmental organisations, the private sector including the pharmaceutical industry, and academics. We have established the Chronic Disease Action Group to encourage, support, and monitor action on the implementation of evidence-based efforts to promote global, regional, and national action to prevent and control chronic diseases.

### Identifying research waste from surgical research: a protocol for assessing compliance with the IDEAL framework and recommendations [^921beb7a]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The Lancet published one of its most provocative Commentaries in 1996 and labelled 'surgical research' as 'comic opera'. This critique was based largely on surgical studies in the early stages. Our study will provide important information about whether compliance with the specific IDEAL Recommendations has reduced research waste in surgical and therapeutic device studies, especially those studies in earlier stages of surgical research. Additionally, we will identify particular aspects of study design, conduct and reporting that need improvement, usefully directing the focus of future education.

To our knowledge, this study is the first study assessing research waste in non-randomised studies and will include all specialties and all stage of the life cycle (from innovation to long-term follow-up), which should lead to better generalisability of the findings.

There are some limitations in this study. First, of the five key elements of research waste in the Lancet series, we are not able to assess waste due to failure to identify the research priority, research management issues and lack of fully accessible research, because published reports contain no information about these problems. Our methodological study, therefore, focuses on avoidable design, conduct and reporting errors. Second, our study is based on published information only, and may not reflect the actual implementation of surgical research.

### Top 50 cited articles on COVID-19 after the first year of the pandemic: a bibliometric analysis [^e57a1948]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

It has been just over a year since the Covid-19 pandemic started. The top 50 cited articles on this subject would help identify trends and focus on the research efforts.

Methods

We utilised e-utilities in PubMed to find publications on Covid-19 until the date of search on 7/2/21. The iCite website was used to find the top 50 citations of the output from the search strategy. We looked into their full text for the editorial dates, type of study, level of evidence, focus of the article and country of origin. We also counted the errata and comments on each of them.

Results

The total number of citations of all 50 articles was 123,960, the highest being 10, 754 for a single article. Huang C was the most cited first author. They were published from week 4–17, with February being the month with most citations. Lancet was the most cited journal, having published 9 of the 50 articles. Majority belonged to level 3 of the evidence ladder and were retrospective studies. Thirty percent of them had an errata published and an average of 7 comments per article.

Conclusion

The top 50 most cited articles identify the most impactful studies on Covid-19, providing a resource to educators while identifying trends to guide research and publishing efforts. There has been an explosion of publications and an unprecedented rate and number of citations within the first year for any single condition in the literature.

### Specification curve analysis to identify heterogeneity in risk factors for dementia: findings from the UK biobank [^cc87871d]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2020, the Lancet Commission identified 12 risk factors as priorities for prevention of dementia, and other studies identified APOE e4/e4 genotype and family history of Alzheimer's disease strongly associated with dementia outcomes; however, it is unclear how robust these relationships are across dementia subtypes and analytic scenarios. Specification curve analysis (SCA) is a new tool to probe how plausible analytical scenarios influence outcomes.

Methods

We evaluated the heterogeneity of odds ratios for 12 risk factors reported from the Lancet 2020 report and two additional strong associated non-modifiable factors (APOE e4/e4 genotype and family history of Alzheimer's disease) with dementia outcomes across 450,707 UK Biobank participants using SCA with 5357 specifications across dementia subtypes (outcomes) and analytic models (e.g., standard demographic covariates such as age or sex and/or 14 correlated risk factors).

Results

SCA revealed variable dementia risks by subtype and age, with associations for TBI and APOE e4/e4 robust to model specification; in contrast, diabetes showed fluctuating links with dementia subtypes. We found that unattributed dementia participants had similar risk factor profiles to participants with defined subtypes.

Conclusions

We observed heterogeneity in the risk of dementia, and estimates of risk were influenced by the inclusion of a combination of other modifiable risk factors; non-modifiable demographic factors had a minimal role in analytic heterogeneity. Future studies should report multiple plausible analytic scenarios to test the robustness of their association. Considering these combinations of risk factors could be advantageous for the clinical development and evaluation of novel screening models for different types of dementia.

### The 2024 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: facing record-breaking threats from delayed action [^a2244234]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Indicator 5.3.2: scientific engagement with the health impacts of climate change — headline finding: 31% of the 54 414 studies published on health impacts of climate variables as of 2023 focus on cases in which changes in climate variables can be attributed to human influence, up by 117% from 2016

Increasing the understanding of the health impacts of anthropogenic climate change is essential for the characterisation of health risks and design of efficient measures to protect and promote health. This indicator tracks the number of scientific studies of the health effects of changes in climate variables in cases in which the changes in those variables can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change.

The cumulative number of articles identified in the chosen databases, which studied events in which changes in the climate variables driving health effects can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, increased by 117% from the cumulative total as of 2016 (7806) to the total as of 2023 (16 926). However, as a proportion of all articles covering the health impact of climate variables, the proportion of articles studying events in which change in the climate variable driving the health effects can be partially attributable to climate change (hereafter referred to as partially attributable studies) remained largely constant, at 30% (of 25 761) in 2016 and 31% (of 54 414) in 2023. The most common health outcome across all studies published as of 2023 was infectious disease (32% of studies). However, there have been rapid increases in the cumulative number of studies of mental health (210% increase) and water security (217% increase) since 2016, with these topics reaching 9% and 5%, respectively, of all partially attributable studies published as of 2023. Inequalities in terms of the locations of these partially attributable studies persist. Across all publication years, there were 6·6 studies per million people in very high HDI countries and 2·1 studies per million people in high HDI countries, whereas there were 1·5 studies per million people in both medium and low HDI countries. Importantly, 88·0% of first author affiliations were from countries with a very high (63·8%) or high HDI (24·2%), with just 12·0% from countries with a medium (8·2%) or low (4·0%) HDI. These data reflect how scientific research on health and climate change remains heavily dominated by researchers in very high HDI countries and expose the under-representation of researchers from the countries that are most heavily affected by the health impacts of climate change.

### Challenges and opportunities for educating health professionals after the COVID-19 pandemic [^87f5c9fe]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The education of health professionals substantially changed before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2010 Lancet Commission examined the 100-year history of health-professional education, beginning with the 1910 Flexner report. Since the publication of the Lancet Commission, several transformative developments have happened, including in competency-based education, interprofessional education, and the large-scale application of information technology to education. Although the COVID-19 pandemic did not initiate these developments, it increased their implementation, and they are likely to have a long-term effect on health-professional education. They converge with other societal changes, such as globalisation of health care and increasing concerns of health disparities across the world, that were exacerbated by the pandemic. In this Health Policy, we list institutional and instructional reforms to assess what has happened to health-professional education since the publication of the Lancet Commission and how the COVID-19 pandemic altered the education process.

### Effect of editors' implementation of CONSORT guidelines on the reporting of abstracts in high impact medical journals: interrupted time series analysis [^7f5c65e9]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study evaluated the effect of journals' editorial policy to implement the CONSORT extension for abstracts guidelines on the reporting quality of abstracts of randomised trials published in five high impact, general medical journals. After publication of the guidelines in January 2008, we identified a significant increase in the reporting of key items in the two journals (Annals of Internal Medicine, and Lancet) that endorsed the guidelines in their instructions to authors and that had an active editorial policy to implement them. By comparison, we observed no significant difference in the one journal (BMJ) that endorsed the guidelines but did not have an active implementation strategy, and in the two journals (JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine) that did not endorse the guidelines in their instructions to authors.

### A comparative study of the EAT-Lancet diet and the mediterranean diet in relation to neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive performance [^49b47f5c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of the sustainable EAT-Lancet planetary health diet on brain and cognitive health remains unclear. This study compared the impact of the EAT-Lancet diet with the well-established cognitive-beneficial Mediterranean diet (MeDi) in relation to neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive performance among older adults.

Methods

The study included 615 dementia-free 70-year-olds from the Swedish population-based Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort study. Dietary adherence was measured with EAT-Lancet diet and MeDi scores. Neuroimaging measures included cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, small vessel disease, and deep learning-derived brain age. Cognitive performance was assessed with a global cognitive composite score.

Results

In multi-adjusted models, higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet was associated with higher total mean cortical thickness, and thicker cortex in Alzheimer's disease-signature regions, while a higher adherence to the MeDi was associated with better cognitive performance.

Discussion

The results indicate the beneficial effects of both the EAT-Lancet and the MeDi on brain health.

Highlights

There were no indications of detrimental effects of adhering to the EAT-Lancet diet. Adhering to the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet was associated with thicker cortex. Results confirm links between the Mediterranean diet and better cognitive function.

### Higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet is inversely associated with mortality in a UK population of cancer survivors [^aed01612]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Significant advancements in treatment and care, as well as early detection, have contributed to an increase in cancer survival rates. Recently, the EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health proposed the "planetary health diet" but to date, no study has investigated the potential associations between adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet and mortality in cancer survivors. To determine whether higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet is associated with lower risk for all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality in cancer survivors.

Methods

Data from the prospective UK Biobank study were used. Information from UK Biobank's Touchscreen questionnaire was used to develop a score reflecting adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of the EAT-Lancet reference diet score with all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality in cancer survivors.

Results

Within 25,348 cancer survivors, better adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet was inversely related to all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95–0.99), 1 unit increase) and cancer mortality (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96–1.00), while mostly null associations were observed for major cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.95–1.03).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest the adoption of the EAT-Lancet reference diet is associated with lower all-cause and cancer-specific mortality among cancer survivors.

### Development of an EAT-Lancet index and its relation to mortality in a Swedish population [^67e77ddd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

EAT-Lancet index

We developed an index to validate the EAT-Lancet diet regarding its association with mortality. The EAT-Lancet diet consists of food components for which defined target intake levels and reference intervals (ranges) are suggested (Supplemental Table 1). The reference intervals are described as uncertainty ranges and are considered to be compatible with optimal health in different populations. In this study, food components were classified as either "emphasized foods" or "limited foods" based on previous descriptions of the EAT-Lancet diet. Emphasized food components were vegetables, fruits, unsaturated oils, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and fish. Food components classified as limited were beef and lamb, pork, poultry, eggs, dairy, potatoes, and added sugar. Dietary intakes were evaluated based on reported amounts in grams per day in uncooked weight, which is in line with how the target intake levels are expressed in the EAT-Lancet diet (see details of included food components in Supplemental Table 2). Our index consists of the 14 food components, with a possible range of 0–3 points for each component; 0 points indicates low adherence to the target for the food component in the EAT-Lancet diet and 3 points indicates high adherence, as described in Table 1. The total possible score range of the developed index is 0 (nonadherence) to 42 points (perfect adherence = 14 × 3 points).

### The Lancet global health commission on global eye health: vision beyond 2020 [^71c15792]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Vision impairment and mortality

Vision impairment seems to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Several explanations are possible for this association in relation to non-communicable eye diseases, mental health, and injuries (figure 5). This Commission did a systematic review and meta-analysis to contribute an updated appraisal of the literature, assessment of bias, and overall grading of the quality of evidence (appendix 1 p 24). We included studies that measured visual acuity and contained at least 1-year follow-up to assess all-cause mortality. A total of 28 studies representing 30 cohorts were included. Studies came from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America and included 451 001 participants.

The primary meta-analysis included studies comparing mortality among participants with vision better or worse than the prespecified thresholds of 6/12, 6/18, and 6/60. Since age is a common risk factor for vision impairment and mortality, all measures of association in this meta-analysis were age-adjusted. Where available, we also selected estimates adjusted for other possible confounders such as smoking, diabetes, access to health care, and socioeconomic status. Figure 6 presents the results of this analysis. We found that the hazard of mortality was higher among those with visual acuity < 6/12 (hazard ratio [HR] 1·29, 95% CI 1·20–1·39) and < 6/18 (1·43, 1·22–1·68) compared to those with better vision. At the 6/60 threshold, the hazard of mortality was higher than for those with visual acuity of ≥ 6/18 (1·89, 1·45–2·47). However, no significant association was detected when comparing those with visual acuity better and worse than 6/60 (1·02, 0·79–1·32), probably because the reference group contained participants with a substantial degree of vision impairment (≥ 6/60). We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and judged it to be of moderate certainty. Additional research is needed to better understand factors that modulate mortality risk among adults with vision impairment, and to more fully characterise risk in LMICs, where data remain scarce. Given the prevailing finding of an association between vision impairment and mortality, future calculations of disability-adjusted life-years might include years of life lost due to vision impairment, which could provide a more complete estimate of the overall global burden of vision impairment. The impact of vision impairment on mortality should drive action to address avoidable sight loss and reinforces the relevance of eye health to SDG3 (good health and wellbeing) and the SDGs in general.

### Warped speed: how COVID-19 transfected and transformed medical journals [^eca1d02a]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

The Need for Speed

As journals evolved and expanded, journal editors recognized that to continue to flourish and maintain market share, they needed to have a broader appeal to their readership that extended beyond publishing scientific articles, which led to journals to publish timely reviews and letters that informed the readership on the latest developments in their respective fields. Indeed, Sir Theodore ("Robbie") Fox, the prolific and transformative editor of the Lancet (1944 to 1964) would often refer to the Lancet as a newspaper. Pari passu with the transition of journals from being a gateway for reporting the latest scientific articles to providing timely newsworthy content to their readers, in the 1990s, journals also began to simultaneously publish articles on late-breaking clinical trials that were being presented at national meetings. Whereas the New England Journal of Medicine has been always been particularly adept at attracting topline clinical trials presented at national meetings, it is important to note that all of the major journals adopted this practice to remain competitive within this specific journalistic space. As noted by Larry Husten, a veteran journalist who has covered cardiology news for decades, "simultaneous publication… brings a lot of benefits, including more rigorous peer review and superior and more widespread availability of trial results. Reducing the time between initial presentation and publication helps shorten the gap between the acquisition of new knowledge and its application to clinical practice". However, Husten also notes that simultaneous publication of clinical trials has "unintended consequences", including "the publication barrier seems to be far lower when a trial is published simultaneously at a major medical meeting". He also states that clinical trialists have confided to him that "compared to non-meeting related publications, the peer review process will be both less rigorous and less prolonged". Although hard data are lacking with respect to whether the peer review process is actually less rigorous for articles that are submitted for simultaneous publications, the editorial process surrounding late-breaking clinical trials changed and became more streamlined, given the competing pressures imposed by the abbreviated time frames for peer review, for statistical review, for editorial oversight, and for generation of fully formatted articles that were available online at the time of the presentation at a meeting. Whereas journals have been remarkably successful at accomplishing these tasks year after year, the need for speed in publishing changed the way in which the editorial process works, which laid the groundwork, at least in part, for the way for the way in which journals have faced the challenges imposed by COVD-19.

### Health journal coverage of climate change and health: a bibliometric study [^e6209eb9]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

A limitation of our study is that we have not been able to examine the types of articles published, so our study does not differentiate between research articles and editorials, comments, news, letters and other types of articles. We know that only 46% of the articles had abstracts, which suggests that fewer than half of the articles were research studies. We know too that funding for research on climate change and health has been slow to become available, meaning that early articles — those before 2010 — were likely to be editorials and comments rather than research. This may also explain why particular journals have published more — for instance, both the Lancet and The BMJ publish news.

Nor do we know the themes of the articles, but we know from the Lancet Countdownthat the majority of articles published have been about the impact of climate change on health, far fewer on mitigating the effects of climate change, and fewer still on adapting to the changes that have already happened. Almost no articles so far have been on decarbonising health systems.

Another limitation of the study may have been unconscious bias as several of the authors were linked with the BMJ and the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change (see the Competing interest section).

Study implications

Why have most health journals published little or nothing on climate change and health?

Despite climate change being predicted in the 19th century, detectable effects occurring by the 80s, and the first Earth Summit being held in 1992, few articles on climate change and health appeared in health journals until the 2000s. Indeed, despite climate change being identified as the major threat to global health, by 2022 about a quarter of health journals in our sample had published nothing on climate change and health and almost three quarters had published five or fewer articles.

Why have health journals been so slow? There are almost certainly multiple reasons.

One answer might be that almost everybody has been slow. Although the serious threat of climate change has long been identified, emissions of greenhouse gases are still rising. The annual UN meeting on climate change, COP, featured health in the main agenda for the first time only in 2023. Of course, the policymakers may have been slow because health scientists have been slow.

### Challenges and opportunities in developing integrated sexual and reproductive health programmes [^b9044507]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sexual and reproductive health and rights are fundamental to both human and societal wellbeing and sustainable development, and encompass a broad array of sociocultural and clinical issues that affect all people across the life course. In 2018, the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission described sexual and reproductive health as a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social wellbeing in relation to all aspects of sexuality and reproduction, not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity. The Commission advocated for a positive approach to sexuality and reproduction that recognises the role of pleasurable sexual relationships, trust, and communication in promoting self-esteem and overall wellbeing. The Commission also stipulated that people have a right to make decisions governing their bodies and to access services that support that right. In light of recent sociocultural changes, biomedical advances that have impacted sexual and reproductive health and rights, and the key findings of the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission, we bring together themes from this Lancet Series to discuss the new scientific developments and sociopolitical changes that affect the programmatic integration of sexual and reproductive health services. As people who present for one sexual and reproductive health service frequently have other unmet sexual and reproductive health-related needs, there are often benefits to interventions and services that address multiple connected sexual and reproductive health issues during one clinical encounter (eg, family planning visits, including testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections), which supports the rationale for an integrated approach. Historically, key components of sexual and reproductive health have been managed separately, partly because of siloed and inadequate funding streams and structural limitations (eg, separate location of service delivery or insufficient staff cross-training). Vertical methods have also evolved from the need for different approaches to reach key populations, who might be reluctant to seek care from primary health care clinics. We build on the findings of the papers in this Series to discuss the rationale for sexual and reproductive health programmatic integration, which has the potential to better engage patients in care by meeting their preferences, simplify the user experience, and save resources when implemented in a thoughtful, culturally tailored manner. However, wide-scale sexual and reproductive health programmatic integration faces multiple challenges, requiring broadly trained health-care providers, a range of clinical and outreach channels, and well-resourced health systems. Programmatic integration might be further constrained by societal norms and regulations (eg, punitive laws, institutional homophobia, legal restrictions on access to safe abortion, and opposition to sexual and reproductive rights). Notably, the Trump Administration's withdrawal of support from various sexual and reproductive health programmes in January, 2025, is a major threat to continued progress. This Series paper provides a call to action based on the key findings from this Series that delineates the steps needed to better integrate programmes to optimise sexual and reproductive health outcomes.

### 2024 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures [^6dd8a9a8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

2.8.2 Modifiable risk factors

Although age, genetics and family history cannot be changed, some risk factors can be changed or modified to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Examples of modifiable risk factors are physical activity, smoking, education, staying socially and mentally active, blood pressure and diet. In fact, The Lancet Commission report on dementia prevention, intervention and care suggests that up to 40% of dementia cases may be attributable to modifiable risk factors. A 2022 study found that nearly 37% of cases of dementia in the United States were associated with eight modifiable risk factors, the most common being midlife obesity, followed by physical inactivity and low educational attainment.

In addition to The Lancet Commission report, a number of other influential reports point to the promising role of addressing these factors to reduce risk of dementia and cognitive decline. These include the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia and a report from the National Academy of Medicine. There are many potentially modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease — too many to discuss in a single report. This section focuses on some of the modifiable risk factors with substantial supportive evidence identified in The Lancet Commission report, the WHO recommendations and the National Academy of Medicine report.

As mentioned earlier, most people living with dementia have the brain changes of Alzheimer's disease as well as another form of dementia (see mixed dementia), and it can be difficult to tell which brain changes are the cause of dementia. As a result, research linking risk factors to dementia is often assumed to support a link between risk factors and Alzheimer's disease. However, additional research is needed to disentangle risk factors that are specific to Alzheimer's disease from those that are specific to other causes of dementia.

### Ethnicity and gender trends of UK authors inand theover the past two decades: a comprehensive longitudinal analysis [^7933598e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

While gender equity among academic authors has been extensively investigated, there is a significant gap in our understanding of racial/ethnic authorship trends, despite the recognition of barriers to authorship along both ethnic and gender lines. Leveraging the meta-data for all articles published in The British Medical Journal (The BMJ) and the Lancet and between 2002 and 2022 (inclusive), we explore demographic trends among UK academic medicine authors in two of the world's leading British medical journals.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed's MEDLINE for all articles published in The BMJ and Lancet between January 1st 2002 and December 31st 2022. Filtering for articles with a UK affiliation, we predicted gender using a publicly-validated name-to-gender dictionary, while data was analysed to explore and investigate ethnicity using the Consumer Data Research Centre's (CDRC) Ethnicity Estimator. Data was analysed to explore and investigate: (a) the proportion of female/male author publications, (b) the proportion of the various UK author ethnicity groups, and (c) the overlap/intersection between gender and ethnic identities among first and last authors. This comprehensive longitudinal analysis was conducted on 82,143 articles (51,209 from The BMJ and 30,934 from the Lancet) which represents > 97% of all published articles between 2002 and 2022. As we sought to understand how academic authorship reflects the diversity of the UK population, we limited our analysis to first and last authors who had a UK affiliation and excluded "news" and "comments" pieces (16,736 articles for The BMJ and 4678 articles from the Lancet). The main outcome measures were the trends in first and last authorship demographics of academic medicine, focusing on the proportion of female/male authors, ethnicity and their intersectionality.

Findings

Our findings show that, while women have made substantial headway towards equity among first and last authorship in The BMJ (peaking at 42% and 43%), they remain under-represented in the Lancet (35% and 27%). In both The BMJ and Lancet, Black authors have remained severely under-represented as both first and last authors (below 1% for most of the two decades), while Asian authors have increased proportionally to match their fraction in the general population (ranging from 2 to 10%).

Interpretation

Analysis over the past two decades has shown that the gender author gap is decreasing quickly in The BMJ and Lancet. However, despite the two journals' growing focus on structural inequalities in medical academia, little progress has been made in rectifying the large gap between White British authors and other ethnic groups, especially Black authors. Without more awareness, diversity initiatives which have resulted in positive gains for White women do not seem to translate well for authors of colour.

Funding

None.

### The association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and cognitive ageing [^ea36548a]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous research on the EAT-Lancet diet in relation to other health outcomes with shared aetiology as cognitive ageing further substantiates our findings. Higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet has been associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in three European cohorts, though not in a cohort of Mexican women. In addition, the EAT-Lancet diet seems beneficial for cardiovascular health as higher adherence to the diet has been associated with lower risk of coronary events, cardiovascular disease, subarachnoid stroke, and improved cardiometabolic markers including blood pressure and cholesterol. However, two studies showed a null association with cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, higher scores on the EAT-Lancet diet were associated with favourable obesity outcomes, as measured by BMI and waist circumference.

From the perspective of nutrient composition, a positive link between the EAT-Lancet diet and cognitive ageing is conceivable. The EAT-Lancet diet is plant-focused and delivers various plant nutrients including carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamin E, and some B-vitamins. These nutrients have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, via which they can support healthy brain ageing. Importantly, the EAT-Lancet diet also recommends consumption of fish and does not completely restrict consumption of other animal foods, thus providing the brain with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B 12. Omega-3 fatty acids contribute to healthy brain ageing due to their anti-inflammatory and vascular health promoting properties. In addition, they are an important structural component of the brain. Vitamin B 12, together with folic acid and vitamin B 6, prevent homocysteine accumulation and thereby help lower the risk of dementia.

However, while the EAT-Lancet diet does contain all nutrients required for healthy brain ageing, concerns have been raised if the diet supplies some of these nutrients in adequate amounts.

The first nutrient of concern is vitamin B 12. According to the original EAT-Lancet diet publication, adopting the EAT-Lancet diet would improve intake of all nutrients but vitamin B 12. Similarly, a nutrient adequacy analysis confirmed that the EAT-Lancet diet does not provide enough vitamin B 12, with estimated intake being 93% of recommended nutrient intake. Vitamin B 12 is not only of great importance for brain health, but also for bone health. The lack of vitamin B 12 is especially of concern for the ageing population, as vitamin B 12 absorption decreases with age and can be compromised with use of certain medications.

### Hip and knee arthroplasty orthopedic literature in medical journals-is It negatively biased? [^b4a9844a]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Healthcare policy is often determined by well-designed studies most often published in high-impact medical journals. However, concern about the presence of publication bias against lower-extremity arthroplasty-related studies has called into question some of the validity of certain reports. There are only a few studies investigating the presence of the bias in high-impact medical journals against lower-extremity arthroplasty intervention, particularly in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA), New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and the Lancet. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess (1) the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative results; (2) the number of reports focused on lower-extremity arthroplasty complications among these 3 journals; and (3) difference in bias between 2 time periods (1975 to 1990 and 2000 to 2016).

Methods

A review of the literature from 3 major medical journals (NEJM, Lancet, and JAMA) was performed using PubMed electronic databases, which retrieved articles between January 1976 and December 2016. Studies were categorized as being positive, neutral, and negatively biased by 2 reviewers. Studies were categorized as reporting on lower-extremity arthroplasty-related complications if they were based on complications including deep vein thrombosis, infection, metal-related complication, fat embolism, readmission, or mortality. In addition, we have compared the journal bias between 2 different time points (1975 to 1990 and 2000 to 2016). Descriptive analyses were performed to assess frequencies. Chi-squared analysis was conducted for categorical variables, whereas a z-test was performed for dichotomous data.

Results

When assessing all 3 journals, there were 46 positive (30.3%), 46 negative (30.3%), and 60 neutral reports (39.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in classification proportions between the 3 groups (P = 0.905). There was a higher percentage of medical literature reporting on the complications of arthroplasty (55.9%); however, this was not statistically significant (z-score = 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.64; P = 0.17). There was no difference in overall journal reporting between 1975 to 1990 and 2000 to 2016 (P = 0.548).

Conclusion

There was no evidence of publication bias of lower-extremity arthroplasty reports in the major medical journals (JAMA, NEJM, and Lancet). However, there were more published studies reporting on complications of lower-extremity arthroplasty. This may be due to systematic bias among journal editors in these journals, or due to low journal submission reporting noncomplications after arthroplasty intervention. We did not find the time period to be a factor in bias reporting of orthopedic literature in major medical journals. More work is needed to verify the results of this study.

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional recovery after acute stroke (EFFECTS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^d928ecee]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The study EFFECTS was published by EFFECTS Trial Collaboration. and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage and Acute ischemic stroke. In the EFFECTS study, the trial question was: what is the role of fluoxetine in patients with acute stroke? In the EFFECTS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EFFECTS study, the population was: 1500 patients (575 female, 925 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage in the previous 2–15 days. The key exclusion criteria were primary subarachnoid hemorrhage; epileptic seizures; unavailable for follow-up for next 12 months; previous drug overdose or attempted suicide; ongoing depression. In the EFFECTS study, the interventions were: n = 750 fluoxetine (an oral dose of 20 mg/day for 6 months) n = 750 placebo (matching placebo for 6 months). In the EFFECTS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in physical function as measured by the stroke impact scale score (76.7 points vs. 77.4 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -6.06 to 4.66). In the EFFECTS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in memory as measured by the stroke impact scale score (89.3 points vs. 92.9 points; AD -3.6 points, 95% CI -6.19 to -1.01) Borderline significant increase in NIHSS (1 point vs. 1 point;). In the EFFECTS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, new stroke, thrombotic events, bleeding events. significant differences in new depression (7% vs. 11%), bone fractures (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (1% vs. < 1%) at 6 months. In the EFFECTS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage in the previous 2–15 days, fluoxetine was not superior to placebo with respect to physical function as measured by the stroke impact scale score.

### High reprint orders in medical journals and pharmaceutical industry funding: case-control study [^7ac166b8]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

Journal responses

Only the Lancet Group and BMJ Group responded to the request for data, providing the top 20 reprint articles each year for the Lancet and BMJ, top 10 reprint articles each year for Heart, Gut, and the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, and the top five reprint articles each year for Lancet Neurology and Lancet Oncology.

Lancet initially provided data from 2002 to 2009, and thus for consistency data were requested for this period from the other journals and used in all analyses.

Reprint orders

Table 1 shows the average reprint orders for the top reprinted articles by journal. Lancet had by far the highest median number of reprints, with a median order of 126 350 for its high reprint group (range 24 000–835 100). The BMJ and Lancet Oncology had median reprint orders greater than 10 000 (13 248 and 10 500, respectively), whereas the other journals had median reprint orders of 5200 or less. Notably, 62.3% of reprint orders in Lancet were in excess of 100 000 copies, higher than the 24% found by other researchers. Table 2gives the proportion of all reprint orders in excess of 100 000 copies.

### Does cancer literature reflect multidisciplinary practice? A systematic review of oncology studies in the medical literature over a 20-year period [^dde1d705]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Quality cancer care is best delivered through a multidisciplinary approach requiring awareness of current evidence for all oncologic specialties. The highest impact journals often disseminate such information, so the distribution and characteristics of oncology studies by primary intervention (local therapies, systemic therapies, and targeted agents) were evaluated in 10 high-impact journals over a 20-year period.

Methods and Materials

Articles published in 1994, 2004, and 2014 in New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet Oncology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Annals of Oncology, Radiotherapy and Oncology, International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, Annals of Surgical Oncology, and European Journal of Surgical Oncology were identified. Included studies were prospectively conducted and evaluated a therapeutic intervention.

Results

A total of 960 studies were included: 240 (25%) investigated local therapies, 551 (57.4%) investigated systemic therapies, and 169 (17.6%) investigated targeted therapies. More local therapy trials (n = 185 [77.1%]) evaluated definitive, primary treatment than systemic (n = 178 [32.3%]) or targeted therapy trials (n = 38 [22.5%]; P < .001). Local therapy trials (n = 16 [6.7%]) also had significantly lower rates of industry funding than systemic (n = 207 [37.6%]) and targeted therapy trials (n = 129 [76.3%]; P < .001). Targeted therapy trials represented 5 (2%), 38 (10.2%), and 126 (38%) of those published in 1994, 2004, and 2014, respectively (P < .001), and industry-funded 48 (18.9%), 122 (32.6%), and 182 (54.8%) trials, respectively (P < .001). Compared to publication of systemic therapy trial articles, articles investigating local therapy (odds ratio: 0.025 [95% confidence interval: 0.012–0.048]; P < .001) were less likely to be found in high-impact general medical journals.

Conclusions

Fewer studies evaluating local therapies, such as surgery and radiation, are published in high-impact oncology and medicine literature. Further research and attention are necessary to guide efforts promoting appropriate representation of all oncology studies in high-impact, broad-readership journals.

### AAP perspective: race-based medicine [^c2c4e995]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) perspective — race-based medicine: Race is not a biological category that produces health disparities due to genetic differences; rather, it is a social category that can have devastating biological consequences, and race should not be viewed as a risk factor that predicts disease, disease severity, and disability but as a risk marker of bias, discrimination, and vulnerability. In 2019, the AAP cautioned against false notions of racial biology and named racism as a social determinant of health with a profound impact on the health status of children, adolescents, emerging adults, and their families; the policy denounces race-based medicine as flawed science and cautions that "failure to address racism will continue to undermine health equity". In a viewpoint published in the October 2020 issue of The Lancet, Cerdeña et al describe race-based medicine as a system by which research characterising race as an essential, biological variable translates into clinical practice leading to inequitable care, name racism, rather than race, as a key determinant of health, and propose introducing "race-conscious" medicine as an alternative.

### Patchy progress on obesity prevention: emerging examples, entrenched barriers, and new thinking [^1feb6fd9]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Despite isolated areas of improvement, no country to date has reversed its obesity epidemic. Governments, together with a broad range of stakeholders, need to act urgently to decrease the prevalence of obesity. In this Series paper, we review several regulatory and non-regulatory actions taken around the world to address obesity and discuss some of the reasons for the scarce and fitful progress. Additionally, we preview the papers in this Lancet Series, which each identify high-priority actions on key obesity issues and challenge some of the entrenched dichotomies that dominate the thinking about obesity and its solutions. Although obesity is acknowledged as a complex issue, many debates about its causes and solutions are centred around overly simple dichotomies that present seemingly competing perspectives. Examples of such dichotomies explored in this Series include personal versus collective responsibilities for actions, supply versus demand-type explanations for consumption of unhealthy food, government regulation versus industry self-regulation, top-down versus bottom-up drivers for change, treatment versus prevention priorities, and a focus on undernutrition versus overnutrition. We also explore the dichotomy of individual versus environmental drivers of obesity and conclude that people bear some personal responsibility for their health, but environmental factors can readily support or undermine the ability of people to act in their own self-interest. We propose a reframing of obesity that emphasises the reciprocal nature of the interaction between the environment and the individual. Today's food environments exploit people's biological, psychological, social, and economic vulnerabilities, making it easier for them to eat unhealthy foods. This reinforces preferences and demands for foods of poor nutritional quality, furthering the unhealthy food environments. Regulatory actions from governments and increased efforts from industry and civil society will be necessary to break these vicious cycles.

### Adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and incident depression and anxiety [^96c56a93]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

High-quality diets have been increasingly acknowledged as a promising candidate to counter the growing prevalence of mental health disorders. This study aims to investigate the prospective associations of adhering to the EAT-Lancet reference diet with incident depression, anxiety and their co-occurrence in 180,446 UK Biobank participants. Degrees of adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet were translated into three different diet scores. Over 11.62 years of follow-up, participants in the highest adherence group of the Knuppel EAT-Lancet index showed lower risks of depression (hazard ratio: 0.806, 95% CI: 0.730–0.890), anxiety (0.818, 0.751–0.892) and their co-occurrence (0.756, 0.624–0.914), compared to the lowest adherence group. The corresponding hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 0.711 (0.627–0.806), 0.765 (0.687–0.852) and 0.659 (0.516–0.841) for the Stubbendorff EAT-Lancet index, and 0.844 (0.768–0.928), 0.825 (0.759–0.896) and 0.818 (0.682–0.981) for the Kesse-Guyot EAT-Lancet diet index. Our findings suggest that higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet is associated with lower risks of incident depression, anxiety and their co-occurrence.

### Evaluation of data sharing after implementation of the international committee of medical journal editors data sharing statement requirement [^bba96ccb]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The benefits of responsible sharing of individual-participant data (IPD) from clinical studies are well recognized, but stakeholders often disagree on how to align those benefits with privacy risks, costs, and incentives for clinical trialists and sponsors. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) required a data sharing statement (DSS) from submissions reporting clinical trials effective July 1, 2018. The required DSSs provide a window into current data sharing rates, practices, and norms among trialists and sponsors.

Objective

To evaluate the implementation of the ICMJE DSS requirement in 3 leading medical journals: JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cross-sectional study of clinical trial reports published as articles in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM between July 1, 2018, and April 4, 2020. Articles not eligible for DSS, including observational studies and letters or correspondence, were excluded. A MEDLINE/PubMed search identified 487 eligible clinical trials in JAMA (112 trials), Lancet (147 trials), and NEJM (228 trials). Two reviewers evaluated each of the 487 articles independently.

Exposure

Publication of clinical trial reports in an ICMJE medical journal requiring a DSS.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes of the study were declared data availability and actual data availability in repositories. Other captured outcomes were data type, access, and conditions and reasons for data availability or unavailability. Associations with funding sources were examined.

Results

A total of 334 of 487 articles (68.6%; 95% CI, 64%-73%) declared data sharing, with nonindustry NIH-funded trials exhibiting the highest rates of declared data sharing (89%; 95% CI, 80%-98%) and industry-funded trials the lowest (61%; 95% CI, 54%-68%). However, only 2 IPD sets (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.0%-1.5%) were actually deidentified and publicly available as of April 10, 2020. The remaining were supposedly accessible via request to authors (143 of 334 articles [42.8%]), repository (89 of 334 articles [26.6%]), and company (78 of 334 articles [23.4%]). Among the 89 articles declaring that IPD would be stored in repositories, only 17 (19.1%) deposited data, mostly because of embargo and regulatory approval. Embargo was set in 47.3% of data-sharing articles (158 of 334), and in half of them the period exceeded 1 year or was unspecified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most trials published in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM after the implementation of the ICMJE policy declared their intent to make clinical data available. However, a wide gap between declared and actual data sharing exists. To improve transparency and data reuse, journals should promote the use of unique pointers to data set location and standardized choices for embargo periods and access requirements.

### Authority and medical expertise: arthur conan doyle in… [^495c5f58]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Recognising medical expertise and authority

Questions of authority and expertise are evident in developments in the medical profession towards the end of the nineteenth century, in particular those developments affecting all manner of professional relationships. The professional structure of medicine crystalised during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Following the Medical Act of 1858, which created the General Medical Council and initiated the registration of qualified medical practitioners, the separate groups of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries further cohered as medicine evolved from a dependent occupation to a profession with its own authority towards the turn of the century. The development most pertinent to my discussion was the changing relationship between the medical practitioners and their patients as medicine evolved. There was a distancing of medical practice from associations with trade, although many starting out in medicine found that economics 'was nevertheless the bottom line in professional survival' (, 4); there was also an emphasis on demonstrative professional courtesy and an attendant retreat of medical self-criticism from the public eye and thus public judgement (, 250–55). Yet medical practitioners depended financially on maintaining good relationships with the public and this public was nonetheless interested in and familiar with medical developments. These relationships were complex, often mediated by the press.details the development of nineteenth-century medical periodicals and finds that the end of the century saw both specialised publications (by their nature distanced from laymen) and journals that aimed to 'mak[e] medical knowledge accessible and interesting to lay audiences' (, 450). She explains that this worried established publications: the Lancet for example, raised the dangers of self-diagnosis (, 450). But the Lancet itself was a journal that set out to make medical knowledge accessible, which suggests a conflict around who has the authority to distribute medical knowledge to laypeople and the effects of this distribution. Adopting new therapeutics that had been enthusiastically discussed in the press could effect public approval and accompanying success for the doctor using them: for example practitioners who made use of cocaine's anaesthetic qualities to treat patients absorbed some of the prestige surrounding the drug in the late nineteenth century. This in turn garnered a more general public perception of practitioners' heroism and 'the physician's unassailable moral primacy' (, 4). Patients developed conflicting expectations of the doctor/patient relationship, demanding both the latest treatments and the comfort of more traditional practice (, 179).

### Do editorialists with industry-related conflicts of interest write unduly favorable editorials for cancer drugs in top journals? [^ebd405a0]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Editorials accompanying the publication of trials in major oncology journals can have a substantial influence on clinical practice. We describe the prevalence of financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) of authors writing such editorials and the extent to which FCOIs may shape the interpretation of clinical trials.

Methods

We examined editorials published in 2018 alongside trial reports in the top 5 journals that publish cancer drug trials (New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Lancet Oncology, JAMA Oncology, and Journal of Clinical Oncology). An editorial was considered to have an FCOI if at least one of the editorialists had any disclosed FCOI. An FCOI with the same company whose drug was being discussed in the editorial was classified as a direct FCOI. Editorials were reviewed for their content and classified as being unduly favorable (defined as the presence of a positive spin without discussion of limitations) or not. Association of an FCOI and a direct FCOI with writing an unduly favorable editorial was assessed.

Results

Of the 90 editorials assessed, 74% (n = 67) were classified as having an FCOI with the pharmaceutical industry, and 39% (n = 35) had an FCOI with the same company whose product was being discussed in the editorial (direct FCOI). Editorials were classified as being unduly favorable toward the study drug in 12% (8 of 67) and 13% (3 of 23) (P = 1.0) of those with and without FCOIs, respectively; corresponding rates with and without direct FCOI were 23% (8 of 35) and 5% (3 of 55), respectively (P = 0.009).

Conclusions

Editorials in top oncology journals were frequently authored by experts with FCOIs, including direct FCOIs. Authoring an unduly favorable editorial for a new cancer drug was significantly associated with the author having a direct FCOI with the same company. These findings support the call for journals to ensure that authors of editorials have no direct FCOIs.

### Evolution of wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future [^44d48501]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Improved referencing for Wikipedia's medical articles has been a strong focus since 2007. Higher quality articles often cite more than a hundred references (figure 4). The majority of references for Wikipedia's medical articles are drawn from reliable sources. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary sources (eg, meta-analyses and clinical guidelines) are strongly preferred in order to reflect the accepted medical consensus. Examples from three leading medical journals (The Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine and British Medical Journal) show similar trends, with a high percentage of articles cited by at least one Wikipedia article, and a subset of publications cited multiple times (following a power law).

Figure 4
Citation metrics for medical content. (A) Total number of external references per Wikipedia medical article for different article qualities (n = 10). FA, 'Featured article'; GA, 'Good article'; B, 'B-class article'; C, 'C-class article'. (B) Absolute numbers and percentage of scholarly articles from three representative high-impact medical journals that have been cited in Wikipedia (up to 13 January 2017). (C) Number of times articles from each representative medical journal have been cited in Wikipedia. (D) Dates when articles are first cited by Wikipedia from selected journals.

In general, there is an upward trend in Wikipedia's accuracy and reputation, but completeness and readability are still major limitations.

### Use of relative and absolute effect measures in reporting health inequalities: structured review [^e06d1171]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

We did a literature search for all studies in calendar year 2009 that reported quantitative evidence on social inequalities in health, published in 10 leading medical, public health, and epidemiology journals: American Journal of Epidemiology, American Journal of Public Health, BMJ, Epidemiology, International Journal of Epidemiology, JAMA, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine, and Social Science and Medicine. We consulted a professional health sciences librarian to create a search strategy that combined the above journal titles with Medline medical subject headings (MeSH) search terms and keywords for health inequalities, as well as MeSH search terms and keywords for social inequalities (see web appendix for complete search terms). We included only articles reporting original research results with a quantitative measure of health inequality in the full text. We excluded review articles, systematic reviews, editorials, and commentaries unless they contained original empirical results.

Six reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full text. At least two reviewers independently reviewed every article at each stage. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

### How have research questions and methods used in clinical trials published in clinical rehabilitation changed over the last 30 years? [^80ea11b6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

This study reviewed the trials published only in Clinical Rehabilitation. Nevertheless, the results reported here are likely to be generalizable to other rehabilitation journals. The top 21 rehabilitation journals in Web of Science all have basically the same impact factor, range 2.0 to 4.0, with Clinical Rehabilitation ranking 10th with an impact factor of 2.4. A critique across all rehabilitation journals for case-control studies, for example, did not find any one rehabilitation journal superior to any other in reporting on studies with this design. In fact, all were very poor.

However, there have been some very good trials published by rehabilitation researchers or on topics relevant to rehabilitation in the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, British Medical Journal, Stroke, etc. These journals had 2014 impact factors ranging from 17.5 to over 55, according to Web of Science, but the number of rehabilitation trials published in these journals is relatively modest. The majority of rehabilitation trials still have room for improvement.

### Acute stroke: we have the treatments and we have the evidence – we need to use them [^66b5629f]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Despite huge global burden, stroke disease has traditionally received little attention in the general medical press. We review a series of four acute stroke research articles published in a themed issue of the Lancet. Claiborne-Johnston and coworkers presented a scoring system to stratify risk of stroke following transient ischaemic attack. Chalela and colleagues demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography in detecting acute ischaemic stroke and that fears of missing intracranial haemorrhage are unfounded. The SITS-MOST (Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke - Monitoring Study) group reported positive experience of translating acute stroke thrombolysis trials into routine clinical practice in Europe, and the PROSIT (Project on Stroke Services in Italy) group studied acute effects of admission to a dedicated stroke unit. The message from all of these reports is that evidence-based, successful management of acute stroke is possible, and that investment in health infrastructure and changing mind sets of health practitioners to improve stroke care will deliver benefits.

### High reprint orders in medical journals and pharmaceutical industry funding: case-control study [^a24e1a65]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We emailed the editors in chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and BMJ to supply details of the top articles by size of reprint orders (the high reprint group).

For each journal we selected control articles immediately before the high reprint article from the same section of the same issue or, where this was not possible, the first article in the same section of the previous issue. The control article was always of the same type as the high reprint article (research article, editorial, etc) and could not be in the high reprint group. We discarded reprint orders for articles when suitable controls could not be found or financial disclosures were lacking. Several articles appeared multiple times in the top reprint groups of successive years; we counted these articles only once but summed the reprint orders. Table 1shows the total numbers of high reprint and control articles for each journal.

Table 1
Included articles and average reprint orders by journal study design and funding

RCT = randomised controlled trial.

Numbers quoted discount multiple reprint orders placed on same articles.

*Median number of reprints and range include all reprint orders regardless of article duplication.

Study design and source of funding

Each study was categorised as either a randomised control trial or another study design (including meta-analysis, observational study, basic science, and commentary). We extracted the source of funding from the acknowledgments or conflicts of interest section and classified this into industry funding, mixed funding, or other sources of funding. Research articles were classified as being industry funded if all of the funding for the study was supplied by a pharmaceutical company, and mixed if some of the funding was supplied by a pharmaceutical company. Other article types, such as commentaries, were classified as being industry funded if the body of the article referred to a pharmaceutical product and the author or authors received funding, honorariums, or salaries from the pharmaceutical company related to that product. Two authors (AEH and JP) independently appraised the funding status of all articles and compared results. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third author (SVR).

The costs for the reprint orders were obtained directly from the BMJ and Lancet on 15 August 2011.

### Effect of editors' implementation of CONSORT guidelines on the reporting of abstracts in high impact medical journals: interrupted time series analysis [^c240ab29]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Design and sample

To assess the effect of publication of the CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines, we planned a segmented regression of interrupted time series analyses, a quasi-experimental design method frequently used and recommended to evaluate the effect of guidelines or other complex interventions.

We selected all primary reports of randomised trials indexed in PubMed (publication type "Randomized Controlled Trial") and published in one of five high impact general medical journals (the Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, Lancet, JAMA, and New England Journal of Medicine). We excluded reports that did not include an electronic abstract, and any secondary trial publications or economic analyses. Because the number of randomised trials published by journals varies each year, we selected at random a sample of up to 60 trial reports per journal per year for inclusion in our final sample. If fewer than 60 reports of randomised trials were obtained for a journal in a particular year, we assessed all eligible reports.

Interventions

We aimed to assess the effect of the publication of the CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines and the effect of different editorial policies used to implement these guidelines. Therefore, we checked each journal's instructions to authors in January 2010 for any reference to the CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines (for example, reference to a publication or link to the relevant section of the CONSORT website). For those journals that mentioned the guidelines in their instructions to authors, we contacted the editor of that journal to ask when the guidance was added, whether the journal enforced the guidelines, and if so, how. We classified journals in three categories: those not mentioning the CONSORT guidelines in their instructions to authors (JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine); those referring to the guidelines in their instructions to authors, but with no specific policy to implement them (BMJ); and those referring to the guidelines in their instructions to authors, with a policy to implement them (Annals of Internal Medicine and the Lancet). In the final journal group, we defined such an implementation policy as having any action to enforce the adherence to CONSORT — that is, an email was sent to authors to revise the abstract according to the CONSORT for Abstracts guidance at the revision stage of the manuscript, or changes were made by the assistant editors of these journals towards the end of the editorial process.

### High reprint orders in medical journals and pharmaceutical industry funding: case-control study [^ae0ef8db]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To assess the extent to which funding and study design are associated with high reprint orders.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Top articles by size of reprint orders in seven journals, 2002–09.

Participants

Lancet, Lancet Neurology, Lancet Oncology (Lancet Group), BMJ, Gut, Heart, and Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry (BMJ Group) matched to contemporaneous articles not in the list of high reprint orders.

Main Outcome Measures

Funding and design of randomised controlled trials or other study designs.

Results

Median reprint orders for the seven journals ranged from 3000 to 126,350. Papers with high reprint orders were more likely to be funded by the pharmaceutical industry than were control papers (industry funding versus other or none: odds ratio 8.64, 95% confidence interval 5.09 to 14.68, and mixed funding versus other or none: 3.72, 2.43 to 5.70).

Conclusions

Funding by the pharmaceutical industry is associated with high numbers of reprint orders.

### Levels of evidence: a comparison between top medical journals and general pediatric journals [^9ef1497e]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Given the large number of publications in all fields of practice, it is essential that clinicians focus on the resources that provide the highest level of evidence (LOE). We sought to determine the LOE that exists in the field of pediatrics, present in the general pediatric as well as high impact clinical literature.

Methods

Clinical pediatric literature, published between April 2011 and March 2012 inclusive in high-impact clinical journals (HICJ) (New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, & The Lancet) and the highest-impact general pediatric journals (GPJ) (Pediatrics, Journal of Pediatrics, & Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine), was assessed. In addition to the LOE, articles were evaluated on criteria including subspecialty within pediatrics, number of authors, number of centers, and other parameters. Eligible level I randomized control trials were appraised using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Results

Of 6511 articles screened, 804 met inclusion criteria (68 in HICJ and 736 in GPJ). On average, LOE in pediatrics-focused articles within The Lancet were significantly higher than all GPJ (p < 0.05). Average CONSORT scores were significantly higher in HICJ vs. GPJ (15.2 vs. 13.6, respectively, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

LOE and quality of randomized control trials within the pediatric field is highest within HICJ, however, only represent a small proportion of data published. Following CONSORT criteria, and promoting studies of high LOE may allow authors and readers to turn to journals and articles of greater clinical impact.

### Hearing impairment and dementia: cause, catalyst or consequence? [^781085df]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Large longitudinal studies reporting associations between objective hearing impairment and dementia

The Table summarizes published studies meeting criteria for inclusion in the 2024 Lancet Commission report on dementia prevention, intervention and care, as follows: a cohort of at least 500 cognitively healthy people followed for at least 5 years; included incident dementia as an outcome; adjusted for age and cardiovascular risk factors; used pure-tone audiometry to measure hearing; included a hazard ratio estimate. Restricting the presentation to these rigorous, high quality studies omits a large number of other studies investigating the association of hearing impairment and dementia (see text); the table also excludes one study included in the 2024 Lancet Commission report, as hearing loss in the follow-up cohort was assessed using a whisper test, rather than pure-tone audiometry. a likely participant overlap between these studies, which draw from the same wider cohort; b hearing loss with and without depressive symptoms groups were combined; c sub-cohort who had pure-tone audiometry; AD Alzheimer's disease, ApoE4 apolipoprotein E4 allele genetic status, BMI body mass index, IHD ischaemic heart diseas

### Adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and incident depression and anxiety [^e611c8a5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

There were several approaches for translating the EAT-Lancet reference diet into the dietary scores. We adopted three common yet differently quantified EAT-Lancet indexes in the current study and the results were consistent, which indicates robust associations between adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and incident mental outcomes. The differences among the three indices lie in the scoring criteria and food group categorizations. Compared with the binary assessments in the Knuppel EAT-Lancet index, the Kesse-Guyot EAT-Lancet index was a continuous score accounting for deviation from the cut-off value based on the Knuppel score and the Stubbendorff score used an ordinal scale, which discriminates different levels of adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. As the emphasized individual components in all indexes, adherence to the vegetable and fruit recommendation was significantly associated with lower risks of depression, anxiety and co-occurrence of depression and anxiety. Higher intake of fish, which is emphasized in the Stubbendorff index yet limited in other two indexes, was also observed to be inversely associated with all mental outcomes, which was supported by a previous study showing that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in fish was inversely associated with depression. Taken together, these discrepancies in score construction may explain the differences in the predictive performances among the three EAT-Lancet indexes.

Although depression and anxiety have been considered as two distinct entities according to the diagnostic criteria, co-occurrence of depression and anxiety is relatively a common syndrome. Among the 4548 participants who developed depression in our study, 1262 (27.7%) participants also had anxiety. Previous reports have shown that compared with individuals with single depression or anxiety, those with their coexistence had a higher risk of suicidal ideation and previous suicide attempts and had poorer responses to treatment, indicating co-occurrence of depression and anxiety deserves particular concern on its management and treatment. Our study suggested that adhering to the EAT-Lancet reference diet may serve as a promising modifiable target which enhances the primary prevention for co-occurrence of depression and anxiety. In addition, we observed that the associations between adhering to the EAT-Lancet diet and incident depression and anxiety were more pronounced in those who were more deprived. Previous studies also suggested that a lower socioeconomic status was associated with greater risks of depression and anxiety. Our findings suggest that the risk differences between different socioeconomic statuses might be narrowed by adhering to the EAT-Lancet diet.

### Global collaborative networks on meta-analyses of randomized trials published in high impact factor medical journals: a social network analysis [^f8b2872e]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Research collaboration contributes to the advancement of knowledge by exploiting the results of scientific efforts more efficiently, but the global patterns of collaboration on meta-analysis are unknown. The purpose of this research was to describe and characterize the global collaborative patterns in meta-analyses of randomized trials published in high impact factor medical journals over the past three decades.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional, social network analysis. We searched PubMed for relevant meta-analyses of randomized trials published up to December 2012. We selected meta-analyses (including at least randomized trials as primary evidence source) published in the top seven high impact factor general medical journals (according to Journal Citation Reports 2011): The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, the BMJ, JAMA, Annals of Internal Medicine, Archives of Internal Medicine (now renamed JAMA Internal Medicine), and PLoS Medicine. Opinion articles, conceptual papers, narrative reviews, reviews without meta-analysis, reviews of reviews, and other study designs were excluded.

Results

Overall, we included 736 meta-analyses, in which 3,178 authors, 891 institutions, and 51 countries participated. The BMJ was the journal that published the greatest number of articles (39%), followed by The Lancet (18%), JAMA (15%) and the Archives of Internal Medicine (15%). The USA, the UK, and Canada headed the absolute global productivity ranking in number of papers. The 64 authors and the 39 institutions with the highest publication rates were identified. We also found 82 clusters of authors (one group with 55 members and one group with 54 members) and 19 clusters of institutions (one major group with 76 members). The most prolific authors were mainly affiliated with the University of Oxford (UK), McMaster University (Canada), and the University of Bern (Switzerland).

Conclusions

Our analysis identified networks of authors, institutions and countries publishing meta-analyses of randomized trials in high impact medical journals. This valuable information may be used to strengthen scientific capacity for collaboration and to help to promote a global agenda for future research of excellence.

### Adherence in leading medical journals to the CONSORT 2010 statement for reporting of binary outcomes in randomised controlled trials: cross-sectional analysis [^e2ad8db3]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Clinicians and lay people tend to overestimate the effectiveness of a treatment when only the relative effect is presented, particularly if the relative effect is large, but the absolute effect is small. In recognition of this problem, item 17b of The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement stipulates authors present both absolute and relative effects for binary outcomes in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Adherence to item 17b and the effect of differing levels of CONSORT endorsement by journals on adherence is not well known. We assessed the extent to which item 17b is adhered to in 258 RCTs published in five leading medical journals (Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine) between January and December 2019 that all endorsed the CONSORT statement to varying degrees. Only 53 of 258 (20.5%; 95%CI 15.8% to 26.0%) included studies adhered fully to item 17b. Proportional adherence was higher in journals that endorsed the statement more strictly (BMJ and JAMA, 47.4% [34.0% to 61.0%]) compared with journals less strict in their endorsement (NEJM and Ann Intern Med, 12.2% [7.0% to 19.3%]; The Lancet, 14.1% [7.3% to 23.8%]). Journals that only recommend author adherence to CONSORT had a greater proportion of studies reporting only relative effects in the main results section (62.6%) and abstract (64.2%) compared with journals that require authors to submit a completed checklist (24.6% and 29.8%, respectively). The majority of RCTs (79.5%) with binary primary outcomes published in five leading medical journals during 2019 do not report both absolute and relative effect estimates as per item 17b of the CONSORT guideline despite its universal endorsement. Differences in adherence were observed between journals that endorsed the CONSORT statement to differing extents.

### Do the most heavily burdened countries have the right policies to eliminate viral hepatitis B and C? [^f438af4e]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

In 2019, a Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission on accelerating the elimination of viral hepatitis reported on the status of 11 viral hepatitis policy indicators in 66 countries and territories with the heaviest burden by global region. Policies were reported as being either in place, in development, or not in place. This study uses the Commission findings to estimate hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) policy scores and rankings for these 66 countries and territories. We applied a multiple correspondence analysis technique to reduce data on policy indicators into a weighted summary for the HBV and HCV policies. We calculated HBV and HCV policy scores for each country. Countries and territories that received higher scores had more policies in place and in development than did countries with lower scores. The highest scoring country for HBV was Australia, whereas Somalia had the lowest score. For the HCV policy score, Australia and New Zealand had perfect scores, whereas Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen had the lowest scores, all having no policy indicators in place.

### Analysis of penetration depth and healing process of a needleless laser Lancet using swept-source optical coherence tomography [^28396eca]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Needleless laser lancets have been used to reduce needle pain in people who undertake self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Although clinical trials have been conducted to understand the degree of pain associated with the developed laser blood sampling device, it is only judged by the patients' subjective judgment. This study aimed to analyze the performance and healing process of a needleless laser lancet. In particular, the penetration depth and healing process of a conventional lancet and a needleless laser lancet were quantitatively analyzed using a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system.

Materials and Methods

To reduce unnecessary animal sacrifice, pig skin was used to establish and set the conditions for needleless laser lancets (wavelength of 2.94μm; LMT-5000; Lameditech), and the penetration depth and healing process were quantitatively assessed at 0, 6, 9, and 16h after laser (energy, 150-270mJ in stages; voltage, 7.4V dc; pulse width, approximately 200microsecond) irradiation using 7-week-old male BALB/c nude mice. The penetration depth and healing process were measured using homemade SS-OCT, and histopathological examination was performed to observe the healing process.

Results

Four 7-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were tested at intensity levels of 1–3 using a needleless laser lancet and compared with the experimental values using a conventional lancet. After the lancet test, the diameter and depth of the puncture were measured using SS-OCT and the healing process was confirmed using SS-OCT and pathological slides. The puncture diameter of the needleless laser lancet was about 0.5mm regardless of the level. In addition, the average depths at Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the measured needleless laser lancet were approximately 1.05, 1.18, and 1.52mm, respectively, and the last common lancet was approximately 0.9mm. In addition, the healing process of the needleless laser lancet and conventional lancet was confirmed through the SS-OCT system.

Conclusion

After using the needleless laser lancet, quantitative indicators such as the diameter of puncture, penetration depth, and healing process were confirmed through two-dimensional and three-dimensional images of the homemade SS-OCT system and microscopic imaging of pathological slides.

### Saving time and money in biomedical publishing: the case for free-format submissions with minimal requirements [^338d6189]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results in context

For many authors, the first step in publishing a scientific article is identifying the most appropriate journal(s) to disseminate their research, and then formatting the manuscript according to the target journal's submission guidelines. The percentage of papers rejected without peer-review can vary across journals, disciplines, and publishing models, with some journals rejecting more than two-thirds of all first submissions at the editorial level; this is known as a 'desk reject'. When an article is returned to the corresponding author, they often want to resubmit to another journal quickly to avoid delays in dissemination. Once the author identifies another appropriate journal, they must then understand its specific submission requirements. It is at this stage that reformatting can be particularly cumbersome and time-consuming; numerous tasks are involved in reformatting manuscripts to adhere to the second journal's specific requirements, as well as additional tasks related to the submission process itself.

Sobani et al. estimated that the total time used to resubmit one article is ~ four hours for submitting authors. Others have estimated that reformatting a single manuscript can take from one to 14 h or more. In practice, the time needed to reformat can be substantially longer, especially when the resubmission requires substantive reductions to the manuscript's word count. For instance, an article rejected by Science (max. 4500 words) cannot be immediately resubmitted to The Lancet (max. 3500 words) or The New England Journal of Medicine (max. 2700 words). Such substantive differences in length also exist among the specialized journals, a specific barrier that was mentioned in our interviews. One researcher said, " For a typical manuscript, [reformatting takes] a couple of days… If you have to rewrite a lot because you have to cut 2,000 words, then it probably takes more time ".

### Midwifery-led antenatal care models: mapping a systematic review to an evidence-based quality framework to identify key components and characteristics of care [^ca0b47a7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

To help us do this we devised a data extraction form based on the QMNC framework (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The Lancet Series on Midwifery: Framework for Quality Maternal and Newborn Care (QMNC): Renfrew et al. 2014

The QMNC framework was developed through a combination of conventional systematic review and advances in methods for interpretive synthesis, and included expert opinion input from 35 Lancet Series co-authors and a further dozen or so critical readers. The detailed evidence base used to develop the framework included 461 Cochrane reviews of interventions, 13 meta-syntheses of qualitative studies of women's views and experiences, and seven reviews of workforce issues. The framework focuses on the needs of women, infants and families across the continuum of care, and can be used to assess the key concepts of quality maternal or newborn care provision by a wide range of providers in diverse care settings worldwide.

The framework identifies five components which are used to organise specific characteristics across the continuum of maternal and newborn care from pregnancy to postpartum and the early weeks of life. These components are: practice categories, organisation of care, values, philosophy, and care providers. The term 'Practice categories' comprises five sub-categories, the first three of which are supportive/preventive and are needed by all childbearing women and infants (education, assessment and the promotion of normal processes), with the last two relevant for women and infants with complications (first line management and specific obstetric and neonatal services). Within each of these components, characteristics of care that women and infants need are specified. The framework can therefore be used to identify and then review the scope and content of all maternal and newborn care. In this paper we use it for one specific purpose - to analyse trials of midwifery-led care.

### Development of an EAT-Lancet index and its relation to mortality in a Swedish population [^d7acd7d3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Distribution of EAT-Lancet index points for 14 food groups in 22,421 participants from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. A very low percentage (< 5%) of the participants reached the target intakes defined in the EAT-Lancet diet (3 points) for legumes, nuts, whole grains, pork, and beef and lamb, whereas most of the participants reached the target intakes for poultry and fish (< 65%).

FIGURE 3
Recommended range and targets in the EAT-Lancet diet, compared with the average intake among 22,421 participants in the MDCS. Abbreviation: MDCS, Malmö Diet and Cancer Study.

Those with the high adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet (higher score) had lower total energy intake and a diet containing lower E% from fat, higher E% from carbohydrates, more dietary fiber, and a marginally higher E% from protein compared to those with low adherence (Table 2). The participants with high adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet were slightly older and less often smokers, and fewer among them had high alcohol consumption. In addition, university degrees and high leisure-time physical activity were more common in this group. BMI did not differ across categories of the EAT-Lancet index in the analysis of women and men together, but in men, BMI increased slightly with higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet, and this trend was also reflected by a lower percentage of normal-weight men in the group with higher adherence (Supplemental Table 5).

### Fluoxetine for motor recovery after acute ischaemic stroke (FLAME): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^6ffa7572]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

The study FLAME (fluoxetine) was published by Chollet F and colleagues in 2011 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of fluoxetine in patients who have motor deficits secondary to ischemic stroke? In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the population was: 118 patients (46 female, 72 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18–85 years with ischemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, who had Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores < 55. The key exclusion criteria were severe post-stroke disability, substantial premorbid disability, clinically diagnosed with depression, receipt of antidepressants, residual motor deficit from a previous stroke, severe aphasia. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the interventions were: n = 59 fluoxetine (20 mg once per day PO for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke) n = 59 placebo (matching placebo for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores at day 90 (34 points vs. 24.3 points; AD 9.8 points, 95% CI 3.4 to 16.1). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in mean NIHSS scores at day 90 (5.8 points vs. 6.9 points;) Significant increase in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (26% vs. 9%; AD 17%, 95% CI 3.29 to 30.71) Significant increase in change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 90 (-0.1 points vs. 3.2 points; AD 3.3 points, 95% CI 0.28 to 6.32). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, including hyponatremia, insomnia, psychiatric disorders, and partial seizure. significant difference in transient digestive disorders (25% vs. 11%) and hepatic enzyme disorders (9% vs. 18%). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged between 18–85 years with ischemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, who had Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores < 55, fluoxetine was superior to placebo with respect to change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores at day 90.

### Clinical obesity through the lens of context-aware large language models [^96ba3e0f]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore whether large language models can assist in refining complex medical definitions, this proof-of-concept study evaluated the capacity of three advanced systems, ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Grok 3, to interpret, critique, and build upon existing definitions of clinical obesity, with particular reference to the Lancet Commission on the Definition and Diagnosis of Clinical Obesity.

Materials and Methods

Five structured questions were used in a three-stage qualitative design: (1) baseline responses without external references, (2) context-informed responses incorporating the Lancet Commission report, and (3) generative redefinition of clinical obesity. Model outputs were reviewed by a medical expert for accuracy, originality, and concordance with established guidelines.

Results

Without contextual guidance, large language models produced generalized definitions largely reflecting public-domain sources. Supplying the Lancet Commission report yielded more precise, conceptually consistent, and clinically relevant outputs. In the generative phase, all models proposed refined definitions that addressed recognized gaps in existing frameworks, emphasizing functional impairment, psychosocial dimensions, and the limitations of body mass index as a diagnostic criterion.

Conclusion

When anchored to authoritative, domain-specific evidence, large language models can serve as adjunctive tools for knowledge synthesis, clarifying and strengthening complex medical constructs. Integrating human expertise with artificial intelligence under transparent and ethically governed conditions may enable the development of more inclusive, adaptive, and evidence-based clinical definitions.

### Higher adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet is associated with higher nutrient adequacy in the nutriNet-santécohort: a cross-sectional study [^201f853d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a planetary and healthy reference diet; however, its nutritional quality has been rarely evaluated.

Objective

Across different adherence levels to the EAT-Lancet reference diet, the following were our objectives:1) describe the food and nutritional intakes of the French population, 2) evaluate the nutrient quality, and 3) investigate the consistency between the French national recommendations and the EAT-Lancet reference diet.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted among participants of the NutriNet-Santé cohort, and the sample was weighted on the characteristics of the general French population. Adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet was estimated using the EAT-Lancet Diet Index (ELD-I). Usual nutrient intakes were obtained using the variance reduction method. We used the estimated average requirements cut-point method to estimate the proportion of participants who meet their respective nutritional requirements. Furthermore, the adequacy of the French food-based dietary recommendations [Programme National Nutrition Santé (PNNS)] according to adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet was studied.

Results

The weighted sample was composed of 98,465 participants. Except for bioavailable zinc and vitamin B12, we observed a decrease in the nutrient inadequacy prevalence when the adherence to the EAT-Lancet reference diet increased, particularly for vitamin B9 (Q1 = 37.8% compared with Q5 = 5.5%, P < 0.0001) and vitamin C (Q1 = 59.0% compared with Q5 = 10.8%, P < 0.0001). However, inadequacy prevalence remained high in all ELD-I quintiles, particularly for fiber (95.9%), vitamin B1 (70.8%), iodine (48.4%), and magnesium (76.8%). Higher ELD-I score was associated with higher adherence for most components of the PNNS, except for food groups that are not specifically included in the EAT-Lancet reference diet and are typical of the French diet, including alcohol, processed meat, and salt.

Conclusion

In the French context, although issues with the intake of certain nutrients may occur, a diet that remains within the planetary limits as the EAT-Lancet reference diet allows a favorable nutritional quality. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03335644.

### Noninferiority designed cardiovascular trials in highest-impact journals [^89dc6be1]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninferiority trials are increasingly being performed. However, little is known about their methodological quality. We sought to characterize noninferiority cardiovascular trials published in the highest-impact journals, features that may bias results toward noninferiority, features related to reporting of noninferiority trials, and the time trends.

Methods

We identified cardiovascular noninferiority trials published in JAMA, Lancet, or New England Journal of Medicine from 1990 to 2016. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Data elements included the noninferiority margin and the success of studies in achieving noninferiority. The proportion of trials showing major or minor features that may have affected the noninferiority inference was determined. Major factors included the lack of presenting the results in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated cohorts, α > 0.05, the new intervention not being compared with the best alternative, not justifying the noninferiority margin, and exclusion or loss of ≥ 10% of the cohort. Minor factors included suboptimal blinding, allocation concealment, and others.

Results

From 2544 screened studies, we identified 111 noninferiority cardiovascular trials. Noninferiority margins varied widely: risk differences of 0.4% to 25%, hazard ratios of 1.05 to 2.85, odds ratios of 1.1 to 2.0, and relative risks of 1.1 to 1.8. Eighty-six trials claimed noninferiority, of which 20 showed superiority, whereas 23 (21.1%) did not show noninferiority, of which 8 also demonstrated inferiority. Only 7 (6.3%) trials were considered low risk for all the major and minor biasing factors. Among common major factors for bias, 41 (37%) did not confirm the findings in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated cohorts and 4 (3.6%) reported discrepant results between intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Forty-three (38.7%) did not justify the noninferiority margin. Overall, 27 (24.3%) underenrolled or had > 10% exclusions. Sixty trials (54.0%) were open label. Allocation concealment was not maintained or unclear in 11 (9.9%). Publication of noninferiority trials increased over time (P < 0.001). Fifty-two (46.8%) were published after 2010 and had a lower risk of methodological or reporting limitations for major (P = 0.03) and minor factors (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Noninferiority trials in highest-impact journals commonly conclude noninferiority of the tested intervention, but vary markedly in the selected noninferiority margin, and frequently have limitations that may impact the inference related to noninferiority.

### Stillbirth-a challenge for the 21st century [^1e4cbf6b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

There are an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths each year. This significant loss of life is frequently unrecognized and hidden from view due to the stigma associated with stillbirth in many countries. Consequently, stillbirth does not receive the prominence it needs in order to influence international policy. Earlier this year these issues were presented in the Ending Preventable Stillbirths Series in the Lancet. This outlined ongoing challenges preventing stillbirths from being addressed. This series of papers in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth develops the work presented in the Ending Preventable Stillbirths Series. These papers are a cogent reminder of the impact of stillbirth and provide considerations for how this might be addressed.

Firstly, they remind us that stillbirth is a global issue; 98% of stillbirths occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Despite this knowledge, challenges remain in data collection which prevent understanding of the number of stillbirths and their underlying causes. To address issues with data collection e-Health and m-Health strategies have been proposed, but the potential of these approaches has yet to be realized. Data also need to reflect the global nature of stillbirth but to date there is no globally acceptable classification system for perinatal deaths. Studies presented here outline the key characteristics required for such a system including the capacity to accumulate data from both high income and low and middle income settings and for the system to be accessible by e-Health and m- Health. However, of all the classification systems available none had all of the characteristics and most had fewer than half of these facets. It is hoped that the development of the ICD-PM classification will address some of these challenges, but this system must evolve and be refined in an ongoing process. Critically, without meaningful data stillbirths will continue to be overlooked and efforts to reduce stillbirth hampered.

### Diabetes and dementia: clinical perspective, innovation, knowledge gaps [^0fc7cfbb]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

The world faces a pandemic-level prevalence of type 2 diabetes. In parallel with this massive burden of metabolic disease is the growing prevalence of dementia as the population ages. The two health issues are intertwined. The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care was convened to tackle the growing global concern of dementia by identifying risk factors. It concluded, along with other studies, that diabetes as well as obesity and the metabolic syndrome more broadly, which are frequently comorbid, raise the risk of developing dementia. Type 2 diabetes is a modifiable risk factor; however, it is uncertain whether anti-diabetic drugs mitigate risk of developing dementia. Reasons are manifold but constitute a critical knowledge gap in the field. This review outlines studies of type 2 diabetes on risk of dementia, illustrating key concepts. Moreover, it identifies knowledge gaps, reviews strategies to help fill these gaps, and concludes with a series of recommendations to mitigate risk and advance understanding of type 2 diabetes and dementia.

### Mental health, subjective experiences and environmental change [^4693a16f]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

In a recent publication, sustained that medical humanities should approach the climate crisis as a health issue and therefore consider lines of action to be undertaken to help solve it. Coope suggested a radical revision was needed of concepts such as health, medical humanities, well-being and even what a 'good society' could be.

Coope's article starts with a reference to the pandemic declared by the WHO when COVID-19 started to expand quickly. In fact, our experience of the pandemic should make us, as some of the witnesses reported to him, thoroughly revise our deepest cultural convictions, particularly our understanding of our relationship with nature (, 123). Yet, beyond the pandemic, other reasons made this 'ecological' turn obviously necessary. Two are specifically mentioned by Coope: the reports published in The Lancet and the support of some doctors to the 'environmental movement Extinction Rebellion' (, 123). I would like to focus on the former.

In January 2015, The Lancet published the results of a comprehensive report entitled The Rockefeller Foundation - Lancet Commission on Planetary Health. This commission aimed to research human health in the context of its potential impact on the ecological systems we inhabit. Its conclusions could not be starker: the improved life and health conditions 'come at a high price: a dramatic degradation of nature's ecological systems'. From this short summary, The Lancet report lays down several ways in which human and planet health are connected, including a study on how climate change and humans entering the Anthropocene era impact the health of human populations. It is precisely this approach — as well as the continuation of this work, The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change in 2015 — what started an analytic effort to understand and measure the effect of climate change on health and to assess the impact of the measures adopted by the world states to slow down global warming in the context of the Paris Agreement reached in 2015.

Returning to Dr Coope's article, he proposed three areas which he defined as 'of progress towards ecological thinking in healthcare'. These are (1) systems understanding, (2) ecological public health and (3) ecological mental health. All three are particularly relevant, but we will attempt in this article to develop a proposal concerned with the third intervention area.
