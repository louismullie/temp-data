## Question

Which antibiotic is best for acute sinusitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is best for acute sinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) versus viral rhinosinusitis, because antibiotics are not indicated for viral disease. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for antibiotics in ABRS and quantify benefit versus harm. Next, I will review comparative effectiveness across antibiotic classes and consider dosing strategies. After that, I need to align with current guideline recommendations for first-line therapy and duration. Finally, I should account for special populations, penicillin allergy, and what to do if the patient fails initial therapy, before stating a clear, clinically actionable answer.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame, because I need to ensure we are treating ABRS and not a viral URI. ABRS is typically defined by persistent symptoms for at least 10 days without improvement, worsening symptoms after initial improvement ("double sickening"), or severe onset with fever and purulent discharge for 3–4 days, whereas viral rhinosinusitis is more likely when symptoms are under 10 days and not worsening, and antibiotics do not help in viral disease [^9201df28] [^b79a5be6] [^3b365ed9].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit of antibiotics in ABRS before naming an agent. High-quality evidence shows only a modest benefit: antibiotics reduce clinical failure by about 5–11 per 100 patients and shorten time to cure by roughly 1 day, while adverse events are more common with antibiotics, with a number needed to harm around 8, so the net clinical benefit is small and must be weighed against harms and resistance risks [^f7f6a5e8] [^0d33feb9] [^2141c357].

> I will now examine comparative effectiveness across antibiotic classes, because I should confirm whether any particular agent is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and head-to-head trials show no clinically meaningful differences in cure or improvement between antibiotic classes, including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones, so there is no "best" antibiotic on efficacy grounds alone [^f347cf0c] [^546dbd37] [^b7076a30].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing; I initially thought higher-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate might be better, but I should double-check that. A randomized trial comparing high-dose versus standard-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate found no advantage to higher-dose amoxicillin, and in fact the standard dose performed numerically better at day 3, so escalating amoxicillin dose does not improve outcomes in uncomplicated ABRS [^6e6c4945] [^00962b5c].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to anchor first-line therapy. Contemporary guidelines converge on amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line for most adults with ABRS, with a recommended duration of 5–7 days rather than 10 days to reduce adverse effects, and with a preference for amoxicillin alone when resistance risk is low and symptoms are mild to moderate, reserving amoxicillin–clavulanate when resistance risk is higher or illness is more severe [^e674ee33] [^46755339] [^ba999865] [^9b709bd3].

> But wait, what if the patient has a penicillin allergy or other modifiers? I need to ensure I address alternatives. For severe beta-lactam allergy, doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone can be used, though macrolides are less reliable due to resistance and should be reserved when options are limited; in children, amoxicillin remains first-line with dosing adjustments, and observation with close follow-up is reasonable for persistent nonsevere disease given the high spontaneous recovery rate [^e674ee33] [^af9a7f77] [^429f7af7].

> I should confirm what to do if the patient fails initial therapy, because that changes the antibiotic choice. If there is no improvement after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy, guidelines advise reassessing the diagnosis, excluding complications or alternative causes, and then changing the antibiotic; in that scenario, switching from amoxicillin to amoxicillin–clavulanate or an alternative class is reasonable, and in children, a 72-hour reassessment window is standard [^c61db5e6] [^7fa8adcc] [^3a0c87f9].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle so I don't overstate antibiotics. Given high spontaneous recovery and only modest incremental benefit, watchful waiting is an appropriate default for many adults with uncomplicated ABRS, with shared decision-making about starting antibiotics now versus deferring with safety-net instructions, which reduces unnecessary use and adverse effects without compromising outcomes [^f2161b54] [^2141c357] [^84d62a4c].

> Putting this together, I should state the answer clearly. For adults with confirmed ABRS, the best first-line antibiotic is amoxicillin for 5–7 days in most cases, with amoxicillin–clavulanate as an alternative when resistance risk is higher or illness is more severe, recognizing that no antibiotic class is superior in efficacy and that higher-dose amoxicillin strategies do not improve outcomes; reserve alternatives for penicillin allergy and reassess at 3–5 days if not improving [^e674ee33] [^46755339] [^ba999865] [^6e6c4945] [^c61db5e6].

---

The best antibiotic for acute sinusitis is **amoxicillin** for most adults with uncomplicated disease, given its narrow spectrum, low cost, and strong evidence base [^46755339] [^f347cf0c]. Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate** when there is a higher risk of resistance, severe symptoms, recent antibiotic use, or concern for β-lactamase–producing organisms [^b92281ba] [^e674ee33]. For penicillin allergy, doxycycline is preferred; macrolides are not recommended due to high resistance [^notfound]. Treat for 5–7 days, as shorter courses are effective and reduce adverse effects [^c3b2a7aa] [^9b709bd3]. Reserve antibiotics for patients with persistent symptoms ≥ 10 days, severe symptoms, or worsening after initial improvement, and consider watchful waiting when appropriate [^3b365ed9] [^f2161b54].

## First-line antibiotic therapy

### Amoxicillin

- **Indication**: First-line for most adults with uncomplicated ABRS [^46755339] [^e674ee33].
- **Rationale**: Narrow spectrum, low cost, and strong evidence base [^46755339] [^f347cf0c].
- **Dosage**: 500 mg orally three times daily or 875 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days [^46755339] [^c3b2a7aa].

---

### Amoxicillin-clavulanate

- **Indication**: Preferred when resistance risk is higher, symptoms are severe, or there has been recent antibiotic use [^b92281ba] [^e674ee33].
- **Rationale**: Covers β-lactamase–producing organisms and resistant pneumococci [^af9a7f77].
- **Dosage**: 500/125 mg orally three times daily or 875/125 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days [^46755339] [^c3b2a7aa].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

### Penicillin allergy

In patients with a true penicillin allergy, **doxycycline** is preferred; macrolides are not recommended due to high resistance rates [^notfound].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Treat for **5–7 days**, as shorter courses are effective and associated with fewer adverse effects than longer courses [^c3b2a7aa] [^9b709bd3].

---

## Clinical considerations and guidelines

- **Watchful waiting**: Appropriate for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS, especially with mild symptoms and assured follow-up [^f2161b54] [^84d62a4c].
- **Indications for antibiotics**: Persistent symptoms ≥ 10 days, severe symptoms (fever ≥ 39°C, purulent discharge, facial pain ≥ 3 days), or worsening symptoms after initial improvement [^3b365ed9] [^9201df28].
- **Reassessment**: If no improvement after 3–5 days of antibiotics, reassess and consider changing therapy [^c61db5e6] [^7fa8adcc].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | First-line for uncomplicated ABRS | 500 mg TID or 875 mg BID | 5–7 days |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | - Higher resistance risk <br/> - Severe symptoms <br/> - Recent antibiotic use | 500/125 mg TID or 875/125 mg BID | 5–7 days |
| Doxycycline | Penicillin allergy | 100 mg BID | 5–7 days |

---

Amoxicillin is the **preferred first-line therapy** for uncomplicated ABRS, with amoxicillin-clavulanate reserved for higher-risk scenarios. Doxycycline is the alternative for penicillin allergy, and therapy should be limited to 5–7 days.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^f7f6a5e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^546dbd37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes, for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n of 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n of 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics (n of 17), where n is the number of trials. Most trials were conducted in otolaryngology settings. Only 8 trials described adequate allocation and concealment procedures; 20 were double-blind. Compared to control, penicillin improved clinical cures [relative risk (RR) 1.72; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.96]. Treatment with amoxicillin did not significantly improve cure rates (RR 2.06; 95% CI 0.65 to 6.53) but there was significant variability between studies. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. Comparisons between classes of antibiotics showed no significant differences: newer non-penicillins versus penicillins (RR for cure 1.07; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17); newer non-penicillins versus amoxicillin-clavulanate (RR for cure 1.03; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, dropouts due to adverse effects were significantly lower for cephalosporin antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73). Relapse rates within one month of successful therapy were 7.7%.

Reviewer's Conclusions

For acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed radiographically or by aspiration, current evidence is limited but supports the use of penicillin or amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. Clinicians should weigh the moderate benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^f347cf0c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up.Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups.In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis (...) [^69f64567]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 40-year-old woman presents with nasal congestion and purulent discharge for one week, with no improvement despite the use of over-the-counter medications. There is tenderness upon palpation over the maxillary sinuses. Clinical Question Should antibiotics be prescribed for acute maxillary sinusitis. Evidence-Based Answer Although there is some evidence that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis, this benefit is modest. Most patients with acute sinusitis improve within two weeks without antibiotics. The potential risk of adverse effects from antibiotics may outweigh the benefits of therapy. Adverse effects of antibiotics were common, ranging from 8 to 59 percent with penicillin and 23 to 56 percent with amoxicillin. The most common reported effects included diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and skin rash. A total of 51 studies were used to compare different classes of antibiotics in the treatment of acute sinusitis.

A statistically significant difference in overall effectiveness was not found, with the exception of amoxicillin/clavulanate, which had a significantly lower failure rate at seven to 15 days compared with cephalosporins. Another recent meta-analysis came to a similar conclusion. 3 The authors found that antibiotics, when compared with placebo, provide a higher rate of cure and faster improvement in symptoms from acute sinusitis, but that the benefit was of only modest clinical significance. They also found that antibiotics were associated with significantly more adverse effects. The authors concluded that a policy of universal prescribing of antibiotics for patients with acute sinusitis could not be endorsed, and that physicians should weigh each case individually and prescribe antibiotics when a bacterial etiology is more likely. However, the clinical significance of the result is equivocal, considering that cure or improvement rate was high in the placebo group and the antibiotic group. Based on six studies, in which clinical failure was defined as a lack of total cure, there was significant difference in favor of antibiotics compared with placebo, with a pooled RR of 0. 74 at seven to 15 days follow-up. None of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^f8df4b9a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and quality assessed trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to see whether or not the treatment was a failure. In meta-analysing the placebo-controlled studies, the data across antibiotic classes were combined. Primary outcomes were the clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow up.

Main Results

Fifty-seven studies were included in the review; six placebo-controlled studies and 51 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for comparison of antibiotics to placebo, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days follow up. These studies found a slight statistical difference in favor of antibiotics, compared to placebo, with a pooled RR of 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98). However, the clinical significance of the result is equivocal, also considering that cure or improvement rate was high in both the placebo group (80%) and the antibiotic group (90%). Based on six studies, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of total cure, there was significant difference in favor of antibiotics compared to placebo with a pooled RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.84) at 7 to 15 days follow up. None of the antibiotic preparations was superior to each other.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. However, 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improve within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population level.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^96aaa703]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children </=6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children >6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^385f5219]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease. Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or that worsen after 7-10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Comparison of antibiotics with placebo for treatment of acute sinusitis: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^0d33feb9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the therapeutic role of antibiotics for acute sinusitis compared with placebo. Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed and Scopus. 17 double-blind RCTs were included (three involving children). Acute sinusitis was diagnosed with clinical criteria in nine RCTs, imaging studies in six RCTs, and microbiological or laboratory methods in two RCTs. Amoxicillin was used in ten of 23 antibiotic treatment groups. To account for potential statistical heterogeneity between studies, a random-effects model was used for all analyses. Compared with placebo, antibiotics were associated with a higher rate of cure or improvement (2648 patients, odds ratio [OR] 1.64 [95% CI 1.35-2.00], data from 16 RCTs), or cure alone (1813 patients, OR 1.82 [1.34-2.46], 12 RCTs), but also with more adverse events (1963 patients, OR 1.87 [1.21-2.90], 12 RCTs). The rate of symptom resolution was faster with antibiotics in most RCTs. Disease complications, disease recurrence, and study withdrawals because of adverse events did not differ between compared treatments. In conclusion, use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis confers a small therapeutic benefit over placebo with a corresponding rise in the risk for adverse events. We suggest that antibiotics should be reserved for carefully selected patients with a higher probability for bacterial disease.

### Acute sinusitis in children: do antibiotics have any role? [^4ad6bfc1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Bacteria can be recovered from paranasal sinuses in the majority of patients given the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), and bacteriologic cure can be achieved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. The critical question is whether bacteriologic cure correlates with meaningful clinical endpoints such as clinical improvement, reduction in recurrent disease, or prevention of complications. Of the 4 pediatric placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PCRCTs), 2 suggest superiority of antibiotic treatment and 2 suggest lack of superiority. PCRCTs in adults are mixed as to clinical benefit. Pediatric and adult meta-analyses demonstrate modest benefit of antibiotic therapy and rates of spontaneous recovery without antibiotics of 60-65%. Although retrospective studies indicate that some patients who develop orbital or neurologic complications of sinusitis were pre-treated with antibiotic therapy, a low rate of complications precludes determination of whether antibiotic treatment prevents complications in some proportion of patients. Like the literature evidence, expert guideline recommendations are mixed. Although the evidence base is incomplete and conflicting, the limited data suggest that antibiotics probably do have a role in the treatment of pediatric ABS. The most compelling rationale is prevention of serious complications, but proof for this rationale is lacking.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^ce066305]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

### Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^18c65919]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common. Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach.

Design

For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness, included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered "cost-effective."

Measurements and Main Results

For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively); empirical antibiotics was cost-effective with higher prevalence. Sinus radiography-guided treatment was never cost-effective for initial treatment.

Conclusions

Use of a simple set of clinical criteria to guide treatment is a cost-effective strategy in most clinical settings. Empirical antibiotics are cost-effective in certain settings; however, their use results in many unnecessary prescriptions. If this resulted in increased antibiotic resistance, costs would substantially rise and efficacy would fall. Newer, expensive antibiotics are of limited value. Additional testing is not cost-effective. Further studies are needed to find an accurate,low-cost diagnostic test for acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^05bcd911]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults—initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician’s discretion and that “most” adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^6757e8cb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^c0975a90]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature <38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^00962b5c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of “a lot better” or “no symptoms” at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^4a04e655]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs)(–) and meta-analyses(–) demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting >12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS,(–) which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^4912c1a7]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline—antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Antibiotics for acute sinusitis in children: a meta-analysis [^24fd25e2]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Acute sinusitis is one of the leading causes of antibiotic prescriptions in children. No recent systematic reviews have examined the efficacy of antibiotics compared with placebo.

Objective

We sought to determine if antibiotics are superior to placebo in the treatment of acute sinusitis in children.

Data Sources

Medline and Embase were searched from their origin to July 2023.

Study Selection

We considered randomized placebo-controlled studies focusing on the treatment of acute sinusitis. In all studies, symptoms were present for <4 weeks and subjects were <18 years of age.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted the data. We pooled data primarily using fixed-effects models.

Results

Analysis of 6 included studies showed that antibiotic treatment reduced the rate of treatment failure by 41% (with a risk ratio of 0.59; 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.72) compared with placebo. There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 69.7%), which decreased substantially when the 1 study with a high risk of bias was removed (I2 = 26.9%). Children treated with antibiotics were 1.6 times more likely to have diarrhea than those who were not treated with antibiotics (risk ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.51).

Limitations

A small number of studies were eligible for inclusion. Included studies differed in their methodology.

Conclusions

In children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, antibiotics significantly reduced the rate of treatment failure compared with placebo. However, given the favorable natural history of sinusitis, our results could also support close observation without immediate antibiotic treatment.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^72938921]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^250c0f9f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions--especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended)--a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients. Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults." These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses.This paper describes the background and specific aims of and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used in conjunction with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years—initial management and antibiotics: The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for children with severe onset or worsening course, and should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the first-line treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is caregiver report of worsening or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management, and if the diagnosis is confirmed with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c3b2a7aa]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis—antibiotic duration and adverse events: the guideline recommends 5 to 7 days of empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected ABRS instead of 5 to 10 days, citing a systematic review finding no difference in clinical success for antibiotics given for 3 to 7 days versus 6 to 10 days and similar success when 5 days were compared with 10 days; adverse events are common with antibiotic therapy with an average event rate of 15% to 40%, and antibiotic therapy increases adverse event rate on average by 10% to 12% over placebo with an odds ratio of 1.8 to 2.1; the incidence of adverse events is lower when antibiotics are given for 5 days instead of 10 days (odds ratio, 0.79), so short courses should be considered for patients with less severe illness.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^3a0c87f9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics Key Action Statement 5B—For children with confirmed acute bacterial sinusitis who have worsening symptoms or fail to improve in 72 hours, clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment for the child initially managed with observation (Evidence Quality: D; Option based on expert opinion, case reports, and reasoning from first principles). For patients whose symptoms are mild and have failed to improve but have not worsened, initiation of antimicrobial agents or continued observation (for up to 3 days) is reasonable. If caregivers report worsening of symptoms at any time in a patient for whom observation was the initial intervention, the clinician should begin treatment as discussed in Key Action Statement 4. If caregivers report worsening of symptoms after 3 days in a patient initially treated with antimicrobial agents, current signs and symptoms should be reviewed to determine whether acute bacterial sinusitis is still the best diagnosis; if sinusitis remains the best diagnosis, infection with drug-resistant bacteria is probable and an alternate antimicrobial agent may be administered, and face-to-face reevaluation is desirable.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings.The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines,of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^71bd5881]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Additional observation for persistent onset acute bacterial sinusitis—The guideline recommends either antibiotic therapy or an additional brief period of observation as initial management for children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis, noting benefits to antibiotic therapy (number needed to treat, 3–5) while some children improve on their own and the risk of suppurative complications is low; benefits must also be balanced against an increased risk of adverse events (number need to harm, 3). Choosing between antibiotic therapy or additional observation presents an opportunity for shared decision-making with families. Children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis who received antibiotic therapy in the previous 4 weeks, those with concurrent bacterial infection (pneumonia, suppurative cervical adenitis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, or acute otitis media), those with actual or suspected complications, or those with underlying conditions should generally be managed with antibiotic therapy; the latter group includes children with asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, previous sinus surgery, or anatomic abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. Limiting antibiotic use in children who may improve on their own reduces common antibiotic-related adverse events, and in the most recent RCT adverse events were 44% with antibiotic and 14% with placebo.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^608c67b5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children—scope and key changes are defined as follows: Using stringent criteria, acute sinusitis has been observed in between 6% and 7% of children seeking care for respiratory symptoms. The revision focuses on diagnosis and management in children between 1 and 18 years of age and does not apply to children with subacute or chronic sinusitis; it does not consider neonates and children younger than 1 year or children with anatomic abnormalities of the sinuses, immunodeficiencies, cystic fibrosis, or primary ciliary dyskinesia. Changes from the 2001 guideline include addition of a clinical presentation designated as “worsening course,” inclusion of new data on antibiotic effectiveness, and evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary to identify those children who will benefit from antimicrobial therapy. The guideline is intended for use in a variety of clinical settings (eg, office, emergency department, hospital) by clinicians who treat pediatric patients, and it will be reviewed in 5 years unless new evidence emerges that warrants revision sooner.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis in children: a systematic review [^f1bba9e7]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics published clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) in children. The technical report accompanying those guidelines included 21 studies that assessed the diagnosis and management of ABS in children. This update to that report incorporates studies of pediatric ABS that have been performed since 2001. Overall, 17 randomized controlled trials of the treatment of sinusitis in children were identified and analyzed. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy have been published. The results of these studies varied, likely due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Because of this heterogeneity, formal meta-analyses were not performed. However, qualitative analysis of these studies suggests that children with greater severity of illness at presentation are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy. An additional 5 trials compared different antimicrobial therapies but did not include placebo groups. Six trials assessed a variety of ancillary treatments for ABS in children,and 3 focused on subacute sinusitis. Although the number of pediatric trials has increased since 2001, there are still limited data to guide the diagnosis and management of ABS in children. Diagnostic and treatment guidelines focusing on severity of illness at the time of presentation have the potential to identify those children most likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy and at the same time minimize unnecessary use of antibiotics

Antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis—rationale and indications note that "In the United States, antibiotics are prescribed for 82% of children with acute sinusitis," and support treatment based on recovery of bacteria "in high density (≥10^4 colony-forming units/mL) in 70% of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from children with a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both." Severe-onset cases are presumed bacterial because "a temperature of at least 39°C/102.2°F coexisting for at least 3 consecutive days with purulent nasal discharge is not consistent with the well-documented pattern of acute viral URI," and "children with worsening-course acute bacterial sinusitis have a clinical course that is also not consistent with the steady improvement that characterizes an uncomplicated viral URI"; additionally, "In both guidelines, however, children presenting with severe or worsening illness (which was not defined explicitly in the 2001 guideline) are to receive antibiotic therapy."

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^b79a5be6]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5—Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis—defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^dded5e71]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past 2 decades, and ABRS accounted for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995, ranking as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection, but bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms of at least 10 days duration. Important factors to consider when selecting an antibiotic regimen for ABRS include: severity of disease, rate of disease progression, earlier antibiotic treatment, regional resistance rates, and, in children, an age <5 years and attendance in day care centers. The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny in this era of emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, can no longer be considered dependable in this role. Rather, newer antibiotics may be called on to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

### Amoxicillin for acute rhinosinusitis: a randomized controlled trial [^64e2eac2]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence to support antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis is limited, yet antibiotics are commonly used.

Objective

To determine the incremental effect of amoxicillin treatment over symptomatic treatments for adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of adults with uncomplicated, acute rhinosinusitis were recruited from 10 community practices in Missouri between November 1, 2006, and May 1, 2009.

Interventions

Ten-day course of either amoxicillin (1500 mg/d) or placebo administered in 3 doses per day. All patients received a 5- to 7-day supply of symptomatic treatments for pain, fever, cough, and nasal congestion to use as needed.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was improvement in disease-specific quality of life after 3 to 4 days of treatment assessed with the Sinonasal Outcome Test-16 (minimally important difference of 0.5 units on a 0-3 scale). Secondary outcomes included the patient's retrospective assessment of change in sinus symptoms and functional status, recurrence or relapse, and satisfaction with and adverse effects of treatment. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interview at days 3, 7, 10, and 28.

Results

A total of 166 adults (36% male; 78% with white race) were randomized to amoxicillin (n = 85) or placebo (n = 81); 92% concurrently used 1 or more symptomatic treatments (94% for amoxicillin group vs 90% for control group; P = .34). The mean change in Sinonasal Outcome Test-16 scores was not significantly different between groups on day 3 (decrease of 0.59 in the amoxicillin group and 0.54 in the control group; mean difference between groups of 0.03 [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.19]) and on day 10 (mean difference between groups of 0.01 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.15]), but differed at day 7 favoring amoxicillin (mean difference between groups of 0.19 [95% CI, 0.024 to 0.35]). There was no statistically significant difference in reported symptom improvement at day 3 (37% for amoxicillin group vs 34% for control group; P = .67) or at day 10 (78% vs 80%, respectively; P = .71), whereas at day 7 more participants treated with amoxicillin reported symptom improvement (74% vs 56%, respectively; P = .02). No between-group differences were found for any other secondary outcomes. No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Among patients with acute rhinosinusitis, a 10-day course of amoxicillin compared with placebo did not reduce symptoms at day 3 of treatment.

### Patterns of care before and after the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline [^cb8a76c7]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Determine if patterns of care for acute sinusitis have changed after the publication of the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study with historical controls.

Methods

Cases of adult acute sinusitis occurring in 2005-2006 (before guideline publication) and 2009-2010 (>1 year after guideline publication) were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. Changes in the rates of analgesic recommendations, oral antibiotic prescriptions, and choice of antibiotic therapy were determined and compared before and after guideline publication and relative to guideline recommendations.

Results

An estimated 18.1 ± 1.8 million cases of adult acute sinusitis were studied before (7.9 ± 0.9 million visits for 2005-2006) and after (10.2 ± 1.5 million visits for 2009-2010) guideline publication. Recommendation rates for analgesics did not change significantly (18.9% before vs. 23.0% after, P=.470). The proportion of patients receiving oral antibiotics increased after guideline publication (75.5% before vs. 85.7% after, P=.021). In keeping with guideline recommendations, the proportion of patients treated with amoxicillin as the agent of choice when antibiotics are prescribed increased from 8.1% to 29.4% after guideline publication (P=.001).

Conclusions

Care patterns for the medical treatment of acute adult sinusitis have changed after guideline publication, with an increase in oral antibiotic prescription rates in cases of acute sinusitis and increase in the use of amoxicillin as the first-line antimicrobial agent. The latter is strongly in keeping with guideline recommendation. Clinicians' espousal of the analgesic recommendations likely needs improvement to better comply with guideline recommendations.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^c85542fa]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: clinical impact of resistance and susceptibility [^5b735db4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is a common disorder associated with notable direct and indirect economic costs. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a relatively poorly defined clinical syndrome characterized by a high spontaneous resolution rate, wide variations in presenting symptoms, and an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common causative pathogens in adult ABRS. A relative lack of bacteriological eradication data compared with other respiratory illnesses, uncertainty on the part of many clinicians as to when to treat, and increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance hamper logical treatment strategies. Because it is impossible to know which cases of ABRS will spontaneously resolve and which will not, antimicrobials are recommended. In general, antimicrobial treatment for ABRS should cover both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae while considering the risk of infection with resistant organisms. Treatment guidelines for ABRS were developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership in 2000 and were updated in 2004. This article discusses a Sinusitis Therapeutic Outcome Model, a data-driven model used in the development of the treatment guidelines, with respect to different scenarios involving ABRS to illustrate the implications of antimicrobial selection on therapeutic outcome.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^9ff8dfe9]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Role of antibiotics in sinusitis [^7fce2463]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sinusitis is a leading reason for outpatient antibiotic use, but symptoms are nonspecific. We review potential methods that might enhance the ability to appropriately prescribe antibiotics.

Recent Findings

The evidence base for antibiotic use in acute rhinosinusitis is strongest in studies with stringent entry criteria. In less restrictive studies antibiotics and placebo perform equally. Bacteria from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults correlate with sinus cultures. A recent study showed that antibiotics shortened the duration of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) symptoms in children. Tellingly, over 2000 children with symptoms were screened to enroll less than 10% who fulfilled the study's stringent criteria. In chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), two grade 1 studies on efficacy of long-term macrolide therapy showed conflicting results. Odontogenic sinusitis is underappreciated and frequently fails to grow on culture because of presumed difficulty in growing anaerobes.

Summary

There is currently no grade 1 evidence to support antibiotic use in CRS; however, studies to date have not been conducted in patients with isolated purulent sinusitis. Future use of cultures to direct antibiotic therapy, such as nasopharyngeal swabs in adults with ARS or endoscopically guided cultures, may aid in targeting antibiotic therapy more effectively.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children—initial management by severity: Children with persistent sinusitis may be managed with either an antibiotic or an additional brief period of observation, allowing up to another 3 days to improve, whereas all children diagnosed with severe or worsening sinusitis should start antibiotic treatment. Observation is reasonable because some episodes of persistent sinusitis may improve on their own, and antibiotics can have adverse effects including vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach, skin rash, allergic reactions, yeast infections, and development of resistant bacteria.

IDSA indicates Infectious Disease Society of America.

Of the 157 patients enrolled, the mean age was 48.5 (range, 18.7-84.0) years, and 117 (74.5%) were women. Seventy-nine patients were randomized to the standard-dose arm (60 women [76.0%]; mean [SD] age, 48.5 [16.2] years) and 78 to the high-dose arm (57 women [73.1%]; mean [SD] age, 48.5 [15.8] years). The other baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The only significant differences between treatment groups were a longer mean [SD] duration of illness in those randomized to the standard dose (17.1 [2.7] days) than the high dose (13.9 [1.4] days) and a higher percentage with allergic rhinitis in the standard-dose group (21 [26.6%] vs 10 [12.8%]). In line with the progressive loss to follow-up and the incomplete collection of data, the results in Table 2 provide the actual numerator and denominator for each outcome.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis [^a831942c]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Although antimicrobial treatment for children with acute sinusitis is used commonly, it is unclear whether it offers significant clinical benefit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments for acute sinusitis as they are used in community pediatric practice.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 3 community pediatric practices in St Louis, Missouri. A total of 188 patients who were between the ages of 1 and 18 years and who had had 10 to 28 days of persistent sinus symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of acute sinusitis were randomized to receive 14 days of amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/d in 3 daily doses), amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/d in 2 daily doses), or placebo. Change in sinus symptoms was assessed both by a quantitative symptom score (the S5 score) and subjectively by the parent. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects of treatment and recurrence or relapse of sinus symptoms. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews over a 2-month period.

Results

Of the 161 patients who were included in the analysis, 58 received amoxicillin, 48 received amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 55 received placebo. Day 14 improvement rates were 79%, 81%, and 79%, respectively. There were no differences in the 14-day change in S5 score among treatment groups. The rates of adverse events (amoxicillin, 19%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 11%; placebo, 10%), relapse (amoxicillin, 12%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 13%; placebo, 13%), and recurrence (amoxicillin, 9%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 13%; placebo, 13%) of sinus symptoms were similar among treatment groups.

Conclusion

Neither amoxicillin nor amoxicillin-clavulanate offered any clinical benefit compared with placebo for children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^75c77463]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is a common outpatient diagnosis and is typically treated with antibiotics even though the current recommended regimen (875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate by mouth twice a day)has been shown in clinical trials to provide only minimal benefit beyond placebo.The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends using high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate (containing amoxicillin 2000 mg rather than 875 mg twice a day) only when the prevalence in the community of penicillin-resistant pneumococci exceeds 10%.However, few primary care clinicians will know this prevalence, and evidence from studies in children of the penetration of amoxicillin into middle ear fluidand of the treatment of acute sinusitis with high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanatesuggests that higher-dose amoxicillin might provide more benefit to adults as well, even in areas with a low prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed from 2014 to 2017 comparing high-dose and standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate for adults with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis.That study confirmed that very few individuals carried resistant bacteria. The primary outcome was the participants’ subjective rating of improvement after 3 days of treatment, knowing that most people get better by 2 weeks but value rapid relief and that the benefit of other common treatments—eg, for streptococcal pharyngitisand influenza—is largely a quicker improvement. The study drug was the extended-release formulation of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. Midway through the trial, the manufacturer stopped producing all formulations of the study drug. The study drug was transitioned to a combination of standard immediate-release amoxicillin with clavulanate (875/125 mg) and immediate-release amoxicillin (875 mg) twice a day. Unexpectedly, the extended-release formulation provided no significant benefit, but the immediate-release formulation did; in the second, immediate-release part of the study, 52% of participants receiving the high dose rated symptoms as “a lot better” at the end of 3 days of treatment vs 34% receiving the standard dose (P =.04).

### Impact of first-line vs second-line antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis [^b7076a30]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Studies suggest little benefit in relief of acute sinusitis symptoms from the use of newer and more expensive (second-line) antibiotics instead of older and less expensive (first-line) antibiotics. However, researchers have failed to include development of complications and cost of care in their analyses.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and cost of first-line with second-line antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis in adults.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study using a pharmaceutical database containing demographic, clinical (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision), treatment, and charge information for 29 102 adults with a diagnosis of acute sinusitis receiving initial antibiotic treatment between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 1997.

Main Outcome Measures

Absence of additional claim for an antibiotic in the 28 days after the initial antibiotic, presence of a claim for a second antibiotic, serious complications of sinusitis, and direct charges and use for the acute sinusitis treatment.

Results

There were 17 different antibiotics prescribed in this study. The majority (59.5%) of patients received 1 of the first-line antibiotics. The overall success rate was 90.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0%-90.8%). The success rate for the 17 329 patients who received a first-line antibiotic was 90.1% and for the 11 773 patients who received a second-line antibiotic was 90.8%, a difference of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.01%-1.40%; P<.05). There were 2 cases of periorbital cellulitis, one in each treatment group. The average total direct charge for patients receiving a first-line antibiotic was $68.98 and a second-line antibiotic was $135.17, a difference of $66.19 (95% CI, $64.95-$67.43; P<.001). This difference was due entirely to the difference in charge of antibiotics and not other charges, such as professional fees, laboratory tests, or emergency department visits.

Conclusions

Patients treated with a first-line antibiotic for acute uncomplicated sinusitis did not have clinically significant differences in outcomes vs those treated with a second-line antibiotic. However, cost of care was significantly higher for patients treated with a second-line antibiotic.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^a084cb14]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, we did not find a benefit to patients of treating clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis with high-dose rather than standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. This finding is disappointing because the IDSA-recommended standard dosehas a limited effect (vs placebo).This outcome is also surprising in light of the promising results of the previous trial.

Why would we get such very different results? First, the current trial suffered from an incomplete collection of data (although mostly for the secondary outcomes). Yet these missing data cannot explain such a pronounced lack of benefit. A best-case analysis of the missing primary outcomes made only a modest difference. We found no important changes in baseline characteristics in the participants who remained at the end of days 3 and 10, and it seemed futile to continue recruitment to achieve the planned number of participants. Second, the 2 groups were not completely similar at baseline. Standard-dose participants reported a longer average duration of illness; therefore, more of them might have had spontaneous improvement unrelated to antibiotic dose by the end of day 3. However, the actual impact of duration of illness appeared to be minimal. In addition, even if an effect of allergic rhinitis in diminishing the response to antibiotics had been found, it would have reduced primary outcomes in more participants in the standard-dose group. Third, one or both of the studies may have suffered from a randomly skewed, nonrepresentative sample of participants. Whatever the explanation, the addition of the current participants to those from our previous study reduced the benefit of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate to statistical nonsignificance.

Three secondary findings are of interest. First, the frequency of diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections was quite high, even though most cases were mild.Second, patients who reported they were prone to adverse effects were more likely to experience them. Whether or not this outcome represented a self-fulfilling prophecy, this information would seem important when discussing with patients the pros and cons of antibiotic treatment. Third, the large number of patients with presumed penicillin allergy (Figure 1) underlines the need for more widespread testing for penicillin allergy. As shown in multiple studies,, most of these patients do not have, or no longer have, an allergy to penicillin and can benefit from having the option of treatment with a penicillin.

### Principles of judicious antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections in pediatrics [^49e75691]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Most upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses and require no antibiotics. This clinical report focuses on antibiotic prescribing strategies for bacterial upper respiratory tract infections, including acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. The principles for judicious antibiotic prescribing that are outlined focus on applying stringent diagnostic criteria, weighing the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy, and understanding situations when antibiotics may not be indicated. The principles can be used to amplify messages from recent clinical guidelines for local guideline development and for patient communication; they are broadly applicable to antibiotic prescribing in general.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^6e6c4945]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7-84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms," as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P=.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^b898ef72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to June week 2, 2011) and EMBASE (January 2009 to June 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Four RCTs with a total of 1008 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged studies to be of moderate methodological quality. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants received oral antibiotics and were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in three trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In all trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at Days 3 to 7, risk ratio (RR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8; risk difference (RD) 20% (6% to 34%) and at Days 4 to 10 or 12, RR 1.3, 95% CI (1.0 to 1.7), RD 18% (3% to 33%). An analysis of the three trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: Days 3 to 6: RR 1.2, 95% CI (1.1 to 1.4), RD 12% (5% to 19%) and Days 4 to 10 or 12: RR 1.1, 95% CI (1.0 to 1.2), RD 10% (3% to 16%). Scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids). We did not identify any data on the long-term effects of oral corticosteroids on this condition, such as effects on relapse or recurrence rates. Reported side effects of oral corticosteroids were limited and mild.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are effective for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis. However, data are limited and there is a significant risk of bias. High quality trials assessing the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids both as an adjuvant and a monotherapy in primary care patients with acute sinusitis should be initiated.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^d48c30b5]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis—acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and macrolide therapy—are characterized by limited evidence for antibiotics in AE-CRS, with only one small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial reporting similar overall improvement in 2 weeks for amoxicillin–clavulanate twice-daily (n = 21) versus placebo (n = 11), both groups receiving saline rinses and topical steroids, and the study powered to detect a 10% difference at the 14 day mark; a retrospective study found no difference in quality of life between culture-driven versus empiric antibiotics, although long-term endoscopy scores improved with culture-driven therapy; current guidance notes the evidence does not strongly support antibiotics in AE-CRS and makes no specific recommendations. Macrolide antibiotics—a special circumstance—have short-term use not generally recommended for acute sinusitis, but long-term use may be considered for patients with non-type 2 CRS; only 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized long-term trials exist, with roxithromycin significantly improving symptoms and nasal endoscopy in CRSsNP, whereas a 12-week course of weekly azithromycin failed to show end-of-course improvement but 12 weeks post-completion 50% reported improvement or cure versus 9% with placebo; studies suggest that in CRS without nasal polyposis, with near-normal eosinophil counts, and resistant to corticosteroid therapy, macrolides may be a therapeutic option.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^6ca9c7b5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^fb734ce7]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children and adolescents.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline (2001).

Results

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) presents with (1) persistent illness (nasal discharge [of any quality] or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement), (2) a worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement), or (3) severe onset (concurrent fever[temperature ≥39°C/102.2°F] and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days). Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI, because they do not contribute to the diagnosis; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications. The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the firstline treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening(progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management.If the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed in a child with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, then clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include the addition of a clinical presentation designated as “worsening course,” an option to treat immediately or observe children with persistent symptoms for 3 days before treating, and a review of evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary in children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0e917a22]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute sinusitis is a common condition in ambulatory care, where it is frequently treated with antibiotics, despite little evidence of their benefit. Intranasal corticosteroids might relieve symptoms; however, evidence for this benefit is currently unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on the symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases until February 2011 for studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids with placebo in children or adults having clinical symptoms and signs of acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in ambulatory settings. We excluded chronic/allergic sinusitis. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' methodologic quality.

Results

We included 6 studies having a total of 2,495 patients. In 5 studies, antibiotics were prescribed in addition to corticosteroids or placebo. Intranasal corticosteroids resulted in a significant, small increase in resolution of or improvement in symptoms at days 14 to 21 (risk difference [RD] = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.13). Analysis of individual symptom scores revealed most consistently significant benefits for facial pain and congestion. Subgroup analysis by time of reported outcomes showed a significant beneficial effect at 21 days (RD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.17), but not at 14 to 15 days (RD = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11). Meta-regression analysis of trials using different doses of mometasone furoate showed a significant dose-response relationship (P=.02).

Conclusions

Intranasal corticosteroids offer a small therapeutic benefit in acute sinusitis, which may be greater with high doses and with courses of 21 days' duration. Further trials are needed in antibiotic-naïve patients.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^85b082f7]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Beginning antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis and choosing the right treatment [^f702da10]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is an extremely common problem in both children and adults. There are three clinical presentations of acute sinusitis: (1) onset with persistent symptoms (nasal symptoms or cough or both for > 10 but < 30 d without evidence of improvement); (2) onset with severe symptoms (high fever and purulent nasal discharge for 3-4 consecutive days); and (3) onset with worsening symptoms (respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, which worsen after several days of improvement). Images to confirm the presence of acute sinusitis are necessary in older children (> 6 years) and adults to enhance the certainty of diagnosis. The predominant bacterial species that are implicated in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. In the last decade, there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Although there has been some controversy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ABS, most studies in which the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed with images and appropriate anti-biotics are prescribed show superior outcomes in recipients of antibiotics. Therapy may be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In penicillin-allergic patients or those who are unresponsive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate. Alternatives include cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir. In cases of serious drug allergy, clarithromycin or azithromycin may be prescribed. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Some recommend treatment until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 d.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^af9a7f77]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics—acute bacterial sinusitis first-line therapy in children: Amoxicillin remains the antimicrobial agent of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis when antimicrobial resistance is not suspected. For children aged 2 years or older with mild to moderate uncomplicated disease who do not attend child care and have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent within the last 4 weeks, amoxicillin is recommended at 45 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses. In communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (>10%), treatment may be initiated at 80 to 90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose. Patients with moderate to severe illness or those younger than 2 years, attending child care, or recently treated with an antimicrobial may receive high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 80–90 mg/kg per day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg per day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose; potassium clavulanate levels are adequate to inhibit β-lactamase–producing H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Risk factors for resistance include attendance at child care, antimicrobial treatment within the previous 30 days, and age younger than 2 years.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3
