## Question

What are the optimal testosterone levels to achieve in patients on ADT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal testosterone level to achieve in patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical definition of castration and how it was measured. Then, I should verify what contemporary data say about lower thresholds and outcomes. Next, I will reconcile guideline positions and expert consensus. After that, I need to consider disease-state nuances and assay methodology. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with monitoring details and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the historical benchmark. Traditionally, castration has been defined as serum testosterone less than 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L), a threshold derived from older immunoassays and embedded in major guidelines, including NCCN, which still anchor castration at less than 50 ng/dL and recommend intensifying therapy if this level is not achieved [^1173ZWyW] [^114PP6qm] [^114VT2uF].

> Wait, let me verify whether lower targets improve outcomes. Multiple contemporary studies and expert panels suggest that pushing testosterone lower than the legacy 50 ng/dL threshold is associated with better oncologic outcomes, with a commonly cited target of less than 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) supported by PR-7 and other analyses showing improved cause-specific survival and delayed progression with nadirs at or below this level [^1123UJL5] [^113Uz7Dh] [^112qN1jC].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic rationale and assay implications. Modern mass spectrometry shows that bilateral orchiectomy yields median testosterone around 15 ng/dL, supporting the concept that truly profound suppression lies below 20 ng/dL; moreover, MS-based work identified an even lower optimal cut point around 0.27 nmol/L (about 8 ng/dL) linked to delayed castration resistance, though this requires validation and access to high-sensitivity assays [^112qN1jC] [^112UJXee].

> I need to check how guidelines reconcile these data. NCCN maintains the less than 50 ng/dL definition but advises checking testosterone 12 weeks after starting LHRH therapy and again if PSA rises, and it acknowledges that the optimal castration level remains unsettled. Expert consensus panels, in contrast, frequently recommend a stricter target of less than 20 ng/dL for mCSPC and mCRPC, with uniform agreement to continue ADT indefinitely and to monitor testosterone at progression to confirm castrate status [^1173ZWyW] [^1166f6hx] [^116PQr3g] [^115daJ6a].

> Let me consider disease-state nuances. In metastatic castration-sensitive disease, many experts favor a less than 20 ng/dL target and emphasize combination therapy rather than ADT monotherapy. In mCRPC, maintaining castrate levels less than 20 ng/dL is standard, and confirming castration at the time of CRPC diagnosis is essential to avoid misclassification. In localized settings treated with ADT plus radiotherapy, data are mixed, with one trial not showing added benefit for pushing below 20 ng/dL, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize [^1166f6hx] [^113ubpsD] [^116PQr3g] [^116NSQkc] [^112bo5D2].

> I should double-check assay issues because they materially affect interpretation. Immunoassays can be inaccurate at very low testosterone concentrations. LC-MS/MS is preferred for ADT monitoring, and clinicians should coordinate with laboratories to ensure appropriate lower limits of quantification and use consistent methods over time to allow meaningful comparisons [^116NSQkc] [^112UJXee].

> Next, I should review practical monitoring cadence. A reasonable approach is to obtain a baseline testosterone, recheck at about 12 weeks to confirm adequate suppression, and then monitor periodically and whenever PSA rises to distinguish noncastrate from castrate progression. If testosterone exceeds 20 ng/dL, evaluate adherence, consider switching from an agonist to an antagonist, or add an antiandrogen, recognizing that the clinical benefit of further intensification beyond achieving castration is uncertain in some contexts [^1173ZWyW] [^1166f6hx] [^116NSQkc].

> But wait, what about intermittent ADT and testosterone recovery dynamics. Intermittent strategies hinge on testosterone recovery during off-treatment intervals, with median times to normalization often exceeding 6–9 months and longer durations of prior ADT slowing recovery; this matters for interpreting PSA during off periods and for counseling on side-effect trade-offs, and it reinforces why continuous ADT is favored in higher-risk disease [^112h2XfQ] [^114kLwVP] [^114inEke].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not overstating. The conservative, guideline-concordant minimum is to achieve and maintain testosterone less than 50 ng/dL; however, the weight of contemporary evidence and expert opinion supports a stricter target of less than 20 ng/dL when feasible, with recognition that even lower nadirs may confer additional benefit in some settings and that assay choice and consistency are critical to accurate assessment and longitudinal management [^1173ZWyW] [^113Uz7Dh] [^112UJXee].

> Final clinical recommendation: Aim for profound suppression with a target testosterone less than 20 ng/dL in patients on ADT, confirm achievement early with appropriate assays, maintain castrate levels throughout the disease course including mCRPC, and individualize toward even lower nadirs when supported by high-sensitivity testing and clinical context, while acknowledging that the historical less than 50 ng/dL threshold remains the guideline baseline and that evidence for pushing below 20 ng/dL is strongest in advanced disease [^1166f6hx] [^116PQr3g] [^1173ZWyW] [^112UJXee].

---

The optimal testosterone level on ADT is **< 20 ng/dL** [^113Uz7Dh] (0.7 nmol/L), as this threshold is associated with improved survival and delayed progression compared with the historical < 50 ng/dL cut-off [^1123UJL5] [^112UJXee]. NCCN still defines castration as **< 50 ng/dL** [^114PP6qm], but many experts recommend targeting **< 20 ng/dL** when feasible [^1166f6hx]. Testosterone should be monitored at 12 weeks after starting ADT [^1173ZWyW] and at each PSA rise to ensure castration is maintained; if testosterone exceeds 20 ng/dL, consider switching therapy or adding an antiandrogen [^1166f6hx].

---

## Historical definition of castration levels

Historically, castration has been defined as **testosterone < 50 ng/dL** [^112qN1jC] (< 1.7 nmol/L), based on older immunoassays with limited sensitivity at low levels [^112qN1jC]. This threshold has long guided clinical practice and remains the NCCN benchmark [^1173ZWyW].

---

## Contemporary evidence supporting lower testosterone targets

Recent data indicate that **lower testosterone levels correlate with better outcomes**:

- **PR-7 trial**: Nadir testosterone ≤ 0.7 nmol/L (< 20 ng/dL) within the first year of ADT was associated with improved cause-specific survival and delayed hormone resistance [^1123UJL5].
- **Mass spectrometry study**: Patients with testosterone < 0.27 nmol/L (< 8 ng/dL) had significantly longer time to castration resistance than those with higher levels [^112UJXee].
- **Meta-analysis**: Lower nadir testosterone (< 0.7 nmol/L) was linked to improved survival and delayed progression [^notfound].

These findings support a **target of < 20 ng/dL** when achievable [^113Uz7Dh].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines reflect evolving evidence:

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommended testosterone target** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| NCCN | < 50 ng/dL (< 1.7 nmol/L) | Historical standard; consider intensification if not achieved [^1173ZWyW] |
| Expert consensus panels | < 20 ng/dL (< 0.7 nmol/L) | Recommended for mCSPC and mCRPC when feasible [^1166f6hx] |
| EAU guidelines | Monitor testosterone regularly; ensure castration levels maintained | Emphasizes ongoing monitoring and adjustment [^113GyGjc] |

---

## Clinical implications of achieving lower testosterone levels

Achieving **< 20 ng/dL** is associated with:

- **Improved survival**: Better cause-specific and overall survival in multiple cohorts [^1123UJL5] [^113Uz7Dh].
- **Delayed progression**: Longer time to castration resistance and slower disease progression [^1123UJL5] [^113Uz7Dh].
- **Enhanced therapy response**: Greater sensitivity to androgen receptor–targeted agents and chemotherapy [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Effective ADT requires **routine testosterone monitoring**:

- **Initial monitoring**: Check testosterone at 12 weeks after starting ADT [^1173ZWyW] [^116NSQkc].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Recheck at each PSA rise or clinical progression to confirm castration [^1173ZWyW] [^1166f6hx].
- **Management of elevated levels**: If testosterone rises above 20 ng/dL, consider switching therapy (e.g. LHRH antagonist) or adding an antiandrogen [^1173ZWyW] [^1166f6hx].

---

## Variability in testosterone measurement methods

Assay choice affects accuracy at low levels: **immunoassays** can be inaccurate below 50 ng/dL, risking underestimation of residual androgens [^116NSQkc], whereas **mass spectrometry** provides precise quantification at very low levels and is preferred when available [^112UJXee].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring individualized targets

Certain scenarios may warrant **individualized targets**:

- **High-risk disease**: Consider stricter targets (< 20 ng/dL) to optimize outcomes [^113Uz7Dh].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and treatment goals may influence the target and monitoring frequency [^113Uz7Dh].
- **Intermittent ADT**: Requires careful monitoring during off-treatment periods to balance recovery and control [^113JWwgp].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of achieving very low testosterone levels

Lower testosterone increases **ADT-related toxicities**, including:

- **Bone loss**: Higher fracture risk; monitor bone density and use calcium/vitamin D and bisphosphonates as indicated [^116YAayP].
- **Metabolic effects**: Increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dyslipidemia; monitor and manage proactively [^111awdEq].
- **Quality of life**: Fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and mood changes; address with supportive care and patient counseling [^114oxm5S].

---

## Summary of evidence and recommendations

- **Optimal target**: < 20 ng/dL (< 0.7 nmol/L) when feasible, given improved survival and delayed progression [^1123UJL5] [^112UJXee].
- **Minimum standard**: < 50 ng/dL (< 1.7 nmol/L) per NCCN [^1173ZWyW].
- **Monitoring**: Regular testosterone checks (e.g. 12 weeks after initiation, then at PSA rise) to ensure castration is maintained [^1173ZWyW] [^113GyGjc].
- **Assay selection**: Prefer mass spectrometry for accurate low-level measurement when available [^116NSQkc] [^112UJXee].

---

The optimal testosterone level on ADT is **< 20 ng/dL** when achievable, balancing oncologic benefit with toxicity; maintain at least **< 50 ng/dL** per guidelines, and monitor regularly to guide therapy adjustments [^113Uz7Dh] [^114PP6qm].

Background/Objective

The optimal prognostic value of testosterone following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is controversial. We studied the effect of serum testosterone levels on clinical outcome in localized prostate cancer (PCa) treated with ADT and high-dose radiotherapy (HRT).

Patients and Methods

The DART01/05 trial randomized 355 men with intermediate and high-risk PCa to 4 months of ADT plus HRT (STADT, N = 178) or the same treatment followed by 24 months of ADT (LTADT, N = 177). This study included patients treated with LTADT who had at least 3 determinations of testosterone during ADT (N = 154). Patients were stratified into 3 subgroups by testosterone level: minimum < 20 ng/dL; median 20–49 ng/dL; and maximum ≥ 50 ng/dL. Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression analysis were used for overall survival (OS) and Fine & Gray regression model for metastasis free survival (MFS), biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) and time to TT recovery.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences in 10-year bDFS, MFS, or OS between the < 20 ng/mL and 20–49 ng/dL subgroups. Multivariate analysis showed that a median testosterone ≥ 50 ng/dL was significantly associated with a decrease in bDFS (HR: 6.58, 95%CI 1.28–33.76, p = 0.03). Time to testosterone recovery after ADT did not correlate with bDFS, MFS, or OS and was not significantly associated with any of the testosterone subgroups.

Conclusions

Our results do not support the concept that additional serum testosterone suppression below 20 ng/dL is associated with better outcomes than 20–49 ng/dL. Time to testosterone recovery after ADT and HRT did not impact clinical failure.

For hypogonadal men treated with testosterone, the goal is to ensure that benefits are optimized, risks are minimized, and any adverse effects are identified early and managed appropriately. This can best be achieved by careful patient selection, excluding men with contraindications and addressing any modifiable risk factors in those at increased risk. A standardized plan should be used for monitoring that includes evaluation of symptoms, side effects, adherence, and measurement of testosterone and hematocrit. Shared decision making should be used to determine whether to screen for prostate cancer and informed by age, baseline cancer risk, and patient preference.

### Relugolix plus radiotherapy in localized or advanced prostate cancer… [^116wZeMS]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

bTime to testosterone recovery-free survival was defined as the time from 1 day after the last dose of relugolix or 4 weeks plus 1 day after the last dose of degarelix to testosterone recovery. Testosterone recovery was defined as testosterone levels back to baseline or more than 280 ng/dL, whichever occurred first. It was censored for patients initiating alternative ADT without recovery at the last testosterone laboratory assessment before the initiation of ADT. Twelve weeks post–short-term relugolix, 34 achieved testosterone levels to baseline or more than 280 ng/dL. Ninety days post longer-term ADT, mean testosterone levels were 310. 5 ng/dL vs
53. 0 ng/dL among the subset assessed for testosterone recovery.

The primary end point assessed for patients receiving longer-term ADT was the sustained castration rate, which was defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression below castrate levels from week 5 through week 48. Secondary end points reported for patients receiving longer-term ADT with radiotherapy included the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression of less than 50 ng/dL on day 4 and day 15, cumulative probability of profound testosterone suppression on day 15, time to castration resistant-free survival, the proportion of patients with a PSA response on day 15 followed with confirmation on day 29, mean FSH level at the end of week 24, mean time to testosterone suppression, and mean testosterone levels 90 days after treatment cessation among the patients assessed for testosterone recovery.

Treatment with GnRH receptor agonists for even just 6 months has been shown to have a 19-month time to testosterone recovery, with approximately 30% of men not achieving normal testosterone levels within 18 months. 20 In men receiving long-term ADT, it takes multiple years. to recover normal T levels, with 47% of men not recovering normal testosterone levels within 2 years. 21 In contrast, even after 48 weeks of relugolix treatment, most men recovered to normal testosterone levels within 90 days after discontinuing ADT. 15.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

### Changing paradigms in management of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) [^113oRqGD]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

It is amazing that we have turned around in the past few years from calling progressive metastatic prostate cancer-hormone refractory to castrate resistant disease. We now realize that the optimal hormone suppression in the past was not adequate. With a variety of better androgen receptor blockers and targets, we are now at a point where we can continue to improve the efficacy of these agents. Should we stop LHRH agents once we use these agents, what is the ideal testosterone level that we need to achieve, what level would correlate with response, are there markers that are better than testosterone and many more? Future research should be directed towards optimizing efficacy through less toxic combinations and should ultimately make a difference in improving the survival and quality of life of our patients.

### The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications [^114uHX19]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2023). High credibility.

The discovery of the benefits of castration for prostate cancer treatment in 1941 led to androgen deprivation therapy, which remains a mainstay of the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. However, as early as this original publication, the inevitable development of castration-resistant prostate cancer was recognized. Resistance first manifests as a sustained rise in the androgen-responsive gene, PSA, consistent with reactivation of the androgen receptor axis. Evaluation of clinical specimens demonstrates that castration-resistant prostate cancer cells remain addicted to androgen signalling and adapt to chronic low-testosterone states. Paradoxically, results of several studies have suggested that treatment with supraphysiological levels of testosterone can retard prostate cancer growth. Insights from these studies have been used to investigate administration of supraphysiological testosterone to patients with prostate cancer for clinical benefits, a strategy that is termed bipolar androgen therapy (BAT). BAT involves rapid cycling from supraphysiological back to near-castration testosterone levels over a 4-week cycle. Understanding how BAT works at the molecular and cellular levels might help to rationalize combining BAT with other agents to achieve increased efficacy and tumour responses.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Nadir testosterone within first year of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) predicts for time to castration-resistant progression: a secondary analysis of the PR-7 trial of intermittent versus continuous ADT [^1123UJL5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Three small retrospective studies have suggested that patients undergoing continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) have superior survival and time to progression if lower castrate levels of testosterone (< 0.7 nmol/L) are achieved. Evidence from prospective large studies has been lacking.

Patients and Methods

The PR-7 study randomly assigned patients experiencing biochemical failure after radiation therapy or surgery plus radiation therapy to CAD or intermittent androgen deprivation. The relationship between testosterone levels in the first year and cause-specific survival (CSS) and time to androgen-independent progression in men in the CAD arm was evaluated using Cox regression.

Results

There was a significant difference in CSS (P = 0.015) and time to hormone resistance (P = 0.02) among those who had first-year minimum nadir testosterone ≤ 0.7, > 0.7 to ≤ 1.7, and ≥ 1.7 nmol/L. Patients with first-year nadir testosterone consistently > 0.7 nmol/L had significantly higher risks of dying as a result of disease (0.7 to 1.7 nmol/L: hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.38; > 1.7 nmol/L: HR, 2.93; 95% CI, 0.70 to 12.30) and developing hormone resistance (0.7 to 1.7 nmol/L: HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.18; ≥ 1.7 nmol/L: HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.77 to 4.70). Maximum testosterone ≥ 1.7 nmol/L predicted for a higher risk of dying as a result of disease (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Low nadir serum testosterone (ie, < 0.7 mmol/L) within the first year of androgen-deprivation therapy correlates with improved CSS and duration of response to androgen deprivation in men being treated for biochemical failure undergoing CAD.

### Role of testosterone in managing advanced prostate cancer [^115empwh]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy is frequently used to treat patients with advanced prostate cancer. New therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have drawn increased attention to serum and intratumoral testosterone levels. The present review examines the role of testosterone in prostate cancer progression, discusses the nuances and potential pitfalls in measuring serum testosterone using available assays, and summarizes current data relevant to the arguments for and against achieving and maintaining the lowest possible testosterone levels during androgen deprivation therapy, including the adverse effects of such treatment. Incorporating this information, we have made recommendations incorporating testosterone evaluation and its effect on the clinical decision-making process.

### Pattern of testosterone recovery after androgen deprivation therapy… [^1157vKSN]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Existing studies have reported a wide range of average testosterone recovery intervals and rates of non-recovery, with recent meta-analysis suggesting that a large fraction of patients may never recover to normal testosterone levels after ADT. Patient characteristics including age, race/ethnicity, stage/PSA/Gleason score at diagnosis, duration of ADT, and testosterone levels were collected. Time to Testosterone Recovery was estimated based on date and duration of last dose of leuprolide injection to date on which testosterone rose to laboratory-defined normal limits. TTR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox-Proportional Hazard models using. After a median follow-up time of 33. 4 months, 413 men achieved testosterone recovery with a mean TTR of
15. 6 months and a median TTR of 9. 4 months. Risk factors for non-recovery include age > 80 years, and duration of ADT > 6 months. Marginal difference in risk of non-recovery was observed when considering race/ethnicity as a whole. However, compared to AA, API had a delayed median TTR. For men who achieved testosterone recovery, no significant difference in TTR between ADT ≤ 6 months versus > 6 months was observed. Conclusions: Although over 50% of men never achieved testosterone recovery, we observed a median TTR of 9 months in men who achieved TTR. Risk factors for non-recovery include age > 80 years and long-term ADT use. Surprisingly, among men who achieved testosterone recovery, there was no difference in TTR with respect to ADT duration. Larger multi-institutional datasets are needed to confirm these findings and help inform patients on risk factors that impact probability of testosterone recovery.

Monitoring of testosterone-replacement therapy — evaluation and laboratory schedule: In hypogonadal men who have started testosterone therapy, we recommend evaluating the patient after treatment initiation to assess whether the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering any adverse effects, and is complying with the treatment regimen (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Clinicians should maintain serum testosterone concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal range for healthy young men, evaluate symptoms and formulation-specific adverse events at each visit, and measure testosterone and hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, at 12 months, and annually thereafter; for those who choose prostate monitoring, include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — treatment goals and monitoring: We recommend testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of testosterone deficiency. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Kinetics of serum androgen normalization and factors associated with testosterone reserve after limited androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer [^112a6M9a]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Groups have investigated time to testosterone recovery in patients who have undergone androgen deprivation therapy, usually by measuring androgen every 3 months, with varying results. To our knowledge this represents the largest study using monthly testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone measurement to evaluate the kinetics of androgen recovery following limited androgen deprivation therapy.

Materials and Methods

Monthly serum androgen levels were analyzed following 2, 6-month cycles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy as part of a randomized, placebo controlled study of the role of thalidomide in delaying time to prostate specific androgen progression.

Results

By the Kaplan-Meier method the median time to testosterone normalization in cycles 1 vs 2 was 15.4 vs 18.3 weeks with similar dihydroxytestosterone recovery times. Neither on-study prostate specific antigen, Gleason score nor thalidomide treatment had a significant impact on time to testosterone normalization. However, in cycle 1 men with low baseline dihydroxytestosterone and those who were more than 67 years old had significantly longer time to T normalization on Cox model analysis. Additionally, in cycle 2 patients with prior local radiation therapy had longer time to testosterone normalization, although this was no longer significant on Cox model analysis. Cox model analysis in cycle 2 showed that low baseline dihydroxytestosterone and testosterone, low testosterone nadir and white race were associated with longer time to testosterone normalization.

Conclusions

Findings of delayed testosterone recovery may be useful for designing and analyzing clinical trials of limited androgen deprivation therapy and for estimating the duration of treatment associated side effects in patients undergoing limited androgen deprivation therapy.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^111NCitH]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring in prostate cancer patients on testosterone therapy — states that prostate cancer patients on testosterone therapy should have their PSA levels monitored on the same schedule as men without testosterone deficiency; however, clinicians may choose to increase the frequency of testing. PSA recurrence in men on testosterone therapy should be evaluated in the same fashion as untreated men, and a discussion regarding the benefit of stopping testosterone therapy should include the possibility of a decline in PSA.

### The timing and extent of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: weighing the clinical evidence [^111SUz8c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective means of palliating symptoms of prostate cancer but is associated with significant toxicities that increase with treatment duration. Primary ADT in men with localized disease provides no survival advantage. Neoadjuvant ADT, when combined with external beam radiation, improves survival for men with locally advanced disease. Immediate adjuvant androgen deprivation does not seem to benefit most men undergoing radical prostatectomy. No evidence supports combined androgen blockade or monotherapy with nonsteroidal antiandrogens for locally advanced prostate cancer. ADT with orchiectomy or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists is standard care for men with metastatic prostate cancer.

64% Yes, 36% No

In mCSPC, baseline T levels should be obtained before starting ADT.

100% Yes

For ADT administration, testosterone level should be T < 20 ng/dL. Confirm castrate T levels 1‐4 months after surgical/medical castration, regardless of PSA levels. If PSA rises, T levels must be checked. If T levels are > 20 ng/dL, clinicians should check luteinizing hormone levels to differentiate whether ADT was administered effectively.

100% Yes

In mCSPC, if T > 20 ng/dL despite low luteinizing hormone levels, consider switching to an alternative agent.

100% Yes

In the broad mCSPC population, ADT + Abi is superior to ADT alone in terms of OS.

100% Yes

In mCSPC, the distinction between low‐ and high‐volume disease has not been studied in this context. Thus, ADT + Abi is a reasonable standard of care irrespective of metastatic burden.

86% Yes, 14% Indeterminate

In the broad mCSPC population, ADT + docetaxel is superior to ADT alone in terms of OS.
In high‐volume mCSPC, there is an unequivocal OS benefit to ADT + docetaxel vs ADT alone.
In low‐volume mCSPC, there is no clear OS benefit to ADT + docetaxel vs ADT alone.
Docetaxel treatment can start 6 to 16 weeks after ADT, to avoid toxicities

100% Yes

In low‐volume mCSPC, there is evidence that ADT + docetaxel does not provide an OS benefit; thus, ADT + Abi is the favored choice.

93% Yes, 7% No

In high‐volume mCSPC, there is strong evidence of benefit for ADT + docetaxel. Thus, both ADT + abiraterone or ADT + docetaxel are treatment options.

100% Yes

The panel cannot comment on the comparative efficacy of ADT + Abi in low‐ vs high‐volume mCSPC, because this has not been studied.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^117EwbW6]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

Regarding optimal timing of ADT (immediate vs delayed), the literature does not suggest clear evidence to support timing of ADT in patients with BCR post‐RP/XRT, who are node‐positive after RP, with locally advanced, rising PSA or who are not candidates for definitive therapy, or undergoing adjuvant therapy. 17, 33, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 Given the unclear benefit of early ADT in patients with BCR and the known medical sequelae of chronic ADT, this therapy should be reserved for patients exhibiting high‐risk features.

While the NCCN guideline states that intermittent ADT should be considered in this setting, the panel indicated no clear preference for intermittent vs continuous ADT therapy post‐RP/RT. 9 Data from one study suggest that intermittent ADT is not inferior to continuous ADT in nonmetastatic PC in terms of OS and time to progression. The number of PC‐related deaths was higher in the intermittent group but the difference was not statistically significant. The number of PC‐unrelated deaths was higher in the continuous treatment group. Intermittent ADT may offer some benefit in terms of quality of life (sexual desire, less fatigue), as well as less cost and more convenience. 47 The panel reached a consensus that intermittent ADT is a reasonable alternative to continuous ADT in high‐risk patients with BCR post‐RP/RT, or as salvage therapy post‐RP, and they offer a proposed treatment pathway (Figure 2), taking into consideration PSA and testosterone levels.

Figure 2
Proposed Intermittent Treatment Pathway. *The PSA threshold of 5 ng/mL is arbitrarily chosen for illustrative purposes only. In patients with other high‐risk features, consider restarting treatment at a lower PSA level, but always perform imaging before reinitiation. ADT, androgen deprivation therapy; CRPC, castrate‐resistant prostate cancer; PSA, prostate‐specific antigen [Color figure can be viewed at]

Given the natural history of PC (ie, about 1/3 of patients will go on to progress), the majority of patients with BCR should undergo observation with BCR. For the remaining patients (high risk), ADT would generally be considered for:
Early recurrence (BCR < 3 years), AND
High‐risk features (PSADT ≤ 9 months OR Gleason score ≥ 8)

NCCN Prostate Cancer — progression to and management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) notes that most advanced disease eventually stops responding to traditional ADT and is categorized as castration-resistant (also known as castration-recurrent). CRPC is defined as prostate cancer that progresses clinically, radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum testosterone (< 50 ng/dL). Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC during primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a castrate level of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL; < 1.7 nmol/L), and imaging tests may be indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases; factors affecting the frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health, PSA velocity, and Gleason grade. For patients who develop CRPC, ADT with orchiectomy or an LHRH agonist or antagonist should be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL).

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^111yCHb8]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — executive summary highlights practice gaps in testosterone evaluation and treatment, noting that testosterone testing and prescriptions have nearly tripled in recent years and that some men use testosterone without a clear indication. It reports that some studies estimate that up to 25% of men who receive testosterone therapy do not have their testosterone tested prior to initiation of treatment and that, of men treated with testosterone, nearly half do not have their testosterone levels checked after therapy commences. It adds that while up to a third of men placed on testosterone therapy do not meet diagnostic criteria for testosterone deficiency, many men who need therapy fail to receive it due to clinician concerns about prostate cancer and cardiovascular events despite current evidence failing to definitively support these concerns. The AUA states a need for an evidence-based document to inform assessment and management and commits to a Guideline to ensure men in need of therapy are treated effectively and safely.

### Traditional approaches to androgen deprivation therapy [^111N4kq1]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

For most of the past 25 years, 1 of the favored approaches to treating prostate cancer has been the suppression of circulating testosterone with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. LHRH agonists produce a downregulation of LHRH receptors and an uncoupling of the LHRH signal transduction mechanism. This leads to a marked reduction in the secretion of bioactive hormones stimulating testosterone production and eventual induction of a reversible, but transient and incomplete, state known as "selective medical hypophysectomy". The treatment with LHRH agonists has proved effective in many settings; however, the dosage and timing strategies depend critically on the patient's disease risk and progression. More recent investigations have suggested that a newer, quicker acting, pure gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist might be a preferable treatment approach. It remains a fundamental truth, however, that hormonal therapy is both overused and more toxic than generally appreciated. Therefore, a complete understanding of the indications and applications of this approach is essential for the practice of evidence-based medicine.

### Testosterone recovery in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and different ADT duration: long-term data from two randomized trials… [^114inEke]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 300 Background: To determine the rate and time of testosterone recovery to normal level in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy plus 6, 18 or 36 months of androgen deprivation therapy and considered cured from their disease. Results: Results are reported with a median follow-up of 14 years. 607 pts fit the criteria and are available for analysis: 309 pts in the 6 months ADT schedule, 185 in the 18 and 113 in the 36. Overall,
76. 7%, 54. 6% and
45. 1% pts recovered normal T on the 6, 18 or 36 months schedule, respectively. The median time to T recovery was 1. 5,
3. 1, and 5. 1 years for the 6, 18 or 36 months schedule, respectively.
79. 7% presented with a normal T at baseline while 20. 3% had an abnormal T level. By splitting pts between a normal vs. abnormal presenting T level, the T recovery rate was as follows:

82. 1%,
63. 3%, and 50% for the normal T cohort, compared to 53. 4%,
28. 3% and 21.

1% for the abnormal T cohort at 6, 18 or 36 months, respectively. There was a significant difference in the overall recovery rate between normal vs. abnormal T level and at all ADT duration lengths between the two cohorts. In multivariable model, baseline normal T was a strong predictor of T recovery. Older age, diabetes, longer ADT, higher clinical stage, higher PSA and higher Gleason score reduced significantly the chance for T recovery. In pts recovering T post-ADT, except for the 6 months duration, the median time for T recovery was not significantly different between normal or abnormal T at baseline in 18 and 36 months cohorts. Conclusions: Older age, longer ADT and poor disease features are associated with a lower T recovery. Even after adjusting for several variables and ADT duration, a higher T recovery post-ADT is significantly associated with a normal T at baseline.

### Variations of serum testosterone levels in prostate cancer patients under LH-releasing hormone therapy: an open question [^114HWqKx]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The hypothesis 'the lower the better when achieving castration levels of testosterone' is based on the data from second-line hormonal manipulation and its molecular basis, and on better oncological results reported for lower castration levels in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, including those achieved with maximal androgen blockade. In this regard, the equivalence of surgical and different pharmacological castrations has been controversial. The modified amino acid structure that makes LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs more potent than LHRH, and the method of delivering the analogs impacts on bioavailibility and potentially causes differences in androgen levels and in its final oncological efficacy. In addition to this, there is a myriad of circumstances, such as those related to ethnic variations and co-morbidities, which uniquely impact on the pharmacological approach in a highly heterogeneous population of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. Ineffective testosterone suppression through hormonal escape is currently poorly recognized and may result in increased PCa mortality. Until now, the optimal serum testosterone level in patients under castration, and the impact of its variations in patients under LHRH therapy, remain open questions and have been merged to a broad spectra of patients who are highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity relates to a number of mechanisms regarding response to treatment, which influences the biology of the relapsing tumor and the sensitivity to subsequent therapies in the individual patient. The rationale to achieve testosterone levels below 20–50 ng/dl warrant further investigation as these levels have recently rescued CRPC patients. In the last few years and months, important advancements in prostate cancer treatment have been achieved. Nevertheless, these advances are measured in a few months of additional survival and under high costs, not available to most of the world population, compared with the benefits of hormonal manipulation that are measured in years, there is a huge potential for accessible and durable effect expansion and optimization of treatment, particularly with the current tendency of a more individual approach.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^1166f6hx]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel reached a consensus on the three options to achieve castration (bilateral orchiectomy, LHRH agonists, and LHRG antagonists), as recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. 54, 55 The panel did not reach consensus on whether combined androgen blockade (CAB) is superior to castration alone, but CAB was considered a reasonable alternative to castration alone, in agreement with the NCCN guideline. 9, 56

Unanimous consensus was reached on the role of monitoring serum testosterone (T) (Table 3). Obtaining a baseline T level before initiating ADT is essential. Subsequently, in the patient with mCSPC and CRPC, the optimal T level should be < 20 ng/dL, based on several studies reviewed. 57, 58 Of note, the NCCN guideline defines castration as testosterone < 50 ng/dL. 9 The panel felt that T levels should be checked 1 to 4 months after initiation of ADT, regardless of PSA levels. Once ADT is initiated and a PSA rise occurs, T levels should be obtained to distinguish noncastrate vs castrate‐resistant progression. If T levels are > 20 ng/dL, clinicians should check luteinizing hormone levels to determine whether ADT was administered effectively. If T levels are > 20 ng/dL despite low luteinizing hormone, consider switching to an alternative agent.

3.7 The role of ADT in metastatic castrate‐resistant prostate cancer

Metastatic castrate‐resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has been defined as men with PC on ADT with T level < 50 ng/dL, a rising PSA (defined as two consecutive rises, ≥ 4 weeks apart), and radiographic evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies. 72 However, based on current literature, the panel agreed unanimously that the goal of ADT should be to achieve a T level < 20 ng/dL, which differs from the NCCN guideline treatment goal of maintain T levels < 50 ng/dL. 9 There was no consensus on a value‐based model of ADT continuation, that is, whether ADT could be stopped once castrate levels are reached and then to check T levels every 3 months (restarting ADT if T rises ≥ 20 ng/dL). The American Society of Clinical Oncology and NCCN recommend that ADT should be continued indefinitely in the setting of mPC despite the development of castration resistance. 9, 73 But a survey of PC physicians from five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) found that up to one third of physicians used chemotherapy as a monotherapy and stopped administering ADT after the development of castration resistance. 74 The panel did not endorse discontinuing ADT after emergence of castration‐resistant disease.

In the context of mCRPC, the panel agreed unanimously that T should be checked at the time of diagnosis of castration resistance, when changing therapy, and if PSA is rising (to confirm castrate levels of T, ie, < 20 ng/dL). PSA measures and CT/bone scans should also be obtained at regular intervals (Table 5). These recommendations are in accordance with the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group recommendations. 72, 75

mCRPC is defined as:

mPC (by conventional radiology)

Testosterone level < 50 ng/dL

Progressive disease (one or more of):
PSA progression (2 rises above a nadir, ≥ 4 weeks apart)

### Prognostic and predictive value of plasma testosterone levels in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer [^115k2iFG]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Castrate state has been defined as a testosterone plasma level from 20 to 50 ng dL −1. Today, it is accepted by consensus that target testosterone level (TL) for androgen-deprivation therapy involving the use of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists must be < 50 ng dL −1 (1.7 nmol l −1). Docetaxel has been considered as the gold standard treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer progressing under castrate levels of testosterone. In the recent years, we have contemplated the arrival of new therapeutic options, either chemotherapy (CT) with cabazitaxel or hormone therapy with enzalutamide or abiraterone. Enzalutamide and abiraterone have proven efficacy for both patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostatic cancer (mCRPC) progressing after docetaxel and in first-line therapy for asymptomatic patients or for those with low symptoms. Cabazitaxel provided a benefit in survival for those patients progressing after docetaxel-based CT. Although survival has improved, necessity of optimisation of therapy together with some small preliminary reports of cross-resistance between abiraterone and enzalutamide or abiraterone and docetaxel have raised the necessity of biomarkers to help the right choice of therapy for each individual patient.

In patients receiving LH-RH agonist or surgical castration, testosterone can still be detected in plasma. Baseline TL, although under the definition of castration, has been suggested to be both prognostic for survival and predictive of response to subsequent hormonal manoeuvres.

Looking to new prognostic and predictive values for survival in mCRPC, we analysed the role of baseline TL and other potential factors (such as haemoglobin) in a cohort of patients with mCRPC. In addition, we analysed the probability of response to salvage hormone therapy (SHT) upon progression to first-line treatment.

### Testosterone responders to continuous androgen deprivation therapy show considerable variations in testosterone levels on followup: implications for clinical practice [^115tXs6x]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined whether men on continuous androgen deprivation therapy who achieve testosterone less than 0.7 nmol/l demonstrate subsequent testosterone elevations during followup and whether such events predict worse oncologic outcomes.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated a random, retrospective sample of 514 patients with prostate cancer treated with continuous androgen deprivation therapy in whom serum testosterone was less than 0.7 nmol/l at University Health Network between 2007 and 2016. Patients were followed from the date of the first testosterone measurement of less than 0.7 nmol/l to progression to castrate resistance, death or study period end. Study outcomes were the development of testosterone elevations greater than 0.7, greater than 1.1 and greater than 1.7 nmol/l, and progression to a castrate resistant state. Survival curves were constructed to determine the rate of testosterone elevations. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was done to assess whether elevations predicted progression to castrate resistance.

Results

Median patient age was 74 years and median followup was 20.3 months. Within 5 years of followup 82%, 45% and 18% of patients had subsequent testosterone levels greater than 0.7, greater than 1.1 and greater than 1.7 nmol/l, respectively. In 96% to 100% of these patients levels less than 0.7 nmol/l were subsequently reestablished within 5 years. No patient baseline characteristic was associated with elevations and elevations were not a significant predictor of progression to a castrate resistant state.

Conclusions

Men on continuous androgen deprivation therapy in whom initial testosterone is less than 0.7 nmol/l frequently show subsequent elevations in serum testosterone. Such a development should not trigger an immediate response from physicians as these events are prognostically insignificant with regard to oncologic outcomes. Levels are eventually reestablished at less than 0.7 nmol/l.

### Testosterone recovery in the off-treatment time in prostate cancer patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy [^112h2XfQ]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) for prostate cancer was studied with the objective of reducing the side effects of treatment and potentially delaying the development of hormone resistance. There also appears to be a quality of life benefit during off-treatment intervals owing to the recovery of serum testosterone levels.

Methods

In this multicentre European prospective randomised phase III trial EC507, testosterone serum concentrations were analysed in prostate cancer patients with PSA progression after radical prostatectomy. Patients were randomised to a continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) and IAD therapy using a 3-month depot with 11.25 mg leuprorelin acetate as microcapsule formulation. A complete IAD cycle comprises both a 6-month androgen deprivation therapy plus the off-treatment time (OTT).

Results

Serum testosterone recovery was recorded in 109 patients during OTT in the IAD group. Testosterone recovery to baseline values was achieved in 79.3% during the first and in 64.9% during the second IAD cycle, respectively. Median time to testosterone normalisation was 100 days in the first and 115 days in the second cycle, respectively. No significant difference was observed up to 1000 days between IAD and CAD with regard to time to androgen-independent progression. This is the first prospective study of leuprorelin acetate 11.25mg demonstrating normalisation of testosterone levels in the off-treatment period in patients undergoing IAD.

Conclusions

The prerequisite of an IAD treatment is the testosterone recovery during off-treatment periods. In this study, in patients with PSA relapse after radical prostatectomy, a real achievement of intermittent castration with normalisation of testosterone levels during off-treatment periods could be confirmed.

### Intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer [^114oxm5S]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is still a mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Continuous ADT causes considerable patient morbidity including sexual dysfunction, poor mood and physical capacity, changes in body composition and health-care-related costs. Intermittent ADT has been used as an approach to ADT monotherapy to limit morbidity by enabling cyclical recovery of serum testosterone levels. To date, a number of well-performed randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated statistically insignificant differences in oncological outcomes between intermittent and continuous ADT monotherapy. Sexual outcomes, morbidity profiles and cost-savings favour intermittent therapy in most randomized trials, but the benefit for clinical practice is unclear. Despite the growing body of evidence, the optimal administration regime for ADT has not been clearly established and incorporation of adjunctive upfront treatments such as chemotherapy and novel anti-androgen agents has further hampered progress. Recommendations by authoritative urological and oncological societies regarding the use of intermittent ADT are limited. The potential benefits of reduced morbidity for a particular patient must be considered in light of the possible oncological outcomes. Although the oncological changes associated with intermittent ADT are controversial, intermittent ADT does seem to provide symptomatic benefit in patients compared with continuous ADT. However, careful selection of suitable patients is crucial.

### Androgen-targeted therapy in men with prostate cancer: evolving practice and future considerations [^113Uz7Dh]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is foundational in the management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and has benefitted from a recent explosion in scientific advances. These include approval of new therapies that suppress testosterone (T) levels or inactivate its function, improvements in diagnostic and assay technologies, identification of lower therapeutic targets for T, discovery of the relevance of germline genetic mutations and identification of the benefits of sequential and combination therapies.

Methods

This review discusses the clinical profiles of the most up-to-date options for ADT, best practices for managing patients with advanced PCa and future directions in therapy.

Results and conclusions

Modern assay technologies reveal that bilateral orchiectomy results in a serum T level of approximately 15 ng/dL as compared to the historical definition of castration of T < 50 ng/dL. Evidence shows that lowering T levels to < 20 ng/dL improves patient survival and delays disease progression. Routine monitoring of T in addition to prostate-specific antigen throughout treatment is important to ensure continuing efficacy of T suppression. New drugs that inhibit androgen signaling in combination with traditional ADT suppress T activity to near zero and have significantly improved patient survival. When personalizing ADT regimens physicians should consider a number of factors including initiation and duration of ADT, monitoring of T levels and PSA, the possibility of switching monotherapies if a patient does not achieve adequate T suppression, and consideration of intermittent vs. continuous ADT according to patients' lifestyles, comorbidities, risk factors and tolerance to treatment.

### Redefining clinically significant castration levels in patients with prostate cancer receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy [^111VpoH8]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the testosterone castration level with clinical relevance in patients with prostate cancer on continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Secondary objectives were to analyze the role of associated bicalutamide in breakthrough increases of serum testosterone in these patients and the possible benefit of maximal androgen blockade.

Materials and Methods

Serum testosterone was determined 3 times (in 6 months) in 73 patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with medical castration, 28 (38.4%) of whom also received bicalutamide (maximal androgen blockade). During a mean followup of 51 months (range 12 to 240) 41 (67.1%) events of androgen independent progression were identified, and correlated with breakthrough testosterone increases of 50 ng/dl (classic level) and 20 ng/dl (surgical castration level).

Results

Testosterone was less than 20 ng/dl in all determinations in 32 patients (43.6%). Breakthrough increases between 20 and 50 ng/dl were observed in 23 patients (31.5%), and increases greater than 50 ng/dl were observed in the remaining 18 (24.7%). The lowest testosterone level with a significant impact on survival free of androgen independent progression was 32 ng/dl. Mean survival free of androgen independent progression in patients with breakthrough increases greater than 32 ng/dl was 88 months (95% CI 55–121) while it was 137 months (95% CI 104–170) in those without breakthrough increases (p < 0.03). Patients on maximal androgen blockade had an incidence of testosterone increase similar to those receiving monotherapy. However, maximal androgen blockade provided a significantly longer survival free of androgen independent progression in those with breakthrough increases greater than 50 ng/dl.

Conclusions

In the current report the lowest testosterone castration level with clinical relevance in medically castrated patients with prostate cancer was 32 ng/dl. Breakthrough increases greater than this threshold predicted a lower survival free of androgen independent progression. Maximal androgen blockade might benefit medically castrated cases of prostate cancer with breakthrough increases of more than 50 ng/dl.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113jp7Ba]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — prostate cancer risk discussion and monitoring: In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old, who are being considered for testosterone therapy and have a life expectancy > 10 years, we suggest discussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating prostate cancer risk and prostate monitoring and engaging the patient in shared decision making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. For patients who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone. In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options.

### An expert review on the combination of relugolix with definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer [^112jaPAv]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an integral component in the management of prostate cancer across multiple disease states. Traditionally, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists constituted the backbone of ADT. However, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor hormone (GnRH) antagonists also are available, which offer faster testosterone suppression and reduced likelihood of ADT-related adverse effects compared with LHRH agonists, including the potential for fewer ADT-associated major cardiac events. Until recently, all forms of LHRH agonists and GnRH antagonist formulations were of parenteral administration. However, recently relugolix gained Food and Drug Administration approval as the first oral GnRH antagonist. Relugolix achieves faster and more complete testosterone suppression compared with an LHRH agonist. This translates to more rapid prostate-specific antigen response compared with LHRH agonists. After discontinuation of relugolix, testosterone recovers faster than after GnRH agonists or injectable GnRH antagonist therapy. Overall, these factors provide opportunities for more precisely defined ADT duration when combined with radiation therapy. The rapid onset and offset of testosterone suppression with relugolix may require physicians to rethink the mechanism and goals of ADT when prescribing. As an oral formulation, relugolix enables patients to avoid pain and injection site reactions, limit extra office visits for injections, and achieve a shorter duration of experiencing the side effects of castrate testosterone levels. This convenience and tolerability may enhance physicians' willingness to prescribe ADT and patients' feeling of control during their ADT course, but the potential advantages are accompanied by the risks of patients choosing to discontinue therapy to escape side effects of ADT. This article focuses on different aspects of what is known and unknown regarding the optimal use of ADT and radiation therapy, and how relugolix, due to its properties, fit into our current treatment paradigms for localized prostate cancer.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1139NQV1]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

There has been a marked increase in testosterone prescriptions in the past decade resulting in a growing need to give practicing clinicians proper guidance on the evaluation and management of the testosterone deficient patient.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review utilized research from the Mayo Clinic Evidence Based Practice Center and additional supplementation by the authors. Evidence-based statements were based on body of evidence strength Grade A, B, or C and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations with additional statements presented in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

This guideline was developed by a multi-disciplinary panel to inform clinicians on the proper assessment of patients with testosterone deficiency and the safe and effective management of men on testosterone therapy. Additional statements were developed to guide the clinician on the appropriate care of patients who are at risk for or have cardiovascular disease or prostate cancer as well as patients who are interested in preserving fertility.

Conclusions

The care of testosterone deficient patients should focus on accurate assessment of total testosterone levels, symptoms, and signs as well as proper on-treatment monitoring to ensure therapeutic testosterone levels are reached and symptoms are ameliorated. Future longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials of significant duration in this space will improve diagnostic techniques and treatment of men with testosterone deficiency as well as provide more data on the adverse events that may be associated with testosterone therapy.

### Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT): a patient's guide [^114gmCtc]. The Prostate (2022). Medium credibility.

Time is a critical component of hormone therapy. Androgen deprivation works initially because prostate cancer cells undergo a "hormone shock" when they are suddenly deprived of testosterone. The majority of the prostate cancer cells cannot survive this shock and die, resulting in a large drop in PSA level, disappearance of cancer sites on imaging scans, and symptomatic improvement. However, given sufficient time, the prostate cancer cells that survive this initial shock adapt to living in a new low testosterone environment and begin to grow again. BAT is a similar type of "hormone shock" but just in the opposite direction. However, if the testosterone is maintained at a steady high level, the prostate cancer cells can also adapt again to this new high testosterone environment. They become resistant to BAT and begin to grow again. A key feature of BAT is the rapid change from a very high to low testosterone level over a single course of therapy. The high levels of testosterone produced initially by BAT are effective against CRPC cells that are making very high levels of AR. Prostate cancer that has lowered levels of the AR will not be killed by high levels of androgen. However, these low AR cells become vulnerable to cell death when testosterone levels drop suddenly over a cycle of BAT. Thus, BAT is designed to repeatedly shock the prostate cancer cells, by alternating between these polar extremes of high and low testosterone levels. The rapid change in testosterone levels does not give prostate cancer cells sufficient time to adapt to the underlying environment because it is always changing. This method keeps the prostate cancer cells constantly guessing.

### Study of testosterone-guided androgen deprivation therapy in management of prostate cancer [^114mmftL]. The Prostate (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists is an effective initial therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer. LHRH agonists are usually administered indefinitely at a fixed interval.

Methods

We recruited men with advanced prostate cancer who had been on fixed-schedule injections of an LHRH agonist for ≥ 1 year and had castrate serum testosterone [< 1.75nmol/l (approx. 50ng/ml)]. Testosterone levels were measured at 6-week intervals and ADT was withheld until testosterone levels were no longer in the castrate range and then reinstituted. Time to reinstitution of ADT was the primary outcome and was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method; Cox regression was used to identify factors predicting delay in reinstitution of treatment. Influence on quality-of-life (QoL) was evaluated by the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC).

Results

Forty-six evaluable men who had received LHRH agonist injections every 12 weeks were recruited. Median time to testosterone recovery (defined as testosterone outside the defined castrate level) after previous injection was > 1 year. In univariable analysis, lower baseline testosterone [≤ 1 vs. > 1nmol/l (approx. 30ng/dl)] and longer time on ADT (> 5 vs. ≤ 5 years) predicted for prolonged time to testosterone recovery, but only lower baseline testosterone remained significant in multivariable analysis (Hazard Ratio = 5.2, P = 0.03). Overall EPIC scores remained stable but improvement from baseline was observed in the hormonal domain (P = 0.002). Median per-patient saving in cost was approximately USD 3,100 (1,050–6,200).

Conclusions

Testosterone-guided ADT reduces exposure to LHRH agonists, with reduction in cost and improvement in some symptoms from ADT. Testosterone-guided ADT should be considered an alternative to fixed schedule treatment by physicians and policy makers.

### Androgen-targeted therapy in men with prostate cancer: evolving practice and future considerations [^116NSQkc]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for routine testosterone testing

T levels should be measured regularly in men receiving ADT to ensure T suppression is being maintained to target; this does not appear to be the case in routine clinical practice. EAU guidelines recommend that T testing is performed 3 months after the first dose of ADT and repeated every 3−6 months thereafter. ADT use is often assumed to be a proxy for adequate T suppression to castrate levels; however, neglecting to assess T will fail to identify levels above target, microsurges, and escapes. Adding a T test to the regular PSA assessment is simple to implement and would address these concerns.

With a rise in PSA and progression to CRPC, T testing and management remain important. Confirmation that T is castrate at time of CRPC diagnosis is critical, and continuance of regular testing should confirm effective T suppression and prevention of repopulation of partially androgen-sensitive tumor cells. An incorrect diagnosis of CRPC may prompt the use of additional, more costly, and possibly more toxic therapies in patients who do not yet require them.

The most widely used assay for T determinations is the chemiluminescent immunoassay which is reliable at the higher levels of T typically measured in men being evaluated for androgen deficiency or infertility (i.e. > 50 ng/dL), but may not be accurate at the very low levels seen in men on ADT (< 20 ng/dL). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) is the most sensitive test available for detecting low levels of T, although it is more costly and labor intensive. Clinicians should be encouraged to communicate with their laboratory colleagues to ensure that T assays conducted while monitoring patients undergoing ADT have an appropriate lower limit of quantification, ideally LC-MS/MS or an immunoassay that has been validated to detect low levels of T. Additionally, consistent use of the same laboratory and the same assay for all T measurements from a patient would provide the highest level of comparability of patient lab values over the course of treatment.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m 2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Testosterone therapy and prostate cancer: incorporating low-level evidence into practical recommendations [^116pvjwQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The widely accepted absolute contraindication for administration of testosterone in hypogonadal men with prostate cancer has been questioned. Although recommendations from some professional associations still adhere to the traditional concepts, there is increasing relaxation of such positions. Currently, the evidence for definitive guidelines is unavailable and the clinician has to rely on incomplete but best attainable information. Under certain circumstances (successfully treated prostate cancer or active surveillance for low risk disease), testosterone administration is warranted. For those with intermediate or high-risk cancer, extreme caution seems advisable. The benefits must heavily outweigh the hazards. Ideally, these men should participate in clinical trials and registries. Competent initial assessment of individual circumstances and follow-up are mandatory.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^116MxzH6]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the panel's recommendations were derived from a review of clinical trial data, publications, national guidelines, and expert opinion. The clinical trials, in particular, had varying entry criteria or outcomes, so many of the panel's recommendations should be prefaced by the assumption of "generally speaking", that is, patient‐specific factors will also affect treatment decisions and thus may make the general recommendation suggested by the panel not applicable for a specific patient. Also, the authors recognize the importance of ongoing and future clinical trials and therefore recommend, whenever possible, encouraging patient enrollment in randomized, controlled trials, which are needed to further clarify when evidence‐based data are lacking.

### Interpreting testosterone and concomitant prostate specific antigen values during androgen deprivation therapy for recurrent prostate cancer [^1162iDvx]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Measurement of testosterone levels during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is broadly recommended, but how therapy should be altered in response to testosterone values during ADT remains controversial. Our objective was therefore to evaluate the relation between testosterone and concomitant prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels during ADT on clinical outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Patients from the continuous androgen deprivation arm of the PR.7 trial of intermittent ADT for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer following radiotherapy were included. Statistical analyses evaluated the prognostic importance of testosterone levels during ADT relative to concomitant PSA levels. We similarly evaluated whether the number of testosterone breakthroughs > 1.7 nmol/l predicted the time to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), cancer specific survival (CSS) or overall survival (OS) with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.

Results

Overall, the prognostic importance of testosterone on outcomes was eclipsed by the prognostic value of concomitant PSA values. The occurrence of testosterone values > 0.7 nmol/l in the first year of therapy was associated with subsequent rises > 1.7 nmol/l, but the number of testosterone breakthroughs per patient had no relationship to the risk of CRPC, CSS or OS. A time-dependent adjusted analysis indicated as expected that PSA values were prognostic, but there was no association of relative cumulative testosterone exposure with outcomes.

Conclusions

In this large-scale trial with long followup, breakthrough testosterone was unrelated to time to CRPC, CSS or OS. Castrate testosterone values during ADT for recurrent prostate cancer provides prognostic information that must be considered alongside the time since ADT initiation and concomitant PSA values.

Evolving view of suppression targets for testosterone

Historically, the definition of castration has been suppression of T to a level lower than 50 ng/dL, based on radioimmunoassays developed in the 1960s that were less accurate when measuring lower levels of T. Advances in assay technology with greater sensitivities confirm that T levels following bilateral orchiectomy are approximately 15 ng/dL.

These findings, together with data that demonstrate improved survival and prolonged time to disease progression with lower levels of T, has led to consensus among PCa experts that a lower target, below 20 ng/dL, is desirable. Almost all PCa tumors will initially respond to ADT, although with long-term T suppression, some cell populations become refractory and elimination of T production from the testes is no longer sufficient to fully suppress tumor cell growth. This is referred to as castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), which is determined by a rising PSA in an environment where T levels are castrate. In CRPC, reactivation of AR pathways from multiple mechanisms occurs, including production of androgens by the adrenal glands and PCa cells themselves, androgen-independent activation of the AR, AR gene amplification or overexpression, constitutively active ligand-independent AR splice variants, and gain-of-function mutations involving the AR ligand-binding domain. Despite this, continuation of T suppression to castrate levels remains important throughout the course of CRPC. One manifestation of the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations is that PCa cells exhibit varying degrees of androgen sensitivity. Growth of androgen-sensitive cells will remain suppressed in a low T environment, hence the need for ongoing, effective ADT; however, growth of androgen insensitive cells will not be prevented. There is also a third compartment of partially resistant cells that only undergo apoptosis at very low levels of T.

### Complications of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer [^111awdEq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current data on adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and to discuss some considerations when choosing therapy and managing side-effects.

Recent Findings

Despite the existing data supporting the use of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients, several questions regarding timing, survival benefit and impact in quality of life remain quite controversial. Although androgen deprivation therapy appears to increase overall survival in select populations with locally advanced and symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer, their side-effects often lead to secondary short and long-term toxicities that negatively impact patient's quality of life and ultimately affect their survival. In addition to the most common side-effects of low testosterone levels such as hot flushes, lack of libido, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia and bone mineral density loss, recent studies have confirmed the detrimental effects of low testosterone states on patient's cardiac risk profile and development of metabolic syndrome ultimately leading to an increase risk of diabetes, hyperlipidemia and heart disease.

Summary

Long-term use of androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients continues to increase. Timing of therapy should be optimized based on each individual's prostate cancer natural history and medical risk profile. Emphasis should be placed on quality of life concerns, with adequate pretreatment education of anticipated side-effects, individualization of therapy, and review of strategies for prevention of side-effects.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of prostate cancer [^117BD2HT]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of prostate cancer issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide a basis for rational treatment decisions. These guidelines represent consensus recommendations by a panel of experts that are evidence based and are designated according to the degree of consensus within the expert panel. The initial stratification point is the patient's life expectancy (> 5 or < 5 years). If life expectancy is > 5 years, the recommended intervention is based on clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score, as well as the presence of symptoms. These assessments establish the patient's risk of recurrence after therapy. Specific initial therapies are then recommended according to whether the risk category is low, intermediate, high, or very high. The guidelines also describe the appropriate use of observation ("watchful waiting") versus active intervention in certain patients. After definitive therapy, patients should be monitored with PSA determinations, digital rectal examination, and bone scans, as outlined in the guidelines. Patients who exhibit increasing PSA levels after prostatectomy are candidates for salvage therapy with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, or observation. If PSA levels begin to increase after radiotherapy, surgery may then be an additional option. Systemic salvage therapy generally consists of androgen ablation; the benefit of total androgen blockade versus initial monotherapy remains controversial. Relapse after initial androgen ablation is treated with an antiandrogen, if none had been administered previously. Patients refractory to further hormonal manipulations are observed or receive palliative therapy, including chemotherapy. The treatment of prostate cancer is complex. Optimal treatment is risk-adapted to the specific characteristics of the cancer and the expected longevity and personal preferences of the patient.

Regarding specific circumstances for osteoporosis in men, more specifically with respect to patients with hypogonadism, testosterone therapy, ES 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating testosterone therapy in patients at borderline high risk for fracture having serum testosterone levels < 200 ng/dL on > 1 determination if accompanied by signs or symptoms of androgen deficiency (such as low libido, unexplained chronic fatigue, loss of body hair, and hot flushes) or organic hypogonadism (such as due to hypothalamic, pituitary, or specific testicular disorder). Discontinue testosterone therapy and consider switching to another treatment if testosterone therapy does not alleviate symptoms of androgen deficiency after 3–6 months. Consider initiating testosterone therapy in patients at high risk for fracture with testosterone levels < 200 ng/dL lacking standard indications for testosterone therapy but having contraindications to approved pharmacological agents for osteoporosis.

In a separate meta-analysis of 19 RCTs, 651 men received testosterone and 433 received placebo for 12 weeks to 36 months; baseline age, testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen were similar (62.9 years versus 64.4 years; 320 ng/dL versus 344 ng/dL; 1.3 ng/mL in both arms). Total prostate-related events were higher with testosterone (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.07, 2.95), while individual events were not statistically significantly different for prostate cancer (OR = 1.09), PSA elevation to > 4ng/mL or PSA increase > 1.5 ng/mL (OR = 1.19), International Prostate Symptom Score (OR = 1.08), or acute urinary retention (OR = 0.99).

### Optimal testosterone suppression on medical ADT should strive to suppress free testosterone levels to levels similar to orchiectomy: what is that value? [^113gMKox]. ASCO (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract 144 Background: The goal of medical androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer is to provide an equivalency to orchiectomy based upon older assays for serum testosterone. Literature shows that based on more modern assays, medical ADT does not always provide optimal total T suppression equivalent to orchiectomy. With the understanding that free, or unbound, T is the biologically and clinically relevant component, the therapeutic goal of ADT should be to decrease free T to levels similar to orchiectomy. Free T has not been well studied in a substantial number of orchiectomized men. The purpose of this study was to examine a subpopulation of orchiectomized men in a clinical trial to determine the level of serum-free T in advanced prostate cancer. Methods: Baseline data was utilized from a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to determine the capacity of toremifene 80 mg to prevent bone fractures in men on ADT.

This study included 1, 389 men from 150 sites in the U. S. and Mexico. Baseline characteristics, including whether men were on medical ADT or status post orchiectomy, were available. Free T levels were assayed at baseline by radioimmunoassay and are reported for men who underwent orchiectomy. Results: A subpopulation of 114 men underwent orchiectomy. Median age was 76. Median serum free T level was
0. 92 pg/ml with a mean level of 1. 71 pg/ml ± 2.
77. **Conclusions**: This study is believed to be the largest cohort in which free T levels have been reported in men who underwent orchiectomy. In this cohort, median serum free T is approximately 0. 9 pg/ml. This value could be considered to be the optimal testosterone suppression of free T with orchiectomy and represents the goal of medical ADT.

At the time this study was performed, RIA was considered to be the standard but has since been shown to underestimate free T levels by 20 to 60%. Currently, equilibrium dialysis coupled with LC-MS/MS is the gold standard, but the results from this analysis provide us with increased understanding of the optimal level of free T in treating advanced prostate cancer. Clinical trial information: NCT00129142.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^111LHZXb]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

For specific clinical indications, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will induce disease prostate cancer (PC) regression, relieve symptoms and prolong survival; however, ADT has a well-described range of side effects, which may have a detrimental effect on the patient's quality of life, necessitating additional interventions or changes in PC treatment. The risk-benefit analysis for initiating ADT in PC patients throughout the PC disease continuum warrants review.

Methods

A 14-member panel comprised of urologic and medical oncologists were chosen for an expert review panel, to provide guidance on a more judicious use of ADT in advanced PC patients. Panel members were chosen based upon their academic and community experience and expertise in the management of PC patients. Four academic members of the panel served as group leaders; the remaining eight panel members were from Large Urology Group Practice Association practices with proven experience in leading their advanced PC clinics. The panel members were assigned to four separate working groups, and were tasked with addressing the role of ADT in specific PC settings.

Results

This article describes the practical recommendations of an expert panel for the use of ADT throughout the PC disease continuum, as well as an algorithm summarizing the key recommendations. The target for this publication is all providers (urologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, or advanced practice providers) who evaluate and manage advanced PC patients, regardless of their practice setting.

Conclusion

The panel has provided recommendations for monitoring PC patients while on ADT, recognizing that PC patients will progress despite testosterone suppression and, therefore, early identification of conversion from castrate-sensitive to castration resistance is critical. Also, the requirement to both identify and mitigate side effects of ADT as well as the importance of quality of life maintenance are essential to the optimization of patient care, especially as more combinatorial therapeutic strategies with ADT continue to emerge.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^112VkCBb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

Methods

A narrative review.

Results

Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥ 2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy. Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea. Testosterone replacement therapy should be accompanied by a standardized monitoring plan.

Conclusion

A shared decision of the patient and physician to treat should be guided by the consideration of the burden of symptoms, potential benefits and risks, patient's values, and the cost and burden of long-term treatment and monitoring.

### Intraprostatic androgens and androgen-regulated gene expression persist after testosterone suppression: therapeutic implications for castration-resistant prostate cancer [^111MCsBE]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the primary treatment for advanced prostate cancer. The efficacy of ADT has not been rigorously evaluated by demonstrating suppression of prostatic androgen activity at the target tissue and molecular level. We determined the efficacy and consistency of medical castration in suppressing prostatic androgen levels and androgen-regulated gene expression. Androgen levels and androgen-regulated gene expression (by microarray profiling, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and immunohistochemistry) were measured in prostate samples from a clinical trial of short-term castration (1 month) using the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, Acyline, versus placebo in healthy men. To assess the effects of long-term ADT, gene expression measurements were evaluated at baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 months of neoadjuvant ADT in prostatectomy samples from men with localized prostate cancer. Medical castration reduced tissue androgens by 75% and reduced the expression of several androgen-regulated genes (NDRG1, FKBP5, and TMPRSS2). However, many androgen-responsive genes, including the androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), were not suppressed after short-term castration or after 9 months of neoadjuvant ADT. Significant heterogeneity in PSA and AR protein expression was observed in prostate cancer samples at each time point of ADT. Medical castration based on serum testosterone levels cannot be equated with androgen ablation in the prostate microenvironment. Standard androgen deprivation does not consistently suppress androgen-dependent gene expression. Suboptimal suppression of tumoral androgen activity may lead to adaptive cellular changes allowing prostate cancer cell survival in a low androgen environment. Optimal clinical efficacy will require testing of novel approaches targeting complete suppression of systemic and intracrine contributions to the prostatic androgen microenvironment.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^113H2pRp]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

For specific clinical indications, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will induce disease prostate cancer (PC) regression, relieve symptoms and prolong survival; however, ADT has a well‐described range of side effects, which may have a detrimental effect on the patient's quality of life, necessitating additional interventions or changes in PC treatment. The risk‐benefit analysis for initiating ADT in PC patients throughout the PC disease continuum warrants review.

Methods

A 14‐member panel comprised of urologic and medical oncologists were chosen for an expert review panel, to provide guidance on a more judicious use of ADT in advanced PC patients. Panel members were chosen based upon their academic and community experience and expertise in the management of PC patients. Four academic members of the panel served as group leaders; the remaining eight panel members were from Large Urology Group Practice Association practices with proven experience in leading their advanced PC clinics. The panel members were assigned to four separate working groups, and were tasked with addressing the role of ADT in specific PC settings.

Results

This article describes the practical recommendations of an expert panel for the use of ADT throughout the PC disease continuum, as well as an algorithm summarizing the key recommendations. The target for this publication is all providers (urologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, or advanced practice providers) who evaluate and manage advanced PC patients, regardless of their practice setting.

Conclusion

The panel has provided recommendations for monitoring PC patients while on ADT, recognizing that PC patients will progress despite testosterone suppression and, therefore, early identification of conversion from castrate‐sensitive to castration resistance is critical. Also, the requirement to both identify and mitigate side effects of ADT as well as the importance of quality of life maintenance are essential to the optimization of patient care, especially as more combinatorial therapeutic strategies with ADT continue to emerge.

### Testosterone measurement in patients with prostate cancer [^114fF9Z9]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Serum testosterone measurement has no widely accepted place in the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). However, several potential clinical applications of serum testosterone determination can be envisaged.

Objective

To review the role of testosterone and the androgen axis in the natural history of PCa and evaluate the evidence for the clinical application of serum testosterone measurement in patient screening, diagnosis, and management.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search retrieved original research and review articles relating to the androgen axis in PCa and the use of testosterone measurement for (1) assessing PCa risk in the general population, (2) adding to the specificity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, (3) determining tumour aggressiveness, (4) assessing the efficacy of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and (5) optimising the scheduling of intermittent ADT. Relevant data were reviewed during a roundtable discussion, and consensus recommendations were agreed.

Evidence Synthesis

A body of data implicates the androgen axis in PCa throughout its natural history. Based on current evidence, serum testosterone measurement cannot be recommended for determining PCa risk, increasing specificity of PSA testing, or assessing tumour aggressiveness. In contrast, for patients receiving ADT, there is a clear rationale for serum testosterone monitoring to ensure that castration levels are achieved. Practical recommendations for testosterone measurement during ADT are outlined. If PSA is rising while on ADT, castration levels of serum testosterone must be demonstrated before hormonal independence can be assumed. Serum testosterone levels might be considered an additional trigger for therapy reinitiation in intermittent ADT schedules. Finally, future prospective studies should further evaluate the potential relevance of testosterone measurement as an independent assessment of prognosis and treatment decision in different disease stages.

Conclusions

As a therapeutic target, serum testosterone levels should be monitored to verify response to ADT and confirm suspected castration independence.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: challenges beyond the guidelines [^116PQr3g]. The Prostate (2020). Medium credibility.

100% Yes

In mCRPC, continuation of ADT to maintain T < 20 ng/dL is strongly recommended.

100% Yes

Another reasonable option ("value‐based model") in treating mCRPC is to stop ADT (once castrate levels are reached) and to check T levels q3 months, then restart ADT if T rises above > 20 ng/dL.

14% Yes, 43% No, 43% Indeterminate

For patients with mCRPC on treatment, testosterone levels should be measured:
At baseline
When changing therapy
If PSA rising (to confirm castrate level: < 20 ng/dL)

Also, PSA and CT/bone scans should be performed at regular intervals.

100% Yes

3.8 AE management strategies with ADT and combination therapies

With ADT being the most commonly prescribed agent by clinicians for the management of advanced PC, understanding all of the potential effects of therapy is critical to optimizing patient health outcomes. While there are numerous medical and quality‐of‐life adverse events attributable to the use of ADT, the panel focused on the following: bone fragility and associated skeletal events, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, neurocognitive effects, and hot flashes. A consistent theme of our discussions was that achieving optimal outcomes requires a multidisciplinary approach of cancer care providers, potentially involving primary care providers (PCPs), and other appropriate specialists to coordinate the care of PC patients on ADT to prevent and minimize complications of ADT therapy. The panel noted that the primary cancer provider (urologist, radiation oncologist, or medical oncologist) needs to be fully engaged in identifying these risks and engaging with the overall medical team.

### A prospective analysis of time to normalization of serum testosterone after withdrawal of androgen deprivation therapy [^114kLwVP]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with prostate cancer are treated with neoadjuvant, adjuvant and intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is altered during androgen deprivation therapy, and as a result the prognostic significance and accuracy of PSA values measured before serum testosterone has normalized are questionable because the patient is still effectively on androgen deprivation therapy. We determine the time it takes for serum testosterone to return to normal after withdrawal of androgen deprivation therapy.

Materials and Methods

Serial serum testosterone was prospectively measured at 3-month intervals in 68 men after withdrawal of androgen deprivation therapy. The number of months to return to normal serum testosterone 270 ng./dl. or greater, was calculated for each patient. Patients were stratified according to duration of androgen deprivation, age and type of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist used.

Results

Median patient age was 71 years (range 46 to 88). Median time to normalization of testosterone was 7 months (range 1 to 58). At 3, 6 and 12 months 28%, 48% and 74% of men had normal serum testosterone, respectively. Serum testosterone took significantly longer to return to normal in patients on androgen deprivation therapy for 24 months or greater compared to those on therapy for less than 24 months (log-rank p = 0.0034). There was no statistical significance based on age or type of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist used.

Conclusions

Androgen deprivation has an effect on serum testosterone that extends beyond the cessation of treatment. Serum testosterone should be measured in all men until normalization. These results should be applied to the interpretation of PSA levels after withdrawal of androgen deprivation therapy. In addition, these data have implications regarding dose scheduling and definition of biochemical (PSA) failure after primary therapy.

### Targeting the androgen receptor – theory and practice [^1168hFwf]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Intensive investigation during the past 2 decades has led to an improved knowledge of the biology of the androgen receptor and a better understanding of how to assess for disease progression and the apparent existence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The result has been the clinical development of a new generation of hormonal therapy agents for achieving the androgen deprivation necessary to achieve castrate levels of circulating testosterone. It has also resulted in the realization that it is probably time to move away from using terms such as "hormone-refractory" and "androgen-independent" prostate cancer, given the clear evidence that significant, effective, ongoing suppression of testosterone, using better drugs and better assays, will continue to be the standard of care.

Intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — ADT is associated with substantial side effects that generally increase with duration; intermittent ADT, based on cycles of androgen deprivation followed by re-exposure, may delay "androgen independence", reduce treatment morbidity, and improve QOL. Some patients without ADT-related morbidity may find the uncertainty of intermittent ADT not worthwhile. Intermittent ADT requires close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels, especially during off-treatment periods, and patients may need to switch to continuous therapy upon signs of disease progression.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The goal of this panel's effort is not to replace existing guidelines that have been published and painstakingly developed by several national and international organizations with input from highly respected experts. Rather, we have attempted to provide a practical and user‐friendly reference for all clinicians who participate in the management of PC, specifically as it involves the utilization of ADT across the various stages of the disease. Of note, the NCCN guideline is broad and includes recommendations for several different treatments in M0 and M1 disease, as the guideline seeks to synthesize all of the published literature. Our goal in this report is to assist physicians in making treatment decisions from among these choices. As we would prefer to have recommendations solely based on level I evidence, we acknowledge that the luxury of having data‐driven information does not always exist, and thus, level III/expert opinion can be solicited and enumerated via a consensus panel of PC experts, thereby providing an educational algorithm to optimize patient care where variability in treatment patterns may exist.

The panel has provided recommendations for monitoring PC patients while on ADT, recognizing that due to the heterogeneity of PC, patients with PC patients will progress despite testosterone suppression and, therefore, early identification of conversion from castrate‐sensitive to castration resistance is critical. Also, the requirement to both identify and mitigate side effects as a result of ADT as well as the importance of quality of life maintenance are essential to the quality of patient care, especially important as more combinatorial ADT therapies emerge throughout the spectrum of disease management. Often, existing guidelines focus upon monitoring workflows for all patients, regardless of their disease stage, and thus we have attempted to improve the granularity of recommendations for all disease states when ADT might be initiated. We have explored, discussed, and debated the current literature and have enumerated our recommendations for our colleagues' consideration and are hopeful that this will serve as a template for the optimization of patient care.

### Testosterone breakthrough rates during androgen deprivation therapy for castration sensitive prostate cancer [^112so2Tb]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Androgen deprivation therapy is an established therapy for castration sensitive prostate cancer and recent studies have observed that patients whose testosterone levels are suppressed below 0.7 nmol/l have improved outcomes. Testosterone breakthrough, or a rise in testosterone above a target threshold after the first month of androgen deprivation therapy, is generally associated with treatment deficiency. The purpose of this review is to summarize breakthrough rate data and explore the relationship to clinical outcomes in patients with castration sensitive prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy.

Materials and Methods

Our systematic search identified 45 studies with a total of 52 cohorts representing 6,047 total patients reporting testosterone breakthrough rates or derivative measures above the thresholds of 1.7 nmol/l (51 cohorts, 6,015 patients) or 0.7 nmol/l (15 cohorts, 2,495 patients).

Results

Significantly higher weighted mean breakthrough rates were seen for the 0.7 nmol/l threshold compared to 1.7 nmol/l (41.3% vs 6.9%, p < 0.0001). A significant association between breakthrough rates and worse clinical outcomes overall was not found, although when larger trials (sample size greater than 100) and higher event rates (greater than 50%) were considered for the lowest threshold, significant associations between breakthrough rates and clinical outcomes were observed. Clinical factors such as administration and monitoring frequency, type of testosterone assay and type of androgen deprivation therapy did not significantly affect breakthrough rates, although nonvalidated assays were associated with a large degree of variability.

Conclusions

Results from our analysis indicate that testosterone breakthroughs likely result in worse clinical outcomes and should be avoided. Moreover, there is a need to standardize assessment of testosterone levels both clinically and in the research context to better inform treatment decisions and improve the reliability and comparability of results across studies.

### Does baseline serum testosterone influence androgen deprivation therapy outcomes in hormone Naïve patients with advanced prostate cancer? [^113tam8h]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study baseline serum testosterone's prognostic value in hormone naïve advanced prostate cancer patients receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy.

Materials and Methods

The study population undergoing continuous androgen deprivation therapy (agonist or antagonist) with 1-year followup was pooled for post-hoc analysis from 2 large prospective, randomized, parallel arm phase 3b trials (NCT00295750-Global; NCT00928434-USA). Survival end points were evaluated for baseline serum testosterone effect as a continuous variable and compared for low (less than 250 ng/dl) vs normal (250 ng/dl or greater) groups based on the saturation model, using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, log rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models incorporating established clinically important baseline factors.

Results

On intention to treat analysis 138 (16.5%) of 838 eligible men had baseline serum testosterone less than 250 ng/dl. Key cancer characteristics for low vs normal baseline serum testosterone cohorts were comparable; Gleason sum 7–10 (55% vs 58%), stage and prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or greater categories (38% each). The lowest baseline serum testosterone quartile cutoff value was 282 ng/dl or less (206 patients). Multivariable analysis showed a significant baseline serum testosterone effect for all survival end points. For the saturation model low cutoff less than 250 ng/dl, significance remained for overall (HR 2.24; p < 0.02) and progression-free survival (HR 1.57; p < 0.02), but not for time to prostate specific antigen progression (HR 1.37; p = 0.2).

Conclusions

Lower baseline serum testosterone was significantly associated with worse study survival end points in hormone naïve advanced prostate cancer patients undergoing continuous medical castration. Future well-designed studies should compare continuous androgen deprivation therapy (the current gold standard) with newer alternatives to optimize individualized management in these men.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Mass spectrometry redefines optimal testosterone thresholds in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy [^112UJXee]. The Prostate (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for prostate cancer treatment. Studies suggest that patients with testosterone levels below 0.7nM have a longer time to castration resistance. Using the most accurate testosterone measurement method, namely mass spectrometry (MS), we sought to determine if a lower testosterone level under ADT could be associated with longer time to castration resistance.

Methods

This retrospective study included 138 prostate cancer patients undergoing noncurative continuous ADT for which we had access to testosterone measurements assessed by MS. For 108 samples, paired immunoassays (IA) testosterone measurement was available. Primary outcome was time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The Contal and O'Quigley method was used to determine the optimal testosterone castration cut-off point considering the outcome and time-to-event variables. Relationship between testosterone levels assessed either by IA or MS and time to CRPC was evaluated using Cox regression.

Results

Mean testosterone level was 0.370nM by IA and 0.275nM as assessed by MS. The optimal testosterone cut-off point identified to predict time to CRPC was of 0.705nM for IA and of 0.270nM for MS. While no significant difference for time to CRPC was found between patients showing IA testosterone level ≥ 0.705nM versus < 0.705nM (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.579; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.908–2.745), patients with MS testosterone ≥ 0.270nM had an increased risk of progression to CRPC compared to MS testosterone < 0.270nM in univariate (HR: 1.717; 95% CI: 1.160–2.541) and multivariate analysis (HR: 1.662; 95% CI: 1.043–2.648).

Conclusions

The higher sensitivity of MS testosterone measurement methods allows the identification of a lower castration threshold and leads to early identification of patients more likely to progress to CRPC. These patients would likely benefit from treatment intensification by androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies to delay disease progression.

Monitoring serum testosterone levels in mCSPC

There was unanimous consensus on the superiority of ADT + abiraterone acetate (AA) compared with ADT alone in terms of OS in mCSPC, based on two large clinical trials (LATITUDE and STAMPEDE), consistent with the NCCN recommendation in this setting. 59, 60 The panel's recommendation was made irrespective of metastatic burden (86% consensus).

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the seminal work by Huggins and Hodges 1 establishing that prostate cancer (PC) is an endocrine‐responsive disease, PC patients — those with locally advanced, recurrent, and metastatic disease — may receive treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 1, 2 Castration can be administered surgically (bilateral orchiectomy) or medically (administration of a gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonist or antagonist). For specific clinical indications, ADT will induce disease PC regression, relieve symptoms and prolong survival; however, ADT has a well‐described range of side effects, including but not limited to, hot flashes, fatigue, depression, sarcopenia, increased visceral and abdominal fat mass, weight gain, increased cholesterol and triglycerides levels, insulin resistance, and loss of bone mineral density with an increased risk of fracture. Any of these side effects may have a detrimental effect on the patient's quality of life, necessitating additional interventions or changes in PC treatment. 3 ADT is often used to manage biochemical recurrence (BCR) or rising levels of prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) after failed primary therapy, despite a paucity of evidence to demonstrate a survival benefit in this clinical setting. Therefore, despite the known risk of ADT side effects, the risk‐benefit analysis for initiating ADT in PC patients throughout the PC disease continuum warrants review.

Guidelines for the management of PC have been systematically reviewed and published by many associations, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the American Urological Association (AUA), and the European Association of Urology (EAU). All have evaluated and delineated recommendations for the foundational role of ADT in the management of advanced PC. However, in clinical practice the decision to use ADT is highly variable.

To address the gaps in ADT recommendations, the Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA) organized an expert panel to develop evidence‐based recommendations for the use of ADT throughout the PC disease continuum, with applicability for community urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists who manage advanced PC patients. The goal of this panel was to provide guidance on a more judicious use of ADT in advanced PC patients, maximizing the benefit‐to‐risk ratio. The initiative was sponsored by an unrestricted grant from Tolmar Pharmaceuticals.

Testosterone therapy — lean body mass effects in men with testosterone deficiency: In men with testosterone deficiency, testosterone therapy results in increased lean muscle mass and reduced fat mass, but no overall changes in BMI. Based on analyses of 12 studies, lean body mass increased by a mean 1.9 kg with trial durations ranging from 12–156 weeks, and studies reporting optimal testosterone levels yielded a mean 2.2 kg increase in lean body mass compared to a non-significant 0.8 kg increase when suboptimal levels of testosterone were achieved. Studies of ≤ 3 months' duration reported non-significant improvements (0.8 kg) compared to 2.1 kg with > 3 months, and meta-analyses have also consistently demonstrated increases in lean muscle mass with testosterone therapy but have reported inconsistent outcomes on overall BMI.
