## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered to evaluate cholecystitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order to evaluate cholecystitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and where labs fit alongside clinical signs and imaging. Then, I should review which inflammatory markers are most discriminative and how to interpret them. Next, I will assess which liver tests are necessary, what patterns suggest choledocholithiasis, and when to escalate to MRCP/EUS. After that, I need to clarify when blood cultures are actually indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical interpretation strategy, consider special populations, and close with the exact test order and hierarchy of interpretation, cross-checking each step against guideline statements and key studies for internal consistency and accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework before ordering tests. Acute cholecystitis is a clinicoradiologic diagnosis that requires integration of local signs, systemic inflammatory markers, and characteristic imaging to be definitive per the Tokyo Guidelines, and WSES 2020 explicitly cautions not to rely on any single clinical or laboratory finding, so labs support probability rather than establish the diagnosis in isolation [^111Dzo9D] [^113UFb78].

> I need to check which inflammatory markers best support the diagnosis. WBC with differential is standard, but I should confirm whether CRP adds more signal; the Tokyo framework includes either elevated WBC or CRP as systemic inflammation, with a commonly used CRP threshold around 3 mg/dL, and a large retrospective cohort indicates CRP has superior discriminative power to WBC across severities of acute cholecystitis, making a normal CRP particularly useful to reduce the likelihood of disease; I should also keep in mind that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may perform comparably to CRP in smaller cohorts, though this is not yet incorporated in major guidelines, so I will prioritize WBC and CRP for routine care and consider NLR as adjunctive if already available [^111Dzo9D] [^115nMfUb] [^1179vqs8].

> Hold on, I should verify how liver biochemical tests are used; they are not for diagnosing acute cholecystitis per se but for detecting possible choledocholithiasis. WSES 2020 recommends ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, and ALP for all patients with acute calculous cholecystitis to stratify risk of CBD stones, while warning that abnormal LFTs have poor positive predictive value and normal LFTs have high negative predictive value for choledocholithiasis; EASL similarly recommends obtaining liver tests when CBD stones are suspected, reinforcing that their value is in risk assessment rather than confirmation [^115ji3tH] [^112RxuPA] [^111peK8x].

> Wait, let me reconsider the specific LFT patterns that should trigger further imaging. Marked elevations in bilirubin and cholestatic enzymes increase the probability of CBD stones, but WSES emphasizes that no single cutoff should be used alone and recommends further testing rather than assuming stones solely from LFT elevation; data suggest bilirubin cutoffs and ALP thresholds have high specificity at higher values but reduced sensitivity, while a GGT cutoff around 90 U/L has excellent NPV with only modest PPV, so I will use a pattern-based approach and move to MRCP or EUS in intermediate risk rather than over-calling based on isolated mild abnormalities [^111MrViD] [^111v6obo] [^114xrDEe].

> I should double-check when to obtain blood cultures because these are often over-ordered. The IDSA 2024 guidance advises obtaining blood cultures only when fever is accompanied by hypotension, tachypnea, or delirium, or when there is concern for resistant organisms or immunocompromise; conversely, it recommends avoiding routine cultures in stable, immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease since yield is low and does not alter initial therapy, so I will not order them reflexively [^116zK9sk] [^117G2gor].

> Next, I will synthesize interpretation with the diagnostic workflow. Definite acute cholecystitis requires characteristic imaging plus at least one local sign and at least one systemic sign, so I will weigh WBC and especially CRP as the systemic component; if both CRP and WBC are normal, I will pause and reassess alternative diagnoses or consider acalculous or early disease while correlating with imaging; if cholestatic LFTs are significantly elevated, I will adjust pretest probability toward choledocholithiasis and add MRCP or EUS before cholecystectomy; and if ultrasound is nondiagnostic yet suspicion persists, I should proceed to HIDA or MRI per contemporary guidance rather than over-interpreting labs alone [^111Dzo9D] [^113JZGsh].

> Let me think about special populations because interpretation can shift. In pregnancy, the laboratory approach is unchanged, but ultrasound and MRI should be favored for imaging adjuncts; in older adults, inflammatory responses may be blunted and CRP may outperform WBC as a systemic signal, so I should not be reassured by a marginal leukocyte count; in critically ill patients with possible acalculous cholecystitis, inflammatory markers remain important but LFTs are less informative for stones and imaging plus clinical context drive management [^111uFnLW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, earlier I was inclined to state that CT has poor diagnostic accuracy compared with other modalities; that aligns with older WSES statements favoring HIDA as most accurate and noting limitations of CT, but hold on, I should verify against newer evidence because sequential CT and ultrasound are frequently used in practice. A recent systematic review suggests CT and ultrasound have broadly comparable sensitivity and specificity in head-to-head analyses, so while ultrasound remains first-line, I should correct my initial impression and acknowledge that CT can be reasonable in selected scenarios or when performed first, with HIDA retained as the most accurate second-line when sonography and CT are equivocal [^113fQgaP] [^114oNFVh].

> To finalize the practical orders, I need to ensure completeness without overtesting. For every patient with suspected acute cholecystitis, I will obtain a CBC with differential and CRP to document systemic inflammation and a comprehensive liver panel including ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and total and direct bilirubin to stratify risk for choledocholithiasis; I will reserve blood cultures for patients meeting IDSA sepsis or resistance-risk criteria; in interpretation, I will weight CRP more heavily than WBC as the systemic marker, use normal LFTs to reduce the likelihood of CBD stones, avoid diagnosing stones on LFTs alone, and escalate to MRCP or EUS when the lab pattern and clinical scenario indicate intermediate to high risk prior to definitive surgery [^115nMfUb] [^115ji3tH] [^114xrDEe] [^114n4SPX].

---

For suspected cholecystitis, order a **CBC with differential** to detect leukocytosis and neutrophilia [^1114f7Hp], and **CRP** to assess inflammation severity [^115nMfUb] [^111Dzo9D]. Obtain a **comprehensive metabolic panel** to evaluate liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) and total and direct bilirubin for biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^116SAcCw] [^114gKpDj] [^115ji3tH]. Consider **blood cultures** in febrile patients with hypotension, tachypnea, or delirium, or when resistant organisms are a concern [^116zK9sk] [^117G2gor]. These tests inform diagnosis and severity but are not diagnostic on their own; interpret alongside clinical assessment and imaging [^113UFb78] [^116kUMFg].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) with differential

- **Leukocytosis**: Elevated WBC count is common in acute cholecystitis [^111Dzo9D], reflecting systemic inflammation or infection.

- **Neutrophilia**: An increased neutrophil count is a strong independent predictor [^113S5Gvs] of acute cholecystitis.

- **NLR**: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a useful inflammatory biomarker [^1179vqs8], with superior discriminative power compared to WBC alone.

---

## C-reactive protein (CRP)

CRP is a **sensitive marker of inflammation** [^111Dzo9D] and is typically elevated in acute cholecystitis. It has superior discriminative power compared to WBC count, particularly in mild and moderate-to-severe cases [^115nMfUb].

---

## Liver function tests (LFTs)

LFTs are essential for evaluating **hepatic involvement and biliary obstruction** [^116SAcCw]. ALT and AST rise with hepatocellular injury; ALT may also increase with biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^115ji3tH]. Elevations in ALP, GGT, and total and direct bilirubin suggest biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^114gKpDj]. Elevated LFTs alone are insufficient to diagnose choledocholithiasis; further diagnostic tests are recommended [^114xrDEe] [^112Bus4P].

---

## Blood cultures

Blood cultures are recommended for patients with suspected intra-abdominal infection who have **fever, hypotension, tachypnea, delirium**, or concern for **antibiotic-resistant organisms** [^116zK9sk] [^117G2gor]. Positive results identify bacteremia, guide antibiotic therapy, and indicate severe infection or sepsis [^116zK9sk].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

Serum amylase and lipase may be elevated when **pancreatitis** is suspected, a potential complication of cholecystitis [^1165emXK]. Elevated lactate may indicate tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis, suggesting severe or complicated disease [^111cihJ4].

---

## Laboratory findings indicating severity or complications

Certain laboratory abnormalities suggest **severe or complicated cholecystitis** [^111Dzo9D]:

- **Marked leukocytosis**: Indicates severe inflammation or infection [^1114f7Hp].

- **Significantly elevated CRP**: Suggests severe inflammation or gangrenous cholecystitis [^115nMfUb].

- **Elevated bilirubin and LFTs**: May indicate biliary obstruction, cholangitis, or hepatic involvement [^115ji3tH].

- **Positive blood cultures**: Indicate bacteremia or sepsis, suggesting severe infection [^116zK9sk].

---

## Limitations of laboratory tests

- **Non-specificity**: Laboratory tests alone cannot definitively diagnose acute cholecystitis [^113UFb78]; they must be interpreted with clinical and imaging findings [^116kUMFg].

- **Normal results**: Normal laboratory results do not exclude acute cholecystitis, particularly in early or mild cases [^1114f7Hp].

- **False positives**: Elevated LFTs may occur without choledocholithiasis, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation [^114xrDEe] [^112Bus4P] [^114gGaRR].

## Recommended laboratory tests summary

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| CBC with differential | Leukocytosis, neutrophilia, NLR [^111Dzo9D] [^1179vqs8] |
| CRP | Inflammation severity [^115nMfUb] |
| ALT, AST, ALP, GGT | Hepatic involvement, biliary obstruction [^114gKpDj] [^116SAcCw] |
| Total and direct bilirubin | Biliary obstruction, cholangitis [^115ji3tH] |
| Blood cultures | Bacteremia, sepsis [^116zK9sk] [^117G2gor] |
| Serum amylase and lipase | Pancreatitis suspicion [^1165emXK] |
| Lactate | Tissue hypoperfusion, sepsis [^111cihJ4] |

---

Laboratory tests for cholecystitis include **CBC with differential, CRP, LFTs, bilirubin**, and blood cultures when indicated. These tests assess inflammation, hepatic involvement, and complications but should be interpreted alongside clinical assessment and imaging [^1114f7Hp].

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" is an essential tool for diagnosing acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease. These criteria are designed to guide clinicians in identifying acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious inflammation of the gallbladder, and to classify patients based on symptom severity.

- **Diagnostic criteria components**: The criteria consist of local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs include Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs include fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and an elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also integral to the criteria.

The diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis requires the presence of characteristic imaging findings, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and at least one systemic sign of inflammation. Suspected acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in the presence of either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one systemic sign of inflammation, even if characteristic imaging findings are absent. If none of these criteria are met, a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established.

These diagnostic criteria provide a structured and systematic approach for diagnosing acute cholecystitis.

### C-reactive protein has a better discriminative power than white cell count in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [^115nMfUb]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) is challenging and may result in a delay in surgery, hospital discharge, and increased mortality. To improve its diagnosis, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been proposed as a benchmark. The aim of this study was to evaluate the discriminative power of CRP against white cell count (WCC) in AC.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study. Over a 5-year period, 1,959 patients were identified from the audit of cholecystectomies. The exclusion criteria were coexisting acute surgical conditions, absence of blood tests within 3 days before hospital admission for elective surgery, and private patients.

- **Results**: The eligibility criteria were met by 1,843 patients. Comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve of CRP and WCC in acute on chronic, edematous, necrotic, suppurative, and gangrenous AC showed a better discriminative power of CRP. Both tests performed equally well in patients with pericholecystic abscess and gallbladder perforation. CRP was superior to WCC in mild AC, AUC = 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.9–0.95) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74–0.84), P < 0.00005, in moderate and severe AC, AUC = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97–1.0) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88–0.97), P = 0.009, and in all forms of AC combined, AUC = 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92–0.97) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79–0.87), respectively, P < 0.00005.

- **Conclusions**: CRP has a better discriminative power than WCC in most forms of AC and is a useful diagnostic marker of AC.

### Complications of cholecystitis: A comprehensive contemporary imaging review [^112DGKFw]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common cause of right upper quadrant pain in patients presenting to the emergency department. Ultrasound, computed tomography, HIDA scans, and magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly utilized to evaluate suspected cases. The prognosis of acute cholecystitis is usually excellent with timely diagnosis and management. However, complications associated with cholecystitis pose a considerable challenge to the clinician and radiologist.

Complications of acute cholecystitis may result from secondary bacterial infection or mural ischemia secondary to increased intramural pressure. The recognized subtypes of complicated cholecystitis are hemorrhagic, gangrenous, and emphysematous cholecystitis, as well as gallbladder perforation. Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a form of cholecystitis that occurs as a complication of severe illness in the absence of gallstones or without gallstone-related inflammation. Complicated cholecystitis may cause significant morbidity and mortality, and early diagnosis and recognition play a pivotal role in the management and early surgical planning.

As appropriate utilization of imaging resources plays an essential role in diagnosis and management, the emergency radiologist should be aware of the spectrum of complications related to cholecystitis and the characteristic imaging features. This article aims to offer a comprehensive contemporary review of clinical and cross-sectional imaging findings of complications associated with cholecystitis. In conclusion, cross-sectional imaging is pivotal in identifying the complications.

One flaw of the study is that the index diagnosis depends to some extent on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of CBDS is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated LFTs; this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.1 We recommend against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC, in which case we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LFTs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a NPV of 97%, whereas the PPV of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for predicting CBDS, even in patients without ACC; the literature ranges from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction. A proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1,178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had definitive CBDS.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115X7qkh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). High credibility.

An updated overview of ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) remains lacking. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US for AC.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We meticulously screened articles from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, spanning from inception to August 2023. We employed the search strategy combining the keywords "bedside US", "emergency US", or "point-of-care US" with "AC". Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to identify suitable studies. The inclusion criteria encompassed articles investigating the diagnostic performance of US for AC. Data regarding diagnostic performance, sonographers, and sonographic findings, including the presence of gallstone, gallbladder (GB) wall thickness, peri-GB fluid, or sonographic Murphy sign were extracted, and a meta-analysis was executed. Case reports, editorials, and review articles were excluded, as well as studies focused on acalculous cholecystitis. The study quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.

- **Results**: Forty studies with 8,652 patients were included. The majority of studies had a low risk of bias and applicability concerns. US had a pooled sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 69–72%), a specificity of 85% (95% CI, 84–86%), and an accuracy of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82–0.83) for the diagnosis of AC. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 71% (95% CI, 67–74%) and 92% (95% CI, 90–93%) when performed by emergency sonographers.

### Role of liver function tests in predicting common bile duct stones in acute calculous cholecystitis [^111v6obo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The role of liver function tests (LFTs) in evaluating common bile duct (CBD) stones in patients with cholelithiasis has been studied widely. However, it is not clear whether these predictive models are useful in inflammatory gallstone disease.

- **Methods**: A review was undertaken of 385 consecutive patients admitted as an emergency for acute calculous gallbladder disease. The diagnosis of calculous cholecystitis was confirmed by ultrasonography or histological confirmation of acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. Patients with obvious jaundice, defined as a bilirubin level above 80 micromol/l, and gallstone pancreatitis were excluded.

- **Results**: Some 216 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 (13.0 percent) were found to have CBD stones. LFT results were not significantly different in patients with chronic, acute, or complicated acute cholecystitis. Using several cut-off levels, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) had the highest specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, comparable to a scoring system that combined all LFTs. Bilirubin was the least specific and predictive. A cut-off point for GGT at 90 units/l produced a sensitivity of 86 percent (24 of 28), specificity of 74.5 percent (140 of 188), and positive and negative predictive values of 33 percent (24 of 72) and 97.2 percent (140 of 144) respectively. This represented a one in three chance of CBD stones when the GGT level was above 90 units/l and a one in 30 chance when the level was less than 90 units/l.

- **Conclusion**: Selection criteria based on GGT can be used effectively in predicting the presence of CBD stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of common bile duct stones (CBDS) into three different classes. These are defined as follows:

- **Low risk (50%) of CBDS**: This proposed classification has clear clinical implications. Patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation. Those with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or intraoperatively with laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), in order to select patients who need stone removal. According to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option for these patients.

Patients with a high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC).

- **Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS**: (modified from Maple et al. 2010)

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC? We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons guidelines.

# QoE: Very low; SoR: Weak#

ASGE guidelines remain a valuable tool for the diagnosis and management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients should be managed accordingly.

### Acute cholecystitis: A review [^116TBPPj]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

Gallbladder disease affects approximately 20 million people in the US. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200,000 people in the US each year.

- **Observations**: Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, which is defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically occurring in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and findings of right upper quadrant tenderness upon physical examination. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test.

	- Following a diagnosis, early (performed within 1–3 days) versus late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes. These improvements include fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs. 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs. 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, when compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal and fetal complications.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^115jKvxy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Combining clinical, laboratory, and imaging investigations is recommended, although the best combination is not yet known (LoE 4 GoRC). The integration of clinical and abdominal ultrasound (AUS) findings may improve diagnostic accuracy; however, studies reporting results related to certain clinical and imaging combinations are limited.

Hwang et al. reported a 74% sensitivity and 62% specificity by combining a positive Murphy sign, elevated neutrophil count, and positive AUS. Interestingly, within this study, the sensitivity of an elevated neutrophil count alone was 79%, higher than the 74% sensitivity of the combined clinical, laboratory, and AUS signs. Additionally, the specificity of AUS alone was 81%, which was higher than the 62% reported when combined clinical, laboratory, and AUS findings were analyzed.

Another study reported 97% sensitivity and 76% specificity by combining C-reactive protein (CRP) and AUS. However, based on the inclusion criteria, the generalizability of these findings may present challenges when applied to routine clinical practice.

The study by Yokoe et al. evaluated the Tokyo guidelines criteria and found a sensitivity of 91.2% and a specificity of 96.9% for these guidelines in diagnosing acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC). The Tokyo guidelines combine different clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, providing a higher probability of reaching a diagnosis. However, the report did not define the specific combinations used. As previously stated, the generalizability of these findings to routine clinical practice may be problematic due to the inclusion criteria.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, specifically concerning further imaging in the general population, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering either an abdominal MRI/MRCP or a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan. These should be obtained as subsequent imaging if both ultrasound and CT are equivocal or non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists.

### Sensitivity and predictive value of ultrasound in pediatric cholecystitis [^116ei15s]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography has a high sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosing cholecystitis in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and PPV of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pediatric cholecystitis.

- **Methods**: We performed a single-institution retrospective review of the records of all patients undergoing cholecystectomy with a preoperative ultrasound during 2005–2010. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and PPV using pathologic findings as the standard for the diagnosis of cholecystitis.

- **Results**: In the 223 included patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 14 years (11–16 years), and 64% were female. Preoperative symptoms of abdominal pain were reported in 98% of patients. A diagnosis of cholecystitis was reported in 10% (23 of 223) of ultrasound readings. Pathologic diagnosis of cholecystitis was present in 80% (179 of 223) of cholecystectomy specimens, with 8% (15 of 179) having acute cholecystitis, 83% (148 of 179) chronic cholecystitis, and 9% (16 of 179) both. Sensitivity of ultrasound findings ranged from 6% for Murphy's sign to 66% for cholelithiasis. Positive predictive values ranged from 67% for Murphy's sign to 87% for gallbladder sludge. Presence of any one ultrasound sign had a sensitivity of 82% and PPV of 80%.

- **Conclusions**: Ultrasound findings in pediatric cholecystitis have lower sensitivities and PPVs than reported in adults. These differences may be explained by the higher prevalence of chronic cholecystitis in children, suggesting that children may have milder episodes of self-limited.

### Clinical presentation, imaging, and management of acute cholecystitis [^114jQc8c]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a life-threatening emergency that commonly occurs as a complication of gallstones. Severe right upper quadrant pain, abdominal guarding, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign with an elevated white blood cell count are the classical clinical manifestations of AC. Although ultrasonography is typically the initial diagnostic examination in patients with suspected AC, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are commonly performed to identify complications. Cholescintigraphy is recommended in patients with equivocal findings on the other imaging modalities, as this technique has the highest diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of AC. Imaging studies are also helpful in the timely detection of complications associated with AC.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the gold-standard treatment for AC. However, percutaneous gallbladder drainage, with or without cholecystostomy tube placement, is a safe, effective management technique for surgically high-risk patients with multiple medical conditions. This treatment can be used either as a bridging therapy, with elective cholecystectomy performed at a later time after the patient's condition improves, or as definitive treatment in surgically unfit patients. Radiologists play a pivotal role in the initial diagnosis and management of patients with AC.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^1151SFiB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Associated common bile duct stones**: Choledocholithiasis, i.e. the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS), is reported to occur in 10% to 20% of gallstone cases, with a lower incidence, ranging from 5% to 15%, in cases of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). Investigations for CBDS require time and may delay surgical treatment. Due to the relatively low incidence of CBDS during ACC, the main issue is to select patients with a high likelihood of CBDS who would benefit from further diagnostic tests and the removal of CBDS. An uncommon condition that mimics CBDS is Mirizzi syndrome, which occurs in less than 1% of patients with gallstones. Preoperative investigations may help in diagnosis, although the vast majority of cases are identified during surgery.

The only new study on this topic was a cross-sectional study on the role of liver function tests (LFTs). The authors evaluated the role of LFTs and early follow-up in the diagnosis of CBDS in ACC. The most reliable LFT was gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 75.3%, using a cut-off level of 224 IU/L. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 50%, while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 91.4%. The results also showed a significant decrease in LFTs within the non-CBD groups at the 4-day follow-up, which was not evident in the ACC + CBDS group, with the exception of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Moreover, in the CBDS group, all LFT values improved significantly after the removal of the CBDS at a mean follow-up time of 4.3 days.

### The absence of gallstones on point-of-care ultrasound rules out acute cholecystitis [^11326Jwd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis affects an estimated 20 million people in the United States yearly; 20% of symptomatic patients will develop acute cholecystitis (AC). A recent single-center study estimating test characteristics of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) for the detection of AC, as defined by gallstones plus sonographic Murphy's sign, pericholecystic fluid, or gallbladder wall-thickening, resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 87% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66–97) and 82% (95% CI 74–88), respectively. No prior studies have been conducted to estimate the test characteristics of POCUS for the purpose of excluding acute calculous cholecystitis.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the finding of gallstones alone on POCUS has high sensitivity, high negative predictive value, and low negative likelihood ratio for the exclusion of AC.

- **Methods**: We conducted an analysis using data from a prospective cross-sectional single-center study of POCUS to estimate the test characteristics using a simplified definition of a positive test — the presence of gallstones alone. Clinical follow-up and pathology reports were used as the reference standard. Test characteristics were calculated and compared to the standard definition, gallstones plus one secondary finding.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of AC was 14% (23 pathology-confirmed cases of 164 included patients). The sensitivity of the simplified definition was 100% (95% CI 85.7–100), negative predictive value 100% (95% CI 92.2–100), and negative likelihood ratio was < 0.1, compared to a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 66–97%).

### Predictive factors for the diagnosis of severe acute cholecystitis in an emergency setting [^113nobHF]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess predictive factors for the diagnosis of severe acute cholecystitis in emergency settings.

- **Methods**: The medical records of 295 patients with pathologically confirmed acute cholecystitis were reviewed. Patients were divided, based on pathology findings, into a group with nonsevere acute cholecystitis and a group with severe acute cholecystitis. Preoperative data were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses, allowing diagnostic values to be assessed based on statistically significant predictive factors. The same approach was attempted for differential diagnosis between gangrenous and phlegmonous cholecystitis.

- **Results**: Among ten variables found to be significantly different in univariate analysis, four were identified as independent predictive factors for severe acute cholecystitis: fever, distension of the gallbladder, wall edema, and preoperative adverse events. Common bile duct stones were confirmed as a protective factor. Leukocyte count, cardiovascular diseases, age, gender, and diabetes were not significant predictive factors for severe acute cholecystitis. No differences in preoperative data were found when comparing phlegmonous and gangrenous cholecystitis.

- **Conclusion**: Severe acute cholecystitis may be differentiated preoperatively from nonsevere acute cholecystitis based on clinical and US data. Predictive diagnostic values may be estimated according to the number of observed predictive factors. No differences were found when comparing phlegmonous and gangrenous cholecystitis.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^113R8ekX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The management of acute calculous cholecystitis still offers room for debate in terms of diagnosis, severity scores, treatment options, and timing for surgery.

- **Material and methods**: A systematic review of the treatment of acute cholecystitis has been completed. The recommendations of recent guidelines have also been examined, taking into account the results of the review.

- **Results**: The evidence available in the literature supports the recommendation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible after diagnosis because early treatment reduces the total hospital stay and does not increase complication or conversion rates. Antibiotics can play different roles, and attention should be given to the risk of emerging resistance. A surgical or percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is advocated by some authors in advanced forms of inflammation or patients with severe comorbidities; however, the available evidence does not support it, and further studies are necessary to clarify its role.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^116FpnFm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Tokyo guidelines offer a systematic overview and revision of the pathophysiological, clinical, and diagnostic approach to biliary infections. Based on this exhaustive overview, these guidelines also provide specific therapeutic indications for operative and conservative management.

Diagnosis is the starting point of treatment for any pathology, including acute cholecystitis. Prompt and timely diagnosis should allow for early treatment and lower morbidity and mortality. The Tokyo guidelines proposed a staging system based on the evaluation of local signs of inflammation (Murphy's sign and RUQ mass/pain/tenderness), systemic signs (fever, elevated CRP with values of 3 mg/dl or more, and abnormal WBC count), and imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis. Similar diagnostic criteria have been reported in other recent studies.

In terms of diagnosis and treatment of acute cholecystitis, the peculiarity of the Tokyo guidelines is the classification of the disease into mild, moderate, and severe categories. No previous study examined the optimal treatment of acute cholecystitis based on an organ-related severity score index. At the Tokyo consensus meeting, the need for surgical treatment according to the grade of severity was suggested and discussed. Subsequent studies analyzed the impact of the Tokyo guidelines on the management of patients with acute cholecystitis, emphasizing their impact on surgical outcomes. Even though the expert panel of that consensus conducted extraordinary scientific work, no benefits have been demonstrated by applying these guidelines.

- **Preoperative MRCP**: Consider magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography based on imaging availability.
- **Preoperative EUS**: Employ endoscopic ultrasound according to expertise and resources.
- **Intraoperative cholangiography**: Utilize this method during surgery when applicable.
- **Laparoscopic ultrasound**: Adapt this technique if suitably equipped.

### Acute cholecystitis [^1142XNvk]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Low credibility.

Of people admitted to hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men, and about one and a half times more common in women than in men thereafter. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, open cholecystectomy, and percutaneous cholecystostomy.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^111cihJ4]. World journal of emergency surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis is a common disorder worldwide. Its prevalence varies significantly by region: in Western countries, the prevalence of gallstone disease reportedly ranges from approximately 7.9% in men to 16.6% in women; in Asia, it ranges from approximately 3% to 15%, is nearly non-existent (less than 5%) in Africa, and ranges from 4.21% to 11% in China. Acute cholecystitis develops in 1–3% of patients with symptomatic gallstones.

In 2016, WSES guidelines for the management of acute calculous cholecystitis (AAC) were published. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is based on clinical features such as right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. It is supported by findings from relevant imaging studies. Ultrasound is the investigation of choice in patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis. Typically, ultrasound shows pericholecystic fluid (fluid around the gallbladder), a distended gallbladder, an edematous gallbladder wall, and gallstones; Murphy's sign can be elicited on ultrasound examination.

Treatment is predominantly surgical, although the timing of surgery without evidence of gangrene or perforation has been debated in recent years. Two approaches are available for the treatment of acute cholecystitis: the early option, generally within seven days of the onset of symptoms, offers a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to provide immediate, definitive surgical treatment after establishing the diagnosis and surgical fitness of the patient in the same hospital admission; the delayed treatment option is performed later.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116FEJZw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Published data from eight cross-sectional studies confirmed the heterogeneity of diagnostic values, diagnostic index, and standard reference for the final diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). Traditional ultrasonography (US) showed wide ranges of sensitivity (from 26% to 100%), specificity (from 62% to 88.1%), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV; 35% to 93.7% and 52% to 97.1%, respectively), as well as positive likelihood ratio (LR; 1.29 to 4.7) and negative LR (0.16 to 0.93). Global accuracy has been reported in two studies, varying from 70.1% to 79%.

In one study, the absence of gallstones was used to rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected cholecystitis. Overall, the sensitivity of the simplified definition of a positive ultrasonography test was 100%, compared to the standard definition. The standard definition involves the presence of gallstones and at least one ultrasonography sign of acute cholecystitis, with a sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 66–97%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI 74–88%). The prevalence was less than 15%. The NPV was 97% (95% CI 93–99%), while the PPV was low at 44% (95% CI 29–59%).

### A proposal for a preoperative clinical scoring system for acute cholecystitis [^114eLrrN]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common diagnosis for which surgery is usually indicated. However, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation makes it difficult to standardize management. The variation in clinical presentation is influenced by both patient-dependent and disease-specific factors. A preoperative clinical scoring system designed to include patient-dependent and clinical factors might be a useful tool in clinical decision-making.

- **Methods**: The data of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in a university hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patient-dependent factors (age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score) and disease-specific factors (history of biliary colics, white blood count, C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickness) were used to compute a clinical score between zero and nine for each patient. Cholecystitis was classified as mild (score ≤ 3), moderate (4 ≤ score ≤ 6), or severe (score ≥ 7).

- **Results**: Cholecystitis was mild in 45 cases, moderate in 105 cases, and severe in 27 cases. Among patient-dependent factors, the male gender, age > 65 years, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score > 2 correlated significantly with high scores (P = 0.001). Equally, high white blood count, elevated C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickness > 4 mm correlated significantly with high scores (P = 0.001). These findings were confirmed on multivariate analyses. High scores correlated significantly with the duration of surgery (P = 0.007) and the need for intensive care unit management.

### Clinical characteristics of acute cholecystitis with elevated liver enzymes not associated with choledocholithiasis [^114gGaRR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated liver enzymes are observed occasionally in patients with acute cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis. The etiology and mechanism of this phenomenon are not well known. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics between acute cholecystitis with and without choledocholithiasis in patients with elevated liver enzymes.

- **Patients and methods**: The medical records of acute cholecystitis patients who underwent cholecystectomy between January 2001 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. We retrieved data of patients who showed abnormal liver enzymes and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or intraoperative cholangiography.

- **Results**: We analyzed clinical characteristics and comorbidities in 424 patients. Among these patients, 178 (42%) did not have choledocholithiasis, whereas 246 (58%) had choledocholithiasis. The median AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were 47, 82.5 IU/dl, and 1.21 mg/dl, respectively, in patients without choledocholithiasis and 58, 96 IU/dl, and 1.53 mg/dl, respectively, in patients with choledocholithiasis. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fatty liver [odds ratio (OR): 0.218; P < 0.001], radiologic findings (OR: 0.414; P = 0.001), and the level of total bilirubin (OR: 1.410; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of choledocholithiasis.

- **Conclusion**: Elevated liver enzymes in patients with cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis are correlated with the presence of fatty liver.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^1114f7Hp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

- **Diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis**: As no feature has sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude the diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC), it is recommended not to rely on a single clinical or laboratory finding. For the diagnosis of ACC, a combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging investigations is suggested. However, the best combination is not known.

	- **Useful features for the diagnosis of ACC include**:
		- **History and clinical examination**: Fever, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, vomiting or food intolerance; Murphy's sign.
		- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated C-reactive protein, elevated white blood cell count.
		- **Imaging**: Signs suggestive of gallbladder inflammation.

The recommendations of the 2016 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines were primarily based on two studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis by Trowbridge et al, and a prospective diagnostic study by Eskelinen et al. This evidence, although flawed by the limitations described below, remains relevant, and the associated statement remains valid.

The paper by Trowbridge et al. included 17 studies, which reported a quantitative assessment of history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The results showed that, with the exception of Murphy's sign (positive likelihood ratio — LR 2.8; 95% CI 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–1.1) — although the 95% confidence intervals included 1.0 in both cases, none of the clinical signs or laboratory tests showed LRs higher than these.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis [^114BcThD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Gallstones are present in approximately 10% to 15% of the adult Western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic each year, with the majority experiencing biliary colic and a significant proportion suffering from acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is typically performed after the episode resolves, due to concerns of increased morbidity and the potential need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes patients to the risk of gallstone-related complications.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days after the clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis) with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after the initial admission for acute cholecystitis) in terms of benefits and harms.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We utilized the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

- **Main results**: We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the analysis.

The 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines provide updated recommendations for surgical interventions in cases of acute cholecystitis, particularly concerning cholecystectomy. According to these guidelines, conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy is advised for patients with acute calculous cholecystitis when any of the following conditions are present:

- **Severe local inflammation**: Conversion may be necessary due to extensive inflammation, which can impede the laparoscopic procedure.

- **Adhesions**: Dense adhesions can obscure anatomical landmarks, making laparoscopic surgery challenging.

- **Bleeding from Calot's triangle**: Significant bleeding can compromise the safety and success of a laparoscopic approach.

- **Suspected bile injury**: In cases where bile duct injury is suspected, conversion allows for better visualization and assessment.

### Hemorrhagic cholecystitis: Ultrasound and CT imaging findings-a retrospective case review series [^114fNbFy]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Gallbladder pathology is diverse, and imaging tests are essential tools for its diagnosis. Acute cholecystitis has multiple manifestations or complications, one of which is hemorrhagic cholecystitis (HC). In the literature, this pathology has been described only in the spectrum of acute cholecystitis complications, case reports, or series with a maximum of 2 to 3 cases. After a retrospective review, we present 11 cases of hemorrhagic cholecystitis and discuss its various causes, clinical presentations, and findings on ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT), considering dual-energy CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 6 years (2012–2018) of hemorrhagic cholecystitis cases diagnosed at our hospital was performed. A search engine of medical terms was used along with the database of radiological cases in the emergency department of the hospital. After careful review by two emergency and one abdominal radiologists, 11 patients were identified as having hemorrhagic cholecystitis according to their clinical, radiological, and surgical records and confirmed with pathology reports.

- **Results**: Both lithiasis and anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy were the most common etiologies found (9 patients, 82%). The clinical presentation may be misleading, simulating a usual cholecystitis episode with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, or manifesting with signs of bile duct obstruction, hematemesis, or anemia that may compromise the patient hemodynamically and become fatal. US is useful, but CT is the most complete test for evaluation.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of pediatric cholecystitis in the ED [^115bbM5T]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of cholecystitis or biliary tract disease in children and adolescents is an uncommon occurrence in the emergency department and other acute care settings. Misdiagnosis and delays in diagnosing children with cholecystitis or biliary tract disease of up to months and years have been reported in the literature. We discuss the technique and potential utility of point-of-care ultrasound evaluation in a series of pediatric patients with suspected cholecystitis or biliary tract disease.

- **Methods**: We present a nonconsecutive case series of pediatric and adolescent patients with abdominal pain diagnosed with cholecystitis or biliary tract disease using point-of-care ultrasound. The published sonographic criteria is 3 mm or less for the upper limits of normal gallbladder wall thickness and is 3 mm or less for normal common bile duct diameter (measured from inner wall to inner wall) in children. Measurements above these limits were considered abnormal, in addition to the sonographic presence of gallstones, pericholecystic fluid, and a sonographic Murphy's sign.

- **Results**: Point-of-care ultrasound screening detected 13 female pediatric patients with cholecystitis or biliary tract disease when the authors were on duty over a 5-year period. Diagnoses were confirmed by radiology imaging or at surgery and surgical pathology.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care ultrasound to detect pediatric cholecystitis or biliary tract disease may help avoid misdiagnosis or delays in diagnosis in children with abdominal pain.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116xi3ue]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

**Role of microbiological cultures and sensitivities**: In patients with complicated acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) and those at high risk for antimicrobial resistance, adapting the targeted antibiotic regimen to the results of microbiological analysis is recommended, ensuring adequate antimicrobial coverage. Identifying the causative organism(s) is essential in managing ACC, particularly in patients at high risk for antimicrobial resistance, such as immunocompromised patients and those with healthcare-associated infections. The rate of positive bile culture, obtained from either gallbladder cultures or bile samples from the common bile duct, ranges from 29% to 54% in cases of ACC. No additional studies have been identified on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^111ZRVMp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of patients affected by acute cholecystitis and their co-morbidities makes it very difficult to standardize therapy for this common condition. The staging system suggested in the recent "Tokyo guidelines" did not show a relevant impact on the management of patients and the outcome of the disease. The relationship among the local pathological picture, patient clinical status, and treatment algorithm needs further study.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, specifically concerning laboratory tests, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding routine blood cultures in non-immunocompromised adult and pediatric patients with suspected intra-abdominal infections. This is applicable when such patients have a normal or elevated temperature without hypotension, tachypnea, or delirium, and there is no concern for antibiotic-resistant organisms that would inform the treatment regimen.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholecystitis, specifically cholecystectomy, the SICG/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in elderly patients. This recommendation is based on the procedure being safe, feasible, having a low complication rate, and being associated with a shortened hospital stay.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154hNrp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

A total of 1309 studies were identified through MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and manual searches of the reference list of the included articles. After initial screening and removal of duplicates, 60 studies were selected for full-text article review. Among them, 20 studies were excluded during the review process because they did not present relevant findings on the topic or report the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (US). Consequently, 40 studies were included for data extraction and meta-analysis. We generated a summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curve to assess the performance of US in detecting acute cholecystitis (AC). Results are visualized in Additional file 1: Fig. S1.

The risk of bias and applicability of included studies are shown in Figure 2. In the risk of bias assessment, most studies, except those involving patient selection, showed a low risk of bias across four domains. However, more than 25% of the studies were considered to have a high risk of bias due to their use of a case-control study design and non-consecutive or non-random enrollment of sample patients. Regarding applicability, most studies scored low in the reference standard and index test domains. Nonetheless, some studies were found to have a high risk of bias in terms of applicability because they exclusively focused on post-cholecystectomy patients instead of a more diverse and representative sample.

### The Choco-W prospective observational global study: Does COVID-19 increase gangrenous cholecystitis [^113bFW8V]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The study compares clinical findings and laboratory test results between COVID-19 and non-COVID patients.

- **Clinical findings**:
	- The COVID-19 group showed more generalized abdominal pain (20.1% compared to 12.4%).

- **Laboratory tests results**:
	- The mean white blood cell count and CRP levels were significantly higher in the COVID group [8156 (8266)/mm³ compared to 7501 (18,690)/mm³ and 89.44 (98.3) mg/L compared to 80.15 (102.5); p = 0.04 and 0.002, respectively].
	- The most striking significant differences were observed in total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin levels, which were almost doubled in the COVID group [9.07 (19.99) mg/dL compared to 5.38 (26.24) mg/dL and 5.38 (15.89) mg/dL compared to 2.31 (8.14); p < 0.0001 in both].

- **AST and ALT levels**:
	- Although there was statistical significance in the mean values of AST and ALT, these differences did not seem to impact clinical features and outcomes.

- **Other markers**:
	- D-dimer levels were significantly higher, and arterial lactates were significantly lower in the COVID group [858.5 (2382) nmol/L compared to 456.8 (1644); p = 0.02] and [3.52 (12.73) mmol/L compared to 16.96 (79); p = 0.03, respectively]. Additionally, APTT time was significantly longer in COVID patients [31.52 (8.94) sec compared to 26.39 (11.54); p < 0.0001].

### Acute cholecystitis [^11656bvQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Of people admitted to the hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men; thereafter, it is about 1.5 times more common in women than in men. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, and open cholecystectomy.

### Evaluation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a potential biomarker for acute cholecystitis [^1179vqs8]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) is frequently associated with an increase in white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, one or both of these inflammatory biomarkers can be normal in AC. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the discriminative powers of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with WCC and CRP in diagnosing AC.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted over more than a period of five years. A total of 1,959 patients were identified from the cholecystectomy registry. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients with histologic evidence of AC were included if they also had preoperative WCC and CRP measurements. Eligibility criteria were met by 177 patients. These patients were compared with 45 control subjects who had normal gallbladder histology.

- **Results**: One unit of increase in the NLR was associated with a 2.5 times increase in the odds of AC (odds ratio = 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.5–4.1; P < 0.0005). NLR cutoff values of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.42–4.79), 3.25 (95% CI, 1.95–4.54), and 4.17 (95% CI, 3.76–4.58) were diagnostic for the overall AC, mild, and moderate-severe AC, respectively. The NLR areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve in AC, mild, and moderate-severe AC were 94% (95% CI, 91%-97%), 87% (95% CI, 81%-93%), and 98% (95% CI, 96%-100%), respectively. The discriminative power of an NLR was superior to that of the WCC and similar to CRP for diagnosing AC and different grades of severity.

- **Conclusions**: NLR can be considered as a potential inflammatory biomarker for AC.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^1168fmwx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholecystitis, more specifically concerning cholecystectomy timing, the SICG/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend performing early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in elderly patients as soon as possible, within 10 days of the onset of symptoms. This is because earlier surgery is associated with a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111MrViD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis reported the diagnostic accuracy of serum bilirubin and serum ALP at two cut-off values for each test. Serum bilirubin at a cut-off of 22.23 μmol/L had a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Bilirubin at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit had a sensitivity of 0.42 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.63) and a specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). For ALP at a cut-off of greater than 125 IU/L, sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99) and specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). For ALP at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit, sensitivity was 0.38 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.59) and specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99).

- **Predictive imaging features for CBDS in patients with ACC**:

- **Visualization of a stone**: We suggest considering the visualization of a stone in the common bile duct at transabdominal US as a predictor of CBDS in patients with ACC. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

- **Increased diameter of the common bile duct**: An increased diameter, an indirect sign of stone presence, is not sufficient to identify ACC patients with CBDS. Therefore, we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Abdominal US is the preferred imaging technique for the diagnosis of ACC; the common bile duct can be visualized and investigated at the same time. A meta-analysis by Gurusamy et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of US: sensitivity ranged from 0.32 to 1.00 with a summary sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90), while specificity ranged from 0.77 to 0.97 with a summary specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.95).

### History, physical examination, laboratory testing, and emergency department ultrasonography for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [^1165emXK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common differential for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain. The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for AC has not been quantitatively described.

- **Objectives**: We performed a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P), laboratory studies, and ultrasonography (US) in diagnosing AC in the ED.

- **Methods**: We searched medical literature from January 1965 to March 2016 in PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS using a strategy derived from the following formulation of our clinical question: patients - ED patients suspected of AC; interventions - H&P, laboratory studies, and US findings commonly used to diagnose AC; comparator - surgical pathology or definitive diagnostic radiologic study confirming AC; and outcome - the operating characteristics of the investigations in diagnosing AC were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc with a random-effects model (95% CI). Study quality and risks for bias were assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.

- **Results**: Separate PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS searches retrieved studies for H&P (n = 734), laboratory findings (n = 74), and US (n = 492). Three H&P studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria with AC prevalence of 7%-64%. Fever had sensitivity ranging from 31% to 62% and specificity from 37% to 74%; positive LR [LR+] was 0.71–1.24, and negative LR [LR-] was 0.76–1.49. Jaundice sensitivity ranged from 11% t

### Computed tomography versus ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114oNFVh]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Some patients undergo both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) sequentially as part of the same evaluation for acute cholecystitis (AC). Our goal was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic performance of US and CT in the diagnosis of AC.

- **Materials and methods**: Databases were searched for relevant published studies through November 2023. The primary objective was to compare the head-to-head performance of US and CT using surgical intervention or clinical follow-up as the reference standard. For the secondary analysis, all individual US and CT studies were analyzed. The pooled sensitivities, specificities, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were determined along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The prevalence of imaging findings was also evaluated.

- **Results**: Sixty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. In the primary analysis of head-to-head studies (n = 5), CT had a pooled sensitivity of 83.9% (95% CI, 78.4–88.2%) versus 79.0% (95% CI, 68.8–86.6%) of US (p = 0.44). The pooled specificity of CT was 94% (95% CI, 82.0–98.0%) versus 93.6% (95% CI, 79.4–98.2%) of US (p = 0.85). The concordance of positive or negative tests between both modalities was 82.3% (95% CI, 72.1–89.4%). US and CT led to a positive change in management in only 4 to 8% of cases, respectively, when ordered sequentially after the other test.

- **Conclusion**: The diagnostic performance of CT is comparable to US for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, with a high rate of concordance between the two modalities.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^112Bus4P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

- **Elevation of liver biochemical enzymes**: Elevation of liver biochemical enzymes and/or bilirubin levels are not sufficient to identify acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) patients with choledocholithiasis, and further diagnostic tests are needed.

Liver biochemical tests have historically been essential in determining the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS). However, many published studies do not specifically involve patients with ACC and often include asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Normal liver biochemical tests have a negative predictive value of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result is only 15%. The positive predictive value of liver function studies as a tool for predicting CBDS is poor, even in non-ACC contexts, with results ranging from 25% to 50%. In ACC, liver biochemical tests may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process affecting the gallbladder and the biliary tree.

Moreover, 15% to 50% of patients with ACC show elevated liver enzymes without the presence of choledocholithiasis. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 of 1,178 patients with ACC had increased liver tests, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), at levels greater than twice the normal. Of these patients, only 246 (58%) had choledocholithiasis. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of ACC patients without choledocholithiasis had elevated ALT and AST levels, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels coupled with leukocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis. Padda et al. demonstrated that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without choledocholithiasis had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT levels.

### Test characteristics of emergency medicine-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113t6CC8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis accounts for up to 9% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain, and best practice entails early surgical management. Ultrasound is the standard modality used to confirm diagnosis. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis when compared with a reference standard of final diagnosis (informed by available surgical pathology, discharge diagnosis, and radiology-performed ultrasound).

We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO, in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched seven databases as well as gray literature in the form of select conference abstracts from inception to February 8, 2023. Two independent reviewers completed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias (QUADAS-2) assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies to create 2 × 2 tables for diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis. Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic models were constructed.

Of 1,855 titles/abstracts, 40 were selected for full-text review. Ten studies (n = 2,356) were included. Emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound with final diagnosis as the reference standard (seven studies, n = 1,772) had a pooled sensitivity of 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.3 to 78.2), specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 88.2 to 97.5).

### Derivation and validation of a practical bedside score for the diagnosis of cholecystitis [^111rXr5G]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

We sought to develop a practical bedside score for the diagnosis of cholecystitis and test its accuracy against the Tokyo Guidelines (TG13).

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of 438 patients undergoing urban, academic emergency department (ED) evaluation of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. Symptoms, physical signs, ultrasound signs, and labs were scoring system candidates. A random split-sample approach was used to develop and validate a new clinical score. Multivariable regression analysis using development data was conducted to identify predictors of cholecystitis. Cutoff values were chosen to ensure positive/negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of at least 0.95. The score was externally validated in 80 patients at a different hospital undergoing RUQ pain evaluation.

- **Results**: 230 patients (53%) had cholecystitis. Five variables predicted cholecystitis and were included in the scores: gallstones, gallbladder thickening, clinical or ultrasonographic Murphy's sign, RUQ tenderness, and post-prandial symptoms. A clinical prediction score was developed. When dichotomized at 4, overall accuracy for acute cholecystitis was 90% for the development cohort, 82% and 86% for the internal and external validation cohorts; TG13 accuracy was 62%-79%.

- **Conclusions**: A clinical prediction score for cholecystitis demonstrates accuracy equivalent to TG13. Use of this score may streamline work-up by decreasing the need for comprehensive ultrasound evaluation and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement and may shorten ED length of stay.

### The yield of fever, inflammatory markers and ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: A validation of the 2013 Tokyo Guidelines [^113S5Gvs]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Each year, 1–4% of people with known gallstones become symptomatic, either presenting with biliary colic or as acute cholecystitis. The distinction between both diagnoses remains challenging. To aid proper diagnosis, the revised 2013 Tokyo Guidelines (TG 2013) were proposed with a self-acclaimed diagnostic accuracy of over 90%. However, this accuracy has not been verified by others so far.

- **Objective**: To determine the accuracy of the TG 2013 guidelines in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis both in its single components of fever, inflammatory markers and ultrasound (US) features and in the combined application of the TG 2013 guidelines as a whole.

- **Methods**: A 5-year retrospective analysis mirroring the TG 2013 validation process of all emergency cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis or persistent biliary pain, with an ultrasound performed during the same admission. Acute cholecystitis at histology was the golden standard.

- **Results**: Inclusion criteria were met by 169 patients with a prevalence of acute cholecystitis of 52.7%. The individual features of fever, gallbladder wall thickening, and probe tenderness were not significant in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, only neutrophil count was an independent predictor. The combined application of the TG 2013 guidelines led to a better sensitivity of 83.1% at the cost of reduced specificity of 37.5% compared to neutrophil count alone. The accuracy was therefore only 60.3%, which was well below the TG 2013 report.

- **Conclusion**: The 2013 Tokyo Guidelines were slightly better in predicting acute cholecystitis.
