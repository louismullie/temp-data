## Question

Can giving vancomycin orally while taking iv antibiotics reduce the chances of c diff in some patients at risk of c diff colitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether giving oral vancomycin during intravenous antibiotics reduces the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection in patients at increased risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which patient populations we are talking about and the exact clinical question, including secondary versus primary prophylaxis. Then, I should review the highest-quality randomized evidence and whether it answers the question definitively. Next, I will examine observational data and meta-analyses to gauge effect sizes and consistency. After that, I need to weigh potential harms, especially vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization. Finally, I should align the synthesis with current guideline positions and provide a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats and alternatives like fidaxomicin or bezlotoxumab where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and population framing, because I need to ensure we are not mixing primary prevention with secondary prevention. The pivotal question is secondary prophylaxis: in patients with a recent episode of C. difficile infection who now require systemic antibiotics for another indication, does low-dose oral vancomycin reduce recurrence compared with no prophylaxis, and what is the magnitude and certainty of that benefit, along with the risks involved.

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The 2025 JAMA Network Open randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled adults with CDI in the prior 180 days who were starting non-CDI systemic antibiotics and assigned them to oral vancomycin 125 mg once daily during antibiotics plus 5 extra days versus placebo, with an 8-week follow-up for recurrence; wait, let me verify the primary outcome details and power before drawing conclusions [^notfound] [^112gEr8D]. Recurrent CDI occurred in 43.6% with vancomycin versus 57.1% with placebo, an absolute reduction of 13.5%, but the difference did not reach statistical significance because the trial was underpowered; importantly, there was a concerning increase in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage at 8 weeks in the vancomycin arm (50.0% vs 24.0% with placebo), which persisted despite a decline in the placebo group, so I should not jump to conclusions about net benefit without balancing this risk [^115JmnWX] [^112SpAW8] [^1171UKRu] [^116LFUTT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single underpowered RCT; I need to check whether observational data and meta-analyses converge on directionality and effect size. Multiple meta-analyses of observational cohorts suggest a substantial reduction in recurrent CDI with oral vancomycin prophylaxis, with pooled odds ratios around 0.24–0.34, which corresponds to a roughly 66–76% relative risk reduction, albeit with significant heterogeneity and confounding; for example, an analysis of 9,258 patients showed 13.3% recurrence with OVP versus 21.9% without, with OR 0.34, and several secondary prophylaxis cohorts report markedly lower recurrence rates with OVP compared with no prophylaxis, including a 557-patient cohort where OVP reduced recurrence by about 15% absolute, with an NNT near 7, though these are not randomized and must be interpreted cautiously [^1121XTRT] [^1159zSqs] [^111soRMv] [^116LRMjr] [^112xx4uB].

> I should double-check whether primary prevention works at all, because that would change how broadly we generalize. Meta-analyses evaluating oral vancomycin for primary prophylaxis in patients without prior CDI show no statistically significant benefit, reinforcing that the signal is strongest for secondary prophylaxis in those with a recent CDI history; a small randomized trial in high-risk inpatients suggested benefit, but the design and follow-up were limited, so I should not over-weight that signal for primary prevention decisions [^1159zSqs] [^116LRMjr] [^113jyYzM] [^111VSd1b].

> Now, I need to weigh potential harms carefully. The RCT showed increased VRE carriage at 8 weeks with OVP, which did not occur in the placebo arm, raising concern about microbiome disruption and selection pressure; but wait, what if clinical VRE infections are not increased despite colonization — does that mitigate the concern? A large VA retrospective cohort found oral vancomycin for CDI treatment was not associated with increased VRE infection at 3–6 months compared with metronidazole, suggesting colonization may not invariably translate to infection, yet colonization remains a risk marker and the long-term clinical implications are uncertain, so I should counsel patients and consider alternatives or additional mitigation when possible [^1171UKRu] [^113FEP5Y].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The American College of Gastroenterology conditionally recommends considering oral vancomycin prophylaxis during subsequent systemic antibiotics in high-risk patients with recent CDI, typically using low-dose regimens such as 125 mg once or twice daily for the duration of systemic therapy, while acknowledging very low-quality evidence; in contrast, IDSA/SHEA found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation in 2017 and did not revisit this in the 2021 focused update, and ESCMID 2021 advised against routine prophylaxis but allowed that it may be appropriate in select cases after weighing risks and benefits, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty highlighted by the underpowered RCT [^1121XTRT] [^116vWBMV] [^1171UKRu] [^112gEr8D] [^113ue2qN].

> Let me consider practical implementation and dosing, and I should confirm the regimen used in the RCT. The trial used 125 mg orally once daily during systemic antibiotics plus 5 additional days, chosen to minimize dysbiosis; ACG suggests 125 mg once or twice daily for the duration of systemic antibiotics in high-risk patients, and some clinicians extend prophylaxis a few days beyond the systemic course, though evidence for the exact duration beyond antibiotics is limited and should be individualized based on risk tolerance and prior recurrence history [^112SpAW8] [^1121XTRT].

> But wait, what if we want to reduce recurrence without adding more antibiotics; I should review validated alternatives. Fidaxomicin is preferred over vancomycin for initial CDI and for first recurrence due to lower recurrence rates, and bezlotoxumab added to standard therapy reduces recurrence by about 40% in high-risk patients; in patients who require frequent systemic antibiotics and have multiple recurrences, long-term suppressive or pulsed vancomycin strategies can be considered, and in selected refractory cases, fecal microbiota transplantation is effective, though these are treatment paradigms rather than prophylaxis per se and should be integrated into a comprehensive prevention plan [^116KhSZu] [^116yPY66] [^115wPjjJ] [^112SpAW8] [^112SpAW8] [^112DVzts].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line and communicate uncertainty clearly. The best available randomized evidence did not prove a statistically significant benefit for oral vancomycin prophylaxis in recent CDI patients exposed to systemic antibiotics, but it showed a clinically meaningful absolute reduction in recurrence of about 13.5% and was underpowered; convergent observational meta-analyses consistently suggest substantial benefit for secondary prophylaxis, while primary prevention remains unproven, and the main safety signal is increased VRE colonization without definitive proof of increased VRE infection in treatment cohorts, so the balance likely favors selective use in high-risk patients after shared decision-making that weighs recurrence risk, antibiotic necessity, and microbiome trade-offs [^112SpAW8] [^1121XTRT] [^1159zSqs] [^1171UKRu].

> Final clinical recommendation, with self-checks for alignment with guidelines and evidence: Yes, in carefully selected high-risk patients with a recent CDI who must receive systemic antibiotics, low-dose oral vancomycin prophylaxis can be considered to reduce the likelihood of recurrence, ideally 125 mg once daily during the systemic antibiotic course with an additional 5 days, recognizing that the evidence quality is low-to-moderate and that a large definitive RCT is still needed; I should document the off-label rationale, discuss the uncertain benefit and the VRE colonization risk, and consider alternatives such as fidaxomicin-based treatment for recurrences and bezlotoxumab in high-risk patients when feasible, while prioritizing antibiotic stewardship and minimizing high-risk systemic agents whenever possible [^1121XTRT] [^116vWBMV] [^112SpAW8] [^116yPY66] [^115wPjjJ] [^114jgARP].

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis during systemic antibiotic therapy **reduces recurrence** of C. difficile infection (CDI) in patients with a prior episode, with a **number needed to treat of 7–8** [^1121XTRT] [^112xx4uB]. It is **not recommended for primary prevention** in patients without prior CDI, as evidence is insufficient and guidelines do not support routine use [^1159zSqs] [^112gEr8D]. The main concern is increased vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization, so prophylaxis should be reserved for high-risk patients with recent CDI who require systemic antibiotics, using 125 mg once or twice daily during and for 5 days after the antibiotic course [^1121XTRT] [^112NrjTW].

---

## Evidence supporting oral vancomycin prophylaxis

### Secondary prevention (patients with prior CDI)

- **ACG guidelines**: Oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) may be considered for high-risk patients with recent CDI who require systemic antibiotics, using low-dose regimens (125 mg once or twice daily) for the duration of antibiotics plus 5 days [^1121XTRT] [^112gEr8D].

- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses show OVP significantly reduces recurrent CDI (OR ~0.34; NNT ~7–8) in patients with prior CDI who receive systemic antibiotics [^112xx4uB] [^111soRMv] [^1159zSqs].

- **RCT data**: A 2025 RCT in patients with recent CDI found a 13.5% absolute reduction in recurrence with OVP (43.6% vs 57.1%), though not statistically significant due to underpowering; the trend supports benefit [^112SpAW8] [^1156ahKu].

---

### Primary prevention (patients without prior CDI)

Evidence is **limited and inconsistent**; meta-analyses show no significant reduction in primary CDI with OVP (OR ~0.18; 95% CI 0.03–1.03) [^113jyYzM] [^1159zSqs]. Accordingly, **guidelines do not recommend** routine OVP for primary prevention; IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID cite insufficient evidence [^112gEr8D] [^114aPRHQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding ovp** |
|-|-|
| ACG (2021) | - Conditional recommendation for OVP in high-risk patients with recent CDI requiring systemic antibiotics <br/> - Use low-dose regimens (125 mg once or twice daily) for the duration of antibiotics plus 5 days [^1121XTRT] [^112NrjTW] |
| IDSA/SHEA (2021) | Insufficient evidence to recommend OVP; no formal recommendation [^112gEr8D] |
| ESCMID (2021) | - Does not recommend routine OVP <br/> - May be considered in select high-risk patients with careful risk–benefit assessment [^112gEr8D] |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **VRE colonization**: OVP is associated with increased VRE carriage (50.0% vs 24.0% in RCT), though clinical VRE infections were not significantly increased in observational data [^112SpAW8] [^113FEP5Y].

- **Microbiome disruption**: Vancomycin can alter gut microbiota, potentially increasing susceptibility to other pathogens, but long-term clinical consequences are uncertain [^111jxSHo] [^116JKu1w].

- **Cost and resistance**: Routine use may increase costs and resistance pressure; reserve for high-risk patients [^1121XTRT].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from oral vancomycin prophylaxis

High-risk patients with **recent CDI** who require systemic antibiotics benefit most from OVP, including older adults, immunocompromised patients, and those with multiple comorbidities [^1121XTRT] [^112NrjTW]. In contrast, **low-risk patients without prior CDI** should not receive routine OVP given insufficient evidence and potential harms [^112SpAW8] [^113jyYzM].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Recurrence is significantly reduced with OVP in patients with prior CDI, with an **NNT of 7–8** [^1121XTRT] [^111soRMv]. Clinical cure is unaffected, as OVP does not significantly change initial cure rates; its role is in preventing recurrence [^1121XTRT]. Mortality data are limited, with no clear mortality benefit identified to date [^notfound].

---

## Practical considerations and dosing strategies

Dosing of **125 mg once or twice daily** during systemic antibiotics and continued for 5 days after the antibiotic course is recommended [^1121XTRT] [^112gEr8D]. Monitoring should include vigilance for VRE colonization and recurrence after OVP ends [^112SpAW8] [^1171UKRu].

---

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis is effective for **secondary prevention** of CDI recurrence in high-risk patients with recent CDI who require systemic antibiotics, but is not recommended for primary prevention. Use should be individualized, balancing benefits against VRE colonization and microbiome effects, and aligned with guideline-supported dosing strategies [^1121XTRT] [^1159zSqs].

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of health care–associated diarrhea. Over one-third of patients who develop CDI will develop 1 or more recurrences; recurrence risk increases with each episode. The main risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use. Following therapy and resolution of initial CDI, recurrent CDI may be triggered when antibiotics are given for other indications. Prevention is essential to reduce the myriad medical, social, and psychological consequences of recurrent CDI. Interventions to prevent recurrent CDI during exposure to systemic antibiotics in a person with prior but not current CDI are needed in clinical practice.

Oral vancomycin for prophylaxis against recurrent CDI has been used in clinical practice based on retrospective cohort studies showing possible favorable outcomes. However, their observational designs precluded assessing efficacy because of confounding, heterogeneity in data availability, inclusion criteria, study populations, and uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effect. In a prospective trial in asymptomatic patients colonized with C difficile, oral vancomycin was effective in eliminating fecal C difficile during and immediately after treatment, but most participants began to shed C difficile again within approximately 3 weeks of completing oral vancomycin treatment.

Whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis is effective against recurrent CDI remains unanswered. Furthermore, most studies have looked primarily at benefits of treatment without evaluating potential risks. This is a critical gap in the field, as oral vancomycin is not without risk (particularly, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE] gut proliferation).,

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of oral vancomycin prophylaxis on recurrent CDI incidence and VRE carriage of the gut in patients with a recent CDI who were taking systemic antibiotics for a non-CDI indication. This study aimed to evaluate whether a low dose of oral vancomycin administered during and immediately following non–CDI-indicated antibiotic treatment was effective in preventing recurrent CDI.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^112gEr8D]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In the absence of clear evidence, use of oral vancomycin prophylaxis has remained an unresolved issue among leading health organizations. Oral vancomycin prophylaxis during non–CDI-indicated systemic antibiotic therapy has been conditionally recommended for patients at high risk of CDI recurrence by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), which notes that this recommendation is supported by low-quality evidence and that there is a need for prospective clinical trials. The Infectious Diseases Society of America found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation in its 2017 clinical practice guidelines and did not address the question in its 2021 update. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 2021 update did not recommend routine prophylaxis during antibiotic treatment but suggested prophylaxis may be appropriate in select patients with recurrent CDI after antibiotic use and with careful consideration of risks and benefits.

Our clinical trial used the ACG dosage and treatment duration for prophylactic oral vancomycin (125 mg of oral vancomycin once per day for the duration of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy plus 5 days after the course of antibiotics was completed). Previous studies have evaluated different dosages and durations of oral vancomycin treatment. We selected a low dosage to reduce the risk of gut dysbiosis. A meta-analysis of oral vancomycin prophylaxis in a variety of patient populations found recurrent CDI to be less likely in patients taking oral vancomycin. In addition, recent meta-analyses found the lower dosage and longer duration that we used in our study to be associated with protective effects against CDI. However, nearly all prior studies on this topic have been retrospective. A strength of our study was its design as a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial, allowing for prospective analyses of the effectiveness of oral vancomycin in reducing recurrent CDI outcomes compared with placebo. Because our study was underpowered, we were not able to confirm these previous findings; we did not find a significant reduction in recurrent CDI in patients prospectively assigned to use of oral vancomycin compared with those receiving placebo.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Mr3ag]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

All procedures used in this meta-analysis were consistent with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and MOOSE (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) criteria for observational studies.

Selection criteria

The studies considered in this meta-analysis were case-control and cohort studies that evaluated patients on systemic antimicrobial therapy who did or did not receive OVP and that measured the incidence of subsequent primary or future CDI. We excluded studies that assessed patients with active CDI. Primary prevention was defined as patients with no prior history of CDI receiving OVP and secondary prevention was defined as patients with prior history of CDI receiving OVP for prophylaxis of a future episode of CDI. We used the term future CDI instead of recurrent CDI as definitions and time for future CDI recurrence were variable and there was no distinction between recurrence (subsequent infection within 8 weeks) and reinfection (subsequent infection beyond 8 weeks) in the available studies. We excluded studies that did not evaluate CDI as an outcome or if there were insufficient data to determine an estimate of an OR and 95% CI. Studies with both published full text or studies available as abstracts were included.

Data sources and search strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search of Ovid MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus from 1 January 2000 to 31 January 2020. The search strategy was designed and conducted by study investigators (SK and RT) and the Mayo Clinic library staff, independently. The search was limited to studies in the English language. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of vancomycin use and CDI. Main keywords used in the search were the following: Clostridium difficile, C diff, C difficile, Clostridium difficile infection, Clostridioides difficile, CDI, Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea or CDAD, or pseudomembranous colitis AND vancomycin OR prophylaxis OR prevention OR pre-exposure prophylaxis AND outcomes or infection. A detailed search strategy is included as an Appendix.

### Oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis of Clostridium difficile infection [^116JKu1w]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize and critically appraise the evidence regarding oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) to prevent recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (RCDIs), identify potential consequences of this emerging practice, and highlight future directions of study.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search of English-language publications from 1947 through September 2018 was performed using the search terms vancomycin and C difficile and prophylaxis. Clinical trials were identified on the National Library of Medicine clinical trials registry.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical studies (n = 3) assessing oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis of C difficile infection (CDI) were evaluated by all authors. Other search results and references in selected publications were used for background and discussion.

Data Synthesis

OVP reduced the risk of RCDI in high-risk patients taking systemic antibiotics. Variable dosing regimens and lack of safety data are limitations. OVP may have an adverse impact on the gastrointestinal microbiome, but this was not examined in the clinical studies. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Although current studies are limited by methodological concerns, clinicians can consider vancomycin 125 mg orally once or twice daily in high-risk patients receiving broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Results of ongoing trials will define the most appropriate regimen and its impact on outcomes, including collateral damage.

Conclusions

OVP reduces the risk of RCDIs and should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Caution is warranted before routine use is implemented because the impact on long-term outcomes has not been assessed and the optimal regimen has not been defined.

Severe CDI — vancomycin dosing evidence and guidance: A small RCT of 46 hospitalized patients with C. difficile colitis found no difference in cure rates, time to response, or recurrence rates between 125 and 500 mg vancomycin given 4 times daily for 10 days, and a single-center experience on patients with severe CDI (n = 78) found no difference in cure rate (60% vs 64%) at day 10, time to cure, complications, or mortality rates on low-dose (< 500 mg daily) vs high-dose (> 500 mg daily) oral vancomycin; although there was a trend toward decreased rate of recurrence (12% vs 2%; P = 0.09) in the high-dose group. Although fecal concentrations of vancomycin inversely correlate with stool frequency, only 125 mg 4 times daily dosing in patients with severe CDI consistently achieved stool drug levels ≥ 1,000-fold higher than the minimum in vitro inhibitory concentration needed against C. difficile (1.2 µg/L), and higher doses of vancomycin are unlikely to be more beneficial; thus, we do not recommend their routine use; if a patient is not responding to standard dosing, we suggest assessing for alternative causes of diarrhea.

### Critical care management of the patient with Clostridioides difficile [^117HhFmH]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review published clinical evidence on management of Clostridioides difficile infection in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

We obtained relevant studies from a PubMed literature review and bibliographies of reviewed articles.

Study Selection

We selected English-language studies addressing aspects of C. difficile infection relevant to critical care clinicians including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a focus on high-quality clinical evidence.

Data Extraction

We reviewed potentially relevant studies and abstracted information on study design, methods, patient selection, and results of relevant studies. This is a synthetic (i.e., not systematic) review.

Data Synthesis

C. difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. Antibiotics are the most significant C. difficile infection risk factor, and among antibiotics, cephalosporins, clindamycin, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam confer the highest risk. Age, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and end-stage renal disease are risk factors for C. difficile infection development and mortality. C. difficile infection diagnosis is based on testing appropriately selected patients with diarrhea or on clinical suspicion for patients with ileus. Patients with fulminant disease (C. difficile infection with hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon) should be treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole, as well as rectal vancomycin in case of ileus. Patients who do not respond to initial therapy should be considered for fecal microbiota transplant or surgery. Proper infection prevention practices decrease C. difficile infection risk.

Conclusions

Strong clinical evidence supports limiting antibiotics when possible to decrease C. difficile infection risk. For patients with fulminant C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin reduces mortality, and adjunctive therapies (including IV metronidazole) and interventions (including fecal microbiota transplant) may benefit select patients. Several important questions remain regarding fulminant C. difficile infection management, including which patients benefit from fecal microbiota transplant or surgery.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^117KMVBc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, patients who had CDI in the previous 180 days who took 125 mg of prophylactic oral vancomycin during and for 5 days after a course of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy had lower rates of recurrent CDI than patients taking a placebo; however, this study was underpowered to find a statistically significant difference. There were high rates of recurrent CDI in both the treatment (43.6%) and the placebo (57.1%) groups. However, the study population was at particularly high risk for recurrent CDI given that all participants had a recent CDI and used systemic antibiotics. The median age of participants was 59 years, and older age is also a risk factor for recurrent CDI.

Previous prospective randomized clinical trials have had mixed findings on the effectiveness of oral vancomycin prophylaxis. A trial in asymptomatic patients with C difficile colonization found that oral vancomycin was temporarily effective in reducing C difficile shedding during and immediately after treatment, but most patients receiving oral vancomycin returned to shedding C difficile within approximately 3 weeks of completing treatment. Another randomized trial of oral vancomycin to prevent initial CDI in high-risk patients receiving systemic antibiotics found a significant reduction in health care facility–onset CDI in patients receiving oral vancomycin prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis. However, the follow-up period was limited. We had a longer follow-up period of 8 weeks to measure recurrent CDI incidence after completion of treatment.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^115FJzgA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection — oral vancomycin dosing and response: A higher dose of oral vancomycin at 500 mg every 6 hours is recommended by multiple society guidelines, although direct comparison of low-dose (< 500 mg/d) and high-dose (> 500 mg/d) regimens found no significant differences and even profuse diarrhea achieved levels on 125 mg 4 times a day. The authors state it is reasonable to treat with the higher dose for the first 48–72 hours, then, if there is clinical improvement, the dose should be decreased to 125 mg every 6 hours and continued for an additional 10 days; if no response is seen after 48–72 hours on high-dose vancomycin, therapy should be reevaluated and an alternative approach considered.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^116chHt6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in patients receiving systemic antibiotics is supported by meta-analyses and small trials showing lower recurrence with OVP, including secondary prophylaxis studies reporting no rCDI in one trial and 5% vs 35% (P = 0.016) in another. A meta-analysis of 9 studies found recurrence less likely with OVP (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13–0.48; I² = 61%), and an observational meta-analysis of 9,258 patients found 13.3% (95/713) with OVP vs 21.9% (1,875/8,545) without OVP, with decreased risk (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.59; P < 0.00001). Considering these data, OVP may be considered in high-risk patients who have been recently treated for CDI and require subsequent treatment with systemic antibiotics; this high-risk group includes patients aged 65 years or older or with significant immunocompromise who were hospitalized for severe CDI within the past 3 months, and when using OVP, we would recommend using low-dose vancomycin, once or twice daily, for the duration of systemic antibiotics.

### Clostridium difficile and inflammatory bowel disease [^114hA1Hp]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile colitis has doubled in North America over the past 5 years and recent reports have demonstrated an increase in incidence and severity of these infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Studies from single institutions as well as trends identified in nationwide inpatient databases have shown that IBD patients with concomitant C. difficile infection experience increased morbidity and mortality. Results from our center have shown that over half of C. difficile-infected IBD patients will require hospitalization and the colectomy rate may approach 20%. Because C. difficile colitis will both mimic and precipitate an IBD flare, it is essential that clinicians be vigilant to identify and address this infectious complication, as empiric treatment with corticosteroids without appropriate antibiotics may precipitate deterioration. The majority of IBD patients appear to contract C. difficile as outpatients, and a prior history of colitis appears to be the most significant risk factor for acquiring this infection. In addition to C. difficile colitis, IBD patients are now known to be at risk for C. difficile enteritis as well as infections in reconstructed ileoanal pouches. An additional challenge facing C. difficile infections in IBD patients is the decreased efficacy of metronidazole, and the need for oral vancomycin in patients requiring hospitalization. In this review we summarize the present knowledge regarding C. difficile infection in the setting of IBD, including unique clinical scenarios facing IBD patients, diagnostic algorithms, and treatment approaches.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^112SpAW8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Systemic antibiotic use for patients with a non-Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major risk factor for recurrent CDI. Increasing use of oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis against recurrent CDI in this context has uncertain efficacy.

Objective

To evaluate whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis compared with placebo is effective against recurrent CDI during and 8 weeks after the end of study treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 4 large health systems across the upper Midwest US. Adults who had completed treatment for CDI within the past 180 days and were taking a systemic antibiotic for a non-CDI indication were enrolled between May 21, 2018, and March 30, 2023, and followed up for 8 weeks after the end of study treatment.

Intervention

Participants were randomized 1:1 to 125 mg of oral vancomycin or placebo once daily during antibiotic use for a non-CDI plus 5 days following cessation of those antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was recurrent CDI incidence during treatment and the 8-week follow-up period. The secondary outcome was vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage in stool.

Results

Among 81 randomized participants (median age, 59 years [IQR, 50–67 years]), all were included in the primary as-randomized analysis (39 in the vancomycin group; 42 in the placebo group). Sixty patients (74.1%) completed 8-week follow-up and were included in the secondary as-completed treatment analysis (31 in the vancomycin group; 29 in the placebo group). Recurrent CDI occurred in 17 of 39 participants in the oral vancomycin group (43.6%) and 24 of 42 in the placebo group (57.1%; absolute difference in percentage, -13.5% [95% CI, -35.1% to 8.0%]). Adverse events occurred in 27 of 39 participants in the oral vancomycin group (69.2%) and 27 of 42 in the placebo group (64.3%). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage was found in 15 of 30 patients in the oral vancomycin group (50.0%) and 6 of 25 in the placebo group (24.0%) (P = 0.048) 8 weeks after treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, the incidence of recurrent CDI was lower (though did not reach significance) in participants taking oral vancomycin compared with those taking placebo. Because the study was underpowered, it was unable to reveal firm conclusions about the efficacy (or lack thereof) of vancomycin prophylaxis with respect to recurrent CDI.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03462459.

### Does addition of intravenous metronidazole to oral vancomycin improve outcomes in Clostridioides difficile infection? [^114agLJN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend adding intravenous (IV) metronidazole to oral vancomycin for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). In this study, we compared dual therapy with IV metronidazole and vancomycin vs vancomycin monotherapy. We assessed prevalence of use and effectiveness of dual therapy in nonfulminant and fulminant CDI.

Methods

This was a 2-center retrospective study conducted from 2010 to 2018. Adult inpatients were included if they had a positive C. difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on an unformed stool and received vancomycin within 2 days of testing. Patients were classified as having received dual therapy if IV metronidazole was given within the same time window, and otherwise classified as vancomycin monotherapy. The primary outcome was death or colectomy within 90 days after the index test. Logistic regression modeling was used to adjust for CDI severity and other established predictors of CDI outcomes. CDI recurrence was examined as a secondary outcome, adjusting for death as a competing risk.

Results

The study included 2114 patients (dual therapy, 993; monotherapy, 1121); 23% met the primary outcome. There was no association between dual therapy and the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval, .79–1.45), which remained true when the analysis was restricted to patients with fulminant CDI (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, .65–2.10). There was also no association between dual therapy and CDI recurrence.

Conclusions

Dual therapy with IV metronidazole and vancomycin was common for nonfulminant and fulminant CDI but was not associated with improved outcomes compared with vancomycin alone.

### Common questions about Clostridium difficile infection [^111p1LEb]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It causes no symptoms in more than one-half of infected patients, but can also cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and death. The incidence and severity have increased in recent years. The most important modifiable risk factor for C. difficile infection is antibiotic exposure; this risk is dose-related and higher with longer courses and combination therapy. C. difficile infection is also associated with older age, recent hospitalization, multiple comorbidities, use of gastric acid blockers, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunosuppression. It has become more common in younger, healthier patients in community settings. The most practical testing options are rapid testing with nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin, or a two-step strategy. Treatment includes discontinuing the contributing antibiotic, if possible. Mild C. difficile infection should be treated with oral metronidazole; severe infection should be treated with oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin may be an effective alternative. Recurrences of the infection should be treated based on severity. Tapering and the pulsed-dose method of oral vancomycin therapy for second recurrences are effective. Prevention includes responsible antibiotic prescribing and vigilant handwashing. Probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but are not recommended specifically for preventing C. difficile infection.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — initial and severe/fulminant CDI treatment recommend for an initial nonsevere episode that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) or that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), while oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 d may be considered in low-risk patients. As initial therapy for severe CDI, we recommend vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day for 10 d (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and we recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with fulminant CDI should receive medical therapy that includes adequate volume resuscitation and treatment with 500 mg of oral vancomycin every 6 hr (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for the first 48–72 hr, and combination therapy with parenteral metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hr can be considered (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an ileus, the addition of vancomycin enemas (500 mg every 6 hr) may be beneficial (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality and is implicated in recent epidemics. Data support the treatment of colitis with oral metronidazole in a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 g/d, with oral vancomycin as a second-line agent, not because its efficacy is questioned but because of environmental concerns. Nitazoxanide and other drugs are currently under intense study as alternatives. Treatment of asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Current management strategies appear to be increasingly ineffective, especially for patients who experience multiple recurrences. Biotherapy and vaccination are currently being explored as treatment options for patients who have recurrent disease. Greater attention should be paid to hospital infection control policies and restriction of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Oral vancomycin prophylaxis for the prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111soRMv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recently, oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) has been suggested for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of this approach.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We conducted a computerized search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from inception to March 2019 for publications investigating OVP for CDI prevention. Results were screened for eligibility. Relevant data were extracted and analyzed. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test.

Results

Ultimately, 8 retrospective studies and 1 prospective study examining 2174 patients, published between 2016 and 2019 were included in the review. OVP was associated with decreased CDI (odds ratio, 0.263; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.52) with considerable heterogeneity (I² = 61%). Meta-regression showed that total daily dose of OVP correlated with CDI, explaining 100% of heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, 3 studies evaluated the risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection after OVP and found no significant increase.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that OVP might decrease CDI rates in at-risk populations, although this conclusion should be interpreted with caution. Higher daily doses of OVP might increase CDI. Although the use of OVP in high-risk patients may reduce CDI, this suggestion has yet to be validated by prospective blinded randomized controlled trials.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^116LFUTT]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial, among patients with a recent CDI and taking a subsequent non–CDI-indicated antibiotic course, patients taking oral vancomycin had reduced rates of recurrent CDI compared with patients taking a placebo. However, our study was underpowered to identify a statistically significant difference. There was a marginal but significant difference in VRE carriage in stool samples at 8 weeks after treatment between patients taking oral vancomycin and patients taking a placebo; however, participants taking placebo had a decrease in VRE carriage after completing treatment that was not observed in participants taking oral vancomycin. While this study was underpowered due to enrollment challenges, these findings suggest that other interventions should be investigated for their effectiveness in preventing CDI recurrence after non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy.

### Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^117KAtei]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Current treatment recommendations for CDI rely mainly on the severity of disease and clinical presentations like fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis and signs for end-organ failure.

The mainstay of CDI therapy is now considered oral vancomycin whereas metronidazole is reserved for mild disease and intolerance towards vancomycin; furthermore, vancomycin is always recommended in cases with severe disease. Metronidazole IV should be added in severe to fulminant disease. Furthermore, early surgical consultation is recommended in patients who do not respond to conventional therapy within 3 days. Specific recommendations on CDI therapy for critically ill patients are lacking.

Our study objective was the characterization of critically ill patients with CDI and identification of risk factors for unfortunate outcomes as well as analysis of the best antibiotic treatment.

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^111jxSHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Vancomycin

Oral vancomycin has remained a highly effective treatment agent for CDI and is the preferred comparison antibiotic for treatment trials of new therapeutic agents. The agent is not absorbed, and the concentrations of vancomycin in milligrams per gram of feces that are achieved vastly exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for C. difficile by multiple folds. Although vancomycin is highly effective for initial cure, a recurrence rate of 20% has been demonstrated repeatedly. Perhaps for this reason, clinicians are often tempted to increase the dose of vancomycin or extend the length of treatment for the subsequent episode. Neither of these strategies has been tested, and with data showing high fecal concentrations of vancomycin achieved by the 125 mg dose, there is little justification for this approach. Vancomycin treatment delays recovery of the indigenous fecal microbiota, and germination of residual spores after cessation of treatment likely contributes to symptomatic CDI recurrences. A more practical approach to managing multiple recurrences is to taper (eg, decrease frequency to twice daily, then once daily), then pulse (every other day to every third day) the vancomycin therapy after a 10- to 14-day regimen of 125 mg 4 times daily when the patient's symptoms have resolved or significantly improved. Other limitations of this treatment include cost (which can be offset by using the intravenous formulation given orally in place of vancomycin capsules) and also the potential for promoting overgrowth or colonization of other clinically important pathogens that reside in the intestine (eg, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species). An ideal agent for treatment of CDI theoretically would not be the same agent used for the systemic treatment of other pathogens and would not engender resistance to those pathogens.

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis with concurrent systemic antibiotics — retrospective cohorts: Three single-center cohorts evaluated OVP. The largest studied 557 patients receiving non-CDI antibiotics within 30 days of a CDI episode, of whom 227 received OVP with a mean duration of 7 days; in those with recurrent CDI history, 49 of 90 (54.5%) in the OVP group versus 57 of 82 (69.5%) without OVP developed CDI within 90 days, yielding a number needed to treat of 7 to prevent 1 CDI (P < 0.0001). Another 71-patient study showed 4% vs 27% recurrence (P < 0.001). A third cohort showed reduced risk when CDI itself was a recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio 0.47; 95% CI 0.32–0.69, P < 0.0001), whereas a toxin-positive relapse analysis found 9.8% (19 of 193) vs 9.3% (53 of 567) with adjusted OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.35–1.14, and relapses at 90 days were less frequent in exposed patients with only 1 previous episode (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.1–0.93).

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^111K13A1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study emphasizes the need for nuanced CDI prevention strategies that address distinct risks in carriers and noncarriers of C difficile. While antibiotic stewardship is crucial for reducing CDI in general, additional approaches are needed for carriers to mitigate their substantially high baseline risk. Further research should explore modifiable factors beyond antibiotic use to improve outcomes in patients with CDI and to reduce the overall burden of CDI in health care settings. Shortened duration of antibiotic therapy and restriction of BLBLIs may reduce CDI among hospitalized patients.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^112EUNur]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

Eight weeks after completing treatment, 17 of 39 patients in the oral vancomycin group (43.6%) and 24 of 42 in the placebo group (57.1%) experienced a CDI recurrence (absolute difference in percentage, −13.5%; 95% CI, −35.1% to 8.0%; p = 0.22) (Table 2). There was no statistically significant difference in nonrecurrence probability over time (from start of oral vancomycin or placebo treatment) between treatment groups (Figure 2 A). We also did not find a difference in the distribution of the number of days to first recurrence of CDI between treatment groups (Figure 2 B and C). Similar results were observed in the as–completed treatment analysis (eAppendixes 1 and 2, eTable 1, and eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). There was a slight difference between curves when comparing CDI recurrence between study sites (eAppendix 2, eTable 2, and eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). There was no difference in recurrent CDI outcomes when evaluating subgroups at particularly high risk of recurrent CDI (use of high-risk antibiotics, having an immunocompromised condition, or age ≥ 65 years) (eAppendixes 3–5, eTables 3–5, and eFigures 3–5 in Supplement 2).

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with CDI — antibiotic selection and duration: We suggest vancomycin 125 mg p.o. 4 times a day for a minimum of 14 days in patients with IBD and CDI (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). There are no published RCTs comparing treatments for CDI in adults with IBD. In a retrospective, single-center study, a vancomycin-containing regimen vs metronidazole reduced 30-day readmissions (9% vs 31.0%, P = 0.04) and length of stay (6.38 days vs 13.62 days, P = 0.022). Longer vancomycin duration 21–42 days vs < 21 days reduced CDI recurrence from 11.7% to 1.8% (OR 0.13, P = 0.043). In a retrospective cohort of 503 IBD patients, recurrent CDI was 33% vs 24% in the general population (P < 0.01).

### Clostridium difficile infection: epidemiology, risk factors and management [^1175wkCY]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

The epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has changed over the past decade. There has been a dramatic worldwide increase in its incidence, and new CDI populations are emerging, such as those with community-acquired infection and no previous exposure to antibiotics, children, pregnant women and patients with IBD. Diagnosis of CDI requires identification of C. difficile toxin A or B in diarrheal stool. The accuracy of current diagnostic tests remains inadequate and the optimal diagnostic testing algorithm has not been defined. The first-line agents for CDI treatment are metronidazole and vancomycin, with the latter being the preferred agent in patients with severe disease as it has significantly superior efficacy. The incidence of metronidazole treatment failures has increased, emphasizing the need to find alternative treatment options. Disease recurrence continues to occur in 20–40% of patients and its treatment remains challenging. In patients with CDI who develop fulminant colitis, early surgical consultation is essential. Intravenous immunoglobulin and tigecycline have been used in patients with severe refractory disease but delaying surgery may be associated with worse outcomes. Infection control measures are key to prevent horizontal transmission of infection. Ongoing research into effective treatment protocols and prevention is essential.

### An open-label, randomized trial comparing fidaxomicin with oral vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving concomitant antibiotics for concurrent infections [^112GCEg7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) occurs frequently, and concomitant antibiotic (CA) during the initial episode for treatment of non-CDI is a major risk factor. We sought to address the comparative efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in the setting of CA during the initial CDI episode.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial at 2 hospitals in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We consecutively consented and enrolled hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years old with diarrhea, a positive test for C. difficile, and ≥ 1 qualifying CA. Complicated CDI, CDI treatment for > 24 hours prior to enrollment, and planned long-term (> 12 weeks) CA use were notable exclusions. Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea for 2 consecutive days maintained until 2 days after therapy, and rCDI as recurrent diarrhea with positive testing ≤ 30 days after initial treatment. Patients were randomized to fidaxomicin or vancomycin.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups of 144 patients. Rates of clinical cure (73% vs 62.9%, P = 0.195) and rCDI (3.3% vs 4.0%; P > .99) were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol cohorts, respectively. Only 4 patients developed rCDI.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with CDI receiving CA, a numerically higher proportion were cured with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, but this result did not reach statistical significance. Overall recurrence was lower than anticipated in both arms compared with previous studies that did not extend duration of CDI treatment during CA.

Severe CDI — fidaxomicin comparative outcomes: In patients with severe disease, fidaxomicin was noninferior to vancomycin in achieving clinical cure at the end of therapy and associated with decreased risk of recurrence in a phase 3 clinical trial, and trials of fidaxomicin have excluded patients with fulminant CDI and life-threatening illness so evidence to support its use in these populations is limited. In critically ill patients, although only 36 patients in this series had a diagnosis of severe or fulminant CDI, one-third of them experienced treatment failure, and a more recent retrospective chart review that compared 213 fidaxomicin and 639 oral vancomycin courses showed no statistically significant difference for the primary outcome of combined clinical failure or recurrence (68/213 [31.9%] vs 169/639 [25.5%], respectively, P = 0.071).

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — secondary prophylaxis during subsequent systemic antibiotics: Two retrospective cohort studies compared patients empirically treated with vancomycin during subsequent antibiotic exposure versus those not treated, including cohorts who received antibiotics within 90 days of the prior episode and those rehospitalized (1–22 months later), and both studies showed a decreased risk of subsequent CDI for some patients; there are no prospective, randomized studies to guide recommendations, but if CDI prevention agents are instituted it may be prudent to administer lower doses of vancomycin or fidaxomicin (eg, 125 mg or 200 mg, respectively, once daily) while systemic antibiotics are administered.

OVP for primary prophylaxis

Five observational studies comprising a total of 1352 patients evaluated OVP for hospitalized patients with no prior CDI episode who were on systemic antibiotics (primary prevention). The rate of CDI in patients on OVP was 7.2% (29/402) compared with 10.4% (99/950) without OVP. Meta-analysis revealed a non-significant trend towards decrease in risk of CDI in patients who received OVP to prevent primary CDI (OR 0.18; 95% CI, 0.03–1.09; p = 0.06). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies, with an I² of 76% (Figure 2).

Nonsevere Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode management includes the following and supporting evidence: "We recommend that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days be used to treat an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence)". "We recommend that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". "Oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days may be considered for treatment of an initial nonsevere CDI in low-risk patients (strong recommendation/moderate quality of evidence)". In comparative trials, fidaxomicin showed similar clinical cure but lower recurrence than vancomycin: "cure rates with fidaxomicin (82.1%) were similar to vancomycin (88.6%). The rate of recurrence within 30 days, however, was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (13.0% vs 26.6%, P = 0.02)", and a second RCT found "no significant difference in clinical cure (76.2% vs 70.5%, P = 0.473), but lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin (8.3% vs 32.6%, P < 0.05)". A Veteran Administration analysis found "no statistically significant difference in the combined outcome of clinical failure or recurrence between 213 fidaxomicin treatment courses (31.9%) and 639 vancomycin treatment courses (25.5%)", with mortality "30-day (10.8% vs 11.7%), 90-day (22.5% vs 21.9%), and 180-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 29.1%)" similar. A Cochrane review concluded that "moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin", while noting "The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost". For follow-on therapy, rifaximin trials used "400 mg t.i.d. for 20 days" with recurrence "decreased from 31% to 15%", and another trial used "400 mg t.i.d. for 14 days and then 200 mg t.i.d. for an additional 14 days" with recurrence "from 30% to 16% (P = 0.06)", but concerns include "30%–50% resistance rates", and the authors "do not currently recommend its routine use".

### Treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^115RTZ2T]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature related to the treatment and infection control of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-August 2001) of the English literature was conducted.

Data Synthesis

C. difficile is a leading cause of antibiotic-related diarrhea. The clinical spectrum extends from simple diarrhea to fulminant colitis. Cessation of antibiotic therapy alone is sufficient for mild cases; however, the majority of cases require oral metronidazole as the drug of choice. Vancomycin orally is reserved for patients who have failed to respond to metronidazole, are pregnant, or are severely ill. There is an important role for infection control interventions.

Conclusions

CDAD is a common infection. Appropriate antibiotic treatment and infection control policies can prevent the spread and reduce the morbidity associated with this disease.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe and fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is indicated and operationalized as follows: We suggest FMT be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy; in particular, when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Reported single-FMT cure in case reports ranges from 66%–91%. A pseudomembrane-driven protocol treats patients who fail to respond to 5 days of vancomycin ± intravenous metronidazole with colonoscopic FMT, restarts oral vancomycin within 24–48 hours, and repeats FMT at 3- to 5-day intervals until resolution. Using this protocol, 100% of severe CDI and 87% of fulminant CDI patients were cured during the same admission. In an open-label randomized trial, overall success was 75% with a single FMT–vancomycin and 100% with multiple FMT–vancomycin (P = 0.01), with 57% fulminant cases in the multiple-FMT group. Mortality improvements accompanying FMT include reductions from 43.2% to 12.1% and, with early FMT within 2–4 days of diagnosis, from 42.2% to 12.1% (P < 0.001). During sequential therapy, administration of oral vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours or fidaxomicin 200 mg every 12 hours should be continued as long as pseudomembrane is present, and if discharged before resolution, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 5 days followed by a final outpatient FMT.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Adjunctive agents for recurrent or refractory disease are summarized as follows: Adjunctive agents including other antimicrobials, binding agents, and probiotics may be considered in addition to standard treatment in cases of recurrent or refractory CDI, with Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. Rifaximin may be used to treat recurrent CDI and has a moderate success rate (53%–67%) in this setting, and because of the propensity of C difficile to develop resistance to rifaximin, this drug should typically be used in combination with other recommended agents. For refractory CDI, tigecycline can be used with dosing of 100 mg IV loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5–24 days, and in a pooled analysis of 47 cases of refractory CDI treated with standard antibiotics together with adjunctive tigecycline, 7 patients (15%) died and 35 (77%) were cured. Toxin-binding agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol are also used as adjuncts for recurrent CDI with variable success, and because binding agents can also bind oral vancomycin (based on in vitro studies), the administration of these medications should be staggered by a few hours; data regarding tolevamer show it is inferior to vancomycin and metronidazole for treating CDI, with unknown adjunctive efficacy. Finally, administering antimotility agents to patients with CDI has historically been discouraged, but prospective data regarding this practice is not available; probiotics may be useful in treating recurrent or refractory disease, but the efficacy under these circumstances remains unclear, and when used with appropriate medical therapy one small randomized trial reported decreased recurrence (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35–0.98) whereas 3 other randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate a benefit.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iMRzk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection in the United States, with almost half a million cases annually. Recurrent infection is common, with antibiotic exposure being a primary risk factor. – Recent data have suggested that the incidence of recurrent CDI has increased disproportionately compared with primary CDI, indicating a rising demand for strategies to prevent both primary and recurrent CDI.

The optimal approach to reduce the risk of CDI in patients who require systemic antimicrobial therapy remains unclear. Oral vancomycin is the first line therapy for active CDI; however, the risk of recurrence after primary CDI is approximately 20–25% and is further increased with the use of additional systemic antibiotics. Treatment with fidaxomicin or bezlotoxumab in addition to antibiotic therapy is associated with a decreased risk of recurrence compared with vancomycin alone. A meta-analysis compared therapies for prevention of recurrent CDI in patients with active CDI and demonstrated fidaxomicin, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of recurrent CDI, with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody with bezlotoxumab. This study did not address prophylaxis with oral vancomycin to prevent CDI.

In patients who require systemic antibiotics, a primary or secondary prophylactic strategy to prevent CDI is appealing. Studies evaluating the role of probiotics for mitigating primary or recurrent CDI are inconsistent. Preventing CDI with oral vancomycin, termed oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP), has been reported in small studies. One study evaluated the efficacy of OVP for recurrent CDI within 90 days in adult inpatients who received systemic antibiotics and found reduced risk of CDI with OVP [odds ratio (OR), 0.63; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.35–1.14)]. Another study evaluated the efficacy of OVP for hospitalized patients on systemic antibiotics and found no difference in rates of primary CDI in patients who received OVP versus no OVP. One recent meta-analysis of nine studies concluded that OVP was associated with decreased risk of CDI (OR, 0.263; 95% CI, 0.13–0.52) but the analysis was limited by the exclusion of key studies and inclusion of both primary and secondary prophylaxis studies together. In addition, studies that have controlled for confounders may be better able to identify a true association.

Due to inconsistent results from prior studies, we performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the role of OVP for primary and secondary CDI prevention in patients receiving systemic antimicrobial therapy.

### Fidaxomicin versus oral vancomycin forinfection among patients at high risk for recurrence based on real-world experience [^116y1qPK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provided a focused update for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in June 2021, with fidaxomicin (FDX) recommended as first-line therapy for non-fulminant disease.FDX is recommended primarily based on clinical trial data showing a reduced rate of recurrence compared to oral vancomycin (VAN). – FDX is thought to be associated with lower rates of recurrence due to its narrower spectrum of activity compared to VAN making it less disruptive to gut microbiota, its post-antibiotic effect, and bactericidal activity.

Although the IDSA/SHEA guidelines recommend a preference for FDX, high acquisition cost and limitations in coverage from payers remain a barrier to patient access and contribute to higher overall healthcare costs. The IDSA/SHEA guidelines note that VAN is a reasonable first-line option if resources are not available for obtaining FDX. Additionally, American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines for CDI management still recommend oral VAN as first-line therapy with the same level of evidence as FDX for non-fulminant disease for primary episodes.

At our medical center, prior to the updated IDSA/SHEA guidelines, we routinely recommended VAN over FDX for non-fulminant CDI. Based on the updated guideline recommendations, we modified our recommendations to prefer FDX for patients with CDI meeting certain criteria. Given the high cost of FDX we chose to recommend FDX as first-line therapy only in patients at the greatest risk for recurrent CDI (rCDI). We sought to evaluate whether rates of rCDI at 8 weeks were lower among patients at high risk for rCDI that received FDX compared to VAN as the primary outcome.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — in a pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adding bezlotoxumab to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics reduced CDI recurrence after initial clinical cure at 12 weeks (RR: 62; 95% CI: .51–.75) and reduced CDI-associated hospital readmission at 30 days (RR: 46; 95% CI: .29–.71), but failed to show a reduction in mortality (RR: 94; 95% CI: .66–1.34), with certainty ratings as reported; the certainty in the evidence for benefits was initially rated as moderate mainly due to indirectness when fidaxomicin is the SOC antibiotic. The 2 phase III trials enrolled patients between November 2011 and May 2015, during which the 2010 IDSA-SHEA guideline suggested metronidazole for mild–moderate CDI and oral vancomycin for more severe disease, and most trial patients received metronidazole (47%) or oral vancomycin (48%); SOC antibiotics now include vancomycin and fidaxomicin in the updated 2017 IDSA-SHEA guideline. Despite planned subanalyses indicating the choice of SOC antibiotics did not influence clinical outcomes, uncertainty remains about generalizability when fidaxomicin is the SOC antibiotic because it was used in < 5% of the cohort (n = 60 patients); one study reanalyzed the modified intent-to-treat population (n = 1554).

Outcomes

The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for recurrent CDI. The primary end point was incidence of recurrent CDI in participants using oral vancomycin compared with incidence in participants taking placebo during treatment and through 8 weeks following completion of treatment. Incidence of recurrent CDI was collected via weekly telephone calls with participants. Participants reporting 3 or more type-5 to type-7 stools (via the Bristol Stool Scale) above their baseline bowel movements in a 24-hour period provided stool samples to the coordinating site laboratory for 2-step testing to confirm recurrent CDI. Stool samples were cultured for C difficile, with toxigenic polymerase chain reaction confirmation for positive culture results. A combined C difficile toxin A and B enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) (TECHLAB Inc) conducted by the coordinating site laboratory followed by a cytotoxin cell culture assay (if ELISA results were negative) at ARUP Laboratories was used to identify toxigenic C difficile for the recurrent CDI outcome.

The secondary objective was comparing gut VRE carriage in patients taking oral vancomycin vs placebo. Patients self-collected stool samples (and/or perirectal swab samples if stool could not be produced) at enrollment, visit 2, and visit 3 and shipped them to the coordinating site laboratory. The presence of VRE was identified through broth enrichment following culture onto selective agar.

Sample Size

Power and sample size were based on the primary outcome (recurrent CDI incidence). Previous research showed an absolute decrease of 22% in the proportion of patients with CDI recurrence (h = 0.66) between those receiving oral vancomycin and those receiving placebo. We estimated that using a 1:1 random allocation ratio with 80% power and 2-tailed P < .05, a sample size between 84 and 144 total participants would be needed depending on the level of attrition. We proposed a total sample size of 150 participants, anticipating no more than a 20% attrition rate, to detect effects as low as h = 0.57, or a 20.5% decrease in recurrence.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159zSqs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

Prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a challenge in clinical practice, particularly in patients who need systemic antimicrobial therapy. We aimed to evaluate the role of oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) in prevention of primary or future CDI in patients on systemic antimicrobial therapy.

Methods:

A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science was performed from 2000 to January 2020. We included case-control or cohort studies that included patients on systemic antimicrobial therapy who did or did not receive oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) and were evaluated for development of CDI. Odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

Results:

Four studies including 1352 patients evaluated OVP for primary CDI prevention, with CDI occurring in 29/402 patients on OVP (7.4%) compared with 10.4% (99/950) without OVP. Meta-analysis revealed no significant decrease in risk of CDI in patients who received OVP (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.03–1.03; p = 0.06). There was significant heterogeneity with I² = 76%. Ten studies including 9258 patients evaluated OVP for secondary CDI prevention. Future CDI occurred in 91/713 patients on OVP (13.3%) compared with 21.9% (1875/8545) who did not receive OVP. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant decreased risk of future CDI (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.59; p < 0.00001). Significant heterogeneity was seen with I² = 59%.

Discussion:

Based on observational data, OVP appears to decrease the risk of future CDI in patients with prior CDI who require systemic antimicrobial therapy. However, OVP was not effective for primary prevention of CDI.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1171UKRu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin use has been associated with VRE colonization. While other studies have not found an increase in VRE infections after oral vancomycin treatment, our study evaluated carriage of VRE in the gut, a risk factor for future VRE infection. We found that in patients taking placebo, there was a significant reduction in the proportion with VRE carriage from visit 1 (27 of 40 [67.5%]) to visit 3 (6 of 25 [24.0%]) (P < .001), but VRE carriage did not change in patients taking oral vancomycin.

Prior to and during our study, clinical oral vancomycin prophylaxis use at participating sites was often based on institutional and practice preferences rather than clinical trial evidence to show benefit. Many patients were prescribed oral vancomycin prophylaxis prior to being identified for possible enrollment in this study. During recruitment, we noted many participants who did not wish to participate because they were already taking oral vancomycin prophylaxis and did not wish to discontinue use due to the possibility of being randomized to the placebo group. Of the 470 eligible patients who were approached but declined participation, 185 (39.4%) cited this concern. Of these 185 patients, 156 (84.3%) were located at 1 site. Given the difference in protocols for preventing recurrent CDI across different sites and the impact of this on potential patient populations, maintaining equipoise will be a consideration in any future studies.

Limitations

This study has limitations. We did not reach our target enrollment of 150 participants, ultimately randomizing 81 participants. While we have reported the trends and findings in this population, the study was underpowered, which precludes drawing conclusions from findings.

Our study also did not evaluate broader effects on the gut microbiome that may be impacted by systemic antibiotic and oral vancomycin use. Vancomycin alters the gut microbiome, including reducing baseline commensals, which may allow C difficile to colonize and establish. Additional research on patient populations, dosages, and dosing schedules may be needed to determine whether oral vancomycin may provide a greater protective effect within specific parameters while maintaining a low risk profile for patients.

The comment notes implementation "depends upon available resources" and that "Vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative". Trials compared fidaxomicin with vancomycin "(125 mg orally 4 times daily for 10 days)", and one study used an extended regimen "(200 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, followed by once daily on alternate days on days 7–25)… rather than a standard regimen (200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days)". In pooled analysis, fidaxomicin increased sustained response at 4 weeks versus standard vancomycin with "risk ratio [RR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.24", while initial clinical cure was comparable "(RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96–1.04)" and mortality was not reduced "(RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.66–1.23)". Drug-related adverse events were not increased "(RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.76–1.36)", and "The overall certainty in the evidence was rated as moderate" due to study design and imprecision.

Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States, with potential life-threatening complications and a significant impact on the costs of care. Antibiotic stewardship as well as discontinuation of chronic acid suppressive therapy are key for its prevention and treatment. Effective infection management requires appropriate interpretation of diagnostic tests, as well as the use of vancomycin and fidaxomicin as first-line treatment. Novel treatments such as Bezlotoxumab, fecal microbiota transplant, and live biotherapeutic products are proven effective in recurrent C. difficile infection and address dysbiosis.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LRMjr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a challenge in clinical practice, particularly in patients who need systemic antimicrobial therapy. We aimed to evaluate the role of oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) in prevention of primary or future CDI in patients on systemic antimicrobial therapy.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science was performed from 2000 to January 2020. We included case-control or cohort studies that included patients on systemic antimicrobial therapy who did or did not receive oral vancomycin prophylaxis (OVP) and were evaluated for development of CDI. Odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

Results

Four studies including 1352 patients evaluated OVP for primary CDI prevention, with CDI occurring in 29/402 patients on OVP (7.4%) compared with 10.4% (99/950) without OVP. Meta-analysis revealed no significant decrease in risk of CDI in patients who received OVP (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.03–1.03; p = 0.06). There was significant heterogeneity with I² = 76%. Ten studies including 9258 patients evaluated OVP for secondary CDI prevention. Future CDI occurred in 91/713 patients on OVP (13.3%) compared with 21.9% (1875/8545) who did not receive OVP. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant decreased risk of future CDI (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.59; p < 0.00001). Significant heterogeneity was seen with I² = 59%.

Discussion

Based on observational data, OVP appears to decrease the risk of future CDI in patients with prior CDI who require systemic antimicrobial therapy. However, OVP was not effective for primary prevention of CDI.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention ofinfection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112TtWx6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis, we found that OVP was associated with a decreased risk of future CDI in patients with a prior history of CDI who required systemic antimicrobial therapy. However, there was no benefit of oral vancomycin as primary prophylaxis.

Oral vancomycin is well tolerated, with minimal systemic absorption from the gastrointestinal mucosa to result in toxicity or other systemic antimicrobial effects. It can be postulated that oral vancomycin might inhibit the growth of the vegetative form (but not spores) of C. difficile in patients with history of CDI who are on antibiotics, and, thus, prevent recurrence. At the same time, it should be considered that vancomycin leads to gut microbial dysbiosis. One study demonstrated that, in patients with CDI, the stool concentration of vancomycin remained adequately high for 3–5 days after completion of therapy to inhibit the in vitro growth of C. difficile. Therefore, it could be proposed that, in high-risk patients, vancomycin could be continued for 1–2 weeks after completion of the systemic antimicrobial therapy to continue inhibiting C. difficile growth. However, the risk of CDI continues to be high even 90 days after antibiotics, while continuing the use of vancomycin prophylaxis this long is practically difficult.

The principal concern while considering OVP would be that oral vancomycin will have a damaging effect on the microbiota of the colon and on whether OVP increases the risk of recurrent CDI following completion of therapy due to disruption of gut microbiota. A clinical trial comparing the efficacy of vancomycin, metronidazole, and placebo for eradication of asymptomatic C. difficile fecal excretion showed that vancomycin was temporarily effective, but, after 2 months, vancomycin was associated with a significantly higher rate of subsequent recolonization with new CDI strains compared with those on placebo or metronidazole. One study found that patients with CDI treated with oval vancomycin 125 mg four times per day had fecal concentrations of the drug 500–1000 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations against C. difficile, suggesting lower doses of once or twice daily could be sufficient as a prophylactic dose.

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in adults [^114Sg48u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), or C. difficile infection (CDI), being synonymous terms.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 26 January 2017. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDI were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion and extracted data. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random-effects model was used. The following outcomes were sought: sustained symptomatic cure (defined as initial symptomatic response and no recurrence of CDI), sustained bacteriologic cure, adverse reactions to the intervention, death and cost.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies (3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled patients with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded patients with severe CDI and few patients with severe CDI were included in the other six studies. Twelve different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin, cadazolid, LFF517, surotomycin and fidaxomicin. Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo. There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a 'no treatment' control group. The risk of bias was rated as high for 17 of 22 included studies. Vancomycin was found to be more effective than metronidazole for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-two per cent (318/444) of metronidazole patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 79% (339/428) of vancomycin patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97; moderate quality evidence). Fidaxomicin was found to be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-one per cent (407/572) of fidaxomicin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 61% (361/592) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; moderate quality evidence). Teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving a symptomatic cure. Eightly-seven per cent (48/55) of teicoplanin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 73% (40/55) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.46; very low quality evidence). For other comparisons including the one placebo-controlled study the quality of evidence was low or very low due to imprecision and in many cases high risk of bias because of attrition and lack of blinding. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed by study authors to the co-morbidities of the participants that lead to acquiring CDI. Although many other adverse events were reported during therapy, these were attributed to the participants' co-morbidities. The only adverse events directly attributed to study medication were rare nausea and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13 (Health Warehouse). Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 (Walgreens for 56 tablets) compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more (Optimer Pharmaceuticals) and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67 (GBP 71.40, British National Formulary).

Authors' Conclusions

No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded patients with severe disease. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the initiating antibiotic. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other two antibiotics. The quality of evidence for teicoplanin is very low. Adequately powered studies are needed to determine if teicoplanin performs as well as the other antibiotics. A trial comparing the two cheapest antibiotics, metronidazole and teicoplanin, would be of interest.

### Initial therapy affects duration of diarrhoea in critically ill patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [^115y57LM]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Although it has been reported that enteral tube feeding poses a risk factor for CDI, our data identified parenteral nutrition as risk factor for increased 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with CDI. Apart from the level of sickness in terms of choice of nutrition therapy in critically ill patients, our data supports the recommendation of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, not to delay early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients with infections.

Accordingly, critically ill patients' primarily enteral nutrition seems to be vital, as it is also the general recommendation of nutrition in critical illness.

Choice of CDI therapy has been reported to influence mortality rate and should therefore be determined appropriately. Although there are several recommendations on treatment of CDI based on severity of disease, specific recommendations for CDI therapy in patients at the ICU are lacking.

In our cohort, more than 90% of CDI infections were treated by a monotherapy and only 9.1% of all patients received a combination therapy in the beginning. Most patients were treated with metronidazole orally or IV; this treatment is currently only recommended in mild disease in patients who do not tolerate vancomycin. Since our data collection starts in 2010, therapy recommendations were still relying on metronidazole as first-line treatment. In the following years, studies showed the superiority of vancomycin in treating patients with severe CDI.

Interestingly, we observed a significantly decreased clinical success rate in patients treated with metronidazole IV as first-line therapy. Critically ill patients frequently suffer from impaired intestinal transport, and oral drug application might be challenging. Consequently, intravenous treatments are often used. Intravenous metronidazole is partly secreted into the gut lumen in the inflamed colon but concentrations may vary and might not suffice to effectively treat CDI. Now, our data suggest that oral therapy should be included in CDI treatment regimens as far as possible, either vancomycin or metronidazole.

Addition of intravenous metronidazole to vancomycin has been shown to decrease mortality rates in critically ill patients in a retrospective study. However, we could not observe a systematic advantage of combination therapy in this small subgroup (n = 12) in our study.

There is certainly a limitation in our analysis due to the retrospective setting, low number of CDI cases at our hospital and therefore lack of opportunity for propensity score matching. However, to our knowledge, this study is one of the largest studies on incidence and treatment of CDI, especially in the ICU setting.

### The addition of intravenous metronidazole to oral vancomycin is associated with improved mortality in critically ill patients with Clostridium difficile infection [^111MVCeM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal therapy for critically ill patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is not known. We aimed to evaluate mortality among critically ill patients with CDI who received oral vancomycin (monotherapy) vs oral vancomycin with intravenous (IV) metronidazole (combination therapy).

Methods

A single-center, retrospective, observational, comparative study was performed. Patients with a positive C. difficile assay who received oral vancomycin while bedded in an intensive care unit (ICU) between June 2007 and September 2012 were evaluated. Patients meeting ≥ 3 of the following criteria were included: albumin < 2.5 g/dL, heart rate > 90 bpm, mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg, white blood cell count ≥ 15 000 cells/mL, age > 60 years, serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 times baseline, or temperature ≥ 100.4°F. Patients in the combination therapy group received IV metronidazole within 48 hours after initiating vancomycin. Patients < 18 years or with unrelated gastrointestinal disease were excluded. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Patients were matched using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were included, 44 in each group. Patient characteristics were similar although more patients in the combination group had renal disease. Mortality was 36.4% and 15.9% in the monotherapy and combination therapy groups, respectively (P = 0.03). Secondary outcomes of clinical success, length of stay, and length of ICU stay did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Our data are supportive of the use of combination therapy with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole in critically ill patients with CDI. However, prospective, randomized studies are required to define optimal treatment regimens in this limited population of CDI patients.

### Use of oral vancomycin for Clostridioides difficile infection and the risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^113FEP5Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is now a preferred treatment for all cases of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), regardless of disease severity. Concerns remain that a large-scale shift to oral vancomycin may increase selection pressure for vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). We evaluated the risk of VRE following oral vancomycin or metronidazole treatment among patients with CDI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with CDI in the US Department of Veterans Affairs health system between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2016. Patients were included if they were treated with metronidazole or oral vancomycin and had no history of VRE in the previous year. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation of 50 datasets. Patients treated with oral vancomycin were compared to those treated with metronidazole after balancing on patient characteristics using propensity score matching in each imputed dataset. Patients were followed for VRE isolated from a clinical culture within 3 months.

Results

Patients treated with oral vancomycin were no more likely to develop VRE within 3 months than metronidazole-treated patients (adjusted relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, .77 to 1.20), equating to an absolute risk difference of -0.11% (95% CI, -.68% to .47%). Similar results were observed at 6 months.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that oral vancomycin and metronidazole are equally likely to impact patients' risk of VRE. In the setting of stable CDI incidence, replacement of metronidazole with oral vancomycin is unlikely to be a significant driver of increased risk of VRE at the patient level. In this multicenter, retrospective cohort study of patients with Clostridioides difficile infection, the use of oral vancomycin did not increase the risk of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci infection at 3 or 6 months compared to metronidazole.

Methods

Trial Design

We conducted a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of adult patients with a recent CDI who were prescribed systemic antibiotics for non-CDI indications. This was a multicenter study with participants enrolled at 4 large health systems: University of Wisconsin (UW) Health (Madison, Wisconsin) from May 21, 2018, through March 30, 2023; Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW; Milwaukee, Wisconsin) from February 1, 2019, through December 31, 2022; Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, Michigan) from October 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021; and Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) from November 1, 2021, through October 31, 2022. Three health systems (including UW Health and MCW) were initially included, with 1 dropping out without enrolling. Henry Ford Hospital was added in October 2020 and Mayo Clinic was added in November 2021 to increase enrollment. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. The protocol was approved by the UW-Madison institutional review board, which served as the institutional review board of record for all study sites. All participants provided written informed consent via paper or electronic form. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 reporting guideline.

### Enteral vancomycin as primary prophylaxis against… [^115m1HLZ]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if oral vancomycin can prevent C. diff infection in adults who are critically ill and are at high risk of C. diff infection due to their medical conditions and being in the hospital. It will also help us learn about the safety of the drug in this setting. The main questions the trial aims to answer are:

- Does oral vancomycin lower the rate of C. diff infection in high-risk patients.
- Does C. diff carrier status change the C. diff infection rate as well as clearance of carrier status when vancomycin is used as primary prophylaxis. Researchers will compare the oral, active drug vancomycin to a placebo to determine if vancomycin works to prevent C. diff infection in the hospital.

Protocol Synopsis General: Enteral vancomycin has gained attention as a promising strategy for preventing healthcare facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection in patients during systemic antibiotic exposure in certain high-risk populations. However, data remain scarce for its use as primary prophylaxis. Our study aims to fill this gap and evaluate whether enteral vancomycin prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of HCFO-CDI in critically ill patients along with other relevant clinical outcomes. Study Population: Study subjects will include hospitalized subjects with significant risk factors for HCFO-CDI. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria: Adult patients with at least 72 hours of hospitalization who are on a systemic antibiotic for at least 72 hours presenting with two additional risk factors for the development of HCFO-CDI. Study Intervention: Study subjects will be randomized into two study arms
- treatment versus placebo.

Those in the treatment arm will receive vancomycin 125 mg solution daily for up to five days after the last dose of systemic antibiotic. Those in the placebo arm will receive a matching placebo solution. A rectal swab will be performed on all subjects prior to randomization and at study termination or discharge to assess C. difficile colonization and the possible development of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization. Primary outcome: Incidence of HCFO-CDI, defined as symptoms of ≥ 3 loose stools or diarrhea in a 24-hour period in subjects with concurrent positive stool test for C. difficile > 72 hours into hospitalization.

### Uncertain benefits of oral vancomycin for recurrent C. difficile infection… [^1156ahKu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

One strategy used is continuing or starting oral vancomycin with the use of antimicrobials to treat another bacterial infection. Prior studies of prophylaxis have been small and mostly retrospective, and results have been mixed when weighing the benefits with the risks. If the enzyme-linked immunoassay was negative, stool was sent out for cell cytotoxicity. Positive stool cultures were tested by polymerase chain reaction, which was used to confirm the presence of the toxin B gene. The study demonstrated the benefit of daily vancomycin with a 13. 5% decrease in recurrences. 2 Although it did not reach statistical significance because the study was underpowered, the reduction appears to be a clinically meaningful result. The secondary outcome was rates of VRE carriage. 2 The rates of carriage were higher in the placebo group by rectal swab at the time of enrollment, but not significantly different.

After vancomycin treatment, the rate of VRE colonization did not change in the vancomycin group but declined in the placebo group. After treatment, the vancomycin group had more VRE colonization. In addition, patients with obesity treated with vancomycin had reduction of the conversion of primary to secondary bile acids. 5 Primary bile acids are associated with promotion of C difficile spore germination and growth, which may ultimately set up the patient for more recurrences. There are 3 treatment guidelines for management of CDI: the American College of Gastroenterology guideline, 3 which conditionally recommends vancomycin use; The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guideline, 6 which does not recommend routine prophylaxis but states that it may be useful in select patients; and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline, 7 which found insufficient evidence to recommend use of vancomycin.

The current study2 supports the use of vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention of rCDI in patients receiving antibacterial treatment for alternative indications within 180 days of the CDI episode. The small sample size limits the ability to provide conclusive evidence of efficacy. A large multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial will be necessary to answer this question definitively. It will also provide more evidence of the effects on the gut microbiota and allow clinicians to weigh the risks and benefits of vancomycin prophylaxis.
