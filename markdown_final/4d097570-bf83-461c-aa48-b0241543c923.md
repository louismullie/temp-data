## Question

If someone had an A1C of 7% how metformin to prescribe

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to prescribe metformin for a patient with an A1C of 7.0%, including how to dose, titrate, monitor, and escalate therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and whether pharmacotherapy is indicated at A1C 7.0%. Then, I should verify contraindications and choose an appropriate formulation and starting dose. Next, I will plan a titration schedule to a maximally effective dose, define monitoring intervals and targets, and anticipate expected A1C reduction. After that, I need to outline when and how to intensify therapy if the goal is not met, including early combination options. Finally, I should consider special populations, adherence and tolerability strategies, and summarize a practical algorithm with timelines anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold and treatment indication. An A1C of 7.0% meets the diagnostic criterion for type 2 diabetes, and for most adults the typical treatment target is A1C less than 7.0%, so pharmacotherapy is appropriate alongside lifestyle therapy unless there are compelling reasons to individualize a less stringent target, such as frailty, hypoglycemia risk, or limited life expectancy [^1171rfep] [^112JDMsi] [^112jY9jx].

> Wait, let me verify contraindications before I commit to metformin. I need to check renal function because metformin should not be initiated if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and dose should be halved when eGFR is below 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; I should also screen for hepatic disease, heart failure, or conditions predisposing to hypoxia or lactic acidosis, and confirm there is no prior intolerance to metformin or plans for contrast procedures that would require temporary holding [^117BaHtQ] [^117C3dcr] [^114Ct4wx].

> I will now examine formulation and starting dose. Immediate-release metformin is commonly started at 500 mg twice daily with meals to mitigate gastrointestinal effects, while extended-release can be started at 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Both approaches are acceptable, and I should tailor to patient preference and prior tolerability, keeping in mind that the maximum labeled dose is 2550 mg/day for IR and 2000 mg/day for ER in adults [^117MTcKd] [^1164cFxF] [^113aN7AJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the titration cadence to reach an effective dose. A pragmatic plan is to increase by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks based on tolerability, aiming for 1500–2000 mg/day within about 4–6 weeks, because clinically meaningful A1C reductions are typically not seen below about 1500 mg/day. If GI intolerance emerges, I should slow the titration or switch to ER, which is often better tolerated [^117MTcKd] [^115eKBbd] [^113mxqLA].

> Next, I should review monitoring and targets. I need to check fasting plasma glucose during titration to gauge response and identify the minimum effective dose, then reassess A1C about every 3 months to detect primary or secondary failure. The default target for most nonpregnant adults is A1C less than 7.0%, though individualized targets between 6.5% and 8.0% may be appropriate depending on comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^1164cFxF] [^112JDMsi] [^112jY9jx].

> Let me consider the expected glycemic effect to set expectations. Metformin monotherapy typically lowers A1C by about 1.0–1.2% on average, so from a baseline of 7.0% I would anticipate a reduction to roughly 5.8–6.0% if fully effective, acknowledging interpatient variability and the need to titrate to a maximally tolerated dose to realize this benefit [^116vrtAK] [^115bSq8g].

> But wait, what if the A1C remains at or above 7.0% after 3 months of optimized metformin and lifestyle therapy. I should double-check for adherence, proper dosing, and competing medications, and if still above goal, I should escalate promptly to avoid therapeutic inertia; options include adding a second agent with complementary mechanism, with DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or basal insulin as reasonable choices based on comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and access, noting that most add-on agents reduce A1C by roughly 0.5–1.0% [^112JDMsi] [^1124y8Lt] [^112jY9jx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy durability. I should confirm that early combination therapy can be considered in selected patients to improve durability; the VERIFY trial showed that initial combination with vildagliptin plus metformin significantly delayed treatment failure versus metformin alone in newly diagnosed patients with A1C 6.5–7.5%, supporting a strategy of earlier combination in some contexts, particularly when A1C is close to but above target or when rapid, durable control is prioritized [^112xNyF9] [^112dHfyA].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and tolerability. In older adults, I should start low and go slow, reassessing renal function regularly and avoiding maximum doses if eGFR is borderline or if frail. If GI intolerance limits IR titration, switching to ER or using a lower, divided dose can help, and I should remember to monitor for vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term therapy and hold metformin peri-procedurally when indicated [^114Ct4wx] [^117C3dcr] [^1164cFxF].

> Let me reconsider the practical timeline to avoid missed opportunities. A reasonable algorithm is to initiate metformin at 500 mg twice daily with meals, increase to 1000 mg twice daily by week 2–4 if tolerated, and aim for 1500–2000 mg/day by week 4–6. Reassess A1C at 3 months and, if not at goal, add a second agent rather than allowing prolonged hyperglycemia, aligning with guideline calls to intensify within about 3 months when targets are unmet [^115eKBbd] [^117WzJKy] [^112jY9jx].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis and absence of contraindications, start metformin at 500 mg twice daily with meals or 500 mg ER once daily, titrate every 1–2 weeks to 1500–2000 mg/day as tolerated, monitor FPG during titration and A1C every 3 months, and if A1C remains at or above 7.0% after 3 months of optimized therapy, add a second agent promptly while continuing metformin, individualizing the choice to comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, weight, and access, with early combination considered when durability is a priority [^1164cFxF] [^117MTcKd] [^112JDMsi] [^112xNyF9].

---

For a patient with an A1C of 7.0%, **start metformin at 500 mg twice daily with meals** and titrate by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks to a target of 2,000 mg/day if tolerated, as this balances efficacy and gastrointestinal side effects [^117MTcKd] [^115eKBbd]. If gastrointestinal intolerance occurs, **switch to extended-release metformin** and titrate to 2,000 mg/day [^111ertvi]. Monitor A1C every 3 months and add a second agent if the A1C remains above goal after 3–6 months of optimized metformin therapy [^1164cFxF] [^114A4woA].

---

## Initial metformin dosing

- **Standard initial dose**: 500 mg twice daily with meals to minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^117MTcKd] [^1164cFxF].

- **Alternative initial dose**: 850 mg once daily with meals if twice-daily dosing is not feasible [^115eKBbd].

- **Titration**: Increase by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks based on tolerance and glycemic response, aiming for 2,000 mg/day [^117MTcKd] [^1164cFxF].

---

## Maximum recommended dose

The **immediate-release formulation** has a maximum of 2,550 mg/day (divided doses with meals) [^1164cFxF], whereas the **extended-release formulation** has a maximum of 2,000 mg/day (once daily with the evening meal) [^111ertvi].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting metformin initiation at A1C 7.0%

- **Efficacy**: Metformin lowers A1C by ~1.0–1.5% in drug-naive patients, often achieving the < 7% target when started at A1C 7.0% [^116vrtAK] [^1178cyN9].

- **Durability**: Early metformin use preserves beta-cell function and delays treatment failure [^111wqKyY] [^111cxdpz].

- **Cardiometabolic benefits**: Modest weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and potential cardiovascular risk reduction [^117H2PAq] [^116XTpfp].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

- **Glycemic monitoring**: Check fasting glucose during titration; measure A1C every 3 months [^1164cFxF] [^117C3dcr].

- **Renal function**: Assess eGFR at baseline and at least annually; adjust dose if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and discontinue if < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^117BaHtQ] [^117C3dcr].

- **Vitamin B12**: Monitor periodically due to risk of deficiency with long-term use [^111ruk4g].

---

## When to consider combination therapy

Add a second agent if, after 3–6 months of optimized metformin therapy, the **A1C remains above the individualized target** (typically ≥ 7.0–7.5%) [^1118Uxy2] [^112dHfyA]. Options include SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or basal insulin, selected based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and patient preference [^111mHWBv] [^1124y8Lt].

---

## Special considerations

In chronic kidney disease, **adjust the dose or discontinue** based on eGFR thresholds [^117BaHtQ]. In older adults, start conservatively and titrate cautiously due to renal function decline [^1124WYZ9]. If gastrointestinal intolerance occurs, use extended-release metformin or consider alternative therapies [^114ngiEQ].

## Metformin dosing and monitoring

| **Parameter** | **Immediate-release** | **Extended-release** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 500 mg twice daily with meals | 500 mg once daily with evening meal |
| Titration | Increase by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks | Increase by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks |
| Maximum dose | 2,550 mg/day | 2,000 mg/day |
| Monitoring | - Fasting glucose during titration <br/> - A1C every 3 months <br/> - Renal function annually | - Fasting glucose during titration <br/> - A1C every 3 months <br/> - Renal function annually |

---

For a patient with an A1C of 7.0%, **start metformin at 500 mg twice daily with meals**, titrate to 2,000 mg/day if tolerated, and monitor A1C every 3 months; add a second agent if the A1C remains above goal after 3–6 months.

### A review of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: is there a place for adjunctive metformin? [^111tErZx]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Current Place of Metformin in Type 1 Diabetes

Metformin is not approved for use in T1D by the US FDA. However, in the data from the T1D Exchange registry from the US, 6% of patients were identified as metformin users. In another Scottish registry of 1850 type 1 diabetics, 7.9% with BMI > 27 kg/m² and 13% with BMI > 30 kg/m² were receiving metformin. In its Standards of Care, the ADA notes that 'adding metformin to insulin therapy may reduce insulin requirements and improve metabolic control in overweight/obese patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes'. In 2015, the UK NICE guidelines recommended use of metformin in adults with type 1 diabetes with BMI ≥ 25 or BMI ≥ 23 kg/m² for people of South Asian and related ethnic groups, who want to improve glucose control while minimizing their effective insulin dose.

However, there is little evidence to support that it can improve glycemic control in T1D, and the initial transient reduction in HbA1c is not maintained over time. This could be due to down titration of the insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia. Thus, there is a need to revise the guidelines and acknowledge that there is no sustained glycemic benefit of adjunctive metformin in T1D and that there is no particular glycemic efficacy in overweight/obese individuals. On the other hand, adjunctive use of metformin in T1D results in significant reductions in the insulin dose requirement and insulin-induced weight gain and may therefore, be particularly useful in overweight/obese type 1 diabetics. Therefore, overall, metformin has an insulin-sensitizing effect in type 1 diabetics.

Recent evidence suggests that metformin reduces LDL cholesterol and maximal cIMT and may extend cardioprotective benefits in T1D. Metformin use may thus be warranted to improve CV risk management in T1D and to reduce insulin dose requirements. Further outcome studies are needed to assess whether there is an actual reduction in CV outcomes. Such studies may not be easily forthcoming as they would require many type 1 diabetics to be followed for a long time, and there may be difficulty in funding such trials, unlike in type 2 diabetes. In Tables 3 and 4, we summarize the risks and benefits of adjunctive metformin and enumerate the possible indications for use of metformin as an adjunct to insulin therapy in T1D.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — general principles state that individualized pharmacotherapy for persons with T2D should be prescribed based on evidence for benefit that includes glucose lowering, avoidance of hypoglycemia and weight gain, and reduction of cardio-renal risk; persons with T2D and their health care professionals should use patient-centered shared decision-making to agree on therapy targets and treatments as well as a regimen for glucose monitoring; glycemic targets include A1C, BGM, and, for those using CGM, achievement of CGM targets such as time in range (TIR), percentage in low and very low range, time above range, and glycemic variability, while nonglycemic targets include avoidance of hypoglycemia, control of BP, lipids, other CVD risk factors, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight; independent of glycemic control, targets, or treatment, if there is established or high risk for ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD, clinicians should prescribe a GLP-1 RA or an SGLT2i with proven efficacy; DM therapy should be individualized based on level of glycemia and the presence of comorbidities, complications, and access, with metformin often the preferential initial therapy and other agents appropriate as first-line or in addition to metformin to reduce BG and/or address specific comorbidities; clinicians should discuss with persons with T2D the likelihood that most persons with T2D ultimately require a combination of multiple complementary agents to attain and maintain optimal glycemic control, and the DM care team should assess medication adherence and safety and glycemic control in persons with T2D quarterly or more frequently as needed.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116YSn1B]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with ASCVD/high-risk — A1C targets and treatment thresholds: A target A1C of < 6.5% in most nonpregnant adults can be used if safely achieved, whereas less stringent A1C goals (> 7%) should be adopted in specified situations. If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^116vrtAK]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the first-line oral medication recommended for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We reviewed the literature to quantify the effect of metformin treatment on glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in all types of diabetes and examine the impact of differing doses on glycemic control.

Research Design and Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1950 to June 2010 for trials of at least 12 weeks' duration in which diabetic patients were treated with either metformin monotherapy or as an add-on therapy. Data on change in HbA(1c) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Data from dose-comparison trials were separately pooled.

Results

A total of 35 trials were identified for the main analysis and 7 for the dose-comparison analysis. Metformin monotherapy lowered HbA(1c) by 1.12% (95% CI 0.92–1.32; I(2) = 80%) versus placebo, metformin added to oral therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.95% (0.77–1.13; I(2) = 77%) versus placebo added to oral therapy, and metformin added to insulin therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.60% (0.30–0.91; I(2) = 79.8%) versus insulin only. There was a significantly greater reduction in HbA(1c) using higher doses of metformin compared with lower doses of metformin with no significant increase in side effects.

Conclusions

Evidence supports the effectiveness of metformin therapy in a clinically important lowering of HbA(1c) used as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents. There is potential for using higher doses of metformin to maximize glycemic control in diabetic patients without increasing gastrointestinal effects.

### Second-line pharmaceutical treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes [^112JDMsi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control. However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

### Double-blind, randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of early initiation of sitagliptin during metformin uptitration in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: the compoSIT-M study [^113XG6SB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clinical practice guidelines recommend that hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) be controlled through a comprehensive management strategy including lifestyle modification and, as needed, pharmacotherapy. 1, 2 While glycaemic treatment targets are individualized based on patient‐specific considerations, a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration of < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) is considered a typical treatment target for most patients with T2D, and anti‐hyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) are usually initiated and intensified in a stepped‐care fashion, based on glycaemic response relative to this goal. Because of its favourable efficacy, safety and cost, metformin is the first‐line AHA for most patients with T2D. It is typically initiated at 500‐1000 mg/d, with dose escalations occurring as required, based on HbA1c re‐assessments, up to doses of 2000 to 2500 mg/d. 2 If dose uptitration of metformin monotherapy does not result in HbA1c goal attainment, one or more other AHAs are added.

This stepped‐care approach can substantially delay HbA1c goal attainment in patients who ultimately require two or more AHAs for optimal glycaemic control. A recent analysis of observational data in the United Kingdom indicated that only 25% of patients with T2D with HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (≥ 7.0%) received treatment intensification within 12 months. 3 Further, the likelihood of attaining glycaemic control was significantly lower for patients with delayed intensification. More aggressive approaches may therefore be considered in patients who are well above their HbA1c goal. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that initial treatment with two AHAs be considered for patients presenting with an HbA1c level well above target. For example, HbA1c thresholds for initiation of dual therapy of 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) and 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) have been recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes, respectively. 1, 2 However, practice recommendations do not yet provide guidance regarding an optimal approach to treatment intensification for patients who are well above their HbA1c target on metformin monotherapy at a sub‐maximal dose. For some such patients, it may be reasonable to consider initiation of a second AHA in parallel with, instead of following, metformin dose escalation.

### Intensification of diabetes therapy and time until A1c goal attainment among patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who fail metformin monotherapy within a large integrated health system [^115S4yXk]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

"Clinical inertia" has been used to describe the delay in the intensification of type 2 diabetes treatment among patients with poor glycemic control. Previous studies may have exaggerated the prevalence of clinical inertia by failing to adequately monitor drug dose changes and nonmedication interventions. This project evaluated the intensification of diabetes therapy and hemoglobin A1c (A1C) goal attainment among patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes when metformin monotherapy failed.

Research Design and Methods

The electronic health record at Cleveland Clinic was used to identify patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes between 2005 and 2013 who failed to reach the A1C goal after 3 months of metformin monotherapy. A time-dependent survival analysis was used to compare the time until A1C goal attainment in patients who received early intensification of therapy (within 6 months of metformin failure) or late intensification. The analysis was performed for A1C goals of 7% (n = 1,168), 7.5% (n = 679), and 8% (n = 429).

Results

Treatment was intensified early in 62%, 69%, and 72% of patients when poor glycemic control was defined as an A1C > 7%, > 7.5%, and > 8%, respectively. The probability of undergoing an early intensification was greater the higher the A1C category. Time until A1C goal attainment was shorter among patients who received early intensification regardless of the A1C goal (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

A substantial number of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes fail to undergo intensification of therapy within 6 months of metformin monotherapy failure. Early intervention in patients when metformin monotherapy failed resulted in more rapid attainment of A1C goals.

### Metformin to prevent diabetes in patients at increased risk… [^117BCfYS]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question In patients at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, is metformin effective for the prevention or delay of diabetes onset and its associated complications. Evidence-Based Answer In patients at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, metformin reduces the risk compared with counseling on standard diet and exercise. Data are limited regarding adverse effects and long-term outcomes.

1. Practice Pointers Patients with prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and/or an A1C of
5. 7% to 6. 4%, are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has been associated with many complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and kidney dysfunction.

Patients who used metformin for one to five years were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with patients counseled on standard diet and exercise. However, there was no significant reduction in the development of type 2 diabetes in patients taking metformin compared with those who were counseled on intensive diet and exercise. This review had some limitations. Notably, 48% of the patients were from one study, and 60% of the reviews were conducted in a single country. The results were consistent across studies, although the results of some studies were not statistically significant. Importantly, there were limited data on mortality between treatment groups, as well as long-term outcomes. A previous meta-analysis also found that metformin reduced the risk of developing diabetes.

4 Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend metformin as an adjunct to intensive lifestyle modification or for patients incapable of lifestyle modification. 5 The American Diabetes Association recommends the use of metformin to reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high-risk individuals but suggests that it is inferior to lifestyle modifications. 6 It should be noted that within the United States, the cost of metformin is typically low. It is often included on the low-cost medication options at pharmacies for patients who need to pay out of pocket for their medications.

### Metformin for prediabetes… [^113z5sjg]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Metformin for Prediabetes. JAMA. 2017; 317:

1171. doi: 10.1001/jama.2016.17844 The oral biguanide metformin is generally the drug of choice for initial treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has also been used to prevent or at least delay the onset of diabetes in patients considered to be at high risk for the disease. Recent guidelines recommend considering use of metformin in patients with prediabetes, especially in those who are < 60 years old, have a BMI > 35 kg/m², or have a history of gestational diabetes. 1 Metformin has not been approved for such use by the FDA.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^112JmZW3]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Most leading guidelines suggest adding one of several antihyperglycemic drugs when lifestyle and metformin fail to keep A1C at target unrelated to these questions. The previous American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement suggested a preferable order of drugs, while the AACE/ACE Diabetes Algorithm for Glycemic Control suggested starting treatment with combination therapy in naïve patients with A1C > 7.6%. The Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines suggested adding one of several second drugs after metformin in patients with A1C > 7%. Similarly, the recently published ADA/EASD position statement suggested leaving the decision of which drug to add to the treating physician. The above-mentioned guidelines are mainly based on drug efficacy and safety and do not necessarily address the various pathophysiology defects leading to hyperglycemia and increased risk for CVD in these patients. The case for initiating combination therapy that addresses the different pathophysiological faults in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in order to preserve near-normal glycemic durability is presented in this issue by DeFronzo, Eldor, and Abdul-Ghani. I will present the case for guidelines while referring and critiquing the approach of DeFronzo, Eldor, and Abdul-Ghani and suggest another option for a middle-of-the-road treatment method.

We disagree with the most recent American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) guideline that suggests combination therapy as the initial step for persons with HbA 1c 7.0% to 8.0%, noting that a substantial component of this population (especially those at the lower end of this range) will be able to attain goal with one of the more potent agents; a similar approach (initial monotherapy with metformin, for instance) is supported in the most recent ADA/EASD position paper. Utilization of polypharmacy prior to maximizing glycemic control with well chosen monotherapy seems, to us, overtreatment at stage 1 and exposes the patient to unnecessary expense, potential adverse effect profile, complexity, and risk for hypoglycemia.

### The position of gliclazide in the evolving landscapes and disease continuum of T2DM: a collaborative Delphi survey-based consensus from India [^116dU5Qv]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Decision to Use Gliclazide/Gliclazide-MR as Valid Option for Drug-Naïve Patients with T2DM

Current guidelines recommend metformin as the first-line, initial monotherapy, and as part of combination therapy for patients with T2DM. In case metformin is not suitable, the IDF recommends use of SU, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) for the treatment and prevention of T2DM. Several clinical trials comparing gliclazide with other antidiabetic agents such as metformin, pioglitazone, vildagliptin, or insulin have reported similar glycemic efficacy. In the EASYDia trial, nearly half of the treatment-naïve patients with diabetes successfully achieved an A1c of 7.0% or less at month 3 with gliclazide-MR therapy. However, initiating therapy with multiple antidiabetes agents in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, especially those with A1c greater than 8.0% to 8.5%, represents a rational approach to achieve the target A1c level while minimizing side effects. Indeed, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) recommends starting newly diagnosed diabetic subjects with A1c greater than 7.5% on multiple antidiabetes agents.

### Initial combination of linagliptin and metformin improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112aJU5A]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with linagliptin plus metformin versus linagliptin or metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial, 791 patients were randomized to one of six treatment arms. Two free combination therapy arms received linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (bid) + either low (500 mg) or high (1000 mg) dose metformin bid. Four monotherapy arms received linagliptin 5 mg once daily, metformin 500 mg or 1000 mg bid or placebo. Patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 11.0% were not eligible for randomization and received open-label linagliptin + high-dose metformin.

Results

The placebo-corrected mean (95% confidence interval) change in HbA1c from baseline (8.7%) to week 24 was -1.7% (-2.0, -1.4) for linagliptin + high-dose metformin, -1.3% (-1.6, -1.1) for linagliptin + low-dose metformin, -1.2% (-1.5, -0.9) for high-dose metformin, -0.8% (-1.0, -0.5) for low-dose metformin and -0.6 (-0.9, -0.3) for linagliptin (all p < 0.0001). In the open-label arm, the mean change in HbA1c from baseline (11.8%) was -3.7%. Hypoglycaemia occurred at a similar low rate with linagliptin + metformin (1.7%) as with metformin alone (2.4%). Adverse event rates were comparable across treatment arms. No clinically significant changes in body weight were noted.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy with linagliptin plus metformin was superior to metformin monotherapy in improving glycaemic control, with a similar safety and tolerability profile, no weight gain and a low risk of hypoglycaemia.

### How do we continue treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes when therapeutic goals are not reached with oral antidiabetes agents and lifestyle? Incretin versus insulin treatment [^111hxm3U]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Studies with basal insulin (analogs) added onto metformin.

A meta-analysis of 27 published RCTs with > 11,000 type 2 diabetic patients treated with different noninsulin antidiabetes drugs for a mean of 32 weeks added to metformin was recently published. The overall effects on HbA 1c, body weight, and the relative risk of hypoglycemic events using sulfonylureas, glinides, glitazones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1 RAs were −0.79%, 0.14 kg increase, and 1.43-fold, respectively. Sulfonylureas and glinides were associated with the highest relative risk of hypoglycemia (2.63 and 7.92, respectively).

Should a GLP-1 RA or a basal insulin analog be added to metformin? The meta-analysis mentioned above partly provides an answer: GLP-1 RA therapy lowered HbA 1c by 0.99% (mean) and was associated with no risk of hypoglycemia (0.94) and a loss of weight (−1.76 kg). One may argue that the limited efficacy of lowering HbA 1c by ~1% of GLP-1 RA therapy is not sufficient to meet glycemic targets in most of the patients failing on metformin monotherapy. By contrast, basal insulin analogs added to metformin provide relatively uniform insulin coverage throughout the day and night, thus making nearly any target of HbA 1c achievable, provided insulin dose titration is properly done.

A large, pooled analysis of prospective RCTs in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on 0–2 OHAs initiating basal insulin glargine after a specific titration algorithm was published last year. Of 63 RCTs performed between 1997 and 2007, eleven studies were eligible, meeting the following criteria: 1) studies were phase 3 or later prospective RCTs of ≥ 24 weeks' duration; 2) enrolled adult patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control; 3) basal insulin was given once daily, with no concomitant prandial or bolus insulin administration; 4) insulin glargine was initiated at 10 units/day and was administered according to predefined titration algorithms with frequent insulin dose adjustment (from every 1–3 days to every week) to achieve fasting plasma glucose levels < 100 mg/dL; and 5) studies were conducted according to good clinical practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116XTpfp]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study showed that dosing of metformin monotherapy in people with T2DM in the United Kingdom is influenced by HbA1c levels, and in prevalent users, also by duration of disease. Up‐titration was infrequent in the first year postinitiation and was dependent on subject's age and HbA1c levels.

Metformin is widely prescribed for T2DM globally, particularly in Western countries. 13, 15, 23, 24, 25 Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced and released by the liver, and by increasing insulin sensitivity. 26 A major advantage of this therapy is weight stability or modest weight loss, in contrast to many other antihyperglycaemic medications. It may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. 27, 28 A recent US study found that up‐titration of metformin was as effective as adding a second T2DM drug in terms of the probability of glycaemic control after 6 months. 29 Despite these positive features of metformin therapy, optimization of the metformin dose appears to be infrequent.

The median time to up‐titration in the current study was around 175 days, regardless of HbA1c level. This suggests that up‐titration, if it happens, generally happens within the first 6 months of treatment. This is in accordance with international guidelines that recommend dose optimization over the first several weeks. 7, 8, 9 Studies of time to treatment intensification, that is, switching to another drug or adding a second drug, indicate that < 40% of people on metformin monotherapy intensify their treatment within the first year, 11, 18 with median times to initiation of second‐line therapy of 2‐2.3 years, 18, 19 suggesting there is a sufficiently long lag time between metformin initiation and the time to intensification during which to up‐titrate metformin. In most of our study population, however, this had not been done.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^1171rfep]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Finally, that the A1C diagnostic threshold now being defined at 6.5% while the recommended target for most diabetic patients remains at 7% will be viewed by some as untidy — if not a contradiction of sorts. However, good clinical judgment suggests that for many patients it may be appropriate to start at least lifestyle interventions whenever the diagnosis is made, irrespective of A1C. Whether this threshold should now be considered one for the initiation of metformin therapy (or other agents) will be extremely, and appropriately, controversial. The argument will not be settled until we have randomized clinical trials that better inform our clinical decisions in patients with such mild degrees of hyperglycemia. Such data are sorely lacking at this point. Indeed, clinical research in this arena may be easier to conduct now that the new criteria have been suggested, given that cases will be easier to identify at this early stage.

In summary, the adoption of the A1C test as a diagnostic criterion is a reasonable proposition on the practical grounds analyzed by the report. Its worldwide feasibility is, at present, limited. In addition, anchoring the diagnostic threshold solely to microvascular risk, leaving a diagnostic hiatus in the A1C range 6.1–6.5%, and choosing an A1C threshold different from the treatment target recommended by most guidelines (7%) are problematic aspects carried over from the glucose-based diagnostics. Perhaps further analysis and relevant new evidence will be considered before the findings and arguments of the International Expert Committee can be transposed into widely endorsed recommendations.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Secondary failure of metformin monotherapy in clinical practice [^116FAJku]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE We sought to document the secondary failure rate of metformin monotherapy in a clinical practice setting and to explore factors that predict therapeutic failure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied 1,799 type 2 diabetic patients who, between 2004 and 2006, lowered their A1C to < 7% after initiating metformin monotherapy as their first-ever anti-hyperglycemic drug. We examined all A1C values recorded through 31 December 2008 (2–5 years of follow-up), defining secondary failure as a subsequent A1C ≥ 7.5% or the addition or substitution of another anti-hyperglycemic agent. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the probability of secondary failure. RESULTS Of the 1,799 patients studied, 42% (n = 748) experienced secondary failure; the mean failure rate was 17% per year. However, patients who initiated metformin within 3 months of diabetes diagnosis failed at an age-and A1C-adjusted rate of 12.2% (10.5–14.4%) per year, and patients who initiated while A1C was < 7% failed at an adjusted rate of 12.3% per year. An interaction term between duration of diagnosed diabetes and A1C was not significant. Age, duration, and A1C at initiation were the only factors that predicted secondary failure. CONCLUSIONS Although metformin failure may occur more rapidly in clinical practice than in clinical trails, initiating it soon after diabetes diagnosis and while A1C is low might preserve beta-cell function, prolong the effectiveness of metformin, reduce lifetime glycemic burden, and prevent diabetes complications. Our findings support the current treatment algorithm for hyperglycemia management that recommends metformin initiation when diabetes is first diagnosed.

### Target for glycemic control: concentrating on glucose [^112DUTcc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A tool for choosing between insulin regimens in patients suffering from severe insulin deficiency

Insulin should be implemented as soon as oral hypoglycemic agents at maximal doses do not achieve satisfactory diabetic control. At present, there is little doubt that patients with a sustained level of A1C > 8% should be treated with insulin. Because in these patients basal hyperglycemia is preponderant over prandial hyperglycemia, insulin regimens based on basal insulin should be preferred to prandial insulin at initiation of the insulin therapy. If the target cannot be achieved, premeal boluses of rapid insulin analogs should be added, especially before the meals that result in the more pronounced glycemic excursions. The problem is slightly more complex in those patients who exhibit A1C levels between 7 and 8%. In this situation, most patients are reluctant to being treated with insulin. Furthermore, despite recent publications of more stringent recommendations, many physicians delay insulin treatment until further deterioration in A1C occurs. The new recommendations indicate that insulin treatment should be initiated as soon as A1C remains above 7%, with maximal doses of oral hypoglycemic agents combining insulin sensitizers (metformin + glitazone) with an insulin secretagogue. These recommendations are in agreement with our data, since the mean interval of time that separates the moment at which A1C levels reach 7 and 8% is ∼4 years, a duration that is not negligible in terms of risk for development or progression of diabetic complications. At present, it is recommended to start insulin with one injection of a long-acting insulin analog before dinner or at bedtime. With such a regimen, the insulin action reaches a maximum over a period corresponding to the dawn and extended dawn phenomena, i.e. over a period that covers the end of the overnight fast and the postbreakfast period. In patients with A1C ranging between 7 and 8%, plasma glucose values over this time interval are usually more elevated than at any other period of daytime. However, this group of patients can be divided into two subsets according to whether prebreakfast glucose levels were lower or greater than 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l). Most patients (more than two-thirds) had glucose patterns with both a "dawn" and "extended dawn" phenomena (Fig. 3) and should be treated with a single injection of long-acting insulin analog before dinner or at bedtime. In less than one-third, prebreakfast glucose values remained below 126 mg/dl (Fig. 3). In this latter subgroup of patients, the dawn phenomenon was absent. Nevertheless, these patients with near-normal glycemia before breakfast experience abnormal postbreakfast excursions, which result in sustained hyperglycemia over the entire morning period. To combat this glycemic profile, which is limited to the postbreakfast period, it is probably preferable to administer a small bolus of a rapid-acting insulin analog at prebreakfast than a long-acting insulin analog before dinner or at bedtime. Continuous glucose monitoring can be a useful tool for guiding the choice between these two insulin regimens. When this type of monitoring is not available, the clinician can use, as a surrogate, the glucose values at prebreakfast and at 2-h postbreakfast times. The observation of concomitant elevation of both pre- and postbreakfast glucose suggests that the basal hyperglycemia should be controlled first and, as a consequence, that the insulin regimen should be initiated with either intermediate-acting insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. By contrast, an elevated postbreakfast level with a near-normal fasting glucose level indicates that a bolus of rapid insulin analog should be administered before breakfast to blunt the postbreakfast glucose excursions. Tailoring the insulin replacement rather than adopting standardized insulin strategies is a more logical approach to achieve satisfactory metabolic control.

### Therapeutic efficacy and safety of initial triple combination of metformin, sitagliptin, and lobeglitazone in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes: initial triple study [^112vayoq]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

A pathophysiological approach aiming to alleviate insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia or to improve β-cell function has shown long-term benefit in T2D management, compared with simple insulin secretagogues. Here, both treatments showed substantial and comparable reductions in HbA1c levels during the first 5 months. However, hypoglycemia was reported in only one patient in the initial triple group, while 11 patients in the conventional group experienced hypoglycemia. Among them, one patient in the initial triple group and five in the conventional group discontinued the study because of hypoglycemia. High numbers of hypoglycemic events in the conventional therapy arm can be attributed to the uptitration of glimepiride or insulin, which was added as a rescue therapy.

The HbA1c levels in both groups were decreased significantly at the 2 and 5-month visits (> 2.0% and another > 1.0%, respectively). The participants receiving initial triple combination therapy were able to maintain a target HbA1c goal of < 7.0% over 12 months (69.8%). By contrast, the HbA1c level rebounded after 5 months using the stepwise approach. Only 52.4% of patients maintained the HbA1c target < 7.0% over 12 months. These results support the use of initial triple combination therapy with DPP4 inhibitor, metformin, and TZD for greater durability in glucose control than the stepwise therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea.

The 0.2% increasing tendency in HbA1c level after 5 months in our stepwise approach is consistent with data from previous studies with metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin. It should be noted that the progressive increase in HbA1c levels was paralleled by a progressive decline in β-cell function.

At 12 months, 141 mg/dL of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the conventional group seemed not to be satisfactory but the metformin dose was not escalated to the maximum possible level; instead, 1425 mg of metformin was used. High-dose metformin therapy is not generally prescribed in Asian countries because it tends to increase the incidence of adverse side effects, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, without affecting its glucose-lowering efficacy. Furthermore, high doses of metformin are also not recommended for elderly people because of their attenuated renal function. In our study, about 30% of the subjects were aged > 60 years. For these reasons, a moderate dose of metformin (up to ~1500 mg) was used in the conventional therapy group.

### Initial treatment with rosiglitazone / metformin fixed-dose combination therapy compared with monotherapy with either rosiglitazone or metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^1175HM5f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone and metformin (RSG/MET) fixed-dose combination (AVANDAMET) as initial therapy in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes compared with monotherapy with either RSG or MET after 32 weeks of treatment.

Methods

A total of 468 drug-naive patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes were recruited for this multicentre, double-blind trial if their glycated haemoglobin (A1c) was greater than 7.5%, but less than or equal to 11%, and their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was less than or equal to 15 mmol/l. Patients were randomized to 32 weeks of blinded treatment with either RSG/MET fixed-dose combination (n = 155), MET (n = 154) or RSG (n = 159). The groups were comparable at baseline, with mean A1c of 8.8% and FPG of 11 mmol/l. RSG/MET was initiated with a total daily dose of 2 mg/500 mg and could be increased up to 8 mg/2000 mg; MET therapy began with a total daily dose of 500 mg and could be increased up to 2000 mg; and RSG treatment began with a total daily dose of 4 mg and could be increased up to 8 mg. Medication was uptitrated during on-therapy visits based on failure to attain glycaemic target of mean daily glucose less than or equal to 6.1 mmol/l (unless at maximum tolerated dose). Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety at nine visits over a 32-week treatment period. This was a trial designed to show greater efficacy of RSG/MET combination therapy compared with MET or RSG monotherapy. The primary end point was change in A1c from baseline to week 32. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients achieving recommended A1c and FPG targets for glycaemic control and change from baseline in FPG, free fatty acid, lipids, insulin, insulin sensitivity, C-reactive protein and adiponectin. Safety evaluations included adverse-event (AE) monitoring, changes in weight and clinical laboratory evaluations.

Results

At week 32, RSG/MET showed significant improvements in A1c from a baseline of 8.9 ± 1.1% to 6.6 ± 1.0% at study end, and this 2.3% reduction was significantly greater than the reductions achieved individually with MET (-1.8%; p = 0.0008) and RSG (-1.6%; p < 0.0001). The greatest mean decrease in FPG was seen with RSG/MET (-4.1 mmol/l) and was significant compared with MET (-2.8 mmol/l; p < 0.0001) and RSG (-2.6 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). Target A1c of less than or equal to 6.5% and less than 7% were achieved in more patients in the RSG/MET group (60% and 77%) than with MET (39% and 57%) or RSG (35% and 58%) respectively. Treatment was well tolerated, with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as the most commonly reported AEs. Oedema was comparable between RSG/MET (6%) and RSG (7%) and lower in the MET group (3%). No new safety and tolerability issues were observed in the RSG/MET group.

Conclusions

As first-line therapy in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, RSG/MET fixed-dose combination therapy achieved significant reductions in A1c and FPG compared with either RSG or MET monotherapy. RSG/MET was generally well tolerated as initial therapy, with no new tolerability issues identified with the fixed-dose combination.

### Pivotal role of timely basal insulin replacement after metformin failure in sustaining long-term blood glucose control at a target in type 2 diabetes [^1173S3GP]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION — EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF DIABETES CONSENSUS

The 2008 consensus of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)–European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) proposes lifestyle intervention along with metformin at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes to rapidly reduce A1C levels to < 7.0%. This "step 1" is generally well accepted, and, in fact, it is common clinical experience that combining medical nutrition treatment and physical exercise, along with metformin, reduces A1C to < 7.0% in a significant number of subjects. However, in subjects presenting with severely elevated blood glucose (A1C > 9–10%), initiation of insulin controls hyperglycemia more rapidly than oral hypoglycemic agents.

Some patients never satisfactorily respond to lifestyle modifications and metformin and do not reduce A1C to < 7.0% within a few months of treatment initiation. Other patients, after an initial successful response to lifestyle modification + metformin, may lose the response within months or a few years; therefore, their A1C progressively increases beyond the value of 7.0%. This is the time at which an aggressive "add on" treatment has to be initiated to rapidly control A1C to < 7.0% and maintain it over a long period of time ("step 2" of the ADA-EASD consensus). To successfully implement step 2, several preliminary considerations should be made. First, the initiation of step 2 should be timely, i.e. the decision should be made as early as possible after failure of step 1 to maintain A1C < 7.0%. This scenario requires consistent monitoring of A1C every 2–3 months, which makes it possible to identify the trend for progressive increases of A1C from values of 6–6.5 to 7.0%. Perhaps it would be better to move to step 2 immediately before, not after, A1C has already trespassed the threshold of 7.0%.

### Cardiovascular benefit in the limelight: shifting type 2 diabetes treatment paradigm towards early combination therapy in patients with overt cardiovascular disease [^117SKPBQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Current diabetes clinical practice guidelines recommend lifestyle modification and metformin, if not contraindicated, as the preferred initial pharmacologic agent for the treatment of patients with recent onset T2DM and mild hyperglycemia. For patients who present with higher HbA1c levels, ADA guidelines advocate a stepwise approach that intensifies treatment incrementally to dual and triple therapy at 3-month intervals until the patients are at their individualized goal, taking into consideration initial dual therapy if HbA1c ≥ 9% at diagnosis. AACE/ACE guidelines encourage initial dual therapy for patients who present with HbA1c > 7.5% at diagnosis, with a suggested hierarchy of use in which GLP-1 RA ranks second and SGLT2–2i ranks third after metformin. Similarly, Diabetes Canada guidelines state that initiating metformin in combination with a second glucose-lowering agent should be considered if HbA1c values are ≥ 1.5% above target at diagnosis. Recent guidelines address the FDA approval of empagliflozin and liraglutide for CVD benefit. The ADA and Diabetes Canada guidelines recommend that in patients with T2DM and established CVD, antihyperglycemic therapy should begin with lifestyle management and metformin and subsequently incorporate an agent proven to reduce major adverse CV events and CV mortality, currently empagliflozin and liraglutide (canagliflozin may be considered) after considering drug-specific and patient factors. Notably, the ADA and Diabetes Canada guidelines discern drug-specific CV effects into atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF) effects that should be considered when selecting treatment, along with renal dosing considerations. All guidelines endorse individualized glycemic targets based on numerous factors, such as life expectancy, comorbid conditions, duration of diabetes, and risk of hypoglycemia. AACE/ACE supports an HbA1c level of ≤ 6.5% for most patients, but higher targets may be appropriate if lower HbA1c cannot be achieved without adverse outcomes. ADA guidelines denote HbA1c of 7% as a reasonable goal for many nonpregnant T2DM patients and suggest more stringent targets (such as HbA1c < 6.5%) for selected patients at low risk for hypoglycemia or other adverse effects and patients with long-life expectancy and no significant CVD. Less stringent HbA1c goals (such as HbA1c < 8%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia or advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^111vKSNn]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Insulin titration protocol: weaning — manage insulin reduction with the following steps and thresholds. If still on MDI, stop short acting insulin and contact approximately every 3 days to review glucoses. Wait until fasting numbers are < 100 mg/dl for at least 2–3 days in a 5–7 day period. If so, cut back long-acting insulin dose by 20%/10 units, but may consider 30%/15–20 units if glucoses are 80 mg/dl or less, and consider reliability of patient contact when making the decision to more aggressively wean insulin. Once the dose is down to 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, consider stopping, and consider using a small decrease in insulin as a motivational factor to continue to maintain contact. If patient was lost to follow-up between onset visit and follow-up visit, but has an HbA1c < 6% 3 months+ after diagnosis and is on full-dose metformin (or pioglitazone), stop long-acting insulin with careful monitoring after. If HbA1c is 6.5–7% at the next visit, add a second agent.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^115bSq8g]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin's known benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality, as well as its neutral effects on body weight and low risk of hypoglycemia, has led to wide recommendations for routine prescribing. However, until now, it has not been clear how different patients may respond to treatment. By separately examining the effect of metformin treatment in various groups of patients, depending on their previous antidiabetes medication, we are providing a tool to assist decisions on treatment combinations and optimal doses.

This review demonstrates that metformin treatment can be used to reduce HbA 1c in all patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of prior antihyperglycemic medication or insulin treatment. Use of higher doses of metformin resulted in modestly higher decreases in HbA 1c compared with lower doses. Metformin use in type 1 diabetes may not, however, reduce HbA 1c. Despite this, there may be other indications for treating type 1 diabetic patients with metformin because a reduction in insulin dose required in the metformin arm of these trials was observed consistent with metformin's role as an insulin sensitizer.

### A treatment strategy implementing combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin results in superior glycaemic control versus metformin monotherapy due to a low rate of addition of antihyperglycaemic agents [^1171LzyK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin has shown superior efficacy compared with metformin monotherapy. In this study, we compare two strategies: initial combination therapy with sitagliptin/metformin as a fixed-dose combination (FDC) and initial metformin monotherapy, with the option to add additional antihyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) in either treatment arm during the second phase of the study in order to reach adequate glycaemic control.

Methods

We evaluated the sitagliptin and metformin FDC compared with metformin monotherapy over 44 weeks in 1250 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a two-part, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The initial 18-week portion (Phase A) of this study in which additional AHAs were only allowed based on prespecified glycaemic criteria, has been previously reported. Here, we present results from the 26-week Phase B portion of the study during which double-blind study medication continued; however, unlike Phase A, during Phase B investigators were unmasked to results for haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and directed to manage glycaemic control by adding incremental AHA(s) as deemed clinically appropriate.

Results

There were 1250 patients randomized in the study with 965 completing Phase A and continuing in Phase B. Among patients receiving sitagliptin/metformin FDC or metformin monotherapy, 8.8% and 16.7% received additional AHA therapy, respectively. Although glycaemic therapy in both groups was to have been managed to optimize HbA1c reductions with the option for investigators to supplement with additional AHAs during Phase B, patients randomized to initial therapy with sitagliptin/metformin FDC had larger reductions of HbA1c from baseline compared with patients randomized to initial metformin monotherapy [least squares (LS) mean change: -2.3% and -1.8% (p < 0.001 for difference) for sitagliptin/metformin FDC and metformin monotherapy groups, respectively]. A significantly larger reduction in FPG from baseline was observed in the sitagliptin/metformin FDC group compared with the metformin monotherapy group (p = 0.001). Significantly more patients in the sitagliptin/metformin FDC group had an HbA1c of less than 7.0% or less than 6.5% compared with those on metformin monotherapy. Both treatment strategies were generally well tolerated, with a low and similar incidence of hypoglycaemia in both groups and lower incidences of abdominal pain and diarrhoea in the sitagliptin/metformin FDC group compared with the metformin monotherapy group.

Conclusions

A strategy initially implementing combination therapy with sitagliptin/metformin FDC was superior to a strategy initially implementing metformin monotherapy, even when accounting for the later addition of supplemental AHAs. Sitagliptin/metformin FDC was generally well tolerated.

### Therapeutic efficacy and safety of initial triple combination of metformin, sitagliptin, and lobeglitazone in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes: initial triple study [^11253UmQ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Among these 291 patients with T2D who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 100 who started initial triple combination therapy, metformin 1000 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day, and lobeglitazone 0.5 mg/day at baseline were selected consecutively for the initial triple therapy group. Using age (± 3 years) and body mass index (BMI) (± 2 kg/m²) matching, another 100 subjects who started glimepiride (2–6 mg/day) and metformin (1000–2000 mg/day) at baseline were selected as a conventional stepwise therapy group: initial doses of glimepiride and metformin were decided at the physician's discretion.

In the triple therapy group, if the HbA1c level was > 8.0% at 2 and 5 months, the metformin dose was recommended to increase by 25%–50% at the physician's discretion. If the HbA1c level was still > 7.0% at 8 months, the metformin dosage was recommended to be increased further at the physician's discretion. In the conventional group, if the HbA1c level was > 8.0% at 2 and 5 months, the metformin dose was increased by 25%–50% or the glimepiride dose was increased by 25%–50% if the metformin dose exceeded 2000 mg/day. If the HbA1c level was still > 7.0% at 8 months, the metformin dose was further increased up to 2500 mg/day and glimepiride up to 8 mg/day. However, actual doses of metformin and glimepiride were titrated at each visit according to physician's discretion.

A third antihyperglycemic agent was prescribed to patients with a high HbA1c level (> 9.0%) at the physician's discretion at any follow-up visit. At every visit, compliance to the medications was assessed using the pill counting method.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

### Metformin hydrochloride er (metformin hydrochloride) [^115eKBbd]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.

Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone.

Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride extended-release will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass. (See Patient Information printed separately.)

Recommended Dosing Schedule

Adults - In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms.

The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increment of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals.

### Should adults with prediabetes Be prescribed metformin to prevent… [^111ruk4g]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association definition of prediabetes now includes a threshold value in fasting glucose, two-hour glucose tolerance test, or A1C. This definition dramatically expands the number of people who meet the definition of prediabetes; one-third of Americans older than 18 years meet the criteria. 2 In addition, many people will be mislabeled as having prediabetes. Compared with the reference standard of an oral glucose tolerance test, a single A1C measurement is 49% sensitive and 79% specific for prediabetes. 3 Those advocating for pharmacologic intervention for threshold glucose values cite randomized controlled trials that show a lower incidence of diabetes with metformin treatment. The landmark 2002 Diabetes Prevention Program studied metformin vs. placebo medication vs.

a lifestyle modification program in patients without diabetes who had elevated fasting and postload plasma glucose levels. 5 This study showed a decreased incidence of diabetes at 2. 8 years. Using the ADA-defined threshold, 28. 9% in the placebo group,
21. 7% in the metformin group, and 14. 4% in the lifestyle group were diagnosed with diabetes at three years. At four years, the average A1C was 5. 9% in the metformin or lifestyle groups and
6. 1% in the placebo group. Although these surrogate outcome differences are statistically significant, they are not clinically meaningful. Treating borderline glucose values does not improve quality of life, mortality, or any other patient-oriented outcomes. 5, 6. It is unlikely that initiating metformin before diabetes is diagnosed improves outcomes compared with waiting for a formal diagnosis. When the clinically meaningful benefit of a treatment is marginal, harms become more important to consider.

Although metformin is inexpensive and simple to use, many patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting. 5 Long-term use is associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency. 7 Further, the labeling of patients with the diagnosis of prediabetes is an example of disease mongering (i.e., "the selling of sickness that widens the boundaries of illness in order to grow the markets for those who sell and deliver treatments".

### Effect of noninsulin antidiabetic drugs added to metformin therapy on glycemic control, weight gain, and hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes [^1124y8Lt]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Metformin is the recommended initial drug therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the optimal second-line drug when metformin monotherapy fails is unclear.

Objective

To determine the comparative efficacy, risk of weight gain, and hypoglycemia associated with noninsulin antidiabetic drugs in patients with type 2 DM not controlled by metformin alone.

Data Sources

A literature search via MEDLINE (beginning in January 1950) and Cochrane CENTRAL through January 2010 and a manual search of references for additional relevant studies.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least 3 months' duration, evaluating noninsulin antidiabetic drugs added to metformin in patients experiencing an inadequate response to maximized and stable (≥ 4 weeks at ≥ 1500 mg or maximally tolerated dose) metformin therapy.

Data Extraction

Inclusion/exclusion criteria; duration of patient follow-up; drug, dose, and schedule used; use of concurrent lifestyle modification; and baseline characteristics (age, sex, anthropometrics, glycated hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)], duration of DM, and metformin dose). End points collected included mean change in HbA(1c), proportion of patients achieving HbA(1c) goal of less than 7%, change in weight, and incidence of hypoglycemia. Mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis was used to calculate the weighted mean difference for changes from baseline in HbA(1c) and body weight and relative risk (RR) of HbA(1c) goal attainment and hypoglycemia, with associated 95% credible intervals.

Data Synthesis

Overall, 27 RCTs (n = 11 198) were included. Mean (range) trial duration was 32 (12–52) weeks. The different classes of drugs were associated with similar HbA(1c) reductions (range, 0.64%-0.97%) compared with placebo. Although use of thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and glinides were associated with weight gain (range, 1.77–2.08 kg), glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were associated with weight loss or no weight change. Sulfonylureas and glinides were associated with higher rates of hypoglycemia than with placebo (RR range, 4.57–7.50).

Conclusion

When added to maximal metformin therapy, all noninsulin antidiabetic drugs were associated with similar HbA(1c) reductions but differed in their associations with weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia.

### Glycaemic durability of an early combination therapy with vildagliptin and metformin versus sequential metformin monotherapy in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (VERIFY): a 5-year, multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial [^112xNyF9]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Early treatment intensification leading to sustained good glycaemic control is essential to delay diabetic complications. Although initial combination therapy has been suggested to offer more opportunities than a traditional stepwise approach, its validity remains to be determined.

Methods

Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with metfoRmIn For earlY treatment of type 2 diabetes (VERIFY) was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes conducted in 254 centres across 34 countries. The study consisted of a 2-week screening visit, a 3-week metformin-alone run-in period, and a 5-year treatment period, which was further split into study periods 1, 2, and 3. Patients aged 18–70 years were included if they had type 2 diabetes diagnosed within 2 years prior to enrolment, and centrally confirmed glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c) of 48–58 mmol/mol (6.5–7.5%) and a body-mass index of 22–40 kg/m². Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to the early combination treatment group or to the initial metformin monotherapy group, with the help of an interactive response technology system and simple randomisation without stratification. Patients, investigators, clinical staff performing the assessments, and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. In study period 1, patients received either the early combination treatment with metformin (stable daily dose of 1000 mg, 1500 mg, or 2000 mg) and vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily, or standard-of-care initial metformin monotherapy (stable daily dose of 1000 mg, 1500 mg, or 2000 mg) and placebo twice daily. If the initial treatment did not maintain HbA 1c below 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), confirmed at two consecutive scheduled visits which were 13 weeks apart, patients in the metformin monotherapy group received vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily in place of the placebo and entered study period 2, during which all patients received the combination therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomisation to initial treatment failure, defined as HbA 1c measurement of at least 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) at two consecutive scheduled visits, 13 weeks apart from randomisation through period 1. The full analysis set included patients who received at least one randomised study medication and had at least one post-randomisation efficacy parameter assessed. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of randomised study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01528254.

Findings

Trial enrolment began on March 30, 2012, and was completed on April 10, 2014. Of the 4524 participants screened, 2001 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the early combination treatment group (n = 998) or the initial metformin monotherapy group (n = 1003). A total of 1598 (79.9%) patients completed the 5-year study: 811 (81.3%) in the early combination therapy group and 787 (78.5%) in the monotherapy group. The incidence of initial treatment failure during period 1 was 429 (43.6%) patients in the combination treatment group and 614 (62.1%) patients in the monotherapy group. The median observed time to treatment failure in the monotherapy group was 36.1 (IQR 15.3-not reached [NR]) months, while the median time to treatment failure time for those receiving early combination therapy could only be estimated to be beyond the study duration at 61.9 (29.9-NR) months. A significant reduction in the relative risk for time to initial treatment failure was observed in the early combination treatment group compared with the monotherapy group over the 5-year study duration (hazard ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.45–0.58]; p < 0.0001). Both treatment approaches were safe and well tolerated, with no unexpected or new safety findings, and no deaths related to study treatment.

Interpretation

Early intervention with a combination therapy of vildagliptin plus metformin provides greater and durable long-term benefits compared with the current standard-of-care initial metformin monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Managing hyperglycemia and rash associated with alpelisib: expert consensus recommendations using the Delphi technique [^116RTGhL]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

In certain instances, patients may require combination anti-hyperglycemic therapy and/or holding alpelisib to manage hyperglycemia. For patients with FBG > 250 mg/dL (first episode), the panel recommended holding alpelisib, adding another anti-hyperglycemic agent to metformin, and an endocrinology consult. For patients with FBG > 500 mg/dL at second or later episodes who are on maximal non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic therapy, the panel recommended holding alpelisib, starting insulin, and an endocrinology consult, or permanent discontinuation of alpelisib. The hyperglycemia consensus treatment algorithms for managing the first and subsequent episodes of hyperglycemia as recommended by the expert panel are included in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

### Treatment escalation and rise in HbA1c following successful initial metformin therapy [^112dRGPL]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe secondary failure of initial metformin therapy in patients who achieved initial HbA(1c) (A1C) < 8% and to identify predictors of failure.

Research Design and Methods

We identified 1,288 patients who achieved A1C < 8% within 1 year of initiating metformin as their first-ever antihyperglycemic drug. Subjects were followed until they added/switched antihyperglycemics, they terminated health plan membership, or 31 December 2004. We defined secondary failure using two separate but overlapping approaches: 1) addition/switch to another antihyperglycemic drug or 2) first A1C measurement > 8.0% after at least 6 months on metformin.

Results

The best A1C achieved within 1 year of metformin initiation was the most powerful predictor of avoiding secondary failure. Approximately 50% of subjects whose best A1C was 7–7.9% added/switched antihyperglycemic drugs within 36 months, whereas it took > 60 months for those in the 6–6.9% A1C category to reach a 50% failure rate. Those who achieved an A1C < 6% did not reach a 50% rate of adding/switching drugs until 84 months. For the alternative secondary failure outcome, about half of those whose best A1C was 7.0–7.9% reached an A1C > 8% within 24 months. Only approximately 25% of subjects in the 6–6.9% category failed by 48 months, and > 80% of subjects in the < 6% category remained below 8% through 60 months.

Conclusions

Whether defined by adding/switching to another drug or by reaching an A1C of 8%, secondary failure is inversely associated with the reduction of A1C achieved within the 1st year of metformin monotherapy.

### Initial combination therapy with metformin and colesevelam for achievement of glycemic and lipid goals in early type 2 diabetes [^1178cyN9]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with metformin plus colesevelam in patients with early type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adults with type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c [A1C] values of 6.5% to 10.0%) and hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] levels ≥ 100 mg/dL) were randomly assigned (1:1) to colesevelam (3.75 g/d) or placebo in combination with open-label metformin (850 mg/d; uptitrated at week 2 to 1,700 mg/d). The primary efficacy evaluation was change in A1C from baseline to study end (week 16 with last observation carried forward).

Results

In total, 286 patients were randomized: metformin/colesevelam (n = 145) or metformin/placebo (n = 141). Mean A1C was reduced by 1.1% with metformin/colesevelam (from 7.8% at baseline to 6.6% at study end) and by 0.8% with metformin/placebo (from 7.5% to 6.7%), resulting in a treatment difference of -0.3% at study end (P = 0.0035). In addition, metformin/colesevelam significantly reduced LDL-C (-16.3%), total cholesterol (-6.1%), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-8.3%), apolipoprotein B (-8.0%), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-17%) and increased apolipoprotein A-I (+4.4%) and triglycerides (+18.6%) versus metformin/placebo (P < .01 for all). The proportions of patients who achieved recommended goals with metformin/colesevelam versus metformin/placebo, respectively, were as follows: A1C < 7.0% (67% versus 56% [P = 0.0092]), LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (48% versus 18% [P < .0001]), and composite A1C < 7.0% + LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (40% versus 12% [P < .0001]). Safety and tolerability were similar between the treatment groups.

Conclusion

Metformin plus colesevelam may be a valid option for initial therapy to achieve glycemic and lipid goals safely in early type 2 diabetes.

3.3 Dose distribution in prevalent users

Prevalent users of metformin received doses of > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (14%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (40%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (15%), > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (29%) or > 2000 mg (1%) daily (Figure 2 A). Their dose distribution varied substantially by HbA1c level and duration of T2DM, with subjects with HbA1c ≥ 64 mmol/mol (8.0%) and duration of disease ≥ 10 years more likely to receive doses > 1000 mg per day (Figure 2 B, C).

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116uxUym]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

At 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation, most new users had experienced no change in their treatment regimen; just 6.7% and 10.8% of new users had been up‐titrated, respectively (Figure S1). Rates of up‐titration were 5.5% in subjects with HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), 8.5% in those with HbA1c 53 to < 64 mmol/mol (7.0% to < 8.0%), 14.1% in those with HbA1c 64 to < 75 mmol/mol (8.0% to < 9.0%) and 14.8% in those with HbA1c ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%). Of the 667 subjects up‐titrated at 12 months, 39.0% had an HbA1c measurement ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) at initiation, whereas just 9.2% had HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (Table 2). The median time to up‐titration was 175 days, with a shallow trend towards longer times in subjects with lower HbA1c values (Table 2). Predictors of up‐titration in new users (Table 3) included younger age at 12 months postinitiation (eg OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.97‐7.58 for subjects aged < 50 versus ≥ 70) and higher HbA1c at both 6 months and 12 months (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.27‐4.41 at 12 months for HbA1c 64 to < 75 mmol/mol (8.0% to < 9.0%) vs < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%); OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.11‐3.86 at 12 months for HbA1c ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) versus < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%)). Triglyceride and HDL‐C levels were predictive of up‐titration at 6 months, but not at 12 months (Table 3).

Laboratory Tests

Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Thereafter, both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored. Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating long-term control (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis. While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin hydrochloride therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin B12 deficiency should be excluded.

Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Efficacy of glyburide / metformin tablets compared with initial monotherapy in type 2 diabetes [^112jDk7t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Many patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve or maintain the American Diabetes Association's recommended treatment goal of glycosylated hemoglobin levels. This multicenter, double-blind trial enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control [glycosylated hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C), > 7% and < 12%) with diet and exercise alone to compare the benefits of initial therapy with glyburide/metformin tablets vs. metformin or glyburide monotherapy. Patients (n = 486) were randomized to receive glyburide/metformin tablets (1.25/250 mg), metformin (500 mg), or glyburide (2.5 mg). Changes in A1C, fasting plasma glucose, fructosamine, serum lipids, body weight, and 2-h postprandial glucose after a standardized meal were assessed after 16 wk of treatment. Glyburide/metformin tablets caused a superior mean reduction in A1C from baseline (-2.27%) vs. metformin (-1.53%) and glyburide (-1.90%) monotherapy (P = 0.0003). Glyburide/metformin also significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose and 2-h postprandial glucose values compared with either monotherapy. The final mean doses of glyburide/metformin (3.7/735 mg) were lower than those of metformin (1796 mg) and glyburide (7.6 mg). First-line treatment with glyburide/metformin tablets provided superior glycemic control over component monotherapy, allowing more patients to achieve American Diabetes Association treatment goals with lower component doses in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes: a real-world study of 2-OAD regimens, GLP-1 RAs, or basal insulin [^114A4woA]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend individualized treatment to achieve control of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels soon after diagnosis. The ADA-recommended HbA1c goal for most people with diabetes is < 7.0%, while that from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology is ≤ 6.5%. Treatment strategies should be designed to attain and maintain goals to prevent or delay hyperglycemia-related complications. HbA1c targets may be achieved and maintained with a stepwise approach to treatment intensification, based on regular HbA1c testing to identify the need for additional therapy if treatment goals are not met. Often, the recommended first step in pharmaceutical treatment is metformin. Guidelines recommend that if a patient's HbA1c level is above goal after 3 months, a second agent should be added to metformin. The ADA recommends the addition of one of the following six available treatment options: sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or basal insulin. If the HbA1c goal is not achieved or the patient's glycemic control is not maintained with dual therapy, triple therapy can be initiated. For patients with marked hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥ 10.0%) at diagnosis, initial treatment with insulin may be considered. Combination injectable therapy comprising basal insulin plus preferably a GLP-1 RA or rapid-acting insulin (or a change to premixed insulin twice daily) is usually the next recommended step in the treatment course if HbA1c remains above target. The latest algorithm from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) recommends initiation with combination therapy rather than monotherapy in patients presenting with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% [if the HbA1c goal is ≤ 6.5%] and initiating treatment with insulin, with or without other agents, in symptomatic patients presenting with HbA1c > 9.0%. AACE/ACE recommends antihyperglycemic agents in descending order of preference.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^117SpZm5]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

### Comparative efficacy of dual and single initiation of add-on oral antihyperglycemic agents in type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin alone: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^112Hoqhy]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines recommend adding an oral antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) uncontrolled on metformin. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that adding dual AHAs instead of a single AHA provided more effective glycemic control. However, the comparative efficacy of approved single and dual initiation strategies is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of dual and single add-on oral AHAs in patients uncontrolled on metformin.

Methods

A systematic literature review of RCTs was conducted following Cochrane and ISPOR guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to November 19, 2019. Approved oral doses of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in single or dual initiation therapies were indirectly compared. Outcomes focused on efficacy and included mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and achieving HbA1c target < 7% at 24–26 weeks. Fixed and random effects models with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations were used.

Results

Of 1955 unique records screened, 25 RCTs (14,264 participants) were included. In patients uncontrolled on metformin, dual AHA added to metformin had statistically significant or a trend of greater reduction in HbA1c compared to single AHAs, with ertugliflozin+sitagliptin showing the greatest improvement. Statistically significant reductions in weight and SBP were observed with ertugliflozin+sitagliptin, ertugliflozin, or canagliflozin compared to single initiation DPP-4 inhibitors.

Conclusion

For reduction of HbA1c, weight, and SBP in patients uncontrolled on metformin, add-on dual AHAs showed greater improvement compared to single AHAs. These findings can further inform the treatment of T2DM patients uncontrolled on metformin.

### Double-blind, randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of early initiation of sitagliptin during metformin uptitration in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: the compoSIT-M study [^1126Rb8x]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To characterize the glycaemic efficacy and safety of initiation of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin during metformin dose escalation in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not at glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) goal on a sub-maximal dose of metformin.

Materials and Methods

Study participants with HbA1c ≥ 58 mmol/mol and ≤ 97 mmol/mol (≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11.0%) while on 1000mg/d metformin were randomized to sitagliptin 100mg once daily or placebo. All were to uptitrate metformin to 2000mg/d. A longitudinal data analysis model was used to test the primary hypothesis that sitagliptin is superior to placebo when initiated during uptitration of metformin in reducing HbA1c at week 20. [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02791490, EudraCT: 2015–004224–59] RESULTS: A total of 458 participants (mean HbA1c 71.1 mmol/mol [8.7%], T2D duration 6.3 years) were treated. After 20weeks, the least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were-12.1 mmol/mol (-14.0, -10.1) (-1.10% [-1.28, -0.93]) and -7.6 mmol/mol (-9.6, -5.6) (-0.69% [-0.88, -0.51]) with sitagliptin and placebo, respectively; the between-group difference in LS mean changes from baseline HbA1c was -4.5 mmol/mol (-6.5, -2.5) (-0.41% [-0.59, -0.23]); P < 0.001. The likelihood of having HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) at week 20 was higher in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group in the overall population (relative risk 1.7, P = 0.002) and in those with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 69 mmol/mol (≥ 8.5%) (relative risk 2.4, P = 0.026). There were no notable differences between groups with regard to adverse events overall, hypoglycaemia events, changes in body weight or other safety variables.

Conclusion

In participants not at HbA1c goal on a sub-maximal dose of metformin, addition of sitagliptin at the time of metformin dose uptitration improved glycaemic response and HbA1c goal attainment, with similar safety and tolerability, compared to metformin uptitration alone.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114vTAjw]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Characteristics of the study population

A total of 6,174 new users of metformin were identified during 2013‐2016 (Table 1). Their mean age was 61.7 years, and 42.7% were male. Just 17.9% of new users had an HbA1c level at the standard target of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). Obesity was highly prevalent (67.8%), and the median duration of T2DM was 0.04 years, indicating that most of these subjects were very recently diagnosed.

Table 1
Characteristics of new and prevalent metformin users a

Note

A total of 8733 prevalent users of metformin were identified during 2017 (Table 1). Their mean age was 64.4 years, and 57.0% were male. Just over half of prevalent users (51.0%) had met the HbA1C target of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), and 59.8% were obese. The median duration of T2DM was 3.1 years.

3.2 Dose distribution and up‐titration patterns in new users

New users initiated metformin at > 0 mg to ≤ 500 mg (25%), > 500 mg to ≤ 1000 mg (47%), > 1000 mg to ≤ 1500 mg (17%) or > 1500 mg to ≤ 2000 mg (12%) daily (Figure 1 A). This distribution did not vary over time (Figure 1 A), but varied substantially at initiation by HbA1c: 48% of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) received an initial daily dose of > 1000 mg, but only 14% of subjects with HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) did so (Figure 1 B). Given this variation by HbA1c level, we assessed whether the dose distribution differed over time in subjects who had not attained HbA1c targets of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and < 64 mmol/mol (8.0%) (Figure 1 C). In the subset of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), 39% received a metformin dose > 1000 mg at both 6 months and 12 months (compared to 31% of subjects in the combined study population at the same time points). In the subset of subjects with HbA1c ≥ 64 mmol/mol (8.0%), 48% received a metformin dose > 1000 mg at 6 months and 50% did so at 12 months.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^116nFQoS]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

A previous systematic review found lower rates of cardiovascular mortality in people randomized to metformin in six trials of > 11,000 patients. Compared with that review, our analysis has the disadvantage of using the surrogate outcome of glucose lowering, albeit a well-established surrogate on which treatment guidelines are based, but it has the advantage of an estimate based on more trials. This has allowed us to examine subgroups, such as monotherapy, combination oral therapy, and insulin therapy, and to establish a dose-response relationship.

This is the most comprehensive systematic review to date on the effect of metformin treatment on HbA 1c levels. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of metformin dose-comparison studies. Significant unexplained heterogeneity observed between the trials, however, is a limitation of this review and, consequently, results need to be treated with caution. Our searches identified 5 times more trials than a previous review, which examined the effect of metformin on glycemic control in seven trials. This is partly explained by the other reviewer's more stringent inclusion criteria, which included a minimum of 50 subjects in each arm of the trial and an explicit statement that informed consent was obtained. Inclusion of a larger number of trials has made it possible to separately analyze data from metformin monotherapy, oral combination therapy, and insulin trials. The greatest reduction in HbA 1c in our analysis was 1.1%, which is at the low end of the 1–2% estimated by Nathan et al. The results of our review suggest that these estimated reductions are most likely to be achieved with the highest metformin doses. Previous trials that compared different metformin doses from various trials could not establish a dose-effect relationship of metformin. By including head-to-head trials of metformin in our systematic review, we clearly demonstrate the benefit of using a higher metformin dose to maximize HbA 1c reduction, although there may be an associated increase in gastric side effects. We have not been able to demonstrate a relationship between baseline HbA 1c and change in HbA 1c with treatment observed in other systematic reviews. A previous systematic review of 61 trials of oral glucose-lowering therapy found an association between baseline HbA 1c and the change in HbA 1c on treatment, but metformin was a randomized therapy in only seven of these trials. We were not able to find such a relationship in 15 trials of metformin monotherapy, 12 trials of metformin in combination with oral therapy, and 13 trials of metformin in combination with insulin. However, our analysis is based on metaregression, which compares mean values across trials. The best data to address this question would make comparisons between individuals. These results, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution.

Participants

Between May 6, 2020 and March 1, 2022, 304 of 335 participants were enrolled in this trial. Inclusion criteria encompassed the following: (1) individuals with T2DM aged between 18 and 65 years; (2) body mass index (BMI) ranging from 19 to 45 kg/m 2; (3) undergoing monotherapy with metformin of 750–1500 mg with poor glycemic control (7.5 ≤ glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≤ 10%, or fasting blood glucose [FBG] of ≥ 7 and ≤ 13.9 mmol/l). Exclusion criteria included: (1) intolerance of a daily 1500 mg of metformin; (2) a history of hypertension: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 180 mmHg and/or Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 110 mmHg; (3) a history of severe cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, chronic pulmonary disease, or chronic gastrointestinal disease; (4) pregnant women. The flow of screening and recruitment of study subjects is presented in Fig. 1. Patients were 1:1 assigned to two groups stratified in blocks by the baseline HbA1c (< or ≥ 8.5%). Randomization was performed centrally with an interactive web response system. All patients were fully aware of their physical condition, disease diagnosis, treatment protocol, and potential risks and complications throughout the study.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^1124WYZ9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride.

Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients

The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride therapy. Metformin hydrochloride therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2500 mg for metformin hydrochloride. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response.

Specific Patient Populations

Metformin hydrochloride is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients below the age of 10 years.

The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride.

Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. (See WARNINGS .)

### Metformin hydrochloride [^1164cFxF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age).

Metformin hydrochloride should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin hydrochloride should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.

During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113FraVS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, this study of UK adults with T2DM showed that dosing of metformin monotherapy is often suboptimal and that up‐titration is infrequent. Metformin dosing and up‐titration were highly dependent on HbA1c levels, but remained suboptimal even in subjects with HbA1c levels above the recommended targets. Given the popularity of metformin as a first‐line treatment for T2DM, and its demonstrated efficacy at the recommended doses, providers should be encouraged to optimize the metformin dose, and patients should be made aware of the impact of tolerability and adherence issues on glycaemic control.

### Initial therapy with the fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin and metformin results in greater improvement in glycaemic control compared with pioglitazone monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116yytPg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of sitagliptin and metformin compared with pioglitazone in drug-naÏve patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c of 7.5–12% and not on antihyperglycaemic agent therapy were randomized in a double-blind manner to initial treatment with a FDC of sitagliptin/metformin 50/500 mg twice daily (N = 261) or pioglitazone 30 mg per day (N = 256). Sitagliptin/metformin and pioglitazone were up-titrated over 4 weeks to doses of 50/1000 mg twice daily and 45 mg per day, respectively. Both treatments were then continued for an additional 28 weeks.

Results

From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.9% in both groups, least squares (LS) mean changes in HbA1c at week 32 were -1.9 and -1.4% for sitagliptin/metformin and pioglitazone, respectively (between-group difference = -0.5%; p < 0.001). A greater proportion of patients had an HbA1c of < 7% at week 32 with sitagliptin/metformin vs. pioglitazone (57% vs. 43%, p < 0.001). Compared with pioglitazone, sitagliptin/metformin treatment resulted in greater LS mean reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [-56.0 mg/dl (-3.11 mmol/l) vs. -44.0 mg/dl (-2.45 mmol/l), p < 0.001] and in 2-h post-meal glucose [-102.2 mg/dl (-5.68 mmol/l) vs. -82.0 mg/dl (-4.56 mmol/l), p < 0.001] at week 32. A substantially greater reduction in FPG [-40.5 mg/dl (-2.25 mmol/l) vs. -13.0 mg/dl (-0.72 mmol/l), p < 0.001] was observed at week 1 with sitagliptin/metformin vs. pioglitazone. A greater reduction in the fasting proinsulin/insulin ratio and a greater increase in homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) were observed with sitagliptin/metformin than with pioglitazone, while greater decreases in fasting insulin and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and a greater increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were observed with pioglitazone than with sitagliptin/metformin. Both sitagliptin/metformin and pioglitazone were generally well tolerated. Sitagliptin/metformin led to weight loss (-1.4 kg), while pioglitazone led to weight gain (3.0 kg) (p < 0.001 for the between-group difference). Higher incidences of diarrhoea (15.3% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001), nausea (4.6% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.02) and vomiting (1.9% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.026), and a lower incidence of oedema (1.1% vs. 7.0%, p < 0.001), were observed with sitagliptin/metformin vs. pioglitazone. The between-group difference in the incidence of hypoglycaemia did not reach statistical significance (8.4 and 4.3% with sitagliptin/metformin and pioglitazone, respectively; p = 0.055).

Conclusion

Compared with pioglitazone, initial therapy with a FDC of sitagliptin and metformin led to significantly greater improvement in glycaemic control as well as a higher incidence of prespecified gastrointestinal adverse events, a lower incidence of oedema and weight loss vs. weight gain.

In a 20-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter U.S. clinical study, involving 806 drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes, whose hyperglycemia was not adequately controlled with dietary management alone (baseline fasting plasma glucose [FPG] below 240 mg/dL, baseline hemoglobin A1c[HbA1c] between 7% and 11%), were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 2.5 mg glyburide, 500 mg metformin HCl, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 1.25 mg/250 mg, or glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 2.5 mg/500 mg. After 4 weeks, the dose was progressively increased to a maximum of 4 tablets daily as needed to reach a target FPG of 126 mg/dL. Study data at 20 weeks are summarized in Table 5.

Mean baseline body weight was 87 kg, 87 kg, 89 kg, 89 kg and 87 kg in the placebo, glyburide 2.5mg, metformin 500mg, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 1.25mg/250mg and 2.5mg/500mg arms, respectively. Mean change in body weight from baseline to week 20 was -0.7 kg, +1.7 kg, -0.6 kg, +1.4 kg and +1.9 in the placebo, glyburide, metformin, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 1.25mg/250mg and 2.5mg/500mg arms, respectively.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^117WzJKy]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

### Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin and metformin as initial combination therapy and as monotherapy over 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114z96MW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the 104-week efficacy and safety of sitagliptin and metformin as initial combination therapy and as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA(1c) 7.5–11%) on diet and exercise.

Methods

This study was a 50-week, double-blind extension of a 54-week, randomized, double-blind, factorial study of the initial combination of sitagliptin and metformin, metformin monotherapy and sitagliptin monotherapy (104 weeks total duration). Patients assigned to active therapy in the 54-week base study remained on those treatments in the extension study: sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. + metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. (higher dose combination), sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. + metformin 500 mg b.i.d. (lower dose combination), metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. (higher dose), metformin 500 mg b.i.d. (lower dose) and sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. Patients randomized to receive the sequence of placebo/metformin were switched, in a blinded manner, from placebo to metformin monotherapy uptitrated to 1000 mg b.i.d. beginning at week 24 and remained on higher dose metformin through the extension.

Results

Amongst patients who entered the extension study without having initiated glycaemic rescue therapy, least-squares mean changes in HbA(1c) from baseline at week 104 were -1.7% (higher dose combination), -1.4% (lower dose combination), -1.3% (higher dose), -1.1% (lower dose) and -1.2% (sitagliptin). The proportions of patients with an HbA(1c) < 7% at week 104 were 60% (higher dose combination), 45% (lower dose combination), 45% (higher dose), 28% (lower dose) and 32% (sitagliptin). Fasting and postmeal measures of glycaemic control and beta-cell function improved in all groups, with glycaemic responses generally maintained over the 104-week treatment period. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low across all groups. The incidences of gastrointestinal adverse experiences were generally lower in the sitagliptin group and similar between the metformin monotherapy and combination groups.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin and monotherapy with either drug alone provided substantial and sustained glycaemic improvements and were well tolerated over 104 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes (PDM) guideline (2014) [^116Hnok9]. AND (2014). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care, 2014 — Prevention/Delay of Type 2 Diabetes recommendations state that patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (A), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (A), or an A1C of 5.7% to 6.4% (E) should be referred to an ongoing support program targeting weight loss of 7% of body weight and increasing physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity such as walking; follow-up counseling appears to be important for success (B) and such programs should be covered by third-party payers (B). Metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes may be considered in those with IGT (A), IFG (E) or an A1C of 5.7% to 6.4% (E), especially for those with BMI more than 35kg/m², age less than 60 years and women with prior GDM (A). At least annual monitoring for the development of diabetes in those with prediabetes is suggested (E), and screening for and treatment of modifiable risk factors for CVD is suggested (B).

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^115FFRJV]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Combination therapy thresholds and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are specified: "For newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an A1C ≥ 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, one should initiate, along with lifestyle modifications, oral possibly triple combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin and considering basal insulin". When there are "significant symptoms of hyperglycemia" or "a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels (≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]), insulin is recommended". Metformin can be combined with other agents, but clinicians should "avoid its use in persons with CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) or GI intolerance".

### Adding saxagliptin to metformin extended release (XR) or uptitration of metformin XR: efficacy on daily glucose measures [^1118Uxy2]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), long-term control of blood glucose levels is necessary to help prevent the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) recommend that glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) be maintained at < 7.0% in most patients but be compatible with the patient's preferences, needs, and values, in line with the goal of providing patient-centered care. Guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) recommend a stringent HbA 1c target of 6.5%. HbA 1c is influenced by increases in daily measures of glucose levels including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial glucose (PPG), which are discrete values for measures of daily glucose levels. In addition, rapid daily fluctuations in glucose levels have been implicated as particularly important in contributing to diabetes-related complications. Because average daily glucose measurements are strongly correlated with HbA 1c and are important parameters for physicians to make therapeutic decisions, and because patients understand FPG and PPG better than HbA 1c, estimation of mean daily glucose parameters is critical. Twenty-four hour mean weighted glucose (MWG) can be used to provide an indication of the mean glucose exposure of the body over an entire day.

The ADA/EASD position statement recommends combination therapy when HbA 1c goals are not achieved or maintained during approximately 3 months with monotherapy. However, uptitration of monotherapy is often practiced rather than addition of another agent, which is delayed by an average 27–35 months. The ADA/EASD and AACE/ACE recommend metformin as first-line drug therapy for T2DM. Metformin is a biguanide that helps maintain glycemic control by suppressing glucose production by the liver. Gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) are the most common adverse events reported with metformin monotherapy, although the incidence is lower with metformin extended release (XR) versus metformin immediate release (IR).

Because T2DM is a progressive disease associated with worsening hyperglycemia, intensification of treatment over time through combination therapy typically becomes necessary for most patients to maintain glycemic goals. After metformin is used, various strategies to achieve glycemic control can be applied. Antidiabetic medications with complementary mechanisms of action and differing safety and tolerability profiles can help improve glycemic outcomes with greater tolerability compared with uptitration of a single antihyperglycemic agent to the maximum dose.

### Assessment of AACE / ACE recommendations for initial dual antihyperglycemic therapy using the fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin and metformin versus metformin [^1121K2gX]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) diabetes algorithm recommends a stratified approach to initial therapy to achieve a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) goal of ≤ 6.5% in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have inadequate glycemic control. Data from a double-blind study in drug-naïve T2DM patients comparing initial monotherapy with metformin (MET) with initial dual therapy with a fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin and MET (SITA/MET FDC) was used to determine AACE/ACE HbA1c goal attainment in these treatment groups.

Methods

A total of 1,250 patients (mean baseline HbA1c = 9.9%) were randomized 1:1 to SITA/MET FDC 50/500 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) or MET 500 mg b.i.d. for 18 weeks. SITA/MET FDC and MET were uptitrated over 4 weeks to 50/1,000 mg b.i.d. and 1,000 mg b.i.d., respectively.

Results

At week 18, a higher percentage of patients receiving SITA/MET FDC had HbA1c levels ≤ 6.5% and < 7% than those receiving MET alone within each of the 3 AACE/ACE HbA1c categories (6.5–7.5%, > 7.5–9.0%, and > 9.0%). Of patients with a baseline HbA1c > 7.5–9.0% who initiated SITA/MET FDC, 48.6% achieved an HbA1c ≤ 6.5% at week 18 compared with 23.1% of patients who initiated MET monotherapy (P < .001). In patients with a baseline HbA1c > 9.0%, 24.0% on SITA/MET FDC achieved an HbA1c ≤ 6.5% compared with 12.8% on MET alone (P < .001).

Conclusion

In T2DM patients with a baseline HbA1c > 7.5–9.0%, substantially more achieved the HbA1c goal of ≤ 6.5% with initial dual therapy (SITA/MET FDC) than with initial monotherapy (MET), which is in agreement with the AACE/ACE diabetes algorithm.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115VDXye]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

While the patterns and consequences of intensification of T2DM therapy have been well characterized globally, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 studies examining up‐titration of metformin in the real‐world clinical setting are lacking. The Summary of Product Characteristics from the European Medicines Agency recommends a starting dose of 500 or 850 mg metformin 2‐3 times daily, with a maximum daily dose of 3000 mg, 9, 17 but studies of intensification after metformin monotherapy generally do not report the final titrated dose of metformin before adding on or switching therapies. 11, 18, 19 Since metformin has demonstrated efficacy at lowering HbA1c when given at 1500‐2000 mg/day, 20 the question remains whether metformin treatment sometimes fails because of inadequate dose optimization. The objective of this study was thus to assess the dose distribution of metformin monotherapy, as well as the patterns and predictors of up‐titration following initiation of metformin, among people with T2DM in the United Kingdom.

### Early glycemic response predicts achievement of subsequent treatment targets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis [^116NkGuv]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

American Diabetes Association consensus guidelines emphasize individualized treatment in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Early glycemic response is a clinical marker that may predict longer term efficacy for individual patients and provide a clinical tool to enhance personalized treatment. This analysis evaluated whether glycemic response measured at week 12 ("early") could serve as a reliable predictor of glycemic control at weeks 24 and 52 of therapy in patients with T2DM.

Methods

We used data from 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials that evaluated patients with T2DM treated with 3 commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medications: metformin (n = 597), sulfonylurea (n = 626), and insulin glargine (n = 1046). The gradient boosting method was used to identify predictors of subsequent response; predictive accuracy was represented by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Treatment success at weeks 24 and 52 was assessed for each patient and defined as achieving a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of < 7.0% or a reduction from baseline of ≥ 1.0%.

Results

The predictive parameters (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV) for improvements in HbA1c at week 24 for metformin were 0.83, 0.81, 0.44, and 0.96; for sulfonylurea, 0.79, 0.94, 0.71, and 0.96; and for insulin glargine, 0.67, 0.89, 0.65, and 0.90. The predictive parameters for improvements in HbA1c at week 52 for metformin were 0.73, 0.84, 0.56, and 0.92 and for sulfonylurea, 0.45, 0.94, 0.74, and 0.82.

Conclusion

High predictive values identified in this analysis support "early" response as an appropriate tool for predicting treatment success at weeks 24 and 52. The high NPV (lack of early glycemic response) appears to be an effective indicator of the likely need for change in (or intensification of) therapy. These data support the current guideline recommendations that clinicians evaluate therapeutic responses to pharmacologic interventions with metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin glargine as early as week 12.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults-2024 update [^114yCGpj]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, metformin, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic medication due to its durable efficacy in lowering HbA1c, negligible risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain, relatively mild side effect profile, long-term track record, and affordability.

### The effect of oral diabetes medications on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in Asians in primary care: a retrospective cohort real-world data study [^117J3nmW]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The investigator first identified and collated all pairs of index prescriptions in the "Titrators' cohort". The unique sets of OAD titrations, which consisted of a corresponding pair of initial OAD dose and new OAD dose, were then extracted. An example of an OAD titration is metformin 500 to 1000mg. For each unique OAD titration, the pre-HbA1c indicated the latest glycemic control within 1 year before the OAD dose adjustment and the post-HbA1c reflected the glycemic control beyond 12 weeks to 1 year after the OAD titration. The HbA1c values measured within 12 weeks of titration of an OAD were excluded. This 12-week window was used as HbA1c values are derived from irreversible glucose binding on erythrocytes which have a lifespan of about 90 days, thus reflecting glycemic control over the past 3 months. It is also consistent with clinical trials for OAD typically have a minimum 12-week follow-up to assess HbA1c lowering efficacy. The 1 year limitation concurred with the recommendation to perform panel tests annually for patients with T2DM based on local clinical practice guidelines.

Since patients could have multiple OAD titrations, a HbA1c value could serve both as the post-HbA1c for one titration, as well as the pre-HbA1c for a subsequent titration (Fig. 1). In order to isolate the HbA1c change to each individual OAD titration, we excluded instances where there were multiple titrations (of the OAD of interest, other OADs or insulin) within the 1-year period after the OAD titration of interest.

Fig. 1
This figure illustrates the data processing to identify HbA1c pairs for patients in "Titrators" group. To obtain the HbA1c value before OAD titration (pre_HbA1c) and after OAD titration (post_HbA1c) for the analysis, an OAD titration is first identified. In the figure, two OAD titrations (C1 and C2) were identified for the patient (P01). For each OAD titration, the pre_HbA1c is taken to be the most recent HbA1c result within one year before an OAD titration, while the post_HbA1c is the first HbA1c value within twelve weeks to one year after the OAD titration. Abbreviations: C1 = first OAD titration, C2 = second OAD titration, P01 = illustrative patient, pre_HbA1c = HbA1c before OAD titration; post_HbA1c = HbA1c after the OAD titration

### Secondary failure of metformin monotherapy in clinical practice [^111cxdpz]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this observational cohort study of 1,799 patients who lowered their A1C to below 7% using metformin monotherapy as their first-ever anti-hyperglycemic agent, we found that initiating metformin within 3 months of diabetes diagnosis was associated with a substantial reduction in the odds of secondary loss of glycemic control. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that early initiation of metformin preserves β-cell function and supports the current ADA/EASD hyperglycemia treatment algorithm, which recommends metformin therapy as soon as type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. We also found that lower A1C at treatment initiation was independently associated with a reduced risk of secondary failure. Importantly, only subjects with the shortest diabetes duration (0–3 months) and the lowest baseline A1C (< 7%) benefited; overlapping confidence intervals among the other categories of duration and A1C suggested no difference in the probability of failure.

Of metformin initiators, 42% experienced secondary failure within a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months (2 years and 2 months). This equates to an annual failure rate of 17%, substantially greater than the 4% per year reported in ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial). ADOPT defined failure as fasting plasma glucose > 180 mg/dl, a level that correlates to an A1C of ∼8%, whereas we used an A1C cut point of 7.5%. We also included the addition or substitution of other anti-hyperglycemic agents within our definition of failure. Metformin monotherapy might therefore be less durable than the experience of highly screened volunteers treated by research physicians would suggest. Discrepancies between real-world "effectiveness" studies and trials of clinical efficacy are not uncommon. In addition, our results are consistent with one prior observational study of untreated patients with A1C < 7.0% that similarly found that lower baseline A1C and younger age were the major independent predictors of progression (A1C ≥ 7% or initiation of therapy). We also note that sensitivity analyses examining the two definitions of failure independently, and alternative A1C thresholds of 7 and 8%, did not change our results.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^114ngiEQ]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Initial insulin titration protocol — suspected type 2 diabetes (T2D) directs early testing and stepwise therapy as follows: Order pancreatic autoantibodies at diagnosis and if + add MDI. Is patient already on MDI? If yes: Stop short-acting insulin; ensure initial long-acting dose is optimized (0.5 units/kg); and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily, and check BG 2x daily (fasting, post-prandial). If no: Is HbA1c ≥ 8.5% OR ketosis present; if yes: Start long-acting (LA) insulin (0.5 units/kg) and start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily; if no: Start metformin, to be titrated to 2000 mg daily over 4 weeks. Use post-prandial glucoses to guide changes in eating, adding medications, etc. Reassess: Is patient on maximally tolerated dose metformin? If yes: Increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 126 mg/dl; if no: Continue to increase metformin and increase LA insulin by 5–10 units if FBG ≥ 200 mg/dl. If difficulty tolerating metformin, try extended release or consider switching to pioglitazone 30 mg daily.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113mxqLA]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Biguanides

Metformin is the only biguanide available, and one of the oldest treatments for diabetes, dating back to the 1960s. Metformin reduces gluconeogenesis in the liver, lessening the amount of glucose released by the liver, particularly overnight. Additionally it increases the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin, improving peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Due to its mode of action, metformin rarely causes hypoglycemia.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence pathway for blood-glucose-lowering therapy for type 2 diabetes recommends that metformin is initiated as first-line therapy in asymptomatic patients with a HbA1c greater than 48 mmol/mol, or higher than an agreed individualized target despite changes to lifestyle. Metformin should be commenced with a starting dose of 500 mg once daily after food with active titration over a 4-week period to the maximum tolerated dose or maximum dose of 2 g daily. Adopting this approach reduces the common side effects of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Slow-release preparation of metformin could be trialed if side effects mean that standard release preparations cannot be tolerated.

If renal function declines below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², a dose review should occur, with a maximum dose of 1 g being prescribed. Metformin should be discontinued in patients whose eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Due to an increased risk of lactic acidosis if a sudden deterioration in renal function occurs, metformin should be withheld prior to general anesthesia, procedures requiring contrast medium, and episodes of acute deterioration in eGFR until the renal function normalizes. Dehydration increases the risk of deterioration in renal function; therefore, patients should be aware that they should stop taking metformin if they become unwell with diarrhea and vomiting.

Sulfonylureas

Commonly prescribed sulfonylureas include glimepiride and gliclazide; their mode of action requires a degree of beta-cell function, as they stimulate the pancreas to increase insulin secretion and as a result have a significant risk of inducing hypoglycemia and can potentially cause weight gain. NICE 2015 recommends their use as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients, and should be titrated weekly whilst osmotic symptoms are present based on blood glucose self-monitoring results. Prescribing sulfonylureas in the elderly population and in people who drive requires caution because of the associated risk of hypoglycemia.

### Effect of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and metformin on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes [^115Kmkds]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise.

Research Design and Methods

In a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 1,091 patients with type 2 diabetes and A1C 7.5–11% were randomized to one of six daily treatments: sitagliptin 100 mg/metformin 1,000 mg (S100/M1000 group), sitagliptin 100 mg/metformin 2,000 mg (S100/M2000 group), metformin 1,000 mg (M1000 group), metformin 2,000 mg (M2000 group) (all as divided doses administered twice daily [b.i.d.]), sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. (S100 group), or placebo. Patients who had an A1C > 11% or a fasting glucose value > 280 mg/dl after the run-in period were not eligible to be randomized; these patients could participate in an open-label substudy and were treated with S100/M2000 for 24 weeks.

Results

The mean baseline A1C was 8.8% in the randomized patients. The placebo-subtracted A1C change from baseline was -2.07% (S100/M2000), -1.57% (S100/M1000), -1.30% (M2000), -0.99% (M1000), and -0.83% (S100) (P < 0.001 for comparisons versus placebo and for coadministration versus respective monotherapies). The proportion of patients achieving an A1C < 7% and < 6.5% was 66 and 44%, respectively, in the S100/M2000 group (P < 0.001 vs. S100 or M2000). For the open-label cohort (n = 117; baseline A1C 11.2%) treated with S100/M2000, the within-group mean A1C change from baseline was -2.9%. The incidence of hypoglycemia was low (0.5–2.2%) across active treatment groups and not significantly different from that in the placebo group (0.6%). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse experiences was similar for coadministration therapies compared with their respective metformin monotherapy.

Conclusions

The initial combination of sitagliptin and metformin provided substantial and additive glycemic improvement and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Early combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycemic control to HbA1c ≤ 6.5% without increasing hypoglycemia: pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^116FnT3B]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

CAROLINA and CARMELINA are among the wave of cardiovascular outcomes trials of glucose-lowering drugs over the past decade that have influenced clinical guidelines. Based on the results of these studies, the latest joint consensus report from the ADA and EASD recommends that patients with indicators of high cardiovascular risk, established cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease receive second-line treatment with a glucose-lowering drug that has proven cardiovascular benefit, such as an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist. For others, the consensus report recommends DPP-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, as one of the options to add to metformin when there is a compelling need to avoid hypoglycemia.

Clinical guidelines differ in their recommendations for when to consider initial combination therapy. The ADA suggests that patients who have HbA1c ≥ 1.5% above their glycemic target at the time of diagnosis should start with combination therapy; this would equate in most cases to a HbA1c of ≥ 8.5% or ≥ 8.0% based on the ADA targets of HbA1c < 7.0% for most patients and HbA1c of < 6.5% for certain other patients. In contrast, the AACE guidelines suggest HbA1c ≥ 7.5% as the level at which combination therapy should be initiated. Results from our analysis support the AACE recommendation as, compared with monotherapy, significantly more patients receiving initial combination treatment achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% if they had a baseline HbA1c between 7.5 and 9.0%. However, in patients with baseline HbA1c > 9.0%, although combination therapy numerically improved the proportion achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, the majority still did not reach this target — not unexpectedly, given the high baseline level; adding another OAD or insulin to the combination therapy may be considered for such patients, as suggested by the AACE guidelines. The ADA treatment guidelines suggest considering the early introduction of insulin for patients with HbA1c > 10%. Finally, in patients with baseline HbA1c < 7.5% in our study, the linagliptin/metformin combination was more efficacious than metformin monotherapy for achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.5% or < 7.0% only at the higher dose of metformin (1000 mg), but the majority of patients with baseline HbA1c < 7.5% in all treatment groups achieved these targets. Future guidelines on initial combination therapy are also likely to be impacted by the recent 5-year VERIFY study, in which initial combination treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin and metformin in newly diagnosed T2D patients with HbA1c 6.5–7.5% provided greater and more durable glycemic control than metformin monotherapy.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by a combination of insulin insensitivity in muscle and liver and suboptimal insulin production by pancreatic β‐cells. 1 These insulin‐related defects result in elevated blood glucose, or hyperglycaemia, which in turn has detrimental effects on the vasculature, leading to both macrovascular complications (eg coronary artery disease) and microvascular complications (eg diabetic retinopathy). 2 The primary aim of treating T2DM is to control blood glucose levels, with the goal of preventing these vascular complications.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 8.8% of adults worldwide have diabetes; this number ranges from 3.8% in Africa to 11.5% in North America and the Caribbean. 3 As of 2014, 5.3% of people aged 16 or older in the United Kingdom had T2DM. 4 International guidelines including those from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes, 5 the International Diabetes Federation 6 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 7 recommend metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy. Both the US Food and Drug Administration 8 and the European Medicines Agency 9 note the need to up‐titrate metformin, that is, to gradually increase the dose, over the first several weeks. In the NICE guidance, treatment with metformin is considered successful if, after dose optimization, the patient's glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is maintained at or below the desired level (typically 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or 53 mmol/mol (7.0%)). 7 If HbA1c levels are not maintained on metformin, intensification of therapy by adding a second drug or switching to another drug is recommended. Intensification occurs in over 50% of patients in the United Kingdom. 10

International Guideline Recommendations for the Initiation and Titration of Basal Insulin

Recommendations on the initiation and titration of basal insulin can be found in several international clinical practice guidelines. The 2017 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) comprehensive diabetes management algorithm specifies that basal insulin can be initiated in patients with T2DM with an entry HbA 1c level < 7.5% when either monotherapy with metformin or other OADs, or dual therapy with metformin and other agents, fails to achieve the glycemic target (HbA 1c < 7%). The guidelines also indicate that basal insulin can be initiated as a part of dual therapy with metformin in patients with entry HbA 1c ≥ 7.5%, or when a patient presents with a HbA 1c level > 9.0% (dual or triple therapy with metformin) and symptomatic hyperglycemia at entry. The 2015 diabetes clinical practice guidelines from the AACE/ACE acknowledged that the traditional postponement of insulin therapy after prolonged failure of lifestyle management and OADs to achieve glycemic control has been revised in the past decade, and recommended that basal insulin therapy should be initiated much sooner, and often in combination with OADs. The ADA's updated Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2017 states the importance of dose titration of any insulin regimen once initiated, and that dose adjustments should be based on prevailing BG levels, together with knowledge of the pharmacodynamic profile of the insulin used. The ADA recommends that if the HbA 1c target (< 7%) is not achieved after 3 months of monotherapy with metformin, combination therapy of basal insulin with metformin, amongst other options, should be considered. The 2015 position statement from the ADA/EASD emphasizes that insulin has the advantage of being effective where other agents may not be, and should be considered a part of any combination regimen when hyperglycemia is severe, particularly if the patient is symptomatic. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommends the initiation of basal insulin after the failure of combination therapy with metformin and other OADs, and the titration of insulin using a self-titration regimen, or with at least biweekly contact with a HCP. Table 1 highlights key recommendations regarding the initiation and titration of basal insulin from several international guidelines.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^113FKP27]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Considerations

Dosage of GLUCOVANCE must be individualized
on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum
recommended daily dose of 20 mg glyburide/2000 mg metformin. GLUCOVANCE
should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual
dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely
due to glyburide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and
permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of
blood glucose for the individual patient.

With initial
treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring
should be used to determine the therapeutic response to GLUCOVANCE and to
identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1cshould
be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness
of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to
decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1cto normal or as near normal
as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c(glycosylated
hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than
FPG alone.

No studies have been performed specifically
examining the safety and efficacy of switching to GLUCOVANCE therapy in patients
taking concomitant glyburide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes
in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia
or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should
be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.

GLUCOVANCE in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise

Recommended starting dose: 1.25
mg/250 mg once or twice daily with meals.

For
patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily
managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of GLUCOVANCE
is 1.25 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. As initial therapy in patients with
baseline HbA1c > 9% or an FPG > 200 mg/dL,
a starting dose of GLUCOVANCE 1.25 mg/250 mg twice daily with the morning
and evening meals may be used. Dosage increases should be made in increments
of 1.25 mg/250 mg per day every 2 weeks
up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of
blood glucose. In clinical trials of GLUCOVANCE as initial therapy, there
was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg/2000 mg per day. GLUCOVANCE
5 mg/500 mg should not be used as initial
therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^112dHfyA]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes algorithm — early combination and escalation: For T2D with A1C > 7.5%, early combination therapy may also be considered with metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia. Clinicians should be cognizant that combination of incretin therapies is not recommended. Antihyperglycemic medications should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose and additional agents should be considered in a timely fashion to avoid therapeutic inertia. If the A1C is > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, ≥ 2 antihyperglycemic agents may need to be initiated at once.

### Genetic variation in the multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 transporter protein influences the glucose-lowering effect of metformin in patients with diabetes: a preliminary study [^114gK6Vo]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

All participants in the Rotterdam Study, who were incident metformin users in the period between 1 April 1997 and 1 January 2008, were included in this analysis. Incident metformin use was defined as a first-dispensed prescription for metformin in the database, which included all prescriptions from 1 January 1991 onwards. The study sample consisted of all incident metformin users who had a measurement of A1C both in the period of 90 days before the first prescription of metformin and in the period between 30 and 120 days following the first prescription of metformin. Patients who discontinued metformin therapy before the first measurement after 30 days were excluded. We also excluded patients who were coprescribed acarbose, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, or insulin at the time of one of the two A1C measurements because defined daily doses for these drugs are not similar and these patients most likely differ in their severity of disease. Patients using sulfonylurea were not excluded.

Outcomes.

The aim of antihyperglycemic therapy is to reduce plasma glucose levels. The A1C level is the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is glycosylated and represents the average glucose level in the preceding period of time. Since the A1C level is a more stable measurement of glycemic control than plasma glucose levels, A1C levels are used more frequently for long-term therapeutic purposes. We analyzed the association between genetic variation in the SLC47A1 gene and difference in A1C level between the last A1C measurement before start of metformin therapy and the first A1C measurement after 30 days of metformin therapy. The target level for diabetic patients is an A1C level < 7%.

Cofactors.

Characteristics considered as potential determinants affecting the change in A1C level were age, sex, the A1C level at the last measurement before start of metformin, the daily prescribed dose of metformin at the time of the first measurement after start, the change in daily prescribed dose of sulfonylurea, the time from diabetes diagnosis to start of metformin therapy, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate. To make the prescribed doses of different sulfonylurea comparable with each other, we divided the prescribed daily dose by the defined daily dose. The defined daily dose is a standardized dosing measure representing the recommended daily dose for the main indication in an adult. For the diabetes diagnosis, the World Health Organization definition was used. If patients were diagnosed with diabetes before entrance in the Rotterdam Study, the date of entrance was used. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was estimated from the serum creatinine level at baseline with the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

### Secondary failure of metformin monotherapy in clinical practice [^111wqKyY]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

We sought to document the secondary failure rate of metformin monotherapy in a clinical practice setting and to explore factors that predict therapeutic failure.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We studied 1,799 type 2 diabetic patients who, between 2004 and 2006, lowered their A1C to < 7% after initiating metformin monotherapy as their first-ever anti-hyperglycemic drug. We examined all A1C values recorded through 31 December 2008 (2–5 years of follow-up), defining secondary failure as a subsequent A1C ≥ 7.5% or the addition or substitution of another anti-hyperglycemic agent. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the probability of secondary failure.

RESULTS

Of the 1,799 patients studied, 42% (n = 748) experienced secondary failure; the mean failure rate was 17% per year. However, patients who initiated metformin within 3 months of diabetes diagnosis failed at an age-and A1C-adjusted rate of 12.2% (10.5–14.4%) per year, and patients who initiated while A1C was < 7% failed at an adjusted rate of 12.3% per year. An interaction term between duration of diagnosed diabetes and A1C was not significant. Age, duration, and A1C at initiation were the only factors that predicted secondary failure.

CONCLUSIONS

Although metformin failure may occur more rapidly in clinical practice than in clinical trails, initiating it soon after diabetes diagnosis and while A1C is low might preserve β-cell function, prolong the effectiveness of metformin, reduce lifetime glycemic burden, and prevent diabetes complications. Our findings support the current treatment algorithm for hyperglycemia management that recommends metformin initiation when diabetes is first diagnosed.

Metformin — Dose adjustment and initiation thresholds are specified: the guideline offers a practical point to halve the dose for an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; the FDA recommendation states metformin not be initiated in people with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², based upon likely progression to an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² where metformin would be contraindicated; KDIGO provides a suggestion to reduce the dose of metformin, even when the eGFR is 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m², in the presence of conditions that predispose patients to hypoperfusion and hypoxemia; and metformin should be discontinued when most patients are admitted to the hospital.

### Insulin management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115HJqyf]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an initial A1C level greater than 9 percent, or if diabetes is uncontrolled despite optimal oral glycemic therapy. Insulin therapy may be initiated as augmentation, starting at 0.3 unit per kg, or as replacement, starting at 0.6 to 1.0 unit per kg. When using replacement therapy, 50 percent of the total daily insulin dose is given as basal, and 50 percent as bolus, divided up before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Augmentation therapy can include basal or bolus insulin. Replacement therapy includes basal-bolus insulin and correction or premixed insulin. Glucose control, adverse effects, cost, adherence, and quality of life need to be considered when choosing therapy. Metformin should be continued if possible because it is proven to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in overweight patients with diabetes. In a study comparing premixed, bolus, and basal insulin, hypoglycemia was more common with premixed and bolus insulin, and weight gain was more common with bolus insulin. Titration of insulin over time is critical to improving glycemic control and preventing diabetes-related complications.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112cY7d4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Applicability of recommendations — population scope and baseline glycemia indicates these recommendations apply to adults with long-standing type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c level around 8% (mean range in included primary RCTs, 7.2% to 9.5%) despite usual care, with metformin as the most common usual care medication; subgroup enrollment included Three RCTs requiring CKD, 4 requiring existing CVD or acute coronary syndrome, 3 requiring overweight or obesity, and 11 requiring participants to be "at risk for CVD"; evidence did not allow evaluation of differences between secondary and primary prevention populations; therefore, recommendations apply to patients with type 2 diabetes with and without established CVD or CKD.

### Triple therapy with low-dose dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with each monocomponent, all added to metformin, in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^113kk2vV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Initiating simultaneous combination therapy at early stages of the disease, rather than by the sequential stepwise approach, may permit earlier achievement of glycaemic goals, more durable efficacy, and better preservation of β‐cell function than gradual treatment intensification, 14, 15, 16, 17 and might also enable a greater proportion of patients to meet their glycaemic targets than at present. However, there is still no clear consensus on whether the benefit‐risk profile of this more proactive approach is superior to the sequential approach, or on for which patients early combination therapy would be most appropriate. Indeed, clinical guidelines differ in terms of the HbA1c level at which initial combination therapy is recommended. A recent Consensus Report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends the use of combination therapy in patients who present with an HbA1c level that is > 1.5% above an individualized HbA1c target, based on the knowledge that most oral glucose‐lowering therapies do not result in HbA1c reductions of > 1.0% when given as monotherapies. 18 By contrast, guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommend the use of initial combination therapy in patients with an HbA1c level ≥ 7.5%. 7

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple oral therapy using the lower dapagliflozin dose of 5 mg/d plus saxagliptin 5 mg/d plus metformin ≥ 1500 mg/d, versus dual therapy with each monocomponent (low‐dose dapagliflozin 5 mg/d or saxagliptin 5 mg/d plus metformin ≥ 1500 mg/d) in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.5‐10.0%). 12 Dapagliflozin 5 mg, a lower dose than was used in previous studies of this triple therapy combination, 12, 13 was chosen for this study because it is the recommended starting dose in the USA 19 and because entry criteria for HbA1c levels were lower than those in the previous studies.

Models of drug response

Initial A1C reduction.

Linear regression was used to model two quantitative A1C reduction measurements derived from different treatment A1C definitions: 1) the minimum A1C recorded from baseline to 18 months after the index prescription while the patient was on stable treatment (no additional therapy initiated or metformin stopped) and 2) the average A1C reflecting the area under the curve of A1C within the same period. The corresponding A1C reduction was defined as the difference between the baseline and treatment A1C. The baseline A1C was taken as the nearest A1C within the 180 days before the index metformin prescription.

Treatment target A1C < 7%.

Logistic regression was used to model the ability of patients to reach a treatment target of A1C < 7% within 18 months after the start of metformin given their baseline A1C > 7%.

Sustained A1C response.

In prospective trials of metformin monotherapy (e.g. A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial [ADOPT]) following the initial response for 6 months, there was a gradual deterioration in glycemic control as diabetes progressed. The rate of deterioration of A1C will also reflect the patients' ability to consistently respond to metformin treatment. In the current study, we identified patients on metformin monotherapy for more than 3.5 years and performed unbalanced repeated-measurement analysis on their A1C, measured between 6 and 42 months.

Time to monotherapy failure or reaching a dose of 2 g/day.

In our observational study, the primary care physicians will increase the prescribed metformin dose over time to achieve the treatment target or maintain the A1C level. Therefore, the time to reach a metformin monotherapy dose of 2 g/day will provide an additional measure of drug response. Similarly, the time to start additional therapy (monotherapy failure) will also reflect metformin efficacy. In the current study, we used Cox regression to model time to metformin monotherapy failure and time to a composite event of either reaching a 2 g/day dose of metformin or monotherapy failure. For both analyses, individuals were censored at study end or after 5 years of metformin monotherapy.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — treatment escalation thresholds specify that for some recently diagnosed individuals with T2D and more severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 7.5%), early combination pharmacotherapy should be considered, usually to include metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia; for newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an entry A1C > 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, clinicians should initiate dual- or possibly triple-combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin, and basal insulin along with noninsulin therapy is recommended if there are significant signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia, especially including catabolism or a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L); persons with T2D initially treated with monotherapy who do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets should progress to dual-combination therapy and then triple-combination therapy, if needed, and use a basal insulin to adequately obtain and maintain control.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117UkRWi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Per the Summary of Product Characteristics from the European Medicines Agency, the minimum recommended starting dose of 500 mg metformin two times daily translates to 1000 mg/day. 9 However, in the current study, 72% of new users were initiated at doses lower than this value, and 69% remained at this dose level 6 and 12 months later. Even among new users with suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%)), 61% remained below this dose level at 12 months. Furthermore, 54% of prevalent users of metformin were receiving less than this minimum recommended daily dose. This may explain why only 51% of prevalent metformin users had met the standard HbA1C target of < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), even after a median disease duration of 3.1 years.

The reasons for the low rates of up‐titration are speculative, but may include contraindications, intolerance and discontinuation. The NICE guidelines state that metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated in 15% of diabetes patients. 7 Contraindications include renal dysfunction and recent cardiovascular events, both of which are common among people with T2DM. 30 We investigated the effects of excluding patients with renal dysfunction, defined as eGFR < 30 (0.5% of new users and 1.0% of prevalent users) and found no change in the results. Intolerance of metformin may manifest as lactacidosis or gastrointestinal side effects, which sometimes lead to discontinuation. 20 Our analysis showed that discontinuation was the most frequent treatment pattern (among patterns involving a change) observed in the year after initiating metformin monotherapy, suggesting that many subjects were intolerant of metformin.
