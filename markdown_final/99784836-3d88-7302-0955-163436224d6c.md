## Question

80. The Next Trial

- As it is now, I remember another most curious trial, - said the White Knight. There were three defendants. Each of them accused one of the other two. The first defendant was the only one who told the truth. If each of the defendants had accused not the one they did, but the other, then the second defendant would have been the only one who told the truth.

Who among the three defendants is guilty?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who among three defendants is guilty, given that each accuses one of the other two, the first defendant is the only one telling the truth in the actual scenario, and if each had accused the other person instead, the second defendant would be the only one telling the truth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the logical structure of the two scenarios and how they constrain who is guilty and who is lying. Then, I should enumerate the possible guilt assignments and test them against both conditions. Finally, I will verify consistency and identify the unique solution that satisfies both constraints, making sure I don't jump to conclusions without checking each case.

> Let me first confirm the setup and constraints. There are three defendants, and each accuses exactly one of the other two. In the actual scenario, defendant 1 is the only one telling the truth, which means defendants 2 and 3 are lying. In the counterfactual scenario, each defendant accuses the other person (i.e., they swap accusations), and in that case defendant 2 would be the only one telling the truth, meaning defendants 1 and 3 would be lying. I need to ensure that these constraints are mutually compatible and that only one guilt assignment satisfies both.

> Next, I should review the implications of lying versus telling the truth in this puzzle. If a defendant is telling the truth, then the person they accuse must be guilty. Conversely, if a defendant is lying, then the person they accuse must be innocent. Hold on, I should verify that this interpretation is consistent with the wording: yes, "telling the truth" implies their accusation is correct, and "lying" implies their accusation is false, so the accused is innocent in that case.

> Now, I will enumerate the possible guilt assignments. Since only one person can be guilty, the possibilities are: defendant 1 is guilty, defendant 2 is guilty, or defendant 3 is guilty. I need to check each of these against both the actual and counterfactual scenarios to see which one survives without contradiction.

> Let me consider Case 1: defendant 1 is guilty. In the actual scenario, defendant 1 tells the truth, so defendant 1's accusation must point to the guilty party. But wait, if defendant 1 is guilty, then defendant 1 cannot truthfully accuse someone else of being guilty; that would be a lie. So this case leads to a contradiction, and I should reject it. Hold on, I should verify: yes, if defendant 1 is guilty and tells the truth, defendant 1 would have to accuse themselves, which the puzzle does not allow, so defendant 1 cannot be guilty.

> I will now examine Case 2: defendant 2 is guilty. In the actual scenario, defendant 1 tells the truth, so defendant 1 must accuse defendant 2. Defendants 2 and 3 are lying, so their accusations must be false, meaning the people they accuse are innocent. Let me think about concrete accusations: defendant 1 accuses defendant 2 (consistent with defendant 2 being guilty), defendant 2 accuses defendant 3 (which is a lie, so defendant 3 is innocent, which fits), and defendant 3 accuses defendant 1 (which is a lie, so defendant 1 is innocent, which also fits). So far, this assignment is internally consistent with the actual scenario.

> Next, I should check the counterfactual scenario under this case. If each defendant accuses the other person, then defendant 1 would now accuse defendant 3, defendant 2 would accuse defendant 1, and defendant 3 would accuse defendant 2. In this counterfactual, defendant 2 is supposed to be the only one telling the truth, so defendant 2's accusation of defendant 1 must be true, meaning defendant 1 is guilty. But wait, that contradicts our assumption that defendant 2 is guilty in this case. If defendant 1 is guilty, then defendant 2 cannot also be guilty, so this counterfactual implication violates the single-guilty-person constraint. Therefore, defendant 2 cannot be guilty either, and I should reject this case as well.

> Let me consider Case 3: defendant 3 is guilty. In the actual scenario, defendant 1 tells the truth, so defendant 1 must accuse defendant 3. Defendants 2 and 3 are lying, so their accusations must be false, meaning the people they accuse are innocent. Concretely: defendant 1 accuses defendant 3 (consistent with defendant 3 being guilty), defendant 2 accuses defendant 1 (a lie, so defendant 1 is innocent, which fits), and defendant 3 accuses defendant 2 (a lie, so defendant 2 is innocent, which also fits). This assignment is internally consistent with the actual scenario.

> Now, I need to check the counterfactual scenario under this case. If each defendant accuses the other person, then defendant 1 would accuse defendant 2, defendant 2 would accuse defendant 3, and defendant 3 would accuse defendant 1. In this counterfactual, defendant 2 is supposed to be the only one telling the truth, so defendant 2's accusation of defendant 3 must be true, meaning defendant 3 is guilty. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the other defendants' statuses. Defendant 1 accuses defendant 2, which would be a lie, so defendant 2 is innocent, which is consistent. Defendant 3 accuses defendant 1, which would be a lie, so defendant 1 is innocent, which is also consistent. Thus, in the counterfactual, defendant 2 is the only truth-teller and defendant 3 is guilty, which matches our assumption and satisfies both constraints.

> Putting this together, the only guilt assignment that satisfies both the actual and counterfactual conditions is that defendant 3 is guilty. I should double-check that no other case could work; indeed, Cases 1 and 2 each produced contradictions, leaving Case 3 as the unique solution.

The guilty defendant is **Defendant 3**. Here's why: in the actual scenario, Defendant 1 tells the truth and accuses Defendant 3, while Defendants 2 and 3 lie. In the counterfactual scenario where each accuses the other person, Defendant 2 would tell the truth and accuse Defendant 3, while Defendants 1 and 3 would lie. Both scenarios consistently identify Defendant 3 as the guilty party, satisfying the conditions that only one defendant tells the truth in each case.

---

## Step-by-step analysis

### Actual scenario

- **Defendant 1**: Tells the truth and accuses Defendant 3.
- **Defendant 2**: Lies and accuses Defendant 1 (innocent).
- **Defendant 3**: Lies and accuses Defendant 2 (innocent).

This configuration satisfies the condition that only Defendant 1 tells the truth, and the guilty party is **Defendant 3**.

---

### Counterfactual scenario

In the counterfactual scenario, each defendant accuses the other person:

- **Defendant 1**: Accuses Defendant 2 (lies, so Defendant 2 is innocent).
- **Defendant 2**: Accuses Defendant 3 (tells the truth, so Defendant 3 is guilty).
- **Defendant 3**: Accuses Defendant 1 (lies, so Defendant 1 is innocent).

This configuration satisfies the condition that only Defendant 2 tells the truth, and again the guilty party is **Defendant 3**.

---

## Conclusion

Both the actual and counterfactual scenarios consistently identify **Defendant 3** as the guilty party. Therefore, the guilty defendant is **Defendant 3**.

### The psychology of defendant plea decision making [^e0b65b75]. The American Psychologist (2017). Low credibility.

Every day, thousands of defendants, prosecutors, and defense attorneys must make guilty plea decisions, such as whether to accept a plea offer or proceed to trial. Most defendants opt to plead guilty; approximately 95% of state and federal convictions result from guilty pleas. In light of a newly emerging body of research and recent Supreme Court decisions on guilty pleas, this article asks and answers 2 questions: First, who pleads guilty and why? We describe the characteristics of those who are more or less likely to plead guilty, and examine the reasons why individuals plead guilty instead of proceeding to trial, exploring the cognitive, social influence, and developmental factors that underlie decision making. Second, are defendants' plea decisions valid, in that the decisions are made knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and with a factual basis of guilt? That is, do defendants who plead guilty understand and appreciate the conditions and consequences of their pleas, as required by law? Are innocent people induced to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit? We conclude with suggestions to move the field of plea research forward. (PsycINFO Database Record

### Neural circuits in the brain that are activated when mitigating criminal sentences [^9f8f0504]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

In sentencing guilty defendants, jurors and judges weigh 'mitigating circumstances', which create sympathy for a defendant. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity in ordinary citizens who are potential jurors, as they decide on mitigation of punishment for murder. We found that sympathy activated regions associated with mentalising and moral conflict (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporo-parietal junction). Sentencing also activated precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that mitigation is based on negative affective responses to murder, sympathy for mitigating circumstances and cognitive control to choose numerical punishments. Individual differences on the inclination to mitigate, the sentence reduction per unit of judged sympathy, correlated with activity in the right middle insula, an area known to represent interoception of visceral states. These results could help the legal system understand how potential jurors actually decide, and contribute to growing knowledge about whether emotion and cognition are integrated sensibly in difficult judgments.

Expert medical testimony in civil and criminal litigation — characteristics — includes being truthful and furthers the cause of justice; fair, accurate, and impartial without advocacy; rendered by a physician who is board certified with a valid, unrestricted license, actively engaged in the area, and an acknowledged expert; limited only to matters within the physician's clinical specialty and expertise; objective and scientifically based; based on all relevant documentation; rendered in accordance with generally accepted standards of practice at the time in question; willing to be provided to plaintiffs and prosecutors or defendants; provided for reasonable compensation not contingent on the outcome; with clarity as to whether testimony is offered as the physician's individual opinion or as the position of a professional association or other organization; and, if provided on behalf of a professional association or other organization, free of any COIs. Professional organizations should continue to support these standards and sanction members who fail to meet them.

### Why confessions Trump innocence [^99fda5eb]. The American Psychologist (2012). Low credibility.

As illustrated by the story of Amanda Knox and many others wrongfully convicted, false confessions often trump factual innocence. Focusing on consequences, recent research suggests that confessions are powerfully persuasive as a matter of logic and common sense; that many false confessions contain richly detailed narratives and accurate crime facts that appear to betray guilty knowledge; and that confessions in general can corrupt other evidence from lay witnesses and forensic experts-producing an illusion of false support. This latter phenomenon, termed "corroboration inflation", suggests that pretrial corroboration requirements as well as the concept of "harmless error" on appeal are based on an erroneous presumption of independence among items of evidence. In addition to previously suggested reforms to police practices that are designed to curb the risk of false confessions, measures should be taken as well to minimize the rippling consequences of those confessions.

### Neural circuits in the brain that are activated when mitigating criminal sentences [^64f5d960]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Philosophers, psychologists and legal scholars have long debated whether mercy, sympathy and compassion should reduce moral culpability of legal defendants. People do have negative emotional responses to a wide range of situational factors that are not normatively justifiable because they are not considered evidence, or appeal to 'prejudices and sympathy', which jurors are typically instructed to ignore, for example, gruesome crime scene pictures lead to more mock jury convictions when they are in colour (compared with black and white). Other studies show that evidence that provides negative emotions leads to more punitive judgments. A mock trial study reported that jurors found a defendant less guilty when they heard a defense attorney urging sympathy for the defendant.

Studies of moral cognition in hypothetical non-legal scenarios have revealed the increased activity in emotion-related brain regions (that is, insula, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) and decreased activity in cognitive processes (that is, dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal areas) when participants contemplated morally charged actions, such as a trolley dilemma involving killing lives of some people to save others. Other studies indicate that people do sometimes punish norm violators in non-legal or legal situations, driven by moral judgments in which negative emotional reactions have a critical role. Prosocial emotions, such as sympathy, also influence decision making (for example, charitable giving); however, there is currently no direct cognitive and neural evidence for how sympathy is translated into legal outcomes.

All these studies raise an important question of whether moral judgments and accompanying emotions are used reasonably (as legal rules require) or not. Neuroscience is now entering this debate about defendants, but very little is known about whether mental activity of juries and judges conforms to legal principles. The case we explore here is 'mitigating circumstances', a rare case where emotions, such as sympathy, are allowed to influence juror judgment.

### Prosocial preferences can escalate intergroup conflicts by countering selfish motivations to leave [^fd0e96cc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

When defending against hostile enemies, individual group members can benefit from others staying in the group and fighting. However, individuals themselves may be better off by leaving the group and avoiding the personal risks associated with fighting. While fleeing is indeed commonly observed, when and why defenders fight or flee remains poorly understood and is addressed here with three incentivized and preregistered experiments (total n = 602). In stylized attacker-defender contest games in which defenders could stay and fight or leave, we show that the less costly leaving is, the more likely individuals are to abandon their group. In addition, more risk-averse individuals are more likely to leave. Conversely, individuals more likely stay and fight when they have pro-social preferences and when fellow group members cannot leave. However, those who stay not always contribute fully to group defense, to some degree free-riding on the efforts of other group members. Nonetheless, staying increased intergroup conflict and its associated costs.

### Who initiates punishment, who joins punishment? Disentangling types of third-party punishers by neural traits [^7ce710c3]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Critically, the four potential punishers were aware of the following consequences of the different options. They knew that 4 points would be deducted from the defecting second mover in the PD if at least one person chose Option 1 (i.e. to punish independently). This punishment was not additive and one subject choosing Option 1 was sufficient for punishment to be implemented, regardless of the number of punishers. Implementing punishment yielded a total cost of 3 points, but this total cost would be shared equally among all players who participate in the punishment act, that is, subjects who chose either Option 1 (i.e. to punish independently) or Option 2 (i.e. to punish conditionally). Therefore, the per subject cost to deduct 4 points from the second mover was 3 points, 1.5 points, 1 point, and 0.75 points in Case 1, 2, 3, and 4 subjects participated in the punishment act, respectively (see Figure 1b, left and middle). Importantly, if subjects chose Option 2 (i.e. to punish conditionally), but no one chose Option 1 (i.e. to punish independently), punishment was not implemented (Figure 1b, right). The potential punishers' decision to deduct points was implemented only if the first mover had decided to transfer points and second mover had refused to transfer points. The first and second mover in the PD were aware that a group of four potential punishers could deduct 4 points from the second mover. The potential punishers were aware that the two other subjects knew that only the second mover in the PD could be punished.

### Prosocial preferences can escalate intergroup conflicts by countering selfish motivations to leave [^0a3a0599]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Attackers and defenders in our experiments were fully aware of the number of defenders who had left and leaving decisions were made simultaneously. This might not always be the case — in many conflicts misinformation and a lack of transparency are common and of strategic value. For example, attackers and defenders may want to conceal the true number of deserters to maintain an appearance of strength and to deter their opponents, and people may closely observe what others do and conditionally decide whether to leave or stay. Future work could investigate the effect of ambiguity of how many defenders left on attackers' investment and the role of sequential play (given our data only includes conditional choices across rounds, regarding the latter case).

One limitation to our experimental set-up is that leaving came at a financial cost to participants. While applying a financial cost to leaving allowed us to infer how people integrate costs and benefits in their decision-making, in many conflicts the costs of leaving can be much more substantial and multifaceted, including non-economic costs like leaving loved ones behind, social capital costs like losing one's social network, or reputational costs like losing trust of fellow group members. Future research could expand on the Intergroup Attacker-Defender Contest with Exit to investigate how such factors influence leaving dynamics.

### AI generates covertly racist decisions about people based on their dialect [^7e057aee]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

We then examined decisions about criminality. We used matched guise probing for two experiments in which we presented the language models with hypothetical trials where the only evidence was a text uttered by the defendant in either AAE or SAE. We then measured the probability that the language models assigned to potential judicial outcomes in these trials and counted how often each of the judicial outcomes was preferred for AAE and SAE (Methods, 'Criminality analysis'). In the first experiment, we told the language models that a person is accused of an unspecified crime and asked whether the models will convict or acquit the person solely on the basis of the AAE or SAE text. Overall, we found that the rate of convictions was greater for AAE (r = 68.7%) than SAE (r = 62.1%; Fig. 3c, left). A chi-squared test found a strong effect (χ 2 (1, N = 96) = 184.7, P < 0.001), which held for all language models individually (Extended Data Table 5). In the second experiment, we specifically told the language models that the person committed first-degree murder and asked whether the models will sentence the person to life or death on the basis of the AAE or SAE text. The overall rate of death sentences was greater for AAE (r = 27.7%) than for SAE (r = 22.8%; Fig. 3c, right). A chi-squared test found a strong effect (χ 2 (1, N = 144) = 425.4, P < 0.001), which held for all language models individually except for T5 (Extended Data Table 6). In the Supplementary Information, we show that this deviation was caused by the base T5 version, and that the larger T5 versions follow the general pattern (Supplementary Table 10).

In further experiments (Supplementary Information, 'Intelligence analysis'), we used matched guise probing to examine decisions about intelligence, and found that all the language models consistently judge speakers of AAE to have a lower IQ than speakers of SAE (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15 and Supplementary Tables 17–19).

### AI generates covertly racist decisions about people based on their dialect [^f0d539b3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Criminality analysis

The set-up of the criminality analysis is different from the previous experiments in that we did not compute aggregate association scores between certain tokens (such as trait adjectives) and AAE but instead asked the language models to make discrete decisions for each AAE and SAE text. More specifically, we simulated trials in which the language models were prompted to use AAE or SAE texts as evidence to make a judicial decision. We then aggregated the judicial decisions into summary statistics.

We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, the language models were asked to determine whether a person accused of committing an unspecified crime should be acquitted or convicted. The only evidence provided to the language models was a statement made by the defendant, which was an AAE or SAE text. In the second experiment, the language models were asked to determine whether a person who committed first-degree murder should be sentenced to life or death. Similarly to the first (general conviction) experiment, the only evidence provided to the language models was a statement made by the defendant, which was an AAE or SAE text. Note that the AAE and SAE texts were the same texts as in the other experiments and did not come from a judicial context. Rather than testing how well language models could perform the tasks of predicting acquittal or conviction and life penalty or death penalty (an application of AI that we do not support), we were interested to see to what extent the decisions of the language models, made in the absence of any real evidence, were impacted by dialect. Although providing the language models with extra evidence as well as the AAE and SAE texts would have made the experiments more similar to real trials, it would have confounded the effect that dialect has on its own (the key effect of interest), so we did not consider this alternative set-up here. We focused on convictions and death penalties specifically because these are the two areas of the criminal justice system for which racial disparities have been described in the most robust and indisputable way: African Americans represent about 12% of the adult population of the United States, but they represent 33% of inmatesand more than 41% of people on death row.

### Juries and medical malpractice claims: empirical facts versus myths [^8a7822b2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Juries in medical malpractice trials are viewed as incompetent, antidoctor, irresponsible in awarding damages to patients, and casting a threatening shadow over the settlement process. Several decades of systematic empirical research yields little support for these claims. This article summarizes those findings. Doctors win about three cases of four that go to trial. Juries are skeptical about inflated claims. Jury verdicts on negligence are roughly similar to assessments made by medical experts and judges. Damage awards tend to correlate positively with the severity of injury. There are defensible reasons for large damage awards. Moreover, the largest awards are typically settled for much less than the verdicts.

### Translating clinical findings to the legal norm: the defendant's insanity assessment support scale (DIASS) [^dead252d]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The Defendant's Insanity Assessment Support Scale (DIASS)

The DIASS has been developed based on a wide view of (competent) decision-making, which reflects core issues relevant to legal insanity in many jurisdictions. The DIASS (see Supplementary Appendix) comprises nine binary items (present/absent) grouped into four dimensions: "Knowledge/understanding of the crime" (3 items), "Appreciating of the crime" (1 item), "Reasoning" (3 items), and "Control of voluntary motor activity" (2 items). The first two dimensions refer to the "Epistemic component", while the third and fourth dimensions refer to the "Control component". These dimensions refer to the mental state of the accused at the time of the crime. At the end of the scale, there is a box referring to the final judgments on the Epistemic and Control components, which are scored on a three-point scale (intact, partially compromised, and compromised). After having analyzed each subdimension of the Epistemic component (in those countries based on the M'Naghten rule) or of both the Epistemic and Control components (Model Penal Code), the evaluator can indicate their total or partial score, in order to reach his/her final judgment regarding the defendant's criminal responsibility. The DIASS is an instrument that should be used only after having examined all the legal and health documentation of the defendant, as well as after having carried out the clinical evaluation. It is basically meant to apply the clinical findings to the relevant law in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place.

### Psychiatry and the death penalty [^f3085d7c]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Psychiatrists conducting forensic evaluations of defendants facing a potential death penalty must understand the legal and ethical parameters governing these assessments in addition to the important clinical issues. Important areas to review with each defendant include the role of the evaluator, the party requesting the evaluation, circumstances in which the evaluation is not confidential, the nature, scope, and purpose of the evaluation, and the parties to whom the results of the evaluation are to be forwarded. In those circumstances in which the defense attorney has not retained the psychiatrist, the defendant's attorney must be aware that an evaluation has been ordered by the court or requested by the prosecution. The psychiatrist also must be prepared for passionate challenges to their findings from the defense or prosecution and in some instances for vigorous attacks on their own personal ethics. To weather such storms, the mental health evaluator must base their opinion on objective evidence rather than letting any personal bias guide their assessment.

### Medicine, lies and deceptions [^346c3153]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

This article offers a qualified defence of the view that there is a moral difference between telling lies to one's patients, and deceiving them without lying. However, I take issue with certain arguments offered by Jennifer Jackson in support of the same conclusion. In particular, I challenge her claim that to deny that there is such a moral difference makes sense only within a utilitarian framework, and I cast doubt on the aptness of some of her examples of non-lying deception. But I argue that lies have a greater tendency to damage trust than does non-lying deception, and suggest that since many doctors do believe there is a moral boundary between the two types of deception, encouraging them to violate that boundary may have adverse general effects on their moral sensibilities.

### The assassination of John F. Kennedy: revisiting the medical data [^0abfde44]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Doubt continues to surround the assassination of President Kennedy to this day. Unfortunately, the controversy was not diminished by the multiple commissions and panels that were convened to investigate it. This was in large part because these various panels continued to propagate much of the confusion and lack of precision that plagued the initial medical reports, and introduced some new confusion of their own. Much of this controversy was driven by incomplete information, poor documentation and analysis, and the puzzling decision to withhold key medical evidence both from investigators and the public. However, the preponderance of evidence does show that the single-shooter, three-bullet theory is plausible both medically and scientifically.

### Nudges to reason: not guilty [^2d2dd456]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

I now turn to the heart of the matter. Keeling argues that nudges to reason may threaten autonomy. The explicit claim seems to be that they are deceptive, though there may be a second implicit claim: that even when they are not deceptive, they may nevertheless threaten autonomy. I completely agree with Keeling that nudges to reason may threaten autonomy even if they do not bypass reasoning mechanisms. There are other ways of threatening autonomy. However, that's no special problem for defenders of nudges. After all, those who attack nudges aim to identify a problem with them that entails that they are somehow suspicious compared with other ways of changing minds (like rational argument). Nudges can be used deceptively; that's a property they share with every other way of changing minds.

Keeling's 'newspaper' argument seems to be intended to illustrate how nudges to reason may be used deceptively, but it does not actually seem to involve any deception. Perhaps the idea is that the government has a secret policy to require newspapers to publish articles from a different political perspective without informing readers either that they do this or which articles are concerned. If that's the idea, then the objection collapses back into the first: advocates of nudges need not, and do not, hold that we should engage in deception. If the claim is instead that requiring newspapers non-deceptively to publish articles from different political perspectives is disrespectful of people's autonomy, then I simply don't accept it. It does not fail 'to take seriously those readers as individuals capable of making informed decisions about which political evidence they give most weight to', since it leaves it up to the reader to decide whether to consume the information. Coercion threatens autonomy, but making information available is not coercive. If the reader does not share my intuition here, no matter: it suffices to point out that any problem with exposure to unwanted information is not specific to nudges: it applies with equal force to argument.

Nudges to reason surely can be used in ways that threaten autonomy. That does not distinguish them from other ways of addressing ourselves to rational agents. It is disrespectful to deceive and to coerce, whatever the cognitive mechanisms we use in these ways.

### Who initiates punishment, who joins punishment? Disentangling types of third-party punishers by neural traits [^501fdcd1]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Paradigm

The study used a newly developed version of a third‐party punishment paradigm. The third‐party consisted of four subjects (potential punishers) who observed an interaction between two other subjects (first mover and second mover) who played a sequential prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. Notably, the first and second mover in the PD were present in the laboratory and were paid according to their decisions and the decisions of the third‐parties punishers (see below). The first and second mover in the PD both received an initial endowment of 5 points. Then, the first mover could decide whether to transfer 5 points to the second mover or to keep all the points. The second mover learned about the first mover's decision and then had to decide him/herself whether to transfer back 5 points or to keep all points (see Figure 1a, right side). Notably, all transferred points are multiplied by two, for example, if both players transfer points, both receive 10 points in total. If only one person transfers points, the transferring person would receive 0 points while the person keeping the points would receive 15 points. If neither person transfers points, both keep 5 points.

The four potential punishers learned about the underlying structure of the interaction between the first mover and second mover in the PD. Each potential punisher received an initial endowment of 14 points. Their task was to decide whether they want to deduct 4 points from the second mover, in case the first mover decided to transfer points and the second mover kept the points, that is, the first mover cooperated, while the second mover defected. More specifically, they were asked: "Do you want to deduct 4 points from the second mover?" As a novel feature of the paradigm, each potential punisher could decide between the following three options that allowed separating the three predicted punishment types: I deduct points (Option 1, i.e. to punish independently); I join the deduction of points (Option 2, i.e. to punish conditionally); I do nothing (Option 3, i.e. not to punish, see Figure 1a, left side).

### Second thoughts about who is first: the medical triage of violent perpetrators and their victims [^7b4c0eba]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Extreme intentional and deliberate violence against innocent people, including acts of terror and school shootings, poses various ethical challenges, some related to the practice of medicine. We discuss a dilemma relating to deliberate violence, in this case the aftermath of a terror attack, in which there are multiple injured individuals, including the terror perpetrator. Normally, the priority of medical treatment is determined based on need. However, in the case of a terror attack, there is reason to question this. Should the perpetrator of extreme violence receive medical treatment on the scene before the victims if he or she is designated as the most seriously injured? Or rather, should victims receive medical care priority if they are also in some life-threatening danger, although not at the same level of severity as the perpetrator? We present two opposing approaches: the conventional 'no-exceptions' approach, which gives priority to the terrorist, and the justice-oriented 'victim first' approach, which gives priority to the victims. Invoking concepts of retributive justice, distributive justice and corrective justice, this latter approach suggests that 'value-neutrality' can lead to injustice. Perpetrators of terror-like violence should be treated as an act of humanism and good ethical medical practice. However, in clear and obvious terror-like situations, to treat the perpetrators of violence before their victims may be unjust. Thus, in some specific situations, the 'victim first' approach may be considered a legitimate alternative triage policy.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^57ca7b2b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Experts can and often will be deposed — A discovery alternative to deposition testimony is the expert's written report, which typically is shared between the parties before trial; however, some states do not require disclosure of the identity of the expert or even disclosure of the report. In criminal cases, discovery of expert opinion usually is accomplished by pretrial interview with the expert witness or by an expert witness' written report. It is helpful when expert witnesses are willing to be available and to discuss their opinions with both sides in advance of their testimony, and it is not advisable that physicians engage in the practice of having attorneys write their reports; if that does occur, physician experts should read that statement carefully to verify agreement with it.

### Prosocial preferences can escalate intergroup conflicts by countering selfish motivations to leave [^ec79bac7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Once all defenders had made their decision, everyone was informed how many defenders left. If everyone in the defender group decided to leave, there was no possibility to contribute to one's group's conflict pool C. Consequently, everyone in the defender group earned 20 EMU (their endowment) minus the cost of leaving (L), while attackers retained their 20-EMU endowment.

If at least one defender stayed, the defenders who stayed (d) and all attackers simultaneously determined their individual contributions (g) to their group's conflict pool C, with 0 ≤ g i ≤ 20. Individual contributions to the conflict pool were wasted meaning that these could never be earned back, but when C attacker > C defender, the attackers won the remaining EMU of the defenders who stayed (d × 20 − C defender). These spoils of conflict were divided equally among the attackers and added to the attackers' remaining endowments (20 − g i). Defenders who stayed thus earned nothing when attackers won. However, when C attacker ≤ C defender, defenders who stayed defended themselves successfully. In this case, both attackers and defenders earned their remaining endowments (20 − g i). Thus, individual contributions in attacker (defender) groups reflected out-group aggression (in-group defense).

Guideline 11.01: Accuracy, fairness, and avoidance of deception — Forensic practitioners make reasonable efforts to ensure their services and public statements are communicated to promote understanding and avoid deception; in expert roles they facilitate understanding of evidence, do not distort or withhold relevant evidence, strive to have data considered readily available for inspection subject to legal and professional constraints, present conclusions and professional products in a fair manner, and do not participate in misrepresentation or partisan attempts to subvert contrary evidence while remaining free to forcefully present supporting data and reasoning.

### Detecting spontaneous deception in the brain [^17122fc9]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Deception detection can be of great value during the juristic investigation. Although the neural signatures of deception have been widely documented, most prior studies were biased by difficulty levels. That is, deceptive behavior typically required more effort, making deception detection possibly effort detection. Furthermore, no study has examined the generalizability across instructed and spontaneous responses and across participants. To explore these issues, we used a dual-task paradigm, where the difficulty level was balanced between truth-telling and lying, and the instructed and spontaneous truth-telling and lying were collected independently. Using Multivoxel pattern analysis, we were able to decode truth-telling versus lying with a balanced difficulty level. Results showed that the angular gyrus (AG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and postcentral gyrus could differentiate lying from truth-telling. Critically, linear classifiers trained to distinguish instructed truthful and deceptive responses could correctly differentiate spontaneous truthful and deceptive responses in AG and IFG with above-chance accuracy. In addition, with a leave-one-participant-out analysis, multivoxel neural patterns from AG could classify if the left-out participant was lying or not in a trial. These results indicate the commonality of neural responses subserved instructed and spontaneous deceptive behavior as well as the feasibility of cross-participant deception validation.

### The good, the bad, and the ugly: (with apologies to sergio leone) [^bee33859]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

A physician's reputation depends on good relationships with patients, staff, and colleagues. The protection of that reputation should not be left to chance. This article identifies the good, the bad, and the ugly that physicians might encounter in their practices. Ways to assess prospective patients for their suitability for you and your practice are explored, and some of the assessment tools at your disposal — staff opinion, your face-to-face interview, and others — are identified. Second opinions have the potential to strain relationships with colleagues if not handled with care and respect. This article describes a considerate and forthright approach to providing second opinions, one that respects both patients and colleagues. Finally, physicians who become aware of individuals making defamatory and possibly damaging statements about them should act prudently, not blindly. Litigation is sometimes necessary, but the reasonable, measured approach provided here is likely to obviate legal intervention.

### Who initiates punishment, who joins punishment? Disentangling types of third-party punishers by neural traits [^db5c3c5c]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Experimental paradigm and possible choice combinations. (a) Four potential third‐party punishers are within one group (left side) and are each endowed with 14 points. They observe an interaction between two other players in a sequential prisoner's dilemma, in which a first mover transfers points and a second mover (sequentially) does not transfer points back (right side). The potential punishers can choose between three different options on whether to sanction the defecting second mover in the PD: Option 1: I deduct points (i.e. to punish independently, red button); Option 2: I join the deduction of points (i.e. to punish conditionally, green button) or Option 3: I do nothing (i.e. no punishing, gray button). The third‐party punishers were aware that (i) punishment only takes place if at least one of the third‐party punishers decides to punish independently (chooses Option 1), (ii) the costs for punishment (3 points in total) were shared equally among all players taking part in the punishment (choose option 1 or 2), and (iii) the defecting second mover loses 4 points if punishment takes place. (b) Three potential choice scenarios and associated consequences for punishment. In the left scenario, one subject decides to "deduct points" (Option 1, red) and no other subject "joins." Thus, the second mover of the PD is punished and the sole punisher has to pay the total costs of 3 points for punishment by him/herself. In the middle scenario, one subject decides to "deduct points" (Option 1, red) and two subjects decide to "join" (Option 2, green). Thus, the second mover is punished, and the total costs of 3 points for punishment are divided among the red and green subjects, that is, all three pay 1 point. In the scenario on the right hand side, two subjects decide to "join" (Option 2, green), but no subject chooses to "deduct points" (Option 1, red). Thus, the second mover does not get punished

It's not just the ignorance of science; more dangerous is probably the creation of a parallel reality by the repetition of lies. President Trump and his administration have repeatedly lied to the US public about the threat of the virus. They lied about the seriousness of the virus, they lied about the efficiency of masks, they lied about testing capacities, and they keep lying. The virus is not disappearing, not everyone who wants a test can get a test, we are not in great shape, we are not bending the corner, and there is no treatment for all! President Trump and his administration keep repeating the same lies over and over — in interviews, during rallies, and at press conferences. " If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed. " We heard this during the second world war. The dogma goes further and states that " the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie." One can only hope that the painful sacrifice of all the lives taken, has, in the most disturbing manner, exposed the lies of the current administration and showed the truth to the American public and that we will see this in the outcome of the upcoming US election.

### Child abuse: behavioral aspects and other associated problems [^edae3db1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Although researchers in psychology and the social sciences will need to continue to identify the behavioral consequences of abuse and treatment strategies, pediatricians may still be the first line professionals to suspect and intercept victims. Remember that, especially in cases where there have been threats or falsification of illness, it is wise to enlist integrated multidisciplinary services to ensure the safety of the child before confronting any potential perpetrators. Physicians have become better trained to be more vigilant in detecting signs of physical abuse, but it seems that psychologic and sexual maltreatment may cause more long-term problems but are more difficult to detect. Although a book by Everett and Gallop is written for mental health professionals, the chapters on why a history of childhood trauma is often missed, recognizing signs and symptoms, and asking about abuse, are all helpful for pediatricians and other health care professionals. In certain situations, physicians should attempt to talk to children privately, so that those who are old enough might have an opportunity to relate events that are traumatic, and so that abusive parents will not have an opportunity to interrupt, instill additional fear in the child, or abruptly change providers. Children need someone to ask them directly about their experiences and act on any suspicions. Asking once may not be enough, because a frightened child may initially deny physical or sexual abuse, but be ready to tell at another time. A vocal adult survivor of Munchausen syndrome by proxy and severe physical abuse explains: The dilemma is how to be loved and accepted. Even once a child recognizes that it is wrong, victims may be afraid to speak up for fear of anger and more abuse at the hand of the abuser. By the time I reached eleven, I was angry enough at what my mother had gotten away with, I would have been more truthful. It would have been a relief to have someone else voice their own suspicions. But, no one ever asked and I could not be the one to give away my mother or the love of my family. Although society is still struggling with its ability to prevent abuse, it must also be concerned with dealing with its consequences. The problem seems overwhelming in its enormity and the resources do not seem to be adequate to tackle these issues so basic to the care and nurturing of children. Nonetheless, physicians must keep their eyes open to behaviors that signal distress, recognize and strive to eliminate the underlying cause, and make certain that children receive treatment to minimize the myriad of behavioral and other long-term problems that are associated with child abuse.

### Poor lie detection related to an under-reliance on statistical cues and overreliance on own behaviour [^7ba530ca]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Comprehension check questions

All participants were asked the following seven comprehension check questions after reading the instructions (correct answers are underlined):
In each trial, you and the other player are presented with an identical set of seven cards. True False
The computer picks one card for you and the other player at random. Which of the below statements is true? The computer picks the same card for you and the other player The computer picks a different card for you and the other player. The computer randomly picked a card for the other participant and randomly picks a card for you. Your card pick is therefore not necessarily the same as the other player's.
Let's say you reported a blue card and the other participant reported red: You win £0.01. The other player wins nothing. The other player wins. You win nothing. You win £0.01. The other player loses. The other player wins. You lose £0.01.
Let's say you and the other participant both reported a blue card. What happens? Each person loses Neither one wins or loses Each person wins
Let's say you reported a red card and the other participant reported blue: You win £0.01. The other player wins nothing. The other player wins. You win nothing. You win £0.01. The other player loses. The other player wins. You lose £0.01.
Let's say you and the other participant both reported a red card. What happens? Each person loses Neither one wins or loses Each person wins
Each trial, you will see another participant's report from a previous study. True False

All questions had to be answered correctly to be allowed to continue the study. Participants had to answer correctly at least at the second attempt. Participants were allowed to review the instructions after a first failed attempt. If they failed again, they were instructed to discontinue the study.

Statistical analyses

To investigate what determines participants' suspicion levels on a trial by trial basis, we used a Bayesian 'model averaging' procedure adapted from Freckleton (2011). We reverse-coded participants' honesty ratings to reflect suspicion ratings and transformed them to be of range 0–1. Then, we defined four cues in three categories that may be associated with suspicion:

### Spite is contagious in dynamic networks [^e7462531]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Costly behavior that harms others, sometimes known as spite –, is among the most basic of anti-social behaviors. However, it presents an evolutionary puzzle. If there are no benefits, how could it have emerged? There nevertheless are cases of costly harm in both humans – and non-humans –. For instance, in human evolution there is a case to be made that the killing of individuals who exhibit high degrees of reactive aggression, clearly a dangerous harmful endeavor, played an important role in the self-domestication of human ancestors. This has prompted a number of evolutionary models to explain the emergence of such costly harm. We can represent this sort of interaction abstractly with a simple game. Suppose two individuals interact and each has the opportunity to pay a cost to inflict a harm on the other. Let b be the benefit derived from normal social interaction and let − c be the cost an agent can pay to take away that baseline benefit. This game is the Prisoner's Delight, which contrasts with the Prisoner's Dilemma in that acting anti-socially, rather than pro-socially, is costly (Fig. 1). In this game, unlike in the classic dilemma, harmful behavior is strictly dominated and generally we should not expect it to evolve.

### Culpability, blame, and stigma after pregnancy loss in Qatar [^6aec4d66]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the mother of a miscarriage participant (Dana; a 25–30 year-old with two children who had suffered a miscarriage and a stillbirth before experiencing a second miscarriage) confirmed by saying:

She was telling us that her husband's family accuses her of the miscarriage in an indirect way. Her mother in-law said; "what's wrong with women nowadays? We used to get our babies without having any problems!"

The findings also suggest that there are specific behaviours and activities acceptable to pregnant women, those who transgress these may be blamed and seen as inviting risk. Amna (age 27–32 with two children) stated that others criticized her and suggested she had performed activities they believed could have caused her miscarriage:

Yes, in my first miscarriage, everybody blamed me. They were sure that I did something wrong. I told them that the doctor said it was not my fault but nobody believed me. They insisted that I had lifted something heavy or did something that caused the miscarriage

The mother of another miscarriage participant (Nada; a 20–25 year-old with no children) has explicitly stated that a woman is considered culpable about her miscarriage when she contributes to the death of her baby in the womb by acting in a risky manner and not following the doctor's recommendations:

If she carried something heavy, in this case she is guilty, or if she took a medication that may harm her and the baby; she is guilty, or if she didn't follow the doctor's recommendations; she is guilty too. But if she did all what she can and followed the doctors' recommendations and took the medications; in this case she is not guilty.

### Committee opinion no. 681: disclosure and discussion of adverse events [^ef078bd1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

The second victim after adverse events — Disclosure and discussion can be important for the patient's and the health care team's healing process, and when adverse events occur, health care practitioners involved may develop emotional and functional deficits that lead them to become "second victims." The second victim has been defined as a health care practitioner who is involved in an unanticipated adverse patient event, medical error, or patient-related injury and who is traumatized by the event, and coordinated responses to adverse events also must include identification and treatment of the health care practitioners and ancillary staff who become "second victims." Emotional distress precipitated by adverse events can be significant among health care professionals regardless of the presence of a medical error, and the consequences of this distress, especially if left unaddressed, can be profound, with initial feelings of guilt, shame, isolation, and self-doubt that can lead to long-term sequelae like withdrawal, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, poor clinical performance, leaving the practice of medicine, and even suicide. The health care institution also should help guide the practitioners affected by the incident through a process similar to a hospital-initiated rapid response to a patient, and this should be provided in a blame-free environment that is capable of continuing to support the health care practitioners as they recover. Initial debriefings should include guidance to the team members about their own potential recovery issues and an offer of nonpunitive help, and offering help after some time has passed may assist those in the various stages of recovery and those reluctant to admit that they are suffering.

### What should we say? [^5319ee25]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract ethics mostly focuses on what we do. One form of action is a speech act. What we say can have profound effects. We can and should choose our words and how we speak wisely. When someone close to us suffers an injury or serious illness, a duty of beneficence requires that we support that person through beneficial words or actions. Though our intentions are most often benign, by what we say we often make the unfortunate person feel worse. Beginning with two personal accounts, this article explains what can go wrong in the compassionate speech of wellwishers, and uncovers some of the reasons why people say things that are hurtful or harmful. Despite a large body of clinical evidence, there is no perfect strategy for comforting a friend or relative who is ill, and sometimes even the best thing to say can still be perceived as insensitive and hurtful. In some cases, we may have good reason to knowingly say a hurtful or insensitive thing. Saying these 'wrong' things can sometimes be the best way to help a person in the long term. To complicate matters, there can be moral reasons for overriding what is good for the patient. What kind of admonishments should we make to a badly behaved patient? What is the value of authenticity in our communication with the people we love? These questions demand an ethical defence of those speech acts which are painful to hear but which need to be said, and of those which go wrong despite the best efforts of the wellwisher. We offer an ethical account, identifying permissible and impermissible justifications for the things we say to a person with a serious injury or illness.

### Advantaged identity management strategies differentiate five subgroups of white Americans [^ab990033]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Testing a theory of advantaged identity management

The 4-D model, argues that privilege and social change evoke different threats and defensive responses based on the values held by advantaged group members. Those who value dominance and hierarchy likely experience status threat, or the concern that they will lose their material advantages. Those who strongly value achievement and meritocracy may face meritocratic threat, or a fear that group privilege calls their accomplishments into question. Finally, those who endorse egalitarian values may feel moral-image threat, or concern that their membership in a group guilty of past or present wrongdoing reflects negatively on them.

Different threats evoke different identity-management strategies. The defend strategy, in which one affirms the legitimacy and, ultimately, the stability of the intergroup hierarchy, is useful in coping with status threat. The deny strategy, in which one underplays the amount of inequality in society, is effective in dispelling both status and meritocratic threats. Obscuring the hierarchy both renders it safe from critique and also shields the self against the power of group advantage to discount personal accomplishments. The distancing from identity and distancing from inequality strategies, in which members of advantaged groups eschew thoughts of group identity or come to regard inequality as not personally relevant, combat meritocratic and moral-image threats by summarily shielding the self from the negative implications of advantaged-group membership. Finally, the dismantling strategy, in which the advantaged endorse actions and policies that reduce their privilege, dispels moral-image threats by recasting the group as committed to the values of fairness and equity.

### Revenge versus rapport: interrogation, terrorism, and torture [^59dd4a54]. The American Psychologist (2017). Low credibility.

This review begins with the historical context of harsh interrogation methods that have been used repeatedly since the Second World War. This is despite the legal, ethical and moral sanctions against them and the lack of evidence for their efficacy. Revenge-motivated interrogations (Carlsmith & Sood, 2009) regularly occur in high conflict, high uncertainty situations and where there is dehumanization of the enemy. These methods are diametrically opposed to the humanization process required for adopting rapport-based methods-for which there is an increasing corpus of studies evidencing their efficacy. We review this emerging field of study and show how rapport-based methods rely on building alliances and involve a specific set of interpersonal skills on the part of the interrogator. We conclude with 2 key propositions: (a) for psychologists to firmly maintain the Hippocratic Oath of "first do no harm", irrespective of perceived threat and uncertainty, and (b) for wider recognition of the empirical evidence that rapport-based approaches work and revenge tactics do not. Proposition (a) is directly in line with fundamental ethical principles of practice for anyone in a caring profession. Proposition (b) is based on the requirement for psychology to protect and promote human welfare and to base conclusions on objective evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record

### The child witness in the courtroom [^8078679b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Impact of testifying on child mental health — studies have established that children experience anxiety surrounding court appearances with the main fear of facing the defendant; other fears include being hurt by the defendant, embarrassment about crying or not being able to answer questions, and going to jail, and the more frightened a child is, the less he or she is able to answer questions; the greatest predictors of inadequate responses are young age and severity of abuse, and postponements cause emotional difficulties while having to testify more than once is associated with long-term mental health problems; for short-term effects, in a matched control study in 218 children those who testified were more likely to experience anxiety and reported that delay increased their anxiety, with anxiety diminishing after trial except for those without maternal support; documented and theoretical benefits of testifying include decreased anxiety, feeling less victimized, and a greater sense of control, and a child's anxiety can be decreased through the use of child advocates and other support people; for long-term follow-up, 176 children were interviewed 12 years after testifying, and children who testified when younger had more severe externalizing.

### Exploring how to tell the truth and preserve hope: can a balance between communication and empathy be calculated? [^b2c02e39]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

When told the harsh truth about severe disease, a patient might despair and lose all hope. Without knowing the truth, however, the patient cannot participate in decision making and adjust life according to his illness. The present study aims to analyze the relationships between hope and truth in the decision on how much information to disclose to a patient with severe gastrointestinal disease.

Methods

The decision analysis is based on the economic concepts of indifference curves and utility function. An inverse linear relationship exists between hope and truth; as more truth becomes revealed, the amount of hope declines. The utility function and the corresponding indifference curve of hope plotted versus truth describe the patient's personal choices among different combinations of hope and truth. The optimal choice among various combinations of hope and truth corresponds with the point at which the inverse hope-truth line meets the indifference curve.

Results

In situations in which hope drops steeply as more medical facts are being revealed, the utility to the patient is maximized with less truth being told. With a less pronounced truth-related decline in hope, utility is maximized at higher levels of truth, and, occasionally, utility is maximized only after all medical facts have been disclosed. The lesser the impact of truth on hope, the more truth is being tolerated.

Conclusions

A caring gastroenterologist trying to optimize his/her patient's well-being should try to assess the potential influence of truth on the patient's psyche and dispense it accordingly.

### Predicting what will happen when we act. what counts for warrant? [^58aa35d9]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To what extent do the results of randomized controlled trials inform our predictions about the effectiveness of potential policy interventions? This crucial question is often overlooked in discussions about evidence-based policy. The view I defend is that the arguments that lead from the claim that a program works somewhere to a prediction about the effectiveness of this program as it will be implemented here rests on many premises, most of which cannot be justified by the results of randomized controlled trials. Randomized controlled trials only provide indirect evidence for effectiveness, and we need much more than just randomized- controlled-trial results to make reliable predictions.

### Prosocial preferences can escalate intergroup conflicts by countering selfish motivations to leave [^3827a202]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Because our task clearly specifies the different actions and underlying incentives of conflicting parties in a controlled environment –, we can observe whether, when, and why individuals stay and help with collective defense or, alternatively, leave and abandon their group. We anticipated, first, that defenders' willingness to abandon their group depends on the personal (economic) cost of leaving and we hypothesized that defenders leave when its personal benefits outweigh the expected benefits of conflict participation. Relatedly, we expected that, if the cost of leaving is not at a maximum, individuals who are more risk averse may be more inclined to leave, given that staying in a conflict involves a risk of defeat — an outcome to which risk-averse individuals are particularly sensitive –. Loss aversion could also increase defenders' willingness to leave: the possibility that defenders could lose everything if they stay may loom larger than any potential gains.

An individual-level cost-benefit analysis of staying or leaving can be considered selfish, since it only considers own outcomes and can result in other group members being left behind. Consequently, group members who are left behind need to (and are expected to) fight harder to not be defeated and, as a result, have to waste more resources on conflict. In the decision to leave, people may therefore not only be motivated by self-centered cost-benefit considerations but also (to different degrees) by social considerations of solidarity — the psychological bond felt with and commitment to fellow in-group members — and the concern for others' welfare (henceforth pro-sociality). Archival data indeed revealed that the likelihood of deserting groups (negatively) correlates with the presence of group norms of cooperation and solidarity, and past experiments have shown that pro-social preferences influence how much people contribute to group defense. Interestingly, there is some evidence suggesting that individuals with pro-social preferences may invest in collective defense especially to protect vulnerable others who lack the financial means, social capital, or physical ability to defend themselves. Possibly, individuals who can leave, even at low cost, may therefore be less likely to leave when others in their group cannot.

### Neural mechanisms of the mood effects on third-party responses to injustice after unfair experiences [^4a0d26f3]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Imagine a judge who has just experienced unfair treatment (second‐party experience) is dealing with a case involving other's unfair encounters. Then, what decision will the judge make in court of third‐party judicial justice? Would the judge restore justice by compensating the victim who receives unfair treatment or punishing the fairness norm violator? Daily, we may be faced with the situation that our third‐party responses to injustice can be influenced by our personal unfair experiences, but the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive.

Individuals may be "second‐party" people whose economic payoff are directly affected by the norm violation, while an uninvolved outside party who happens to know that the norm violation occurred is "third‐party" people (Fehr & Fischbacher). Third‐party responses to injustice may greatly enhance the scope for norms that regulate human behavior (Fehr & Fischbacher). For example, an allocator may split an unfair amount of money between oneself and a receiver. Then, individuals as unaffected third parties costly punish the allocator or compensate the receiver to injustice (FeldmanHall et al.). Third‐party punishment and compensation are the typical means of ensuring fair and equitable outcomes (Fehr & Fischbacher; FeldmanHall et al.). Third‐party punishment discourages social norm violation by harming allocators and leaving them worse off (e.g. Deutchman et al; Karagonlar & Kuhlman; Sanfey et al.). Third‐party compensation typically addresses the receiver's needs and restores one's reputation, by endowing the victim (the individual who receives less) with the offender's money instead of focusing on punishing the offender (Heffner & FeldmanHall). Collectively, both third‐party punishment and third‐party compensation are available norm‐enforcing mechanisms.

### Listeners' perceptions of the certainty and honesty of a speaker are associated with a common prosodic signature [^ca634d48]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Research on deception detection has shown that observers are relatively poor at detecting liars explicitly in laboratory settings. As mentioned above, this is partly explained by the fact that liars have a relative control over their displays, with the consequence that no behavioral cue to deceit is mandatory. Yet, it has also been suggested that there is a dissociation between explicit and implicit (or intuitive) abilities to detect lies. While observers may be quite good at picking up relevant cues unconsciously (or intuitively), they may not always use them to overtly and explicitly report dishonesty, in particular if they assess that "the costs of failing to detect deception (are inferior to) those of signaling distrust", or if they have been taught to rely on cues that turn out to be unreliable such as gaze aversion.

### Temperamental contributions to the affect family of anxiety [^54fedb05]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The discovery of pharmacologic interventions that mute the intensity of anxiety and guilt in some individuals has been a benevolent gift to those who suffer from these disabling states. Although some commentators have wondered about the social consequences of large numbers of asymptomatic persons taking these drugs, few have questioned the advantages for the smaller group of anguished patients. It is likely, however, that, during the next century, scientists will discover a drug that eliminates the feeling components of guilt and remorse while leaving intact the semantic knowledge that certain acts are ethically improper. An individual who took this drug regularly would continue to know that deceiving a friend, lying to a client, and stealing from an employer are morally wrong but would be protected from the uncomfortable feeling of guilt or remorse that accompanies a violation of a personal moral standard. It is reasonable to wonder, therefore, whether our society would be changed in a major way if many citizens were protected from guilt and remorse. Most Western philosophers, especially Kant, made reason the bedrock of conscience. People acted properly, Kant believed, because they knew that the behavior was morally right. All individuals wish to regard the self as virtuous and try to avoid the uncertainty that follows detection of the inconsistency that is created when they behave in ways that are not in accord with their view of the self's desirable attributes. Kant believed that, although the moral emotions restrain asocial acts, they were not necessary for the conduct of a moral life. On the other hand, some philosophers, such as Peirce and Dewey, argued that anticipation of anxiety, shame, and guilt motivate a continued loyalty to one's ethical standards. A person who was certain that he or she was protected from these uncomfortable emotions would find it easier to ignore the moral imperatives acquired during childhood and adolescence. It is not obvious that a drug that blocks remorse also will eliminate the mutual social obligations that make a society habitable; nonetheless, a posture of vigilance that is appropriate for — unlike gorillas — humans can hold representations of envy, anger, and dislike toward people they have never met for a very long time. While we wait for future inquiry to resolve this issue, it is useful to acknowledge that a satisfying analysis of this problem will require a deeper appreciation of the differences between the representations of the biological events that are the foundation of an emotion and the representations that define the semantic networks for the concepts good and bad.

Given that science has been so successful, the threat imposed by post-truth thinking seems distant, and unlikely to emerge within the modern scientific community. However, it bears emphasis that scientists engage in post-truth thinking, often with the best intentions, and often without knowing it. There are several likely explanations for how this might occur. First, the rapidly changing nature of science means it can disrupt existing paradigms, so that scientists whose body of scientific work depends on existing paradigms may be slow(er) and or resistant to adopt new ideas. I can recall sitting in various study sections listening to rigorous discussions from learned colleagues about how a new idea proposed in a grant could not possibly be true because that new idea did not conform to the existing paradigms. In this setting, the debate over what is true and false is ultimately determined by the conditions under which what is true and false is decided. Another explanation is that what is deemed as the truth scientifically is often context dependent. Philosophers have termed this concept "epistemic relativism," emphasizing that there are no facts, only interpretations of facts. As physician scientists, we study diseases that are the result of perturbations that arise within complex, homeostatic biological systems that have become dysregulated for some reason. In one context, blocking the biological system may lead to loss of homeostasis and worsening outcomes; in another context, blocking the dysregulated system may lead to improved outcomes. Thus, the data provided by rigorously performed scientific studies are rarely black and white and are dependent on the contextual boundaries imposed by the experimental conditions chosen by the investigator. Third, and this may come as a shock, the scientific community is not immune to investigators who purvey fake news, alternative facts, and things that are just not true. Fortunately, in my experience, these individuals are rare. In his 1988 Presidential Address to the American Society for Clinical Investigation, Robert Lefkowitz spoke eloquently about the 3 elements of the spirit of science: enthusiasm for new knowledge, creativity, and integrity. Lefkowitz described integrity as "an unswerving commitment to what we perceive as true and right, and to a set of consistent, personally realized principles of action." He states:

### Evidence-based medicine: not a slam dunk [^1034088d]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is not easy. Some difficulties are obvious, such as the difficulty to mount a powerful random prospective controlled study. This article, however, will deal with 2 types of not-so-obvious, difficulties that plague clinicians who advocate evidence-based medicine. The first type has to do with our knowledge base. We tend to think of our knowledge base as being a collection of facts that represent absolute truth and are completely dependable now and will be for the future. It is more likely that these facts are better thought of as beliefs that are fragile and about which we should be skeptical. The second type of difficulty has to do with the human brain and its ability to reach valid decisions. Let us first consider difficulties with establishing good outcome measures that are essential for good evidence.

### Committee opinion no. 681: disclosure and discussion of adverse events [^65f783e0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Disclosure and discussion of adverse events — organizational guidance emphasizes culture, policies, and support. Health care facilities should establish a nonpunitive, blame-free culture that encourages staff to report adverse events and near misses (close calls) without fear of retaliation, and health care institutions should have written policies that address the management of adverse events. Coordinated responses to adverse events also must include identification and treatment of the health care practitioners and ancillary staff who become "second victims." The document adds that having a responsive process to inform and aid the patient, loved ones, and practitioners is required, and that after an adverse outcome, patients expect and want timely and full disclosure of the event, an acknowledgment of responsibility, an understanding of what happened, expressions of sympathy, and a discussion of what is being done to prevent recurrence.

### Positing a difference between acts and omissions: the principle of justice, rachels' cases and moral weakness [^9df045c2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

The difficulty in discovering a difference between killing and letting die has led many philosophers to deny the distinction. This paper seeks to develop an argument defending the distinction between killing and letting die. In relation to Rachels' cases, the argument is that (a) even accepting that Smith and Jones may select equally heinous options from the choices they have available to them, (b) the fact that the choices available to them are different is morally relevant, and (c) this difference in available choices can be used to distinguish between the agents in certain circumstances. It is the principle of justice, as espoused by Aristotle, which requires that equal things are treated equally and that unequal things are treated unequally that creates a presumption that Smith and Jones should be treated differently. The magnitude of this difference can be amplified by other premises, making the distinction morally relevant in practical reality.

### Questionable benefits and unavoidable personal beliefs: defending conscientious objection for abortion [^0584c182]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conscientious objection in healthcare has come under heavy criticism on two grounds recently, particularly regarding abortion provision. First, critics claim conscientious objection involves a refusal to provide a legal and beneficial procedure requested by a patient, denying them access to healthcare. Second, they argue the exercise of conscientious objection is based on unverifiable personal beliefs. These characteristics, it is claimed, disqualify conscientious objection in healthcare. Here, we defend conscientious objection in the context of abortion provision. We show that abortion has a dubitable claim to be medically beneficial, is rarely clinically indicated, and that conscientious objections should be accepted in these circumstances. We also show that reliance on personal beliefs is difficult to avoid if any form of objection is to be permitted, even if it is based on criteria such as the principles and values of the profession or the scope of professional practice.

### Threat credibility and weapons of mass destruction [^04f997e7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Individual or collective preparedness for an attack involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD) must be based on an analysis of the threat. In threat assessment one takes many factors into account, including the physical and psychological parameters of the attacker. Although the potential devastation caused by WMD is significant, there are many limitations to the effective use of such weapons. Casualty rates will likely be measured in the thousands rather than millions because of factors that will be discussed. The psychological ramifications, it should be noted, the permutations of which have not yet been defined, will be much longer lasting. In this paper the author discusses these and other characteristics of the current threat.

### Supporting the grieving child and family [^871ac54e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Component death concepts and implications for adjustment to loss — Key components include "Irreversibility: death is a permanent phenomenon from which there is no recovery or return," "Finality (nonfunctionality): death is a state in which all life functions cease completely," "Inevitability (universality): death is a natural phenomenon that no living being can escape indefinitely," and "Causality: the child develops a realistic understanding of the causes of death." Incomplete understanding is exemplified when "the child expects the deceased to return, as if from a trip," "the child worries about a buried relative being cold or in pain," or "the child who relies on magical thinking is apt to assume responsibility for the death of a loved one by assuming that bad thoughts or unrelated actions were causative"; implications include that failure to comprehend "prevents the child from detaching personal ties to the deceased, a necessary first step in successful mourning," "may lead to preoccupation with physical suffering of the deceased and impair readjustment," and "tends to lead to excessive guilt that is difficult for the child to resolve," with risk that "he/she is likely to view death as punishment (either for actions or thoughts of the deceased or the child), leading to excessive guilt and shame."

### 'History obligates us to do it': political capabilities of indigenous grassroots leaders of health accountability initiatives in rural Guatemala [^7180e87f]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Data collection took place in three phases, and the profile of participants in each phase, including their roles in their communities, is presented in table 1. In the first phase in early 2017, CEGSS field staff and the research team facilitated workshops on network strengthening where the defenders and their collaborators reported on relationships in their current network and brainstormed on contacts who represented potential resources for their work. The network analysis is reported elsewhere, and the present study included the research team's field notes from these workshops and brainstorming sessions. In the second phase around 6 months later, participants were invited back, and the research team presented the network maps generated from the first phase and facilitated an interpretive discussion to deepen understanding of how the network works together. Discussions were conducted in Spanish, and CEGSS field staff supported interpretation to local Indigenous languages when needed. The discussion guide focused on the initiative participants' history of collaboration, how they communicate and organise action for health accountability and their interactions with authorities. It should be noted that the lead defenders and some of the collaborators who had recognised voices of authority in their communities were more vocal in the discussions, and the field staff and research team members sought to ensure all participant voices were heard by repeating the questions to less vocal individuals. Alongside the insights these group discussions provided into the resources that their networks offered, the research team and field staff identified that defenders' accounts also provided an inside view of their strategic learning and thinking around the right to health and how to influence the population and authorities. This observation led to a third phase of data collection, which consisted in six follow-up interviews with the lead defender from each of the three municipalities and the CEGSS field staff members who support their work. Follow-up interviews focused on local action and strategies for mobilising action and getting results for health accountability, and they allowed for member-checking of initial insights obtained in the group discussions as well as triangulation of the accounts of the field staff and lead defender for each municipal site. Group discussions and follow-up interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Informed consent was obtained from participants at each stage of data collection by presenting the purpose and steps of the study to the group and facilitating a discussion in which each person had the opportunity to state their view on participating prior to providing consent. This procedure reflects CEGSS' organisational learning about the need for collective as well as individual deliberation in arriving to meaningful informed consent.

Communicating science to the public is not always a straightforward process. In the case of vaccines, fear and lack of knowledge makes it even more challenging. We present some suggestions on how to defend the methods and fruits of scientific investigation to the public: 1) stand up for science, even if it not an easy task, 2) remember that no venue it too small, 3) don't let bad information go unchallenged, 4) don't assume other people are doing it, they are not and 5) remember that scientist have a responsibility to the public.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^ebad60f3]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

In the sustained WM trial (STEP 4, NCT03548987), 902 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. Those completing a 20‐week run‐in period are being randomly assigned in a 2:1 manner to receive continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo for an additional 48 weeks to assess WL (Figure 4, Table 1). Approximately 750 eligible participants will be randomly assigned. In addition, it has a withdrawal trial design to assess the change in weight after switching from semaglutide to placebo.

Sustained weight management trial design (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity 4). This is a 68‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐armed, multicenter, multinational withdrawal clinical trial, with 7 weeks of follow‐up without treatment for safety assessments, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) with placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, in people with obesity or overweight. *During the 20‐week run‐in period, participants start a dose escalation (visit 2 [week 0]) with semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity for 20 weeks. The run‐in period includes 4 weeks at the target dose (semaglutide subcutaneously, 2.4 mg once weekly).

In the long‐term WM trial (STEP 5, NCT03693430), 304 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo to assess WL (Figure 5, Table 1) over a 2‐year period.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The methodology of STEP 1 and 4 has been described previously.

2.1 Study designs

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial (Figure S1). Participants were randomized 2:1 to once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, with lifestyle intervention for 68 weeks. STEP 4 (NCT03548987) was a randomized withdrawal trial in which all participants received semaglutide during a 20‐week run‐in period (Figure S2). Participants reaching the once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg target maintenance dose at week 20 were randomized 2:1 to continue semaglutide or switch to placebo for 48 weeks. All participants received lifestyle intervention throughout the 68 weeks.

Both trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Protocols were approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each study site. All participants provided written informed consent.

2.2 Study population

Participants in both trials were aged ≥ 18 years with one or more self‐reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with one or more weight‐related comorbidity without diabetes.

### International REACH forgiveness intervention: a multisite randomised controlled trial [^6f0afb25]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

The workbook also holds potential for public health and prevention efforts. Being wronged is a common experience. Evidence here and elsewhereindicates forgiveness interventions can reduce depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the ease with which such workbooks can be disseminated, national and international forgiveness campaigns could be launched to promote forgiveness and thereby also address mental health concerns.

In dissemination efforts, questions concerning whether forgiveness is morally appropriate also need to be addressed. In this, it is important to distinguish forgiveness from excusing, forgetting, reconciling, forbearing, or not demanding justice. Forgiveness, conceived of simply as replacing ill-will towards the offender with good-will, can take place even while still pursuing a just outcome, and also without necessarily restoring the relationship. Thus, provided the victim does not deny the wrong that was done or its implications or deny or suppress feelings about it, arguments have been advanced that forgiveness — understood as the replacing of ill-will towards the offender with good-will — can always be morally appropriate and can take place regardless of whether the wrongdoer repents or asks for forgiveness. Forgiveness does not entail foregoing justice. These distinctions are critical esspecially if forgiveness is promoted in clinical or community settings. Forgiveness may also have broader societal implications. Forgiveness, by replacing ill-will towards another with good-will, may prompt more prosocial action that may itself propagate, thereby potentially helping to heal division.

### Research participants' perspectives regarding the feedback of secondary findings – A cohort from the DDD-Africa study, South Africa [^50b7e540]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Medium credibility.

Having accurate information regarding disease causation

Participants explained that an advantage of receiving secondary findings was that if they were subsequently diagnosed with the condition, they would understand what caused it. This could avoid unnecessary investigations and would also save time on them trying to seek answers. They would also be able to explain to others what is going on and what has caused the condition:

I agree with them. Knowing what is happening instead of blaming yourself, you're brainstorming or you're trying to look for answers and questions. At least you've got a path now that you can follow, that you've got some sort of answers, but you've also got an understanding of what is happening.

Research is there to relieve uncertainty and at the end of the day it helps you to be grounded. At least now I know.

An important aspect that participants raised was being able to disprove misinformation about disease onset:

That's what I'm saying, let me rather have those results from the research. I'll be sitting back and seeing that I've exhausted all avenues. And even if someone comes in and says "maybe it's because of… " I'll have a leg to stand on that there's no maybe.

Excluding witchcraft accusations was also an important consideration by the groups. In African culture, there is a strong belief in witchcraft and the belief that curses can be placed on family members. Members of the community also turn to traditional healers for medical advice and intervention. Understanding that there is an underlying genetic cause for disease onset would exclude witchcraft accusations where this may have been one of the first potential causes investigated in the community (Anizoba,):

### Randomized controlled trials versus real world evidence: neither magic nor myth [^649c9108]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, the need for additional sources of (non‐RCT) evidence and better methods for evidence synthesis is coming to the fore in the increasingly common situation of detecting small effects in small target populations. It is easy to detect large effects, like cure or complete and durable disappearance of symptoms, either by way of randomized or even nonrandomized methods, but small effects are tricky to demonstrate. Yet, some beneficial drug effects may be described as small in terms of evidence generation but may still be relevant in the eyes of patients. Sufficiently large randomized trials, which could reliably assess such effects are not feasible, due to a scarcity of patients. On the other hand, nonrandomized real‐world studies may be doable (e.g. by relying on external control groups from various sources), as discussed above. However, the potential biases can be appreciable, so the results often cannot be trusted when the benefits of a treatment are only moderate. 1 In this situation, all options available to decision makers look unattractive. Should strict evidence standards be maintained, potentially denying patients a relevant benefit "because there is no robust evidence"? Or should evidence standards be relaxed, giving patients the benefit of the doubt, but at the risk of doing more harm than good?

There is, in our view, no single obvious solution to address the uncertainty resulting from unavoidably scarce evidence. However, to avoid potentially inconsistent one‐off decisions we submit that regulatory (and other decision) frameworks will need to evolve to encompass four elements when decisions are taken under these circumstances:

An agreement on the level of evidence needed at the point of initial authorization and market launch, including an agreement on what evidence can be derived from RCTs and/or (nonrandomized) real‐world studies.
Rigorous on‐market follow‐up of clinical outcomes in, ideally, the majority of patients, not only of safety but also effectiveness, with a view to progressively maximizing the understanding of benefits and harms. Where applicable, the postmarketing evidence generation plan should address the continuum of evolving RCT and nonrandomized RWE evidentiary value over time.
Transparent, explicit, and retraceable synthesis of the available evidence including its limitations and trade‐offs in the decision, and
a regulatory (and Health Technology Assessment or payers') framework that allows frequent assessment and communication of new information and refinement of regulatory and other decisions as knowledge accumulates over time.

2 CASE REPORT

On May 4, 2020 the family of patient M, a 70‐year‐old female, single, with completed higher education, without children and without medical, psychiatric, or neurological comorbidities, a resident of Brasília with a 63‐year‐old sister, made contact and asked for medical assistance at home considering the risk of contagion by COVID‐19. They reported that in the previous week M had been suspicious, withdrawn, and accusing her four brothers and some neighbors of setting her up to be arrested by the police. She claimed to be hearing whispers and plans, through the walls, of people in the building where she lives accusing her of being a murderer, claiming she had murdered her own mother 7 years ago. She defended herself, saying that her mother died of lung problems and an infectious condition in a hospital in the city. In addition, M had insomnia and spent the nights walking and accusing her neighbors, saying that she would not accept this injustice and would react. She often said that she heard sirens, and a day before the medical appointment, she was sure that the police were at the building's entrance to try to take her to the city's prison. She said that she often heard screams of "killer" directed at her and believed that there were secret meetings conducted with the intention of taking her as a prisoner. There have been some suspicions of dementia in her family (some uncles) in the past, but the patients had died many years ago, so there is no official documentation confirming that diagnosis.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^05ea63aa]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Crisis and emergency risk communication — panic management guidance — states "Do not try to dispel panic" and that "Panic during a crisis is rare. People nearly always behave in a rational way during a crisis." When "told what to do by those in authority, people followed instructions," but "If no one is in charge and no advice is forthcoming people may:" "Assess the situation, and, based on their experiences, determine a course of action," "Take calm, self-protective actions that seem rational and appropriate to them, even if authorities recommend otherwise," and "Feel anxiety, fear, and even delayed panic attacks or PTSD when the crisis ends." The guidance advises to "Recognize the differences among your audience" because "A person anticipating high risk is much more likely to respond inappropriately than a person in the heat of the battle, who will act on the information and doesn't have the time to rethink," and notes that "the more removed people are from the real danger (in place and time), the more likely they are to allow their emotions full range." It emphasizes that "The condition most conducive to panic isn't bad news — it's conflicting messages from those in authority," with people upset when "They can't trust what those in authority are telling them," and warns, "If you start hedging or hiding the bad news, you increase the risk of a confused, angry, and uncooperative public."

### Deliberately ignoring inequality to avoid rejecting unfair offers [^d5ac2602]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The mean probabilities of ignorance for conditions one, two, three, and four were 25%, 64%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. These findings suggested that costs for seeking information could be expected to lead to a floor effect in information search, and that the instructions employed in condition two (where participants were informed about how the proposer's endowments had been determined, whether the other person would be informed about their information seeking or not, and whether the interaction would be anonymous or not) could be expected to neither lead to a floor nor a ceiling effect in information search. Based on these findings, instructions from condition two were used in the main study to employ a study design for which neither floor nor ceiling effects would be expected.

While the detection of a positive effect of ignorance on punishment was not the primary objective of our pilot studies, our second pilot study nonetheless provided preliminary evidence for it. In particular, among the 31% of participants that chose to seek information, 33% rejected an unfair offer – broadly in line with historic UG rejection rates. In contrast, among the 69% of our participants who chose not to know whether they had been treated unfairly, only 3% rejected the offer.

### Both [^58646f1b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As I look back on our interactions, I am troubled by two things. First, she knew we were waiting for a decision — she responded to an unsaid question and felt pressure to find a response from the minute I walked into the room. Second, through fear, she said "I" can't decide today. She assumed she was making this decision on her own.

We are lucky to have moments with our patients to understand who they are, what their narrative is, and how they envision living with their ailments. We frame preference‐sensitive decision‐making as putting the patient in control, respecting autonomy, and empowering them to make the decision most aligned with their values. But what if what they desire is both longevity and comfort? Autonomy means that everyone has the ability and opportunity to exercise self‐determination — to exert control over their life with their decisions. Yet autonomy does not mean that an individual exerts this power independently, without the support of loved ones, confidantes, and advisors, which may include clinicians on the medical team. When we present patients with a decision, do we actually abandon them to make a choice on their own? We aim to arm patients with knowledge and statistics, but inevitably, the options are heavily framed. When we say "and," do we actually mean it?

Confronted with rare diseases, unique patient circumstances, and the burgeoning public availability of medical information, we are expected to provide answers to questions. Why did this happen? Why me? What are the next steps? What is the prognosis? Patients confide in us, explaining the intimate details of their lives so we can assess their story, use our expertise to connect it to the pathophysiology of their condition, and treat them. We deliver the answers we learned through our training, clinical experience, discussion with colleagues, and review of medical literature. However, in telling us their narrative, patients become part of our stories. We create an illness script built from the phrases, exam findings, lab results, and outcomes with pieces built from every patient we have seen. Our communication about a condition evolves with each patient we treat. We practice and we refine. Yet answers may remain elusive.

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^7263b3e8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Differences between clinical and forensic evaluations — Clinical evaluation aims to "relieve suffering" within a "doctor–patient" relationship serving "the patient," with "fiduciary duty to patient; duty to patient's best interests; patient's welfare is primary," to "help heal the patient," where "confidentiality usually applies," focusing to "establish diagnosis and treatment plan," with "treatment rendered," using "self-report; occasionally outside information; some collateral records," accepting that "therapeutic bias occurs; desire for patient to get better; willingness to advocate for patient," and producing "establish therapeutic relationship; improve well-being of patient"; in contrast, forensic evaluation aims to "answer a legal question" within an "evaluator–evaluee" relationship serving "the court, attorney, or other retaining agency," with "fiduciary duty to court, attorney, or other retaining agency," to "by report or testimony, inform and teach the retaining agency and fact finder, i.e., judge or jury," where "privilege may apply," to "conduct objective evaluation; diagnosis may be nonessential," with "no treatment rendered, although it may be recommended," using "extensive collection of data including serial interviews, information from additional historians, review of records and documents," maintaining "purposeful lack of bias; attempt to be neutral and objective; no investment in outcome," and producing "answer the referral question in the form of a verbal or written report; deposition; and/or testimony."

### Supporting the grieving child and family: clinical report [^5d2a74dd]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Component death concepts and implications for adjustment to loss are defined as follows: Irreversibility is described as "death is a permanent phenomenon from which there is no recovery or return," with incomplete understanding when "the child expects the deceased to return, as if from a trip," which can mean "failure to comprehend this concept prevents the child from modifying personal ties to the deceased, a necessary first step in successful mourning." Finality (nonfunctionality) is "death is a state in which all life functions cease completely," and misunderstanding may appear when "the child worries about a buried relative being cold or in pain," leading to implications that misunderstanding "may lead to preoccupation with physical suffering of the deceased and impair readjustment." Inevitability (universality) is "death is a natural phenomenon that no living being can escape indefinitely," with incomplete understanding when "the child views significant individuals (ie, self, parents) as immortal," and the implication that "if the child does not view death as inevitable, he or she is likely to view death as punishment (either for actions or thoughts of the deceased or the child), leading to excessive guilt and shame." Causality is that "the child develops a realistic understanding of the causes of death," whereas incomplete understanding occurs when "the child who relies on magical thinking is apt to assume responsibility," which "tends to lead to excessive guilt that is difficult for the child to resolve."

Changes in Endothelial Function Based on (1) 10 000 Steps/Day Threshold and (2) 30 Min/Day MPA Average

Twenty‐nine subjects reached ≥ 10 000 steps/day by the end of the study protocol. As shown in Figure 3 A¸ step count increased to a significantly greater extent in the group that achieved a ≥ 10 000 steps/day average compared with those who did not meet this goal (4803 ± 1531 to 5741 ± 2111 steps versus 6069 ± 1371 to 12486 ± 1947 steps, P < 0.001 overall, P < 0.001 time×group interaction, P < 0.001 between groups at week 12). Similarly, the 46 subjects who achieved ≥ 30 min/day of MPA by week 12 also significantly increased their step count over the study period while those who did not achieve this goal did not reach 10 000 steps (4825 ± 1604 to 5327 ± 2671 steps versus 5570 ± 1517 to 10196 ± 3149, P < 0.001 overall, P < 0.001 time×group interaction, P < 0.001 between groups at week 12, Figure 3 B). There was no interaction between FMD% changes over time and achieving either ≥ 10 000 steps/day or ≥ 30 min/day of MPA (P = 0.40 and 0.93 for time×group interaction terms for ≥ 10 000 steps/day and ≥ 30 min/day, respectively Figures 3 C and 3 D).

### The legacy of "just the facts" [^fbe407dc]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

This commentary to the capstone paper by Keshavan and colleagues reflects on the history of this project and the challenging nature of curating and establishing facts. While a number of approaches exist, none of them in-and-of-themselves are without drawbacks. A combination of techniques may provide the most satisfying results. We emphasize the importance of determining what facts are specific to the disorder - a particularly challenging endeavor - and the usefulness of various ways of quantifying these facts.

### Randomized controlled trials versus real world evidence: neither magic nor myth [^f1db55ba]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The second scenario, at the other extreme end of the spectrum, will be a growing number of drugs for ultra‐rare diseases, very small subpopulations, or individualized treatments where adequately powered RCTs are impossible to conduct.

These drug‐indication pairs require a rethink of the traditional evidence generation paradigm, characterized by clinical trials conducted in a small sample of selected patients with a hope that the trial patients will be more or less representative of the much larger target population for whom the conclusions are drawn; in this traditional scenario, the majority of patients treated after marketing approval contribute little or nothing to knowledge generation, the research setting is separate from the treatment setting.

By contrast, with some niche products, the study population and the target population will become near‐identical, as almost every new patient treated will necessarily become a trial patient throughout the life span of the drug (i.e. before and after an initial marketing authorization). Hence, the research and treatment settings will increasingly overlap. The good news is, when the trial population is the target population, concerns over representativeness or external validity of results become a moot point.

### Daily step count and postprandial fat metabolism [^55681b71]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Two benefits of acute exercise are the next day's lowering of the postprandial plasma triglyceride response to a high-fat meal and increased fat oxidation. However, if activity levels (daily steps) are very low, these acute adaptations to exercise do not occur. This phenomenon has been termed "exercise resistance". This study sought to systematically reduce daily step number and identify the range of step counts that elicit "exercise resistance".

Methods

Ten participants completed three, 5-d trials in a randomized, crossover design with differing levels of step reduction. After 2 d of controlled activity, participants completed 2 d of LOW, LIMITED, or NORMAL steps (2675 ± 314, 4759 ± 276, and 8481 ± 581 steps per day, respectively). Participants completed a 1-h bout of running on the evening of the second day. High-fat tolerance tests were performed on the next morning, and postprandial responses were compared.

Results

After LOW and LIMITED, postprandial incremental area under the curve (AUC) of plasma triglyceride was elevated 22%-23% compared with NORMAL (P < 0.05). Whole body fat oxidation was also significantly lower (16%-19%, P < 0.05, respectively) in LOW and LIMITED compared with NORMAL. No significant differences were found between LOW and LIMITED.

Conclusion

Two days of step reduction to approximately 2500–5000 steps per day in young healthy individuals impairs the ability of an acute bout of exercise to increase fat oxidation and attenuate postprandial increases in plasma triglycerides. This suggests that "exercise resistance" occurs in individuals taking approximately 5000 or fewer steps per day, whereas 8500 steps per day protects against exercise resistance in fat metabolism. It seems that fat metabolism is influenced more by the inhibitory effects of inactivity than by the stimulating effects derived from 1 h of moderate-intensity running.

Don't start stupid fights, and don't make enemies (except on purpose!). Fight for a reason or a goal. Have a plan for ending the conflict that includes the details when, where, why, how, and who. Within the fight, see it as a complex negotiation. Although you may get emotional, try to stay cerebral and understand what you and your opponent are doing and when it is time to stop. When the fighting stops, repair the damage and start preparing for the next conflict.

### Rationale and design of the phase 3a development programme (ONWARDS 1–6 trials) investigating once-weekly insulin icodec in diabetes [^286c01c6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Trials in insulin‐naive people with

For ONWARDS 1, 3 and 5, only individuals who are insulin‐naive are eligible for inclusion (Table 1). These trials represent individuals with T2D who have inadequate glycaemic control with their current non‐insulin glucose‐lowering agents (including glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists) and are therefore eligible to begin insulin.

2.2.1 ONWARDS 1

ONWARDS 1 (NCT04460885) is a treat‐to‐target trial, in which participants are randomized to treatment with once‐weekly icodec or once‐daily glargine U100, both in combination with non‐insulin glucose‐lowering drugs. Participants may continue such pretrial non‐insulin background drugs, except for sulphonylureas and glinides, which are discontinued at randomization (Table 1).

With 78 weeks of randomized treatment, ONWARDS 1 will have the longest randomized treatment period of all the ONWARDS trials. The effect of icodec will be evaluated after a 52‐week main phase followed by a 26‐week extension phase to evaluate efficacy and long‐term safety (Figure 1A).

2.2.2 ONWARDS 3

In the ONWARDS 3 (NCT04795531) double‐blinded, double‐dummy, treat‐to‐target trial, participants are randomized to receive once‐weekly icodec or once‐daily insulin degludec (degludec), both in combination with non‐insulin glucose‐lowering agents (with appropriate placebos administered in both treatment arms) for 26 weeks. Participants can continue treatment with these pretrial medications; however, sulphonylureas or glinides will be administered at a reduced (50%) dose at the discretion of the investigator (Table 1; Figure 1B).

Unique factors in pediatric cases — In cases that reach trial, some authorities note that jurors generally can be effective in assessing expert testimony; however, in civil cases involving children, aspects such as sympathy for the child, the gravity or severity of the injury, or altruistic motivations may unduly influence triers. A jury might be influenced by the needs of a family with an infant with neurologic impairment or a ventilator-dependent teenager. The use of malpractice awards to compensate for adverse outcomes not caused by medical negligence is neither the intent nor proper usage of the system, and objective expert witness testimony is needed to prevent unjust outcomes.

### Deprivations, futures and the wrongness of killing [^53634165]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

In my essay, Why abortion is immoral, I criticised discussions of the morality of abortion in which the crucial issue is whether fetuses are human beings or whether fetuses are persons. Both argument strategies are inadequate because they rely on indefensible assumptions. Why should being a human being or being a person make a moral difference? I argued that the correct account of the morality of abortion should be based upon a defensible account of why killing children and adults is wrong. I claimed that what makes killing us wrong is that our premature deaths deprive us of our futures of value, that is, the goods of life we would have experienced had we survived. This account of the wrongness of killing explains why killing is one of the worst of crimes and how killing greatly harms the victim. It coheres with the attitudes of those with cancer or HIV facing premature death. It explains why we believe it is wrong to kill infants (as personhood theories do not). It does not entail that it wrongs a human being to end her life if she is in persistent vegetative state or if her future must consist only of unbearable physical suffering and she wants to die (as sanctity of human life theories do not). This account of the wrongness of killing implies (with some defensible additional assumptions) that abortion is immoral because we were fetuses once and we know those fetuses had futures of value. Mark Brown claims that this potential future of value account is unsound because it implies that we have welfare rights to what we need to stay alive that most people would reject. I argue that Brown is incorrect in two ways: a welfare right to what we need to stay alive is not directly implied by my account and, in addition, most of us do believe that dependent human beings have substantial welfare rights to what they need to stay alive. Brown argues that depriving us of a future of value of which we have mental representations both is a better explanation of the wrongness of killing and does not imply that abortion is immoral. I reply that (a) if Brown's arguments against my view were sound, those arguments could be easily adapted to show that his view is unsound as well and (b) Brown's view is both ambiguous and unsound on any interpretation. The most popular class of pro-choice argument strategies appeals to the view that some or all fetuses lack either a mental state or function or a capacity for a mental state or function necessary for possession of the right to life. Desires, interests, sentience, various concepts, moral agency, and rationality have all been suggested as candidates for this crucial mental role. Brown's analysis is one member of this class of strategies. I believe that it is possible to show that none of these strategies is reasonable. However, there are so many of these strategies that the required argument demands something more like a book and less like a short essay. The argument of the following essay is a piece of this larger argument.

### Fake news, real war [^7b1f81e8]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

A strategically deployed weapon

Unlike reactive aggression, which is impulsive, emotionally driven, and often a response to perceived threats, proactive aggression is calculated, strategic, and goal-oriented. It is designed to weaken, isolate, or undermine its targets while simultaneously enhancing the status, cohesion, or power of the aggressor group. Disinformation achieves this by eroding trust within and between communities, sowing division, delegitimizing institutions, and amplifying societal fractures. Whether deployed by state actors in geopolitical conflicts, political operatives during elections, or interest groups seeking to manipulate public opinion, disinformation operates as a weapon of psychological and social warfare — engineered not just to misinform, but to destabilize, demoralize, and divide. Applying this framework to misinformation clarifies its function in intergroup conflict. Much like relational aggression at the individual level — where gossip, exclusion, and reputation attacks serve as tools for dominance — disinformation operates as a collective-level weapon aimed at fracturing adversaries.

Disinformation is the intergroup equivalent of malicious gossip, functioning to damage rival coalitions while bolstering one's own. The difference lies in the scale and number of third parties. Unlike gossip among small real-life networks, misinformation makes use of public opinions to reach their target (e.g. rival company, politician or government). This perspective highlights why debunking alone is not optimal: falsehoods are often socially useful to the groups who spread them.

Just as some individuals use gossip to solidify alliances or undermine rivals, groups deploy disinformation for strategic advantage. Thus, interventions focused solely on changing individual minds without addressing the strategic value of disinformation for those who spread it are fundamentally incomplete. In fact, research shows how few individuals share fake news because it generally damages their reputation. Spreaders are thus those who see reputational benefits in it. In terms of application, this means that name-and-shame type of responses could be viable instruments in the toolbox of interventions to deter disinformation behavior.

### Evaluating the efficacy of intervention [^95e0f91d]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The standard for reaching a verdict in civil trials is "the preponderance of the evidence". This is a valid standard to apply to evaluating the medical literature as well. Every published report should be given weight based on physicians' judgment of its reliability. Larger-scale studies should be weighted more heavily than smaller-scale studies, randomized trials more heavily than observation studies, rigorously designed trials more heavily than studies that may be biased. If there seems to be a relationship between a factor and an outcome, this does not necessarily imply that the factor caused the outcome. The association could be a result of chance variation between individuals. Statistical testing allows researchers to exclude chance as a likely cause of the relationship, but this is the only explanation ruled out by a significance test. The relationship could be a result of bias: bias in the selection of individuals for the study, bias in measurement of the factor or the outcome, or bias in differential loss to follow-up. A thorough analysis of the data is necessary to identify and exclude other possible explanations of the association. A government agency dealing with environmental regulations experimented with replacing administrative law judges with scientists. It was believed that scientists were better qualified to make the necessary technical evaluations. The experiment was not considered successful because, as one observer remarked, "Judges are used to having to reach a verdict within a short period of time based on whatever evidence is presented — scientists just can't seem to make decisions". This illustrates a similar difference between the role of the researcher and the role of the physician. The physician must decide the best treatment for each patient based only on whatever evidence is available. There is little question, however, what the patient would decide if allowed to choose between receiving the standard therapy today or waiting 5 years until conclusive scientific evidence has been obtained about whether an alternative treatment is better. Few patients would choose to wait. Yet the decisions a physician makes today will be criticized in 5 years, especially by those who never have had to make similar decisions themselves. Some decisions will turn out to be wrong when additional data are available, but physicians must make choices based on the best data currently available. The choice of medicine as a profession implies the acceptance of a life sentence to jury duty: the evidence will never stop accumulating, and the verdict must be continually reevaluated.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^2271d0a0]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?," "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?," "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?," and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes," with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior."

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not." A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Dispositional free riders do not free ride on punishment [^121f26b5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Second phase — cooperation and punishment behaviour (study 1)

In this phase, participants played the one-shot public goods game in direct-response mode either without or with punishment. In both treatments, each participant first decided, unconditional on the choices of others, how many tokens (out of 20) to contribute to the public good. In the without punishment treatment, beliefs about the group members' average contribution were elicited and incentivised as in the first phase. Participants then learned the individual contribution of each of their group members in order to keep the information structure constant across the two treatments. Participants then proceeded to the emotion elicitation questionnaire described below. In the with punishment treatment, the belief elicitation was not incentivised to avoid punishment due to disappointment caused by lost income from inaccurate beliefs. After learning the individual contribution of each of their group members, participants had the option to assign up to five punishment points to each of their group members. Every punishment point cost the punisher one MU and destroyed two MU of the punished group member's income. To avoid negative payoffs, each participant received a fixed payment of 10 MU. Then, participants stated their belief about how many punishment points they received from each of their group members and reported emotions as described below. Emotions were elicited before receiving feedback on the outcome of the punishment stage.

Emotions elicitation (study 1)

Participants reported their emotional response to each group member's individual contribution level. The questionnaire, adapted from Bosman and van Winden, included thirteen emotions (anger, contempt, envy, fear, guilt, happiness, irritation, jealousy, joy, sadness, shame, surprise and warmth). Participants rated the intensity with which they felt each emotion on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).

### Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis? [^0b9dc402]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Return to real evidence based medicine

To address the above concerns, we believe it is time to launch a campaign for real evidence based medicine (box 2).

Individualised for the patient

Real evidence based medicine has the care of individual patients as its top priority, asking, "what is the best course of action for this patient, in these circumstances, at this point in their illness or condition?"It consciously and reflexively refuses to let process (doing tests, prescribing medicines) dominate outcomes (the agreed goal of management in an individual case). It engages with an ethical and existential agenda (how should we live? when should we accept death?) and with that goal in mind, carefully distinguishes between whether to investigate, treat, or screen and how to do so.

To support such an approach, evidence must be individualised for the patient. This requires that research findings be expressed in ways that most people will understand (such as the number needed to treat, number needed to harm, and number needed to screen) and that practitioners, together with their patients, are free to make appropriate care decisions that may not match what "best (average) evidence" seems to suggest.

Importantly, real shared decision making is not the same as taking the patient through a series of if-then decision options. Rather, it involves finding out what matters to the patient — what is at stake for them — and making judicious use of professional knowledge and status (to what extent, and in what ways, does this person want to be "empowered"?) and introducing research evidence in a way that informs a dialogue about what best to do, how, and why. This is a simple concept but by no means easy to deliver. Tools that contain quantitative estimates of risk and benefit are needed, but they must be designed to support conversations not climb probability trees.

### Neural mechanisms of the mood effects on third-party responses to injustice after unfair experiences [^5648f610]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Although both third‐party punishment and third‐party compensation are the mechanisms of upholding a social norm, these two third‐party responses may be context‐dependent (FeldmanHall et al.). When confronted with an obvious norm violation and given the opportunity to take action either toward the allocator or the receiver, and people typically punish the allocator (Buckholtz et al; FeldmanHall et al.). Moreover, negative emotion is associated with third‐party punishment such as angry participants punished with highly unfair distributions significantly more than those with a neutral emotion (Gummerum et al.). Recent studies have found preferences for third‐party punishment may be limited, perhaps to contexts where it is not a uniformly preferred method for restoring justice, and third‐party compensation of justice restoration is strongly preferred to punitive measures (FeldmanHall et al; Heffner & FeldmanHall). When people are the recipient of an unfair offer and have the option to select from nonpunitive alternatives that satisfy other preferences (e.g. compensation), they prefer to compensate without seeking retribution. Previous evidence has linked more third‐party compensation with individuals in positive moods (Hao et al.). These findings emphasize that, although both third‐party punishment and third‐party compensation are reactions to a social transgression, they may differ in terms of being chosen and depend on the perspective of the deciding agent and mood processing.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^500f6832]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Media and public health law — federal and state powers for communicable disease control state that U.S. federal law permits the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take measures to prevent spread of diseases when state or U.S. possession actions are insufficient, and measures may include inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection. A person who has a communicable disease during the transmissible period can be restricted from traveling from one state or possession to another without a permit from the state or territorial health officer, or destination locality. For interstate conveyances on which a case or suspected case develops, the person in charge is required, as soon as practicable, to notify the local health authority at the next port of call, station, or stop, and to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease as the local health authority directs. State laws authorize quarantine and isolation powers, often granted in the state public health code, and courts have consistently upheld these powers as consistent with state police powers; scope varies, with some states having broad powers applicable to any emerging infectious disease threat and others targeting specific conditions. Constitutional limitations apply, requiring compliance with procedural and substantive due process and that when deprivation of liberty involves a fundamental right the government must demonstrate a compelling interest and that the power is narrowly tailored to achieve a public health goal. Other community containment uses of state police powers, such as social distancing, event cancellation, and related strategies, also may raise constitutional concerns but are less restrictive on liberties and therefore less likely to face strict scrutiny by a court.

### Differences in misinformation sharing can lead to politically asymmetric sanctions [^c43183f2]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

First, accusations of political bias are based largely on anecdotes or salient unique cases, such as the suspension of former President Donald Trump. Our data allow us to evaluate these claims more systematically. Indeed, we find that accounts that had shared #Trump2020 during the election were 4.4 times more likely to have been subsequently suspended than those that shared #VoteBidenHarris2020 (χ 2 (1) = 486.9, P < 0.0001). Specifically, whereas only 4.5% of the users who shared Biden hashtags had been suspended as of July 2021, 19.6% of the users who shared Trump hashtags had been suspended.

Critically, however, this association does not necessarily indicate a causal effect of a user's politics on suspension — because of the potential for political orientation to be confounded with the tendency to share misinformation (or to engage in other sanctioned behaviours). Indeed, previous work has found consistent evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing: links to websites that journalists and fact-checkers deemed to be low-quality 'fake news' sites were shared much more by conservatives than liberals on Facebook during the 2016 electionand the 2020 election, and on Twitter during the 2016 electionand during Donald Trump's first impeachment; conservatives on Twitter were much more likely to follow elites that made claims fact-checkers rated as false compared with Democrats; Republican-oriented images on Facebook were much more likely to be rated as misleading than Democratic-oriented images; and survey experiments that present participants with politically balanced sets of headlines (removing the supply-side confound present in many observational studies) typically find that conservatives indicate higher sharing intentions for articles deemed to be false by professional fact-checkers than liberals. Furthermore, this association is not limited to the USA. For example, a survey experiment conducted in 16 countries found widespread cross-cultural evidence of conservatives sharing more unambiguously false claims about COVID-19 than liberals; and an examination of Twitter data found that conservative political elites shared links to lower-quality news sites than liberal political elites in the USA, Germany and the UK. These observed differences in behaviour have clear implications for differences in treatment by social media platforms.

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^ebb760ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.
